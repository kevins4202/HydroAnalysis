19930,nitrous oxide n2o dominates greenhouse gas emissions in wastewater treatment plants wwtps formation of n2o occurs during biological nitrogen removal involves multiple microbial pathways and is typically very dynamic consequently n2o mitigation strategies require an improved understanding of nitrogen transformation pathways and their modulating controls analyses of the nitrogen n and oxygen o isotopic composition of n2o and its substrates at natural abundance have been shown to provide valuable information on formation and reduction pathways in laboratory settings but have rarely been applied to full scale wwtps here we show that n species isotope ratio measurements at natural abundance level combined with long term n2o monitoring allow identification of the n2o production pathways in a full scale plug flow wwtp hofen switzerland heterotrophic denitrification appears as the main n2o production pathway under all tested process conditions 0 2 mgo2 l high and low loading conditions while nitrifier denitrification was less important and more variable n2o production by hydroxylamine oxidation was not observed fractional n2o elimination by reduction to dinitrogen n2 during anoxic conditions was clearly indicated by a concomitant increase in site preference δ18o n2o and δ15n n2o n2o reduction increased with decreasing availability of dissolved inorganic n and organic substrates which represents the link between diurnal n2o emission dynamics and organic substrate fluctuations consequently dosing ammonium rich reject water under low organic substrate conditions is unfavorable as it is very likely to cause high net n2o emissions our results demonstrate that monitoring of the n2o isotopic composition holds a high potential to disentangle n2o formation mechanisms in engineered systems such as full scale wwtp our study serves as a starting point for advanced campaigns in the future combining isotopic technologies in wwtp with complementary approaches such as mathematical modeling of n2o formation or microbial assays to develop efficient n2o mitigation strategies graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords nitrification denitrification stable

2013 ravishankara et al 2009 wastewater treatment plants are potent point sources and significant contributors to global anthropogenic n2o emissions tian et al 2018 vasilaki et al 2019 n2o emissions from wwtp exhibit strong temporal dynamics gruber et al 2020 the underlying drivers of these dynamics however remain partially unclear and are likely linked to the complexity of the different nitrogen cycle reactions involved in n2o production in wastewater treatment systems domingo félez and smets 2020 schreiber et al 2012 three main metabolic pathways performed by two different groups of bacteria have been identified in wwtps i hydroxylamine nh2oh oxidation ni and ii nitrifier denitrification nd by ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob as well as iii heterotrophic denitrification hd by heterotrophic denitrifying bacteria het ren et al 2019 wunderlin et al 2012 multiple other microbial and abiotic n2o production pathways have been described in literature for specific ecosystems butterbach bahl et al 2013 but are not discussed here to focus on the most relevant processes however given a sufficient supply of organic carbon het are also able to reduce n2o to n2 the target product of n elimination in wwtp conthe et al 2018 pan et al 2013 the systematic and efficient mitigation of n2o emissions in wwtps is a challenging task and requires both long term monitoring of emissions to identify emission peaks as well as a mechanistic understanding of n2o formation mechanisms in the wastewater treatment process vasilaki et al 2019 a number of approaches have been applied successfully in full scale wwtps to reduce n2o emissions such as the control of the dissolved oxygen do through different aeration rates and timing rodriguez caballero et al 2015 sun et al 2017 or different feeding regimes e g step intermittent feeding maintaining low in situ ammonium concentrations hu et al 2013 however given the intricacy of n2o production and turnover methods to quantify and to mechanistically understand the pathways involved are essential to explain emission dynamics and develop robust mitigation strategies duan et al 2021 differences in stable isotopic substitution of the n2o molecule and the bulk isotopic composition of reactive nitrogen substrates ammonium nh4 nitrite no2 and nitrate no3 provide valuable information on n2o transformation processes since distinct microbial and or abiotic pathways exhibit characteristic isotopic signatures sutka et al 2006 yoshida and toyoda 2000 quantifying the four most abundant n2o isotopocules 14n14n16o 14n15n16o 15n at

well as the 15n site preference sp the n and o isotopic compositions of n2o are controlled by 1 the composition of the substrate 2 kinetic isotope effects that occur during n2o formation and 3 kinetic isotope effects associated with n2o reduction to n2 denk et al 2017 toyoda et al 2017 yu et al 2020 in addition the o isotope ratio in the n2o pool is influenced by o atom exchange reactions between water and n intermediate molecules especially no2 casciotti et al 2002 lewicka szczebak et al 2016 sp is independent of the substrate isotopic composition and therefore an especially sensitive tool for distinguishing mechanisms of n2o production and consumption a powerful way to use the isotopic composition of n2o to constrain its formation and processing is the dual isotope mapping approach where sp values are plotted against either δδ15nbulk n2o substrate or δδ18o n2o h2o and compared to the isotope signatures known for a given process yu et al 2020 despite the potential that natural abundance n2o isotope measurements offer for pathway characterization past applications have been almost exclusively limited to laboratory scale reactors wunderlin et al 2013 tumendelger et al 2016 in this study we tested for the first time whether natural abundance stable isotope measurements in a full scale wwtp can be applied to characterize n2o production pathways under changing inflow composition and process operation in particular we evaluated the influence of organic substrate availability and aeration strategies on the n2o formation pathways to further support the estimated contributions of different production pathways and n2o reduction we used measurements of the 15n 14n and 18o 16o isotope ratios of n substrates nh4 no3 and no2 additionally we performed both spatially and temporally resolved process monitoring of n2o emissions and aqueous nitrogen species to interpret the process dynamics during the experiments finally we propose reduction strategies based on the observed emission patterns and attributed pathways 2 materials methods 2 1 field site the hofen wwtp switzerland 47 27 57 3 n 9 23 49 1 e treats the wastewater of roughly 70 000 population equivalents after mechanical treatment by screening grit chambers and primary clarification the wastewater enters the biological treatment stage consisting of six activated sludge plug flow reactors each comprising three cascaded stirred reactors 3 530 m3 fig 1 while organic compounds and n are removed biologically phosphorus is removed through chemical precipitation using iron iii this biological treatment scheme represents a standard activated sludge configuration tchobanoglous et al 2014 the average cod and nitrogen load of the treatment plant are 9700 kgcod d and 860 kgn d with average

rich reject water to the biological treatment increasing the ammonium load in the inflow reject water is dosed into the primary clarifier to make sure that the n load is equally distributed among the lanes typically reject water from sludge treatment is added overnight from 11 pm to 7 am in batches every 30 min 2 2 continuous n2o monitoring continuous n2o emission monitoring was done using the flux chamber approach as described in gruber et al 2020 a part of the monitoring results november 2019 december 2020 has already been presented by gruber et al 2021 flux chambers were installed in zone 1 2 and 3 according to fig 1 additionally 1 5 meter long columns called anox tubes fig s 1 were installed in zone 1 of selected lanes 1 1 2 1 2 2 3 2 to sample n2o from the mixed liquor during non aerated operation by gas stripping with a blower this technique provides qualitative information on temporal fluctuations of dissolved n2o concentrations for zone 1 n2o concentrations from the anox tubes are not quantitative since the efficiency of the stripping process can only be roughly quantified fig s 2 however anox tubes provide a temporal trend of dissolved n2o concentrations relevant for interpretation of n2o production consumption processes a small share of the off gas from the chambers and anox tubes was diverted to a central n2o measuring unit consisting of an automated valve system preceding a dehumidifier and a non dispersive infra red sensor x stream emerson st louis mo usa the n2o monitoring system was installed in october 2019 and since then is running continuously 2 3 campaigns with isotope measurements in 2019 2020 and 2021 three intensive sampling campaigns supported by n2o isotopic measurements were performed on two selected lanes 2 1 and 2 2 table 1 campaigns were conducted on days with rather dry weather conditions on the day of sampling since rain weather reduces emissions substantially gruber et al 2020 gaseous and aqueous samples of specific zones were collected for isotopic analyses and concentrations measurements during the experiments details on the experiments are given in table 1 2 4 collection of gaseous and aqueous samples

conversion a sample volume equivalent to 40 or 10 nmol of no2 depending on the concentration in the sample was added to 3 ml of nitrite free seawater in a 20 ml headspace vial and crimp sealed the seawater is used to maximize n2o yield and minimize oxygen exchange during the reaction granger et al 2020 then 300 µl of acetic acid sodium azide solution 1 1 mixture of 2 m nan3 with 20 acetic acid were injected in the vial and the mixture was shaken the reaction was stopped using 200 µl 10 m naoh after at least 30 min the pre processing was conducted on the sampling day and the samples were

n2o via no2 zhang et al 2007 briefly a sample volume equivalent to 40 nmol of nh4 was converted to no2 by reaction with 0 5 ml of a 50 µm alkaline hypobromite in a 20 ml headspace vial then this no2 sample was converted to n2o by reaction with sodium azide and the n2o was analysed as described in the preceding section in addition to the nitrite standards n 7373 and n 10 219 international ammonium

respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 n2o emissions at the hofen wwtp the average n2o emissions of lane 2 1 and 2 2 at the hofen wwtp were 0 8 kg n2o n d during the monitoring campaign table 2 the resulting emission factor 0 2 of the total nitrogen load is low compared to other wwtps with full year nitrification and denitrification median of 0 4 gruber et al 2021 emissions from both lanes displayed similar temporal patterns with high emissions in winter and lower emissions during the summer season fig 2 however the emission pattern is not reproducible in different years by far the highest n2o emissions were observed over several weeks starting in january 2021 the emission peak occurred in parallel with increased no2 concentrations in the effluent of the wwtp which is known to enhance n2o emissions via both nd and hd pathways and has been linked to emission peak phases in other wwtps gruber et al 2021 b ren et al 2019 kuokkanen et al 2021 in fact all lanes were fully aerated during the peak emission phase to increase no2 oxidation capacities of the biological treatment which in turn favours n2o stripping and strongly lowers no2 as well as n2o reduction capacities during denitrification consequently during full aeration of zone 1 emissions in all zones of both lanes increase however the major share of the emissions occurs in zone 2 fig 2 where likely most of the nitrogen turnover happens in case of full aeration of a lane the detrimental effect of aeration of zone 1 in terms of n2o production compared to anoxic operation was also shown in campaigns 1 and 3 where the first zone of lane 2 1 or 2 2 were aerated table 2 similarly in april 2020 only zone 1 of lane 2 1 was aerated which led to substantially higher net n2o emissions as compared to lane 2 2 figs 2 and 5 3 2 identification of n2o production pathways using dual isotope mapping approaches the isotope sampling campaigns at the hofen wwtp were conducted during different seasons and day times and under either oxic or anoxic operation of zone 1 tables 1 and 2 the mean sp value for n2o emitted from oxygen replete zones in all three experiment was 1 7 2 7 which is somewhat lower than results 4 5 from a previous full scale wwtp study toyoda et al 2011 and literaure results for n2o from ni which yields consistently higher sp values 32 0 to 38 7 however values are fully in the range of isotopic signatures measured for nd and hd at a lab scale wwtp wunderlin et al 2013 as well as in pure culture studies hd 7 5 to 3 7 nd 13 6 to 1 9 summarized in denk et al 2017 ostrom and ostrom 2017 yu et al 2020 in contrast n2o liberated from zone 1 under anoxic operation using the anox tube displayed significantly higher sp values of 12 3 2 2 to evaluate the n2o production pathways during the experiments in more detail we applied the dual isotope mapping approach where sp values are plotted against either δδ15nbulk n2o substrate or δδ18o n2o h2o and compared to the isotope signatures known from literature for a given process yu et al 2020 in this approach the δ15nbulk n2o values are corrected for δ15n of possible n substrates nh4 no2 no3 with δδ15nbulk n2o substrate δ15nbulk n2o δ15nsubstrate while δ18o n2o is compared to δ18o h2o with δδ18o n2o h2o δ18o n2o δ18o h2o fig 3 wunderlin et al 2013 followed this approach relating sp to δδ15nbulk n2o values to verify process conditions that are most conducive to distinct production pathways e g hd nd ni during batch experiments in a laboratory scale reactor with activated sludge since no elevated sp was observed in the aerated zones no significant contribution of ni to n2o production was anticipated moreover δδ15n n2o nh4 values which considers ammonium as a possible substrate did not co vary with the sp values towards ni source endmember signatures fig s 3 alternatively lewicka szczebak et al 2016 showed that a dual isotope mapping approach with sp versus δδ18o n2o h2o is especially suitable to elucidate mixing of n2o produced by hd or ni and partial n2o reduction by denitrification n2o produced by ni typically bears oxygen isotope values of δ18o n2o 25 inherited from atmospheric o2 frame and casciotti 2010 for n₂o produced from hd or nd the parameter δδ18o n2o h2o offers additional insights over δ18o alone as discussed below the sp values of n2o emitted under aerated conditions indicate nd or hd as main n2o production pathway the relationship of sp with δδ18o n₂o h2o fig 3a displays a considerable decrease in both sp and δδ18o n₂o h2o during the change from anoxic zone 1 to oxic zone 2 conditions this corresponds to a decline in partial n2o reduction for zone 2 in relation to zone 1 as reduction of n2o to n2 by hd increases sp of the residual n2o pool since the 15n o bond is more stable than 14n o summarized in denk et al 2017 ostrom and ostrom 2017 yu et al 2020 additional support for the concurrent reduction of nitrite and n2o through hd comes from the concomitant increase in δ18o no2 and δ15n n2o shown in fig 3b interpreting the δδ18o n₂o h2o signatures of n2o emitted in the aerobic zone i e in parallel with low sp values requires a more nuanced interpretation but yields additional information the δδ18o n₂o h2o value is controlled by both equilibrium isotope effects during o exchange of precursors with water and branching isotope effects during o abstraction casciotti et al 2007 casciotti et al 2010 kool et al 2007 both effects depend strongly on the bacterial community that performs denitrification and can differ substantially among systems kool et al 2007 martin and casciotti 2016 the observed δ18o no2 is consistent with complete exchange between no2 and water for samples in the aerated zone the measured δ18o h2o plus the equilibrium fractionation of 13 at 15 to 20 c yields a composition of 3 buchwald and casciotti 2013 fig 3b complete exchange can be associated with nitrite produced in nitrification buchwald et al 2012 casciotti et al 2010 but can also be mediated by the iron containing nitrite reductase nirs which is present in many heterotrophic denitrifiers casciotti et al 2007 casciotti et al 2002 kool et al 2007 then the final δδ18o n₂o h2o of n2o is determined by the branching kinetic isotope effects associated with nitrite reduction to no followed by no reduction to n2o casciotti et al 2007 casciotti et al 2002 martin and casciotti 2016 rohe et al 2017 the conversion of no2 to n2o by the nitrite reductase and nitric oxide reductase enzymes then imparts a branching kinetic isotope effect casciotti et al 2007 casciotti et al 2002 the identity of the nitrite reductase enzyme nirk nirs controls the size of this branching isotope effect and thus δ18o n2o h2o n2o production from nitrite that has an equilibrium value of δ18o no2 h2o by bacteria with nirs is associated with a larger oxygen isotope effect and so that n2o will display values for δδ18o n2o h2o of 28 6 while bacteria with the copper containing nirk will display a slightly lower δδ18o n2o h2o of 24 6 martin and casciotti 2016 various hd species are known to have either nirk or nirs but only nirk has been found in nd kozlowski et al 2016 nikaido 2003 zumft 1997 wei et al 2015 therefore n2o associated with nd and hd exhibits overlapping ranges for δδ18o n2o h2o but values greater 30 are likely to be associated with hd the only pure culture constraint on δδ18o n2o h2o for n2o generated by nd with a value of 22 frame and casciotti 2010 falls at the low end of the above mentioned range and thus consistent with the expectation from the enzyme based framework provided δδ18o n₂o h2o values for n2o emitted from the aerated zones of wwtp hofen fall into the range expected for bacteria featuring nitrite reduction using the nirs enzyme 30 to 34 fig 3 and thus a major contribution of hd this result is also consistent with the observation of orschler et al 2021 that although hd can theoretically involve both nirk or nirs in activated sludge systems it is predominantly performed via nirs δδ18o n₂o h2o values from the aerated zones are about 10 higher than those reported by lewicka szczebak et al 2016 of 16 7 to 23 3 the observed discrepancy may be explained by the fact that the underlying values reported by lewicka szczebak et al 2016 were derived from soil systems that likely differ significantly in terms of the active microbial communities and expressed enzymes as compared to wastewater systems wu et al 2019 the prevalence of anaerobic hd under oxic conditions can easily be rationalized by anoxic microsites in sludge flocs even in aerated zones sexstone et al 1985 daigger et al 2007 nevertheless given the variability seen in δδ18o n₂o h2o we cannot exclude a variable contribution from nd under certain conditions which could be what drives difference between aerobic samples in fig 3a slightly lower sp and lower δδ18o n₂o h2o values may be due to an increased contribution of nd alternatively the higher values may also be caused by a partial reduction of n2o also during aerobic phases assuming that the organic substrate is not fully consumed in zone 1 and leaks into zone 2 furthermore n2o with a high sp and δδ18o n₂o h2o might be transported and mixed in from zone 1 as discussed in section 3 3 in more detail plotting sp values relative to δδ15n n2o no3 indicates a higher variability among the three intensive sampling campaigns fig 3d co variations in sp and δδ15n n2o no3 values between n2o from aerated and anoxic zones during individual campaigns were driven by the partial n2o reduction indicated by the reduction line differences in δδ15n n2o no3 between experiments e g 31 6 campaigns 1 and 2 versus 41 1 campaign 3 were possibly caused by concentration dependent variations affecting cell specific rates in the isotope effects associated with denitrification kritee et al 2012 more precisely the higher no3 concentrations during experiment 3 10 18 mg no3 n l compared to experiment 1 and 2 0 7 mg no3 n l may manifest in substantially higher isotope effects the increased nitrate concentrations were due to the full aeration of all zones over multiple weeks before experiment 3 the operation led to reduced denitrification activity and no3 accumulation in the biological treatment interestingly δδ15n n2o no2 was more consistent than δδ15n n2o no3 between campaigns i e isotope effects seemed less strongly affected by n substrate concentrations fig 3c therefore isotopic signatures for samples from aerated and anoxic compartments cluster significantly closer to the predicted reduction line fig 3c the observed correlation of delta values for individual campaigns hence supports the notion that the isotopic composition of no3 no2 and n2o are mostly controlled by the sequential reduction of no3 to n2 during complete denitrification in summary the isotopic composition of n2o no2 and no3 consistently point towards a high contribution of hd to n2o production during aeration on all days nd may be of variable relevance yet ni can be excluded as a significant contributor hd was previously shown to govern n2o production during aeration under low c n conditions domingo felez et al 2016 our data confirm that obligate anaerobic processes such as hd play an important role even during aerated reactor conditions supported by strong oxygen gradients and anoxic microniches in sludge flocs daigger et al 2007 for zones under anoxic process conditions observed isotope patterns provide clear evidence for substantial n2o reduction to diagnose the contribution of different production pathways the relation of sp and δδ18o n₂o h2o turned out to be more sensitive than the δδ15n n2o substrate approaches however combining both approaches as shown here has the benefit of being able to additionally validate interpretations and to provide independent process information to assess the full complexity of concurrent n2o formation and reduction 3 3 diurnal variation in n2o emissions and production pathways the main focus of the third campaign was to investigate the effect of the diurnal patterns in n loading controlled by reject water dosage and cod substrate inflow on n2o emissions and variations in n2o reduction for this we analysed the isotopic signatures of n2o and nitrogenous substrates in zone 1 and 2 for five different time points during one day at lane 2 1 fig 4 n2o emissions exhibited a clear diurnal pattern with a peak at 9 am right before the reject water dosage was stopped fig 4a n2o concentration changes in the anoxic zone measured with the anox tube were consistent with changes in the n2o flux from zone 2 and 3 while nh4 concentrations also exhibited a clear diurnal variation pattern no3 concentrations were relatively stable throughout the study period fig 4c figs s 4 and s 5 si no2 was highest in zone 1 and gradually decreased in zone 2 and 3 respectively fig s 6 si the diurnal trend of the n2o site preference in zone 1 indicates a decreasing importance of n2o reduction from 7 am to 9 am sampling points 1 and 2 also shown in the dual isotope mapping approach e g for sp vs δδ18o n₂o h2o fig 3a after 10 am sp and δδ18o n₂o h2o values for n2o from zone 1 increased along the predicted reduction line which suggests a return to an increasing relevance of n2o reduction for samples 3 to 5 no3 concentrations remain stable in zone 1 fig 4c despite an increase of no3 inflow from the return sludge fig s 5 si confirming that heterotrophic nitrate reduction hd was very active after 9 am we suggest two main causes for the strong daily variation in n2o emissions and n removal first the dosage of reject water and the morning peak in n inflow typically seen in wwtps led to a nh4 concentration increase fig 4c t1 t2 while the n2o reduction capacity of the wwtp was lower due to the increased supply of no3 second and more importantly the availability of organic substrate typically exhibits daily fluctuations therefore despite high nh4 loads from 10 am to 2 pm t3 t4 high availability of organic substrate led to increasing nitrogen removal and in turn increased fractional n2o reduction rates notably cod concentrations were not measured during the campaign but are expected to correlate with the inflow rate to the wastewater treatment plant which exhibits reproducible daily variation fig s 7 si the n2o sp in zone 2 is at its maximum between 6 and 9 am probably due to transport of n2o produced in zone 1 where both n2o production and reduction were high during this part of the diurnal cycle as described above fig 4b this would imply that n2o emissions from zone 2 before and during the peak phase i e the end of the reject water dosage comprise a substantial contribution of n2o from zone 1 hd as the main source of this n2o is supported by the high δδ18o n2o h2o values 36 2 2 3 alternatively high sp values in zone 2 before 9 am can be explained by partial n2o reduction but this is unlikely given cod limitation during reject water dosage moreover transport of n2o produced in an anoxic zone to an aerobic zone has been reported earlier for other wwtps mampaey et al 2016 after 10 am the difference in sp values between zone 1 and 2 was increasing again indicating that n2o transport and mixing was less important in addition the contribution of nd to n2o formation might have increased after 10 am in zone 2 which could further explain the lower sp and δδ18o n₂o h2o here nevertheless we believe that hd also contributed a major part to the emissions in the aerobic zones between 11 am and 4 pm given the still high δδ18o n2o h2o values 3 4 n2o emissions depend on process operation the seasonal dynamics in n2o emissions indicate that phases when the air consumption in zone 3 exceeded a defined threshold and thus when zone 1 was aerated were generally characterized by high net n2o production fig 2 to better understand the effect of aerobic conditions in the first zone on overall n2o formation we compared the isotopic signatures of n2o produced along a fully aerated lane 2 1 and a lane under standard operation i e with anoxic conditions in the zone 1 2 2 table 1 the episodes of reject water dosage in the morning had a high impact on the emissions i e high n2o emissions in campaign 3 but n2o emissions were even higher from the fully aerated lane table 2 the difference between lanes was primarily driven by emissions in zones 1 and 2 while emissions in the third zone were comparable fig 5 a the explanation for increased n2o emissions from the fully aerated lane 2 1 can be assessed when comparing isotopic signatures of the n2o released from zone 1 of both lanes fig 5b campaign 1 the n2o isotopic signature measured in the zone 1 of lane 2 2 with conventional operation i e zone 1 mostly anoxic indicates a substantial reduction of n2o in contrast for lane 2 1 with zone 1 aerated the share of n2o reduction was substantially lower the proportion of n2o reduction can be estimated quantitatively by the expression δsp εsp x ln f jinuntuya nortman et al 2008 lewicka szczebak et al 2017 mariotti et al 1981 with ε being the enrichment factor 8 2 to 2 9 yu et al 2020 and f the fraction of unreacted n2o the isotopic enrichment factor between product p and substrate s is defined as εxp s αxp s 1 δxp δxs 1 where α is the isotopic fractionation factor applying this approach yields an estimate of 92 of n2o 84 to 99 using max and min fractionation factors reduced for the anoxic zone 1 of lane 2 2 while only 68 56 to 90 using max and min fractionation factors is reduced in the aerated zone 1 of lane 2 1 assuming that the sp values for n2o from zone 2 are representative for the n2o production process as during campaign 3 n2o production was very likely driven by hd given the increased δδ18o n2o h2o values 35 2 0 6 in the aerobic zones campaigns 1 and 3 revealed that organic carbon availability aeration of zone 1 and reject water n dosage are the most important modulators of n2o emissions during standard operation at the hofen wwtp and at a given time of the year notably emissions were lowest in campaign 2 table 2 with anoxic conditions in zone 1 of both lanes without reject water dosage and sampling times in the afternoon where increased organic substrate concentrations are expected while it seems relatively clear that aerobic conditions in zone 1 and low organic substrate availability both lead to higher emissions by impairing a more efficient n2o reduction the mechanism behind the increased production of n2o caused by elevated reject water dosage which leads to an increase in nh4 concentrations is not fully understood gruber et al 2020 most plausibly elevated n2o emissions are directly linked to the high nh4 concentrations following substrate vs intermediate product systematics alternatively it is possible that the composition of the reject water is somehow unfavorable for heterotrophic denitrifiers and nitrifiers further research is needed to unravel underlying mechanisms e g by comparing the effects of dosages of reject water nh4 versus nh4 2so4 solution in activated sludge nevertheless our results already yield important information regarding efficient strategies to reduce n2o emissions during normal operation at the hofen wwtp the guiding principle for the mitigation of n2o emissions is to maximize n2o reduction by avoiding aeration of zone 1 and dosing reject water primarily during periods with high organic carbon load e g in the afternoon the adaptation of the feeding strategy to optimize organic carbon utilization towards most efficient n2o reduction has been successfully applied in side stream treatment peng et al 2017 however changing reject water dosage operation strategies should be critically evaluated as the effects of the nh4 loading are multifaceted that is besides potential impacts of the nh4 dosage on net n2o emissions other constraints need to be considered for example increased nh4 peak concentrations can lead to nh4 breakthrough and load equilibration in the diurnal pattern is beneficial for the nitrification performance meyer and wilderer 2004 we propose to apply conventional activated sludge modeling and full scale testing combined with extensive process monitoring to optimize reject water dosage in terms of effluent quality and maximized reduction capacities for n2o mitigation henze et al 2000 isotopic technologies were successfully applied to analyze the contribution of n2o production pathways at the hofen wwtp and provided mechanistic understanding to support mitigation strategies still long term monitoring of the isotopic composition of n2o and other nitrogen species is needed in future studies to evaluate the consistency and robustness of the approach a major advantage to characterize contributions of n2o reduction and production pathways at the hofen wwtp involved the cascaded lanes with clearly defined redox conditions in each zone we expect that the application in flow through non compartmented activated sludge systems can be more challenging due to increased mixing over a whole lane leading to a higher exchange of the nitrogen pools furthermore continuous long term monitoring is important for the extrapolation and interpretation of the data and the characterization of the seasonal emission peaks the lion s share of the total annual n2o emissions can be attributed to the january peak emission period fig 2 50 of the total emissions in association with elevated no2 concentration levels seasonally impaired no2 oxidation in wwtps leading to no2 accumulation has been linked to low abundances of nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob and drastic changes in the whole activated sludge microbial community gruber et al 2021 however the nob loss observed by gruber et al 2021 at the uster wwtp led to no2 accumulation over a periods of 1 2 months and it is unclear whether similar process were also responsible for the accumulation of nitrite over a few weeks at the hofen wwtp 4 summary and conclusions measurements of relative 15n and 18o abundances in nitrogen bearing molecules were successfully applied to characterize dynamics of n2o formation pathways under normal operation in a full scale activated sludge wwtp n2o was mainly produced by heterotrophic denitrification while nitrifier denitrification appeared to be less important and of rather variable influence nh2oh oxidation was negligible seasonal emission peaks occurred during winter when no2 accumulates and when the biological treatment is operated at full aeration but nob activity is still impaired based on n2o isotopic measurements n2o reduction was identified under anoxic conditions and to lesser extent also under oxic conditions when it is restricted to anoxic micro niches fractional n2o reduction was most pronounced under organic substrate replete conditions while n2o accumulation in the anoxic zone was primarily observed when organic substrate was limiting hence the daily variation of organic substrate has a strong impact on the reduction of n2o and in turn diurnal n2o emission fluctuations the dosage of reject water and full aeration of the biological treatment significantly increased n2o emissions since n2o reduction was strongly impeded hence an efficient mitigation strategy towards optimized n2o reduction may involve shifting reject water dosage to periods with high organic substrate availability as well as avoiding full aeration of the biological treatment coupling isotopic technologies with continuous long term monitoring of n2o emissions is a powerful tool for qualitative n2o pathway identification and the development of n2o

19930,nitrous oxide n2o dominates greenhouse gas emissions in wastewater treatment plants wwtps formation of n2o occurs during biological nitrogen removal involves multiple microbial pathways and is typically very dynamic consequently n2o mitigation strategies require an improved understanding of nitrogen transformation pathways and their modulating controls analyses of the nitrogen n and oxygen o isotopic composition of n2o and its substrates at natural abundance have been shown to provide valuable information on formation and reduction pathways in laboratory settings but have rarely been applied to full scale wwtps here we show that n species isotope ratio measurements at natural abundance level combined with long term n2o monitoring allow identification of the n2o production pathways in a full scale plug flow wwtp hofen switzerland heterotrophic denitrification appears as the main n2o production pathway under all tested process conditions 0 2 mgo2 l high and low loading conditions while nitrifier denitrification was less important and more variable n2o production by hydroxylamine oxidation was not observed fractional n2o elimination by reduction to dinitrogen n2 during anoxic conditions was clearly indicated by a concomitant increase in site preference δ18o n2o and δ15n n2o n2o reduction increased with decreasing availability of dissolved inorganic n and organic substrates which represents the link between diurnal n2o emission dynamics and organic substrate fluctuations consequently dosing ammonium rich reject water under low organic substrate conditions is unfavorable as it is very likely to cause high net n2o emissions our results demonstrate that monitoring of the n2o isotopic composition holds a high potential to disentangle n2o formation mechanisms in engineered systems such as full scale wwtp our study serves as a starting point for advanced campaigns in the future combining isotopic technologies in wwtp with complementary approaches such as

from wwtp exhibit strong temporal dynamics gruber et al 2020 the underlying drivers of these dynamics however remain partially unclear and are likely linked to the complexity of the different nitrogen

in wwtp conthe et al 2018 pan et al 2013 the systematic and efficient mitigation of n2o emissions in wwtps is a challenging task and requires both long term monitoring of emissions to identify emission peaks as well as a mechanistic understanding of n2o formation mechanisms in the wastewater treatment process vasilaki et al 2019 a number of approaches have been applied successfully in full

mechanistically understand the pathways involved are essential to explain emission dynamics and develop robust mitigation strategies duan et al 2021 differences in stable isotopic substitution of the n2o molecule and the bulk isotopic composition of reactive nitrogen substrates ammonium nh4 nitrite no2 and nitrate no3 provide valuable information on n2o transformation processes since distinct

isotope effects associated with n2o reduction to n2 denk et al 2017 toyoda et al 2017 yu et al 2020 in addition the o isotope ratio in the n2o pool is influenced by o atom exchange reactions between water and n intermediate molecules especially no2 casciotti et al 2002 lewicka szczebak et al 2016 sp is independent of the substrate isotopic composition and therefore an especially sensitive tool for distinguishing mechanisms of n2o production and consumption a powerful way to use the isotopic composition of n2o to constrain its formation and processing is the dual isotope mapping approach where sp values are plotted against either δδ15nbulk n2o substrate or δδ18o n2o h2o and compared to the isotope signatures known for a given process yu et al 2020 despite the potential that natural abundance n2o isotope measurements offer for pathway characterization past applications have been almost exclusively limited to laboratory scale reactors wunderlin et al 2013 tumendelger et al 2016 in this study we tested for the first time whether natural abundance stable isotope measurements in a full scale wwtp can be applied to characterize n2o production pathways under changing inflow composition and process operation in particular we evaluated the influence of organic substrate availability and aeration strategies on the n2o formation pathways to further support the estimated contributions of different production pathways and n2o reduction we used measurements of the 15n 14n and 18o 16o isotope ratios of n substrates nh4 no3 and no2 additionally we performed both spatially and temporally resolved process monitoring of n2o emissions and aqueous nitrogen species to interpret the process dynamics during the experiments finally we propose reduction strategies based on the

flux chamber approach as described in gruber et al 2020 a part of the monitoring results november 2019 december 2020 has already been presented by gruber et al 2021 flux chambers were installed in zone 1 2 and 3 according to fig 1 additionally 1 5 meter long columns called anox tubes fig s 1 were installed in zone 1 of selected lanes 1 1 2 1 2 2 3 2 to sample n2o from the mixed liquor during non aerated operation by gas stripping with a blower this technique provides qualitative information on temporal fluctuations of dissolved n2o concentrations for zone 1 n2o concentrations from the anox tubes are not quantitative since the efficiency of the stripping process can only be roughly quantified fig s 2 however anox tubes provide a temporal trend of dissolved n2o concentrations relevant for interpretation of n2o production consumption processes a small share of the off gas from the chambers and anox tubes was diverted to a central n2o measuring unit consisting of an

respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 n2o emissions at the hofen wwtp the average n2o emissions of lane 2 1 and 2 2 at the hofen wwtp were 0 8 kg n2o n d during the monitoring campaign table 2 the resulting emission factor 0 2 of the total nitrogen load is low compared to other wwtps with full year nitrification and denitrification median of 0 4 gruber et al 2021 emissions from both lanes displayed similar temporal patterns with high emissions in winter and lower emissions during the summer season fig 2 however the emission pattern is not reproducible in different years by far the highest n2o emissions were observed over several weeks starting in january 2021 the emission peak occurred in parallel with increased no2 concentrations in the effluent of the wwtp which is known to enhance n2o emissions via both nd and hd pathways and has been linked to emission peak phases in other wwtps gruber et al 2021 b ren et al 2019 kuokkanen et al 2021 in fact all lanes were fully aerated during the peak emission phase to increase no2 oxidation capacities of the biological treatment which in turn favours n2o stripping and strongly lowers no2 as well as n2o reduction capacities during denitrification consequently during full aeration of zone 1 emissions in all zones of both lanes increase however the major share of the emissions occurs in zone 2 fig 2 where likely most of the nitrogen turnover happens in case of full aeration of a lane the detrimental effect of aeration of zone 1 in terms of n2o production compared to anoxic operation was also shown in campaigns 1 and 3 where the first zone of lane 2 1 or 2 2 were aerated table 2 similarly in april 2020 only zone 1 of lane 2 1 was aerated which led to substantially higher net n2o emissions as compared to lane 2 2 figs 2 and 5 3 2 identification of n2o production pathways using dual isotope mapping approaches the isotope sampling campaigns at the hofen wwtp were conducted during different seasons and day times and under either oxic or anoxic operation of zone 1 tables 1 and 2 the mean sp value for n2o emitted from oxygen replete zones in all three experiment was 1 7 2 7 which is somewhat lower than results 4 5 from a previous full scale wwtp study toyoda et al 2011 and literaure results for n2o from ni which yields consistently higher sp values 32 0 to 38 7 however values are fully in the range of isotopic signatures measured for nd and hd at a lab scale wwtp wunderlin et al 2013 as well as in pure culture studies hd 7 5 to 3 7 nd 13 6 to 1 9 summarized in denk et al 2017 ostrom and ostrom 2017 yu et al 2020 in contrast n2o liberated from zone 1 under anoxic operation using the anox tube displayed significantly higher sp values of 12 3 2 2 to evaluate the n2o production pathways during the experiments in more detail we applied the dual isotope mapping approach where sp values are plotted against either δδ15nbulk n2o substrate or δδ18o n2o h2o and compared to the isotope signatures known from literature for a given process yu et al 2020 in this approach the δ15nbulk n2o values are corrected for δ15n of possible n substrates nh4 no2 no3 with δδ15nbulk n2o substrate δ15nbulk n2o δ15nsubstrate while δ18o n2o is compared to δ18o h2o with δδ18o n2o h2o δ18o n2o δ18o h2o fig 3 wunderlin et al 2013 followed this approach relating sp to δδ15nbulk n2o values to verify process conditions that are most conducive to distinct production pathways e g hd nd ni during batch experiments in a laboratory scale reactor with activated sludge since no elevated sp was observed in the aerated zones no significant contribution of ni to n2o production was anticipated moreover δδ15n n2o nh4 values which considers ammonium as a possible substrate did not co vary with the sp values towards ni source endmember signatures fig s 3 alternatively lewicka szczebak et al 2016 showed that a dual isotope mapping approach with sp versus δδ18o n2o h2o is especially suitable to elucidate mixing of n2o produced by hd or ni and partial n2o reduction by denitrification n2o produced by ni typically bears oxygen isotope values of δ18o n2o 25 inherited from atmospheric o2 frame and casciotti 2010 for n₂o produced from hd or nd the parameter δδ18o n2o h2o offers additional insights over δ18o alone as discussed below the sp values of n2o emitted under aerated conditions indicate nd or hd as main n2o production pathway the relationship of sp with δδ18o n₂o h2o fig 3a displays a considerable decrease in both sp and δδ18o n₂o h2o during the change from anoxic zone 1 to oxic zone 2 conditions this corresponds to a decline in partial n2o reduction for zone 2 in relation to zone 1 as reduction of n2o to n2 by hd increases sp of the residual n2o pool since the 15n o bond is more stable than 14n o summarized in denk et al 2017 ostrom and ostrom 2017 yu et al 2020 additional support for the concurrent reduction of nitrite and n2o through hd comes from the concomitant increase in δ18o no2 and δ15n n2o shown in fig 3b interpreting the δδ18o n₂o h2o signatures of n2o emitted in the aerobic zone i e in parallel with low sp values requires a more nuanced interpretation but yields additional information the δδ18o n₂o h2o value is controlled by both equilibrium isotope effects during o exchange of precursors with water and branching isotope effects during o abstraction casciotti et al 2007 casciotti et al 2010 kool et al 2007 both effects depend strongly on the bacterial community that performs denitrification and can differ substantially among systems kool et al 2007 martin and casciotti 2016 the observed δ18o no2 is consistent with complete exchange between no2 and water for samples in the aerated zone the measured δ18o h2o plus the equilibrium fractionation of 13 at 15 to 20 c yields a composition of 3 buchwald and casciotti 2013 fig 3b complete exchange can be associated with nitrite produced in nitrification buchwald et al 2012 casciotti et al 2010 but can also be mediated by the iron containing nitrite reductase nirs which is present in many heterotrophic denitrifiers casciotti et al 2007 casciotti et al 2002 kool et al 2007 then the final δδ18o n₂o h2o of n2o is determined by the branching kinetic isotope effects associated with nitrite reduction to no followed by no reduction to n2o casciotti et al 2007 casciotti et al 2002 martin and casciotti 2016 rohe et al 2017 the conversion of no2 to n2o by the nitrite reductase and nitric oxide reductase enzymes then imparts a branching kinetic isotope effect casciotti et al 2007 casciotti et al 2002 the identity of the nitrite reductase enzyme nirk nirs controls the size of this branching isotope effect and thus δ18o n2o h2o n2o production from nitrite that has an equilibrium value of δ18o no2 h2o by bacteria with nirs is associated with a larger oxygen isotope effect and so that n2o will display values for δδ18o n2o h2o of 28 6 while bacteria with the copper containing nirk will display a slightly lower δδ18o n2o h2o of 24 6 martin and casciotti 2016 various hd species are known to have either nirk or nirs but only nirk has been found in nd kozlowski et al 2016 nikaido 2003 zumft 1997 wei et al 2015 therefore n2o associated with nd and hd exhibits overlapping ranges for δδ18o n2o h2o but values greater 30 are likely to be associated with hd the only pure culture constraint on δδ18o n2o h2o for n2o generated by nd with a value of 22 frame and casciotti 2010 falls at the low end of the above mentioned range and thus consistent with the expectation from the enzyme based framework provided δδ18o n₂o h2o values for n2o emitted from the aerated zones of wwtp hofen fall into the range expected for bacteria featuring nitrite reduction using the nirs enzyme 30 to 34 fig 3 and thus a major contribution of hd this result is also consistent with the observation of orschler et al 2021 that although hd can theoretically involve both nirk or nirs in activated sludge systems it is predominantly performed via nirs δδ18o n₂o h2o values from the aerated zones are about 10 higher than those reported by lewicka szczebak et al 2016 of 16 7 to 23 3 the observed discrepancy may be explained by the fact that the underlying values reported by lewicka szczebak et al 2016 were derived from soil systems that likely differ significantly in terms of the active microbial communities and expressed enzymes as compared to wastewater systems wu et al 2019 the prevalence of anaerobic hd under oxic conditions can easily be rationalized by anoxic microsites in sludge flocs even in aerated zones sexstone et al 1985 daigger et al 2007 nevertheless given the variability seen in δδ18o n₂o h2o we cannot exclude a variable contribution from nd under certain conditions which could be what drives difference between aerobic samples in fig 3a slightly lower sp and lower δδ18o n₂o h2o values may be due to an increased contribution of nd alternatively the higher values may also be caused by a partial reduction of n2o also during aerobic phases assuming that the organic substrate is not fully consumed in zone 1 and leaks into zone 2 furthermore n2o with a high sp and δδ18o n₂o h2o might be transported and mixed in from zone 1 as discussed in section 3 3 in more detail plotting sp values relative to δδ15n n2o no3 indicates a higher variability among the three intensive sampling campaigns fig 3d co variations in sp and δδ15n n2o no3 values between n2o from aerated and anoxic zones during individual campaigns were driven by the partial n2o reduction indicated by the reduction line differences in δδ15n n2o no3 between experiments e g 31 6 campaigns 1 and 2 versus 41 1 campaign 3 were possibly caused by concentration dependent variations affecting cell specific rates in the isotope effects associated with denitrification kritee et al 2012 more precisely the higher no3 concentrations during experiment 3 10 18 mg no3 n l compared to experiment 1 and 2 0 7 mg no3 n l may manifest in substantially higher isotope effects the increased nitrate concentrations were due to the full aeration of all zones over multiple weeks before experiment 3 the operation led to reduced denitrification activity and no3 accumulation in the biological treatment interestingly δδ15n n2o no2 was more consistent than δδ15n n2o no3 between campaigns i e isotope effects seemed less strongly affected by n substrate concentrations fig 3c therefore isotopic signatures for samples from aerated and anoxic compartments cluster significantly closer to the predicted reduction line fig 3c the observed correlation of delta values for individual campaigns hence supports the notion that the isotopic composition of no3 no2 and n2o are mostly controlled by the sequential reduction of no3 to n2 during complete denitrification in summary the isotopic composition of n2o no2 and no3 consistently point towards a high contribution of hd to n2o production during aeration on all days nd may be of variable relevance yet ni can be excluded as a significant contributor hd was previously shown to govern n2o production during aeration under low c n conditions domingo felez et al 2016 our data confirm that obligate anaerobic processes such as hd play an important role even during aerated reactor conditions supported by strong oxygen gradients and anoxic microniches in sludge flocs daigger et al 2007 for zones under anoxic process conditions observed isotope patterns provide clear evidence for substantial n2o reduction to diagnose the contribution of different production pathways the relation of sp and δδ18o n₂o h2o turned out to be more sensitive than the δδ15n n2o substrate approaches however combining both approaches as shown here has the benefit of being able to additionally validate interpretations and to provide independent process information to assess the full complexity of concurrent n2o formation and reduction 3 3 diurnal variation in n2o emissions and production pathways the main focus of the third campaign was to investigate the effect of the diurnal patterns in n loading controlled by reject water dosage and cod substrate inflow on n2o emissions and variations in n2o reduction for this we analysed the isotopic signatures of n2o and nitrogenous substrates in zone 1 and 2 for five different time points during one day at lane 2 1 fig 4 n2o emissions exhibited a clear diurnal pattern with a peak at 9 am right before the reject water dosage was stopped fig 4a n2o concentration changes in the anoxic zone measured with the anox tube were consistent with changes in the n2o flux from zone 2 and 3 while nh4 concentrations also exhibited a clear diurnal variation pattern no3 concentrations were relatively stable throughout the study period fig 4c figs s 4 and s 5 si no2 was highest in zone 1 and gradually decreased in zone 2 and 3 respectively fig s 6 si the diurnal trend of the n2o site preference in zone 1 indicates a decreasing importance of n2o reduction from 7 am to 9 am sampling points 1 and 2 also shown in the dual isotope mapping approach e g for sp vs δδ18o n₂o h2o fig 3a after 10 am sp and δδ18o n₂o h2o values for n2o from zone 1 increased along the predicted reduction line which suggests a return to an increasing relevance of n2o reduction for samples 3 to 5 no3 concentrations remain stable in zone 1 fig 4c despite an increase of no3 inflow from the return sludge fig s 5 si confirming that heterotrophic nitrate reduction hd was very active after 9 am we suggest two main causes for the strong daily variation in n2o emissions and n removal first the dosage of reject water and the morning peak in n inflow typically seen in wwtps led to a nh4 concentration increase fig 4c t1 t2 while the n2o reduction capacity of the wwtp was lower due to the increased supply of no3 second and more importantly the availability of organic substrate typically exhibits daily fluctuations therefore despite high nh4 loads from 10 am to 2 pm t3 t4 high availability of organic substrate led to increasing nitrogen removal and in turn increased fractional n2o reduction rates notably cod concentrations were not measured during the campaign but are expected to correlate with the inflow rate to the wastewater treatment plant which exhibits reproducible daily variation fig s 7 si the n2o sp in zone 2 is at its maximum between 6 and 9 am probably due to transport of n2o produced in zone 1 where both n2o production and reduction were high during this part of the diurnal cycle as described above fig 4b this would imply that n2o emissions from zone 2 before and during the peak phase i e the end of the reject water dosage comprise a substantial contribution of n2o from zone 1 hd as the main source of this n2o is supported by the high δδ18o n2o h2o values 36 2 2 3 alternatively high sp values in zone 2 before 9 am can be explained by partial n2o reduction but this is unlikely given cod limitation during reject water dosage moreover transport of n2o produced in an anoxic zone to an aerobic zone has been reported earlier for other wwtps mampaey et al 2016 after 10 am the difference in sp values between zone 1 and 2 was increasing again indicating that n2o transport and mixing was less important in addition the contribution of nd to n2o formation might have increased after 10 am in zone 2 which could further explain the lower sp and δδ18o n₂o h2o here nevertheless we believe that hd also contributed a major part to the emissions in the aerobic zones between 11 am and 4 pm given the still high δδ18o n2o h2o values 3 4 n2o emissions depend on process operation the seasonal dynamics in n2o emissions indicate that phases when the air consumption in zone 3 exceeded a defined threshold and thus when zone 1 was aerated were generally characterized by high net n2o production fig 2 to better understand the effect of aerobic conditions in the first zone on overall n2o formation we compared the isotopic signatures of n2o produced along a fully aerated lane 2 1 and a lane under standard operation i e with anoxic conditions in the zone 1 2 2 table 1 the episodes of reject water dosage in the morning had a high impact on the emissions i e high n2o emissions in campaign 3 but n2o emissions were even higher from the fully aerated lane table 2 the difference between lanes was primarily driven by emissions in zones 1 and 2 while emissions in the third zone were comparable fig 5 a the explanation for increased n2o emissions from the fully aerated lane 2 1 can be assessed when comparing isotopic signatures of the n2o released from zone 1 of both lanes fig 5b campaign 1 the n2o isotopic signature measured in the zone 1 of lane 2 2 with conventional operation i e zone 1 mostly anoxic indicates a substantial reduction of n2o in contrast for lane 2 1 with zone 1 aerated the share of n2o reduction was substantially lower the proportion of n2o reduction can be estimated quantitatively by the expression δsp εsp x ln f jinuntuya nortman et al 2008 lewicka szczebak et al 2017 mariotti et al 1981 with ε being the enrichment factor 8 2 to 2 9 yu et al 2020 and f the fraction of unreacted n2o the isotopic enrichment factor between product p and substrate s is defined as εxp s αxp s 1 δxp δxs 1 where α is the isotopic fractionation factor applying this approach yields an estimate of 92 of n2o 84 to 99 using max and min fractionation factors reduced for the anoxic zone 1 of lane 2 2 while only 68 56 to 90 using max and min fractionation factors is reduced in the aerated zone 1 of lane 2 1 assuming that the sp values for n2o from zone 2 are representative for the n2o production process as during campaign 3 n2o production was very likely driven by hd given the increased δδ18o n2o h2o values 35 2 0 6 in the aerobic zones campaigns 1 and 3 revealed that organic carbon availability aeration of zone 1 and reject water n dosage are the most important modulators of n2o emissions during standard operation at the hofen wwtp and at a given time of the year notably emissions were lowest in campaign 2 table 2 with anoxic conditions in zone 1 of both lanes without reject water dosage and sampling times in the afternoon where increased organic substrate concentrations are expected while it seems relatively clear that aerobic conditions in zone 1 and low organic substrate availability both lead to higher emissions by impairing a more efficient n2o reduction the mechanism behind the increased production of n2o caused by elevated reject water dosage which leads to an increase in nh4 concentrations is not fully understood gruber et al 2020 most plausibly elevated n2o emissions are directly linked to the high nh4 concentrations following substrate vs intermediate product systematics alternatively it is possible that the composition of the reject water is somehow unfavorable for heterotrophic denitrifiers and nitrifiers further research is needed to unravel underlying mechanisms e g by comparing the effects of dosages of reject water nh4 versus nh4 2so4 solution in activated sludge nevertheless our results already yield important information regarding efficient strategies to reduce n2o emissions during normal operation at the hofen wwtp the guiding principle for the mitigation of n2o emissions is to maximize n2o reduction by avoiding aeration of zone 1 and dosing reject water primarily during periods with high organic carbon load e g in the afternoon the adaptation of the feeding strategy to optimize organic carbon utilization towards most efficient n2o reduction has been successfully applied in side stream treatment peng et al 2017 however changing reject water dosage operation strategies should be critically evaluated as the effects of the nh4 loading are multifaceted that is besides potential impacts of the nh4 dosage on net n2o emissions other constraints need to be considered for example increased nh4 peak concentrations can lead to nh4 breakthrough and load equilibration in the diurnal pattern is beneficial for the nitrification performance meyer and wilderer 2004 we propose to apply conventional activated sludge modeling and full scale testing combined with extensive process monitoring to optimize reject water dosage in terms of effluent quality and maximized reduction capacities for n2o mitigation henze et al 2000 isotopic technologies were successfully applied to analyze the contribution of n2o production pathways at the hofen wwtp and provided mechanistic understanding to support mitigation strategies still long term monitoring of the isotopic composition of n2o and other nitrogen species is needed in future studies to evaluate the consistency and robustness of the approach a major advantage to characterize contributions of n2o reduction and production pathways at the hofen wwtp involved the cascaded lanes with clearly defined redox conditions in each zone we expect that the application in flow through non compartmented activated sludge systems can be more challenging due to increased mixing over a whole lane leading to a higher exchange of the nitrogen pools furthermore continuous long term monitoring is important for the extrapolation and interpretation of the data and the characterization of the seasonal emission peaks the lion s share of the total annual n2o emissions can be attributed to the january peak emission period fig 2 50 of the total emissions in association with elevated no2 concentration levels seasonally impaired no2 oxidation in wwtps leading to no2 accumulation has been linked to low abundances of nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob and drastic changes in the whole activated sludge microbial community gruber et al 2021 however the nob loss observed by gruber et al 2021 at the uster wwtp led to no2 accumulation over a periods of 1 2 months and it is unclear whether similar process were also responsible for the accumulation of nitrite over a few weeks at the hofen wwtp 4 summary and conclusions measurements of relative 15n and 18o abundances in nitrogen bearing molecules were successfully applied to characterize dynamics of n2o formation pathways under normal operation in a full scale activated sludge wwtp n2o was mainly produced by heterotrophic denitrification while nitrifier denitrification appeared to be less important and of rather variable influence nh2oh oxidation was negligible seasonal emission peaks occurred during winter when no2 accumulates and when the biological treatment is operated at full aeration but nob activity is still impaired based on n2o isotopic measurements n2o reduction was identified under anoxic conditions and to lesser extent also under oxic conditions when it is restricted to anoxic micro niches fractional n2o reduction was most pronounced under organic substrate replete conditions while n2o accumulation in the anoxic zone was primarily observed when organic substrate was limiting hence the daily variation of organic substrate has a strong impact on the reduction of n2o and in turn diurnal n2o emission fluctuations the dosage of reject water and full aeration of the biological treatment significantly increased n2o emissions since n2o reduction was strongly impeded hence an efficient mitigation strategy towards optimized n2o reduction may involve shifting reject water dosage to periods with high organic substrate availability as well as avoiding full aeration of the biological treatment coupling isotopic technologies with continuous long term monitoring of n2o emissions is a powerful tool for qualitative n2o pathway identification and the development of n2o

19931,the inner walls of drinking water pipes are often expected to be clean and controlled surfaces to assure safe water access to the public however these surfaces are typically contaminated with particulate materials and biofilms that eventually degrade water quality while water utilities place significant efforts in identifying and flushing material deposits from compromised pipes the development of effective preventive strategies is still limited by the lack of knowledge about material accumulation processes the aim of this paper is to examine the interplay between suspended sediment concentration particle size and fluid velocity and the attachment of suspended iron oxide particles in pvc drinking water pipes for that purpose a series of short experiments were completed whereby water amended with a known concentration of selected and stable iron oxide particles was introduced in a full scale pipe loop laboratory over a short period of time and both turbidity and suspended sediment concentration ssc were measured at the inlet and outlet of the pipe loop results showed that a selected fraction of the injected particles with sizes above a specific threshold in the range of 4 6 to 6 8 µm had not reached the downstream section of the pipe loop but instead remained attached to the pipe walls in addition exponential decay of the ssc was observed to occur along the pipes and to cause most of the sediments to accumulate in the upstream section of the pipe loop the research improved our understanding of the physical processes of particulate material accumulation in dwdss and it will help water utilities forecast and monitor material accumulation and discolouration potential graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords discolouration suspended sediment concentration particle size iron oxides particle deposition 1 introduction the quality of finished drinking water is expected to deteriorate during its transport through pipes of drinking water distribution systems dwdss the accumulation of material deposits inside the pipes of a distribution network is often suggested as a major factor that contributes to water quality deterioration vreeburg and boxall 2007 material deposits can be resuspended and cause water to be discoloured husband and boxall 2011 seth et al 2004 and spur the growth of microorganisms and biofilms at the pipe wall lehtola et al 2004 vreeburg et al 2008 further contamination with viable microorganisms liu et al 2016 heavy metals liu et al 2017 and antimicrobial genes rilstone et al 2021 all have the potential to cause severe health implications despite this water utilities often lack the tools and methods to adequately assess the build up of material deposits in operational networks traditionally when water utilities suspect that a pipe section is harboring material deposits or contaminants that are degrading drinking water quality they resort to flushing to mobilize materials and clean the culprit sections in most cases flushing effectively removes materials in the short term but it does not prevent new materials from accumulating on the pipe wall flushing operations are expensive also consume a substantial amount of water and require the isolation of pipe sections and service interruptions to customers therefore strategies to slow the rate of material deposition on the wall of drinking water pipes in dwdss can reduce the human and physical resources needed for flushing operations and contribute to maintaining safe drinking water numerous studies have shown that particulate iron oxide is the dominant material that accumulates in dwdss lehtola et al 2004 seth et al 2004 evidence from flushing old cast iron ci pipe mains suggests that most of the iron oxide particles are sourced from the internal corrosion of ci pipe since these sections typically generate the highest mobilized load in a single flushing operation boxall and saul 2005 husband and boxall 2010 research also shows that loose iron oxide particles are continually transported from their source components to the downstream regions of a dwds husband et al 2014 while the apparent load of iron oxide particles in non metallic pipe sections is substantially smaller than that in their ci counterparts iron oxides are still the dominant constituent of mobilized materials in non metallic pipes seth et al 2004 nevertheless vreeburg et al 2008 also found that pipe sections with higher inorganic material deposits fostered the growth of organic matter on the pipe wall which suggests that material deposits enhance biofilm growth in the last two decades researchers have developed conceptual models to explain the mechanics of material deposit accumulation focusing on the relationship between turbidity and discolouration risk boxall et al 2003 and boxall and saul 2005 suggested the use of a turbidity potential to quantify the materials that can be mobilized at the pipe wall they proposed an empirical model named prediction of discoloration events in distribution systems podds that simulates material accumulation as material layers with shear strength conditioned by the wall shear stress wss of the flow at the pipe wall in a flushing simulation podds calculates the increase of the turbidity by comparing the wss to the shear strength of each material layer to determine which layer will be mobilized this concept has been validated by several field and laboratory studies boxall and saul 2005 cook and boxall 2011 husband and boxall 2010 later furnass et al 2014 reported the flaws of the podds regeneration module and suggested that material layers across all shear strengths may accumulate simultaneously and independently of the current wss of the flow furnass et al 2014 further suggested that this coefficient may change over time and its accurate determination still requires further investigation blokker and schaap 2015 also proposed the estimation of material deposition on the basis of turbidity at the upstream inlet of a water main they measured the turbidity equivalent mass in controlled sections located upstream of an operational network and compared it to the turbidity equivalent mass mobilized from flushing these sections ryan et al 2008 suggested that material deposition is comprised of two distinct mechanisms the first is based on the gravitational settling of particles and the second is based on the attachment of particles to the pipe wall here ryan et al 2008 developed a semi empirical approach to simulate the settling of particles adapted from a sewer sediment transport model that makes use of information about particle size particle specific density and flow for their system a threshold velocity of 0 2 m s 1 was found to prevent deposition while vreeburg and boxall 2007 proposed a pragmatic self cleaning velocity threshold of 0 4 m s 1 and blokker et al 2011 suggested a value between 0 2 0 25 m s 1 both these velocities are based on experimental data from operational dwdss later van summeren and blokker 2017 built upon the gravitational model from ryan et al 2008 by adding the concept of sediment bed load transport adapted from previous research on sediment transport in open channels the authors identified a range of possible scenarios and conditions for bed flow occurrence in dwdss but further experimental evidence is still required to confirm their model for the second mechanism ryan et al 2008 developed an empirical model named the particle sediment model psm that can estimate both the deposition and mobilization of particles to pipe walls in this model they assumed that particles can attach to the pipe walls of their experimental system through van der waals force the inclusion of a surface adhesion force in their model established a link to the build up of material layers with the specific shear strength included in the podds model ryan et al 2008 used a small pipe loop facility to maintain a suspension of particles at a velocity of 0 6 m s 1 for two hours before adjusting the pump settings to switch to a lower fluid velocity conditioning velocities in the range of 0 07 0 3 m s 1 were tested the results showed that the bulk water particle concentration decayed exponentially until a stable concentration was maintained in suspension dependent on the pipe material and on fluid velocity ryan et al 2008 suggested that a diffusion like mechanism based on a suspended solids concentration ssc threshold that is function of the fluid velocity governed whether particles would be 1 deposited on the pipe wall 2 stable or 3 resuspended from the pipe wall in this context boxall and saul 2005 showed that the average particle size of materials mobilized from flushing drinking water pipes was in the range of 10 µm and they suggested that in most water mains in operational networks turbulent conditions are enough to prevent gravitational settling of these particles in addition van thienen et al 2011 developed a theoretical model to explain the transport of suspended particles of different sizes under hydraulic conditions of dwdss but the model was not sufficient to explain the predominance of fine particles on samples from discoloured water despite the many advances made in understanding material deposition mechanisms several questions remain unanswered regarding how particles adhere to pipe walls and resist resuspension when subjected to wall shear stress current conceptual models do not explicitly include the particle size distribution and particle density the lack of knowledge about the dynamics of these variables limits the accuracy of models based on gravitational settling due to the strong dependence of particle size on fall velocities it also limits the accuracy of models that make use of a stable relationship between turbidity and suspended solids concentration ssc furthermore while cohesion is widely assumed to be related to biofilms it is unclear which forces contribute to holding inorganic particles on the wall in the absence of biofilms previous experiments completed in a full scale pvc pipe loop facility by braga and filion 2021 showed that fine iron oxide particle deposits were accumulated only on the pipe invert and that only a small fraction of particles were still held in suspension after a 30 day period where fluid velocity was held constant their results suggest that adhesion forces did not develop between particles and the pipe wall to hold them to the obvert or the springline positions of the pipe and that particles as small as 1 µm were able to settle onto the pipe invert and resist the wss of common operational velocities in dwdss these results were in stark contrast to previous research findings boxall and saul 2005 and demonstrate that further examination of the mechanisms behind the accumulation of sediment deposits is required this paper aims to examine the dynamics of acute particulate attachment on pipe walls sunny et al 2020 following the rapid release and travel of a concentrated plume of iron oxide particles immediately following a simulated discolouration event in controlled experiments completed in a full scale pvc pipe loop laboratory the specific objectives of the experiments were to 1 estimate the average rate of iron oxide particle deposition on pvc pipes immediately after the rapid release and during the passage of a highly concentrated plume of iron oxide particles that typifies discolouration events in real systems 2 determine whether previously deposited particles on the pipe wall from the passage of previous iron oxide particle plumes affect the average rate of iron oxide deposition and attachment to the pipe wall and 3 examine the specific mechanisms involved in the particle settling phenomenon for drinking water pipes and the effect of particle size distribution of sediments in suspension on the formation of material deposits on the pipe wall 2 methods the experimental work was realized in the drinking water distribution laboratory dwdl at queen s university using a full scale pipe loop rig that simulates the operation of drinking water mains the pipe laboratory system is comprised of a water tank with a volume of 3 6 m³ two variable speed centrifugal pumps and 11 loops of ipex blue brute pvc pipe class 235 dr18 with an internal diameter of 108 mm and a total length of 193 m fig 1 during the experiments the pipe loop system was operated in a non recirculatory manner where drinking water from the city of kington was continuously added to the tank pumped through the pipe system and discarded at the end the water from the city of kingston has a ph of 8 1 a hardness of 123 mg l 1 caco3 and an alkalinity of 92 mg l 1 caco3 and has approximately 1 7 mg l 1 of dissolved carbon and 1 0 mg l 1 of total nitrogen utilities kingston 2017 during the experiments the water temperature ranged between 12 c and 14 c in the experiments drinking water was amended with iron oxide particles of known particle size distribution at the inlet to the pipe loop to induce the formation of material deposits on the pipe walls a total of five experiments were performed with a variable concentration of suspended particles f1c1 f2c2 and f1c3 in table 1 and a variable conditioning flow rate f1c1 f2c1 and f3c1 in table 1 during all the experiments the pipe flow rate and turbidity were continuously monitored at a sampling frequency of 1 hz using two sierra innovasonic 205i ultrasonic flow meters 0 5 and two online hach tu5300sc turbidimeters 0 01 ntu fig 1 the turbidimeters were configured to monitor turbidity at the inlet 7 of the pipe length and outlet 98 of the pipe length fig 1 turbidity was measured from water continuously sampled from the centre of the pipe at a constant sampling flow rate only steady flow conditions were tested but due to the short duration of the experiments these flows can be interpreted as the highest daily peak flows of operational systems commonly used to determine the conditioning wss in systems with variable demands husband and boxall 2011 husband et al 2008 the conditioning stage of each experiment was divided in three independent sub stages p1 p2 and p3 where plumes of suspended particles were produced at the inlet of the pipe loop and completely transported through the pipe loop outlet before the introduction of the next plume in the next sub stage each plume was created by injecting a known volume of a concentrated solution of iron oxide particles csiop at the inlet of the pipe loop with a known ssc c c s i o p mg l 1 over an injection period equal to the time required for the water to travel 60 m downstream of the injection point given the prevailing flow rate q p i p e l s 1 in the pipe loop fig 1 the plume length of 60 m was mainly defined by a limitation of the maximum injection volume under stable mixing conditions in the csiop a new csiop was prepared for each plume by addinga known mass of iron oxide particles iop m i o p mg into a known drinking water volume v o l c s i o p l in a mixing baffled tank operated at a fixed mixing intensity fig 1 after the iop addition in the tank a period of 5 minutes was used to allow the particle suspension to stabilize in the mixing tank a diaphragm pump was used to pump water from the bottom of the csiop tank approximately 10 cm away from the tank walls from a position of intense mixing between two of the four vertical baffles and inject it at a constant flow at the inlet of the pipe loop at the centreline cross sectional position of the pipe fig 1 the final ssc of the csiop c c s i o p mg l 1 was measured immediately before after the stabilization period and immediately after the injection period by collecting grab samples from sampling tubing located in an equivalent position to the inlet of the diaphragm pump and with a similar flow rate as the diaphragm pump the injection flow rate q c s i o p l s 1 was measured during the injection period by monitoring the decrease of mass in the starting solution in the baffled mixing tank using a conventional scale fig 1 the ssc of the sediment plume generated from the mass injection at the start of the pipe loop c 0 mg l 1 was calculated using direct measurements from experimental variables through a mass balance relationship fig 1 and equation 1 1 c 0 q c s i o p c c s i o p q p i p e c c s i o p m i o p v o l c s i o p this method for estimating the initial ssc was preferred to a direct grab sample collection from the pipe loop immediately after the injection because a mixing length is required to achieve a suspension stability in the pipe therefore initial ssc in the pipes was estimated on the basis of a stable particle suspension in the csiop established after the stabilization period of 5 minutes during the short injection periods given the constant mixing intensity and small variation in the water level in the tank it is also reasonable to assume that the grab sample had an equivalent ssc to the csiop fraction injected in the pipe since the sample was collected from an equivalent location in the mixing tank which is expected to have a flow symmetry around the vertical rotation axis which produces similar particle suspension in both water intake regions cekinski et al 2010 the average of the ssc difference between csiop samples collected before and after the injection was 3 which suggests that no changes occurred during the injection period lastly the average uncertainty of the final ssc estimated at the pipe inlet was of 10 while the average uncertainty of the ssc from samples collected directly at the pipes presented in sequence was 5 during the experiments the three sequential injections with fixed conditions were designed to identify if the particle accumulation rate changed over successive plumes it was hypothesized that the particle accumulation rate of the 2nd and 3rd plumes might be affected by the presence of particles deposited on the pipe wall after the first plume the basis for this hypothesis is that the particles from the first plume might produce new features in the microscopic surface of the pvc pipe which might enhance the attachment of the new particles at the end of each injection period the steady flow conditions were maintained in the pipe loop for an additional period required to refresh the equivalent of 1 5 pipe loop volumes to guarantee that all suspended particles from the sediment plume had exited the pipe loop between each of the different experimental conditions tested the pipe system was cleaned at the highest flowrate 16 l s 1 and clean coupon pipe wall samples presented in sequence were added after the cleaning flush to re establish identical initial condition for all the experiments a chemical grade of red iron oxide powder from alpha chemicals with a composition of 82 of iron iii oxide fe2o3 was chosen as the source of particles for the experiments due their representativeness of iron oxide particles found in dwdss and their stable particulate form and insolubility in water the powder was sent to a commercial laboratory to split it into sub samples of 50 g with identical particle size distributions psd using a mini rotary splitter from retsch company model pt100 the psd of two sub samples picked at random was analyzed with a malvern mastersizer 3000 particle size analyzer laser diffraction in the preparation of the concentrated starting solution 1 to 3 sub samples were added to the csiop tank with a steady mixing rotation the insolubility of the particles and negligible amounts of dissolved iron in the local drinking water guaranteed that particles remained stable during the experiments following each injection grab samples were collected at the inlet and outlet sampling port locations fig 1 to determine ssc at those locations and to assess changes in the particles in suspension after the passage of each plume the collection of grab samples was synchronized with the fluid velocity in the pipe loop to collect 4 l of water from the centre of the passing sediment plume the ssc of the grab samples was determined using a dry weight method by filtering the sample volume with pre weighed 0 45 µm glass microfiber filters drying the filters at 105 c for 1 hour and weighing them again after drying with a precision scale additional grab samples were also collected from the csiop and from the outlet sampling port during the passage of the third plume in experiments f1c1 f2c1 and f3c1 to assess changes of the psd of the particles in suspension the psd of the grab samples was determined with the malvern mastersizer 3000 particle size analyzer a pipe wall coupon sampling system described in braga and filion 2021 was also used in the experiments to characterize the accumulation of material deposits at the pipe wall the system allows for the collection of representative pipe wall coupon samples from a coupon section located at 55 of the pipe loop length fig 1 the coupon samples consist of circular pvc disks that are inserted directly into custom pre drilled holes in the pvc pipe loop a precise surface alignment of the internal surface of the coupon with the surrounding pipe wall surface in the range of 0 1 mm guarantees that the coupon sample experiences the same hydrodynamic conditions as the remainder of the pvc pipe wall without disturbing the local velocity profile in the viscous sub layer region vsl coupon samples were acquired between the passage of each plume and analyzed using brightfield microscopy to visualize the deposits of iron oxide particles on the internal surface of the pvc pipe one hundred 100 field of views fov of each coupon sample were captured using the nikon eclipse ni e automated upright microscope in brightfield mode at a final magnification of 400x a previously developed matlab image processing script was used to calculate the percent coverage sediment and particle size analysis psa of material deposits detected on the pipe coupons braga and filion 2021 3 results 3 1 material deposition estimation fig 2 presents the turbidity measured at the inlet and outlet of the pipe loop against pipe loop volume turnover across the five experiments the outlet turbidity profiles deviate from an instantaneous square shape likely due to a non uniform velocity profile that caused some mechanical dispersion at the plume front and rear this is also noticeable for the inlet turbidity data in experiments f2c1 and f3c1 realized at higher velocities fig 2 turbidity values as high as 100 ntu were measured in experiment f1c3 similar turbidity values have been reported in operational dwdss during intense discolouration events but usually at higher flow rates husband and boxall 2010 fig 3 and table 2 show the detailed results of the particle load estimations for individual plumes of each experiment table 2 indicates the estimated values of the ssc and the total material load tml at the three control sections of the pipe loop 1 injection point l 0 m 2 inlet turbidity meter l 13 5 m and 3 outlet turbidity meter l 189 m a consistent decrease of ssc from the injection point to the outlet location demonstrates that a sizable fraction of the particles in suspension was deposited on the pipe walls of the system the total material load at the injection location tml0 g was calculated by multiplying the csiop c c s i o p mg l 1 by the injection flow rate q c s i o p l min 1 and the injection period for the case of the inlet and outlet locations the corresponding tmlin g and tmlout g were estimated based on both the turbidity and ssc grab sample data through a series of steps 1 the turbidity measurements ntu were converted to an equivalent ssc mg l 1 using a specific linear regression coefficient mg l 1 ntu 1 presented later in this paper 2 an instantaneous suspended sediment flux mg s 1 was calculated by multiplying the ssc mg l 1 by the flow rate l s 1 and 3 the tml g was calculated by integrating the material flux over the total time required for the plume to travel through the pipe loop the total deposited load tdl g was calculated by taking the difference between the total material load at the injection point tml0 g and the total material load at the outlet tmlout g fig 3 shows that large differences in tdl occurred between experiments performed at different concentrations f1c1 f1c2 and f1c3 while only small differences were found between experiments performed at different velocities f3c1 f2c1 and f1c1 systematic variations of the particle deposition rate and attachment were not observed along the three plumes of each experiment fig 3 suggesting that the presence of particle deposits from previous plumes had a negligible impact on particle deposition and attachment the secondary vertical axis right hand side of fig 3 shows that both an increase of concentration and fluid velocity produced an increase in the average deposition rate such increase was mainly caused by the shorter conditioning period of the experiments at higher velocities lastly table 2 also shows the fraction of the particles that were introduced in the pipe loop and were subsequently deposited onto the pipe walls tdl tml0 ranged from a minimum of a 69 2 in the f2c1 p1 experiment to a maximum of 76 3 in the f1c3 p1 experiment a number of regression relationships were developed to relate measured turbidity to measured ssc in the pipe loop the linear regression coefficients used to transform measured turbidity into ssc were obtained by performing a linear regression of the ssc measured from collected grab samples and their corresponding turbidity values fig 4 the linear regression coefficient values of 0 24 mg l 1 ntu 1 and 0 15 mg l 1 ntu 1 determined through regression analysis are smaller than those in the research literature that reported turbidity values exceeding 1 mg l 1 ntu 1 in flushing operations pourcel et al 2020 3 2 particle size analysis the paper also examined the impact of fluid velocity on the evolution of iron oxide particle size distribution in the experiments fig 5 plots the particle size distribution measured from samples collected at different experimental stages including 1 the initial iron oxide particles iop used to prepare the csiop 2 the suspended particles from the csiop mixing tank that were injected into the pipe loop and 3 the particles in suspension at the outlet of the pipe loop during the passage of the third sediment plume in experiments f1c1 p3 f2c1 p3 and f3c1 p3 where the fluid velocity was increased from 0 07 m s 1 to 0 3 m s 1 in the plots of fig 5 the volume density on the primary vertical axis left hand side denotes the percentage of the total particle volume for each particle size and the cumulative volume on the secondary vertical axis right hand side corresponds to the value of particle size below which a certain percentage of the sample lies the volume density curves show the predominant particle sizes of each distribution peak of curves and the particle size range of a sample the volume density curves in fig 5 have peaks that are below 10 µm which indicates a predominance of small particle sizes in all the experimental stages however a large upper range of particle sizes was found for the iop and csiop samples with particles as large as 100 µm while the particle size range at the outlet of the pipe loop was limited to 10 µm for the f1c1 experiment and 20 µm for the f2c1 and f3c1 experiments the cumulative volume curves in fig 5 show that the initial iop powder had a d80 80 of the particle volume is below a specific particle size of 60 μm and that this was reduced to 26 μm at the csiop mixing tank these results suggest that even with an intense level of mixing in the csiop baffled tank a large fraction of particles had settled out of solution in the mixing tank before they were introduced in the pipe loop during the passage of the sediment plumes in the pipes the particles in suspension at the injection point had a d80 of 26 μm while the particles in suspension at the outlet had a d80 of 4 6 μm in the f1c1 experiment velocity of 0 07 m s 1 6 2 μm in the f2c1 experiment velocity of 0 2 m s 1 and 6 8 μm in the f3c1 experiment velocity of 0 3 m s 1 the differences in the d80 between the injection point and the outlet of the pipe loop suggest that particles in the range of 4 6 μm 26 μm were deposited in the f1c1 experiment particles in the range of 6 2 μm 26 μm in the f2c1 experiment and particles in the range of 6 8 μm 26 μm in the f3c1 experiment therefore the lower limit of the sizes of the particles that are deposited establishes a particle size threshold particles with sizes larger than this threshold will be deposited on the pipes deposited particles dp while particles with sizes smaller than the threshold will be maintained in suspension non deposited particles ndp it is clear that the increase in fluid velocity raised the particle size threshold and kept larger particles in suspension as observed with the decrease of the dp fraction these findings are in agreement with the decrease in the deposited materials observed across experiments f2c1 and f3c1 where the fluid velocity was increased from 0 2 m s 1 to 0 3 m s 1 table 2 in addition using the csiop volume density curve of fig 5 it is possible to estimate the fraction of the injected particles that corresponds to a determined particle size range partial cumulative volume choosing a particle size range from 4 6 µm to 6 8 µm defined by the particle size threshold of the two experiments with the larger velocity difference f1c1 p3 and f3c1 p3 results in a csiop partial cumulative volume of 6 5 which represents the fraction of the injected particles csiop that were deposited in the experiment with the lower velocity f1c1 p3 but were kept in suspension in the experiment with the higher velocity f3c1 p3 in other words that is the fraction of the initial injected particles that changed between dp to ndp fractions as consequence of the increase in flow velocity from 0 07 m s 1 to 0 3 m s 1 by comparison the proportional reduction of the tdl table 2 between the experiments f1c1 p3 and f3c1 p3 was estimated to be 6 6 the close agreement between the two metrics estimated from different experimental measurements is strong evidence that the reduction of tdl between the experiments performed at fluid velocities 0 07 m s 1 and 0 3 m s 1 was caused by the non deposition of particles in the range of 4 6 µm to 6 8 µm 3 3 suspended sediment decay model the evolution of particle deposition along the length of the pipe loop was also examined fig 6 plots the ssc measured at the injection point the inlet and outlet of the pipe loop with their corresponding pipe length positions the ssc data points were found to conform to a first order exponential decay process which is indicated with solid lines in fig 6 the first order exponential decay model in equation 2 was used to characterize the decrease in ssc along the pipe length as particles are continuously deposited onto the pipe wall 2 c x c d p e k x v c n d p c 0 c d p c n d p where c x mg l 1 is the ssc measured at pipe length location x m c d p mg l 1 and c n d p mg l 1 are the dp and ndp components of the ssc measured at the injection point c 0 mg l 1 k s 1 is the decay coefficient and v m s 1 is the fluid velocity in the pipe loop the solid lines in fig 6 demonstrate that a stable ssc is established after the mid point of the pipe loop length which corresponds to the ndp component of the initial ssc cndp mg l 1 the ndp fraction does not contribute to the formation of material deposits and therefore sets a baseline for the ssc in each experiment the decay coefficient k which governs how fast the dp fraction of the initial ssc is deposited onto the pipe wall was found to increase across experiments f2c1 and f3c1 where the fluid velocity was increased to 0 2 m s 1 and 0 3 m s 1 fig 7 a the decay coefficient was found to be constant at 0 006 s 1 for the experiments f1c1 f1c2 and f1c3 where fluid velocity was held constant at 0 07 m s 1 fig 7b this suggests that a faster deposition occurred in the experiments with higher fluid velocities but a smaller dp fraction led to lower material loads nevertheless fig 6b shows that 80 of all settable material was deposited in the first 15 m of the pipe in the f1c1 experiment where the same fraction was deposited in the first 25 m of pipe in the f2c1 and f3c1 experiments 3 4 microscopy analysis brightfield microscopy was also used to characterize the occurrence of particle attachment on the pipe wall at a pipe section located relatively far from the injection point even though only a negligible fraction of dp particles was able to reach the coupon section located at pipe length of 106 m from the pipe loop inlet figs 1 and 6 a consistent number of iron oxide particle deposits were observed at the pipe invert pipe coupon samples from the obvert location were not analyzed in this study since previous research provided strong evidence that only negligeable quantities of particles accumulate at the pipe obvert braga and filion 2021 fig 8 indicates box and whisker plots for the percentage coverage area of iron oxide particles detected on the coupon samples across a total of 100 field of views fovs per coupon sample for each individual sediment plume the results in fig 8 indicate that the percentage coverage area was increased with the passage of each sediment plume in the low velocity experiments f1c1 f1c2 and f1c3 and that this increase in percent coverage was more noticeable with an increase in the injection concentration in contrast the percent coverage area for samples collected after the third plume in the high velocity experiments f2c1 and f3c1 was smaller than the percent coverage area observed in the low velocity experiments f1c1 f1c2 and f1c3 fig 8 furthermore no changes to the percent coverage area were detected between the consecutive sediment plumes p1 p2 and p3 for the high velocity experiments f2c1 and f3c1 while consistent increases in percent coverage area were detected in each plume for the low velocity experiments f1c1 f1c2 and f1c3 experiments f1c1 f1c2 and f1c3 performed with a fluid velocity of 0 07 m s 1 resulted in a deposition of larger particle sizes on the pipe coupons previous data from ssc samples and the psd analysis showed that particle sizes in the range of 4 6 µm to 26 µm are likely candidates to form deposits rather than their smaller sized counterparts that remain in suspension in comparison the smaller particle sizes found on the pipe coupon samples may indicate that a different mechanism of particle deposition occurred in the pipe the new deposition mechanism however only targets a very small fraction of the suspended particles whose sizes are compatible with the valleys and occlusions that make up the absolute roughness of the pvc pipe walls to confirm the hypothesis regarding the particle sizes of deposits found on the pipe wall samples an analysis of the particle size distribution of the microscopic images was also performed fig 9 plots particle coverage area as a function of particle size detected with brightfield microscopy after the passage of each sediment plume the data in fig 9c shows that as the injection concentration was increased from 20 mg l 1 f1c1 to 60 mg l 1 f1c3 the dominant particle size increased from 3 μm to 5 μm fig 9 also shows clearly that as the injection concentration was increased across experiments a substantial increase in particle coverage area was observed for all particle sizes ranging from 1 μm to 20 μm after the passage of the second and third plumes the particle coverage area for the f2c1 and f3c1 experiments remained below 50 μm² per particle size bin with a dominant particle size smaller than 5 μm 4 discussion the experimental results presented in this paper demonstrate that it is possible to quantify the total load of material deposits along a pipe section using turbidity data calibrated with ssc samples however the relationship between turbidity and ssc can change rapidly based on the psd of suspended sediments this means that regression coefficients should be determined for specific systems and particle properties large errors in the prediction of material deposition can be expected without an adequate assessment of regression coefficients to transform turbidity data into ssc in the experiments of this paper regression coefficients with a small numerical value seem to have been produced by the lower fluid velocities in comparison to the flush velocities previously used to assess these the experiments performed showed that suspended iron oxide particles as small as 4 6 μm can be rapidly deposited on the pipe wall under common operational conditions in drinking water systems the formation of material deposits was mostly affected by the ssc at the injection point and more specifically by the dp fraction of the initial ssc that was comprised of 69 to 75 of the total mass of particles injected into the pipe loop data also showed that 90 of the dp fraction were attached to the pipe wall along the first 40 m of pipe length in the loop while the deposition rate rapidly decreased along the length of the pipe according to a first order decay process increasing the fluid velocity from 0 07 m s 1 to 0 3 m s 1 0 3 m s 1 is often considered a self cleaning velocity blokker et al 2011 produced a decrease of the tdl of 6 and an increase of the particle size threshold that defines the dp and ndp fractions of the initial ssc while it is clear that increasing fluid velocity has an impact on the particle size threshold it is still unclear how small particle sizes in suspension are rapidly deposited onto the pipe walls under turbulent flow conditions boxall and saul 2005 previous research suggested multiple mechanisms that might explain how particles reach the pipe walls while in suspension in turbulent flow van thienen et al 2011 but their attachment mechanisms and origins of adhesion forces are still poorly understood the fact that material deposits on the pipe wall were formed by the larger particle fractions of the initial ssc and that the pst increased with fluid velocity suggests that the gravitational settling mechanism might be driving the particle deposition process this hypothesis is also supported by the fact that no noticeable quantity of particles was observed to accumulate and adhere to the pipe obvert in previous experiments braga and filion 2021 in this context it is possible that current methods used to forecast the settling of suspended particles might not be appropriate for drinking water pipes due to fundamental differences of particle attachment mechanisms that are still poorly understood therefore further research is required to 1 confirm the processes that govern the possible gravitational settling of small particles in drinking water systems and 2 gain a better understanding of the effect of particle adhesion to the pipe wall in these deposition processes in addition the smaller differences between f2c1 and f3c1 in comparison to f1c1 and f2c1 seem to indicate a tapering of particle attachment effects at higher velocities this seems to be caused by the decreasing pool of available suspended particles at larger particle sizes fig 5 peaks of particle size distribution in fig 5 shows that most of the particle mass is concentrated around 2 µm 3 µm while the analysis of the experimental data suggests that a particle size threshold assumed as the d80 in the curves increased from 4 6 µm to 6 8 µm with the fluid velocity therefore the mass of particles larger than the threshold rapidly decreased with the increase in the particle size threshold further increasing the flow rate would continuously increase the particle size threshold and reduce the dp fraction until the threshold reached the maximum particle size and particle deposition would stop altogether however the microscopy data collected at the pipe wall samples located at pipe length of 106 m which for the current experiments had a negligible mass in comparison to the injected ssc seems to suggest that a different wall attachment process operates on the particles in this case the microscopy data analysis suggested that increasing the fluid velocity decreased the accumulation rate of larger particles while only smaller particles were able to remain attached to the pipe wall the similarity in the percent coverage area between f2c1 and f3c1 suggests that particles may have occupied all remaining roughness valleys on the pipe wall available for the attachment of selected fine particles of compatible size and inhibited any additional attachment of particles to the pipe wall this might be indicative that the self cleaning velocity concept is effective in inhibiting this second attachment mechanism which has the potential to dominate the particle attachment process in operational dwdss where larger particles remain immobile due to low fluid velocities during normal flow conditions in addition to this the similarity in the percent coverage area between the three sediment plumes of the f2c1 and f3c1 experiments further suggests that all roughness valleys may have been occupied by particles after the first plume which may have inhibited any additional particle accumulation in the second and third plumes of these experiments 4 1 experimental limitations the experiments performed mimicked the acute loading of suspended particles from an upstream turbidity event sunny et al 2020 in a downstream pipe under more normal daily conditions the experiments used simplified steady state conditions while daily demand patterns are known to have an impact on material accumulation husband et al 2008 these experiments were arguably performed under the highest daily peak flow which was greater than the self cleaning velocities blokker et al 2011 despite this particle accumulation was strongly evident it is also important to highlight that the acute and rapid process of particle attachment to the pipe wall only represents a fraction of the material accumulation processes that occur inside dwdss the experiments made use of relative new pvc pipes free of biofilms in operational systems pipe materials have undergone changes and are populated with biofilm layers which likely play a role in the attachment dynamics of suspended particles a single pipe diameter was tested in the experiments whereas operational dwdss have a large range of pipe diameters it is expected that the pipe diameter effects mostly translate to impacts on fluid velocity and turbulence structures another key simplification consisted of the use of suspended particles with a stable density which greatly facilitated the analysis of particle size distributions both particle size and density are key to determine particle transport in suspension by turbulent flows guha 2008 in the case of operational dwdss such analysis is more challenging since a large range of particle types with multiple densities are expected from pipe wall material deposits additional biochemical processes that are responsible for the transformations between dissolved and particulate matter were also avoided in the experiments but they are commonly reported in dwdss including the precipitation of inorganic matter and growth of biofilms nonetheless only inorganic suspended sediments were considered here while previous research has shown that organic matter comprises a significant fraction of discolouration materials carrière et al 2005 husband and boxall 2011 mussared et al 2019 the combination of organic and inorganic matter adds further complexity to the problem since organic matter particles can rapidly change their size and density due to smaller cohesion forces and heterogeneous composition organic matter can also attach to inorganic particles and can change their density have an impact on the drag force of the flow and improve their capability to adhere to a solid surface these important simplifications adopted here limits the direct applicability of the research findings but also highlights the complexity of the material accumulation phenomena in dwdss further research is required to properly address each one of these aspects while experiments under controlled conditions are recommended in order to differentiate the multiple processes under investigation 5 conclusion a series of experiments were performed to evaluate the interplay between the ssc and the fluid velocity in the process of particle deposition during the passage of a highly concentrated plume of particles it was found that the magnitude of the ssc influenced the formation of deposits and was directly proportional to the total deposited load in the pipe loop by contrast the fluid velocity was inversely proportional to the total deposited load but increasing the velocity from 0 07 m s 1 to 0 3 m s 1 produced a 6 reduction in the fraction of particles deposited on the pipe walls a similar change of 6 was also observed by analyzing the particle size data for the fraction of injected particles that reached the end of the pipe loop this suggests that the increase in velocity inhibited the deposition of particles in the size range of 4 6 μm to 6 8 μm in addition the fitting of a first order exponential decay model to the ssc data also showed that a particle size threshold pst divided the initial injected particles into two fractions i a fraction of deposited particles dp and ii a fraction of non deposited particles ndp and that only the concentration corresponded to the dp fraction decay along the plume passage the exponential decay coefficients increased with the fluid velocity but the fraction of dp decreased with an increase in fluid velocity due the fast deposition of the dp most of the particles were deposited in the initial sections of the pipe loop in contrast the observations of pipe wall samples with brightfield microscopy collected far away from the particle injection position revealed that small particles with a dominant particle size of 5 µm were able to attach to the pipe wall the experimental data suggests that the gravitational settling of particles might explain the fast deposition of dp fraction while the observations of particles on the pipe coupon samples might indicate that another particle attachment mechanism with substantially smaller deposition rate might also occur the presence of particle deposits from previous plumes had a negligible impact on the particle deposition rate and attachment in the initial pipe sections but considering the second mechanism the microscopy data suggested that at high fluid velocities there was little difference in particle deposition between plumes whereas at lower fluid velocities the particle deposition increased with each successive plume further studies are required to clarify the complete mechanics of the observed phenomena as well as to address several shortcomings and

19931,the inner walls of drinking water pipes are often expected to be clean and controlled surfaces to assure safe water access to the public however these surfaces are typically contaminated with particulate materials and biofilms that eventually degrade water quality while water utilities place significant efforts in identifying and flushing material deposits from compromised pipes the development of effective preventive strategies is still limited by the lack of knowledge about material accumulation processes the aim of this paper is to examine the interplay between suspended sediment concentration particle size and fluid velocity and the attachment of suspended iron oxide particles in pvc drinking water pipes for that purpose a series of short experiments were completed whereby water amended with a known concentration of selected and stable iron oxide particles was introduced in a full scale pipe loop laboratory over a short period of time and both turbidity and suspended sediment concentration ssc were measured at the inlet and outlet of the pipe loop results showed that a selected fraction of the injected particles with sizes above a specific threshold in the range of 4 6 to 6 8 µm had not reached the downstream section of the pipe loop but instead remained attached to the pipe walls in addition exponential decay of the ssc was observed to occur along the pipes and to cause most of the sediments to accumulate in the upstream section of the pipe loop the research improved our understanding of the physical processes of particulate material accumulation in dwdss and it will help water utilities forecast and monitor material accumulation and discolouration potential graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords discolouration suspended sediment concentration particle size iron oxides particle deposition 1 introduction the quality of finished drinking water is expected to deteriorate during its transport through pipes of drinking water distribution systems dwdss the accumulation of material deposits inside the pipes of a distribution network is often suggested as a major factor that contributes to water quality deterioration vreeburg and boxall 2007 material deposits can be resuspended and cause water to be discoloured husband and boxall 2011 seth et al 2004 and spur the growth of microorganisms and biofilms at the pipe wall lehtola et al 2004 vreeburg et al 2008 further contamination with viable microorganisms liu et al 2016 heavy metals liu et al 2017 and antimicrobial genes rilstone et al 2021 all have the potential to cause severe health implications despite this water utilities often lack the tools and methods to adequately assess the build up of material deposits in operational networks traditionally when water utilities suspect that a pipe section is harboring material deposits or contaminants that are degrading drinking water quality they resort to flushing to mobilize materials and clean the culprit sections in most cases flushing effectively removes materials in the short term but it does not prevent new materials from accumulating on the pipe wall flushing operations are expensive also consume a substantial amount of water and require the isolation of pipe sections and service interruptions to customers therefore strategies to slow the rate of material deposition on the wall of drinking water pipes in dwdss can reduce the human and physical resources needed for flushing operations and contribute to maintaining safe drinking water numerous studies have shown that particulate iron oxide is the dominant material that accumulates in dwdss lehtola et al 2004 seth et al 2004 evidence from flushing old cast iron ci pipe mains suggests that most of the iron oxide particles are sourced from the internal corrosion of ci pipe since these sections typically generate the highest mobilized load in a single flushing operation boxall and saul 2005 husband and boxall 2010 research also shows that loose iron oxide particles are continually transported from their source components to the downstream regions of a dwds husband et al 2014 while the apparent load of iron oxide particles in non metallic pipe sections is substantially smaller than that in their ci counterparts iron oxides are still the dominant constituent of mobilized materials in non metallic pipes seth et al 2004 nevertheless vreeburg et al 2008 also found that pipe sections with higher inorganic material deposits fostered the growth of organic matter on the pipe wall which suggests that material deposits enhance biofilm growth in the last two decades researchers have developed conceptual models to explain the mechanics of material deposit accumulation focusing on the relationship between turbidity and discolouration risk boxall et al 2003 and boxall and saul 2005 suggested the use of a turbidity potential to quantify the materials that can be mobilized at the pipe wall they proposed an empirical model named prediction of discoloration events in distribution systems podds that simulates material accumulation as material layers with shear strength conditioned by the wall shear stress wss of the flow at the pipe wall in a flushing simulation podds calculates the increase of the turbidity by comparing the wss to the shear strength of each material layer to determine which layer will be mobilized this concept has been validated by several field and laboratory studies boxall and saul 2005 cook and boxall 2011 husband and boxall 2010 later furnass et al 2014 reported the flaws of the podds regeneration module and suggested that material layers across all shear strengths may accumulate simultaneously and independently of the current wss of the flow furnass et al 2014 further suggested that this coefficient may change over time and its accurate determination still requires further investigation blokker and schaap 2015 also proposed the estimation of material deposition on the basis of turbidity at the upstream inlet of a water main they measured the turbidity equivalent mass in controlled sections located upstream of an operational network and compared it to the turbidity equivalent mass mobilized from flushing these sections ryan et al 2008 suggested that material deposition is comprised of two distinct mechanisms the first is based on the gravitational settling of particles and the second is based on the attachment of particles to the pipe wall here ryan et al 2008 developed a semi empirical approach to simulate the settling of particles adapted from a sewer sediment transport model that makes use of information about particle size particle specific density and flow for their system a threshold velocity of 0 2 m s 1 was found to prevent deposition while vreeburg and boxall 2007 proposed a pragmatic self cleaning velocity threshold of 0 4 m s 1 and blokker et al 2011 suggested a value between 0 2 0 25 m s 1 both these velocities are based on experimental data from operational dwdss later van summeren and blokker 2017 built upon the gravitational model from ryan et al 2008 by adding the concept of sediment bed load transport adapted from previous research on sediment transport in open channels the authors identified a range of possible scenarios and conditions for bed flow occurrence in dwdss but further experimental evidence is still required to confirm their model for the second mechanism ryan et al 2008 developed an empirical model named the particle sediment model psm that can estimate both the deposition and mobilization of particles to pipe walls in this model they assumed that particles can attach to the pipe walls of their experimental system through van der waals force the inclusion of a surface adhesion force in their model established a link to the build up of material layers with the specific shear strength included in the podds model ryan et al 2008 used a small pipe loop facility to maintain a suspension of particles at a velocity of 0 6 m s 1 for two hours before adjusting the pump settings to switch to a lower fluid velocity conditioning velocities in the range of 0 07 0 3 m s 1 were tested the results showed that the bulk water particle concentration decayed exponentially until a stable concentration was maintained in suspension dependent on the pipe material and on fluid velocity ryan et al 2008 suggested that a diffusion like mechanism based on a suspended solids concentration ssc threshold that is function of the fluid velocity governed whether particles would be 1 deposited on the pipe wall 2 stable or 3 resuspended from the pipe wall in this context boxall and saul 2005 showed that the average particle size of materials mobilized from flushing drinking water pipes was in the range of 10 µm and they suggested that in most water mains in operational networks turbulent conditions are enough to prevent gravitational settling of these particles in addition van thienen et al 2011 developed a theoretical model to explain the transport of suspended particles of different sizes under hydraulic conditions of dwdss but the model was not sufficient to explain the predominance of fine particles on samples from discoloured water despite the many advances made in understanding material deposition mechanisms several questions remain unanswered regarding how particles adhere to pipe walls and resist resuspension when subjected to wall shear stress current conceptual models do not explicitly include the particle size distribution and particle density the lack of knowledge about the dynamics of these variables limits the accuracy of models based on gravitational settling due to the strong dependence of particle size on fall velocities it also limits the accuracy of models that make use of a stable relationship between turbidity and suspended solids concentration ssc furthermore while cohesion is widely assumed to be related to biofilms it is unclear which forces contribute to holding inorganic particles on the wall in the absence of biofilms previous experiments completed in a full scale pvc pipe loop facility by braga and filion 2021 showed that fine iron oxide particle deposits were accumulated only on the pipe invert and that only a small fraction of particles were still held in suspension after a 30 day period where fluid velocity was held constant their results suggest that adhesion forces did not develop between particles and the pipe wall to hold them to the obvert or the springline positions of the pipe and that particles as small as 1 µm were able to settle onto the pipe invert and resist the wss of common operational velocities in dwdss these results were in stark contrast to previous research findings boxall and saul 2005 and demonstrate that further examination of the mechanisms behind the accumulation of sediment deposits is required this paper aims to examine the dynamics of acute particulate attachment on pipe walls sunny et al 2020 following the rapid release and travel of a concentrated plume of iron oxide particles immediately following a simulated discolouration event in controlled experiments completed in a full scale pvc pipe loop laboratory the specific objectives of the experiments were to 1 estimate the average rate of iron oxide particle deposition on pvc pipes immediately after the rapid release and during the passage of a highly concentrated plume of iron oxide particles that typifies discolouration events in real systems 2 determine whether previously deposited particles on the pipe wall from the passage of previous iron oxide particle plumes affect the average rate of iron oxide deposition and attachment to the pipe wall and 3 examine the specific mechanisms involved in the particle settling phenomenon for drinking water pipes and the effect of particle size distribution of sediments in suspension on the formation of material deposits on the pipe wall 2 methods the experimental work was realized in the drinking water distribution laboratory dwdl at queen s university using a full scale pipe loop rig that simulates the operation of drinking water mains the pipe laboratory system is comprised of a water tank with a volume of 3 6 m³ two variable speed centrifugal pumps and 11 loops of ipex blue brute pvc pipe class 235 dr18 with an internal diameter of 108 mm and a total length of 193 m fig 1 during the experiments the pipe loop system was operated in a non recirculatory manner where drinking water from the city of kington was continuously added to the tank pumped through the pipe system and discarded at the end the water from the city of kingston has a ph of 8 1 a hardness of 123 mg l 1 caco3 and an alkalinity of 92 mg l 1 caco3 and has approximately 1 7 mg l 1 of dissolved carbon and 1 0 mg l 1 of total nitrogen utilities kingston 2017 during the experiments the water temperature ranged between 12 c and 14 c in the experiments drinking water was amended with iron oxide particles of known particle size distribution at the inlet to the pipe loop to induce the formation of material deposits on the pipe walls a total of five experiments were performed with a variable concentration of suspended particles f1c1 f2c2 and f1c3 in table 1 and a variable conditioning flow rate f1c1 f2c1 and f3c1 in table 1 during all the experiments the pipe flow rate and turbidity were continuously monitored at a sampling frequency of 1 hz using two sierra innovasonic 205i ultrasonic flow meters 0 5 and two online hach tu5300sc turbidimeters 0 01 ntu fig 1 the turbidimeters were configured to monitor turbidity at the inlet 7 of the pipe length and outlet 98 of the pipe length fig 1 turbidity was measured from water continuously sampled from the centre of the pipe at a constant sampling flow rate only steady flow conditions were tested but due to the short duration of the experiments these flows can be interpreted as the highest daily peak flows of operational systems commonly used to determine the conditioning wss in systems with variable demands husband and boxall 2011 husband et al 2008 the conditioning stage of each experiment was divided in three independent sub stages p1 p2 and p3 where plumes of suspended particles were produced at the inlet of the pipe loop and completely transported through the pipe loop outlet before the introduction of the next plume in the next sub stage each plume was created by injecting a known volume of a concentrated solution of iron oxide particles csiop at the inlet of the pipe loop with a known ssc c c s i o p mg l 1 over an injection period equal to the time required for the water to travel 60 m downstream of the injection point given the prevailing flow rate q p i p e l s 1 in the pipe loop fig 1 the plume length of 60 m was mainly defined by a limitation of the maximum injection volume under stable mixing conditions in the csiop a new csiop was prepared for each plume by addinga known mass of iron oxide particles iop m i o p mg into a known drinking water volume v o l c s i o p l in a mixing baffled tank operated at a fixed mixing intensity fig 1 after the iop addition in the tank a period of 5 minutes was used to allow the particle suspension to stabilize in the mixing tank a diaphragm pump was used to pump water from the bottom of the csiop tank approximately 10 cm away from the tank walls from a position of intense mixing between two of the four vertical baffles and inject it at a constant flow at the inlet of the pipe loop at the centreline cross sectional position of the pipe fig 1 the final ssc of the csiop c c s i o p mg l 1 was measured immediately before after the stabilization period and immediately after the injection period by collecting grab samples from sampling tubing located in an equivalent position to the inlet of the diaphragm pump and with a similar flow rate as the diaphragm pump the injection flow rate q c s i o p l s 1 was measured during the injection period by monitoring the decrease of mass in the starting solution in the baffled mixing tank using a conventional scale fig 1 the ssc of the sediment plume generated from the mass injection at the start of the pipe loop c 0 mg l 1 was calculated using direct measurements from experimental variables through a mass balance relationship fig 1 and equation 1 1 c 0 q c s i o p c c s i o p q p i p e c c s i o p m i o p v o l c s i o p this method for estimating the initial ssc was preferred to a direct grab sample collection from the pipe loop immediately after the injection because a mixing length is required to achieve a suspension stability in the pipe therefore initial ssc in the pipes was estimated on the basis of a stable particle suspension in the csiop established after the stabilization period of 5 minutes during the short injection periods given the constant mixing intensity and small variation in the water level in the tank it is also reasonable to assume that the grab sample had an equivalent ssc to the csiop fraction injected in the pipe since the sample was collected from an equivalent location in the mixing tank which is expected to have a flow symmetry around the vertical rotation axis which produces similar particle suspension in both water intake regions cekinski et al 2010 the average of the ssc difference between csiop samples collected before and after the injection was 3 which suggests that no changes occurred during the injection period lastly the average uncertainty of the final ssc estimated at the pipe inlet was of 10 while the average uncertainty of the ssc from samples collected directly at the pipes presented in sequence was 5 during the experiments the three sequential injections with fixed conditions were designed to identify if the particle accumulation rate changed over successive plumes it was hypothesized that the particle accumulation rate of the 2nd and 3rd plumes might be affected by the presence of particles deposited on the pipe wall after the first plume the basis for this hypothesis is that the particles from the first plume might produce new features in the microscopic surface of the pvc pipe which might enhance the attachment of the new particles at the end of each injection period the steady flow conditions were maintained in the pipe loop for an additional period required to refresh the equivalent of 1 5 pipe loop volumes to guarantee that all suspended particles from the sediment plume had exited the pipe loop between each of the different experimental conditions tested the pipe system was cleaned at the highest flowrate 16 l s 1 and clean coupon pipe wall samples presented in sequence were added after the cleaning flush to re establish identical initial condition for all the experiments a chemical grade of red iron oxide powder from alpha chemicals with a composition of 82 of iron iii oxide fe2o3 was chosen as the source of particles for the experiments due their representativeness of iron oxide particles found in dwdss and their stable particulate form and insolubility in water the powder was sent to a commercial laboratory to split it into sub samples of 50 g with identical particle size distributions psd using a mini rotary splitter from retsch company model pt100 the psd of two sub samples picked at random was analyzed with a malvern mastersizer 3000 particle size analyzer laser diffraction in the preparation of the concentrated starting solution 1 to 3 sub samples were added to the csiop tank with a steady mixing rotation the insolubility of the particles and negligible amounts of dissolved iron in the local drinking water guaranteed that particles remained stable during the experiments following each injection grab samples were collected at the inlet and outlet sampling port locations fig 1 to determine ssc at those locations and to assess changes in the particles in suspension after the passage of each plume the collection of grab samples was synchronized with the fluid velocity in the pipe loop to collect 4 l of water from the centre of the passing sediment plume the ssc of the grab samples was determined using a dry weight method by filtering the sample volume with pre weighed 0 45 µm glass microfiber filters drying the filters at 105 c for 1 hour and weighing them again after drying with a precision scale additional grab samples were also collected from the csiop and from the outlet sampling port during the passage of the third plume in experiments f1c1 f2c1 and f3c1 to assess changes of the psd of the particles in suspension the psd of the grab samples was determined with the malvern mastersizer 3000 particle size analyzer a pipe wall coupon sampling system described in braga and filion 2021 was also used in the experiments to characterize the accumulation of material deposits at the pipe wall the system allows for the collection of representative pipe wall coupon samples from a coupon section located at 55 of the pipe loop length fig 1 the coupon samples consist of circular pvc disks that are inserted directly into custom pre drilled holes in the pvc pipe loop a precise surface alignment of the internal surface of the coupon with the surrounding pipe wall surface in the range of 0 1 mm guarantees that the coupon sample experiences the same hydrodynamic conditions as the remainder of the pvc pipe wall without disturbing the local velocity profile in the viscous sub layer region vsl coupon samples were acquired between the passage of each plume and analyzed using brightfield microscopy to visualize the deposits of iron oxide particles on the internal surface of the pvc pipe one hundred 100 field of views fov of each coupon sample were captured using the nikon eclipse ni e automated upright microscope in brightfield mode at a final magnification of 400x a previously developed matlab image processing script was used to calculate the percent coverage sediment and particle size analysis psa of material deposits detected on the pipe coupons braga and filion 2021 3 results 3 1 material deposition estimation fig 2 presents the turbidity measured at the inlet and outlet of the pipe loop against pipe loop volume turnover across the five experiments the outlet turbidity profiles deviate from an instantaneous square shape likely due to a non uniform velocity profile that caused some mechanical dispersion at the plume front and rear this is also noticeable for the inlet turbidity data in experiments f2c1 and f3c1 realized at higher velocities fig 2 turbidity values as high as 100 ntu were measured in experiment f1c3 similar turbidity values have been reported in operational dwdss during intense discolouration events but usually at higher flow rates husband and boxall 2010 fig 3 and table 2 show the detailed results of the particle load estimations for individual plumes of each experiment table 2 indicates the estimated values of the ssc and the total material load tml at the three control sections of the pipe loop 1 injection point l 0 m 2 inlet turbidity meter l 13 5 m and 3 outlet turbidity meter l 189 m a consistent decrease of ssc from the injection point to the outlet location demonstrates that a sizable fraction of the particles in suspension was deposited on the pipe walls of the system the total material load at the injection location tml0 g was calculated by multiplying the csiop c c s i o p mg l 1 by the injection flow rate q c s i o p l min 1 and the injection period for the case of the inlet and outlet locations the corresponding tmlin g and tmlout g were estimated based on both the turbidity and ssc grab sample data through a series of steps 1 the turbidity measurements ntu were converted to an equivalent ssc mg l 1 using a specific linear regression coefficient mg l 1 ntu 1 presented later in this paper 2 an instantaneous suspended sediment flux mg s 1 was calculated by multiplying the ssc mg l 1 by the flow rate l s 1 and 3 the tml g was calculated by integrating the material flux over the total time required for the plume to travel through the pipe loop the total deposited load tdl g was calculated by taking the difference between the total material load at the injection point tml0 g and the total material load at the outlet tmlout g fig 3 shows that large differences in tdl occurred between experiments performed at different concentrations f1c1 f1c2 and f1c3 while only small differences were found between experiments performed at different velocities f3c1 f2c1 and f1c1 systematic variations of the particle deposition rate and attachment were not observed along the three plumes of each experiment fig 3 suggesting that the presence of particle deposits from previous plumes had a negligible impact on particle deposition and attachment the secondary vertical axis right hand side of fig 3 shows that both an increase of concentration and fluid velocity produced an increase in the average deposition rate such increase was mainly caused by the shorter conditioning period of the experiments at higher velocities lastly table 2 also shows the fraction of the particles that were introduced in the pipe loop and were subsequently deposited onto the pipe walls tdl tml0 ranged from a minimum of a 69 2 in the f2c1 p1 experiment to a maximum of 76 3 in the f1c3 p1 experiment a number of regression relationships were developed to relate measured turbidity to measured ssc in the pipe loop the linear regression coefficients used to transform measured turbidity into ssc were obtained by performing a linear regression of the ssc measured from collected grab samples and their corresponding turbidity values fig 4 the linear regression coefficient values of 0 24 mg l 1 ntu 1 and 0 15 mg l 1 ntu 1 determined through regression analysis are smaller than those in the research literature that reported turbidity values exceeding 1 mg l 1 ntu 1 in flushing operations pourcel et al 2020 3 2 particle size analysis the paper also examined the impact of fluid velocity on the evolution of iron oxide particle size distribution in the experiments fig 5 plots the particle size distribution measured from samples collected at different experimental stages including 1 the initial iron oxide particles iop used to prepare the csiop 2 the suspended particles from the csiop mixing tank that were injected into the pipe loop and 3 the particles in suspension at the outlet of the pipe loop during the passage of the third sediment plume in experiments f1c1 p3 f2c1 p3 and f3c1 p3 where the fluid velocity was increased from 0 07 m s 1 to 0 3 m s 1 in the plots of fig 5 the volume density on the primary vertical axis left hand side denotes the percentage of the total particle volume for each particle size and the cumulative volume on the secondary vertical axis right hand side corresponds to the value of particle size below which a certain percentage of the sample lies the volume density curves show the predominant particle sizes of each distribution peak of curves and the particle size range of a sample the volume density curves in fig 5 have peaks that are below 10 µm which indicates a predominance of small particle sizes in all the experimental stages however a large upper range of particle sizes was found for the iop and csiop samples with particles as large as 100 µm while the particle size range at the outlet of the pipe loop was limited to 10 µm for the f1c1 experiment and 20 µm for the f2c1 and f3c1 experiments the cumulative volume curves in fig 5 show that the initial iop powder had a d80 80 of the particle volume is below a specific particle size of 60 μm and that this was reduced to 26 μm at the csiop mixing tank these results suggest that even with an intense level of mixing in the csiop baffled tank a large fraction of particles had settled out of solution in the mixing tank before they were introduced in the pipe loop during the passage of the sediment plumes in the pipes the particles in suspension at the injection point had a d80 of 26 μm while the particles in suspension at the outlet had a d80 of 4 6 μm in the f1c1 experiment velocity of 0 07 m s 1 6 2 μm in the f2c1 experiment velocity of 0 2 m s 1 and 6 8 μm in the f3c1 experiment velocity of 0 3 m s 1 the differences in the d80 between the injection point and the outlet of the pipe loop suggest that particles in the range of 4 6 μm 26 μm were deposited in the f1c1 experiment particles in the range of 6 2 μm 26 μm in the f2c1 experiment and particles in the range of 6 8 μm 26 μm in the f3c1 experiment therefore the lower limit of the sizes of the particles that are deposited establishes a particle size threshold particles with sizes larger than this threshold will be deposited on the pipes deposited particles dp while particles with sizes smaller than the threshold will be maintained in suspension non deposited particles ndp it is clear that the increase in fluid velocity raised the particle size threshold and kept larger particles in suspension as observed with the decrease of the dp fraction these findings are in agreement with the decrease in the deposited materials observed across experiments f2c1 and f3c1 where the fluid velocity was increased from 0 2 m s 1 to 0 3 m s 1 table 2 in addition using the csiop volume density curve of fig 5 it is possible to estimate the fraction of the injected particles that corresponds to a determined particle size range partial cumulative volume choosing a particle size range from 4 6 µm to 6 8 µm defined by the particle size threshold of the two experiments with the larger velocity difference f1c1 p3 and f3c1 p3 results in a csiop partial cumulative volume of 6 5 which represents the fraction of the injected particles csiop that were deposited in the experiment with the lower velocity f1c1 p3 but were kept in suspension in the experiment with the higher velocity f3c1 p3 in other words that is the fraction of the initial injected particles that changed between dp to ndp fractions as consequence of the increase in flow velocity from 0 07 m s 1 to 0 3 m s 1 by comparison the proportional reduction of the tdl table 2 between the experiments f1c1 p3 and f3c1 p3 was estimated to be 6 6 the close agreement between the two metrics estimated from different experimental measurements is strong evidence that the reduction of tdl between the experiments performed at fluid velocities 0 07 m s 1 and 0 3 m s 1 was caused by the non deposition of particles in the range of 4 6 µm to 6 8 µm 3 3 suspended sediment decay model the evolution of particle deposition along the length of the pipe loop was also examined fig 6 plots the ssc measured at the injection point the inlet and outlet of the pipe loop with their corresponding pipe length positions the ssc data points were found to conform to a first order exponential decay process which is indicated with solid lines in fig 6 the first order exponential decay model in equation 2 was used to characterize the decrease in ssc along the pipe length as particles are continuously deposited onto the pipe wall 2 c x c d p e k x v c n d p c 0 c d p c n d p where c x mg l 1 is the ssc measured at pipe length location x m c d p mg l 1 and c n d p mg l 1 are the dp and ndp components of the ssc measured at the injection point c 0 mg l 1 k s 1 is the decay coefficient and v m s 1 is the fluid velocity in the pipe loop the solid lines in fig 6 demonstrate that a stable ssc is established after the mid point of the pipe loop length which corresponds to the ndp component of the initial ssc cndp mg l 1 the ndp fraction does not contribute to the formation of material deposits and therefore sets a baseline for the ssc in each experiment the decay coefficient k which governs how fast the dp fraction of the initial ssc is deposited onto the pipe wall was found to increase across experiments f2c1 and f3c1 where the fluid velocity was increased to 0 2 m s 1 and 0 3 m s 1 fig 7 a the decay coefficient was found to be constant at 0 006 s 1 for the experiments f1c1 f1c2 and f1c3 where fluid velocity was held constant at 0 07 m s 1 fig 7b this suggests that a faster deposition occurred in the experiments with higher fluid velocities but a smaller dp fraction led to lower material loads nevertheless fig 6b shows that 80 of all settable material was deposited in the first 15 m of the pipe in the f1c1 experiment where the same fraction was deposited in the first 25 m of pipe in the f2c1 and f3c1 experiments 3 4 microscopy analysis brightfield microscopy was also used to characterize the occurrence of particle attachment on the pipe wall at a pipe section located relatively far from the injection point even though only a negligible fraction of dp particles was able to reach the coupon section located at pipe length of 106 m from the pipe loop inlet figs 1 and 6 a consistent number of iron oxide particle deposits were observed at the pipe invert pipe coupon samples from the obvert location were not analyzed in this study since previous research provided strong evidence that only negligeable quantities of particles accumulate at the pipe obvert braga and filion 2021 fig 8 indicates box and whisker plots for the percentage coverage area of iron oxide particles detected on the coupon samples across a total of 100 field of views fovs per coupon sample for each individual sediment plume the results in fig 8 indicate that the percentage coverage area was increased with the passage of each sediment plume in the low velocity experiments f1c1 f1c2 and f1c3 and that this increase in percent coverage was more noticeable with an increase in the injection concentration in contrast the percent coverage area for samples collected after the third plume in the high velocity experiments f2c1 and f3c1 was smaller than the percent coverage area observed in the low velocity experiments f1c1 f1c2 and f1c3 fig 8 furthermore no changes to the percent coverage area were detected between the consecutive sediment plumes p1 p2 and p3 for the high velocity experiments f2c1 and f3c1 while consistent increases in percent coverage area were detected in each plume for the low velocity experiments f1c1 f1c2 and f1c3 experiments f1c1 f1c2 and f1c3 performed with a fluid velocity of 0 07 m s 1 resulted in a deposition of larger particle sizes on the pipe coupons previous data from ssc samples and the psd analysis showed that particle sizes in the range of 4 6 µm to 26 µm are likely candidates to form deposits rather than their smaller sized counterparts that remain in suspension in comparison the smaller particle sizes found on the pipe coupon samples may indicate that a different mechanism of particle deposition occurred in the pipe the new deposition mechanism however only targets a very small fraction of the suspended particles whose sizes are compatible with the valleys and occlusions that make up the absolute roughness of the pvc pipe walls to confirm the hypothesis regarding the particle sizes of deposits found on the pipe wall samples an analysis of the particle size distribution of the microscopic images was also performed fig 9 plots particle coverage area as a function of particle size detected with brightfield microscopy after the passage of each sediment plume the data in fig 9c shows that as the injection concentration was increased from 20 mg l 1 f1c1 to 60 mg l 1 f1c3 the dominant particle size increased from 3 μm to 5 μm fig 9 also shows clearly that as the injection concentration was increased across experiments a substantial increase in particle coverage area was observed for all particle sizes ranging from 1 μm to 20 μm after the passage of the second and third plumes the particle coverage area for the f2c1 and f3c1 experiments remained below 50 μm² per particle size bin with a dominant particle size smaller than 5 μm 4 discussion the experimental results presented in this paper demonstrate that it is possible to quantify the total load of material deposits along a pipe section using turbidity data calibrated with ssc samples however the relationship between turbidity and ssc can change rapidly based on the psd of suspended sediments this means that regression coefficients should be determined for specific systems and particle properties large errors in the prediction of material deposition can be expected without an adequate assessment of regression coefficients to transform turbidity data into ssc in the experiments of this paper regression coefficients with a small numerical value seem to have been produced by the lower fluid velocities in comparison to the flush velocities previously used to assess these the experiments performed showed that suspended iron oxide particles as small as 4 6 μm can be rapidly deposited on the pipe wall under common operational conditions in drinking water systems the formation of material deposits was mostly affected by the ssc at the injection point and more specifically by the dp fraction of the initial ssc that was comprised of 69 to 75 of the total mass of particles injected into the pipe loop data also showed that 90 of the dp fraction were attached to the pipe wall along the first 40 m of pipe length in the loop while the deposition rate rapidly decreased along the length of the pipe according to a first order decay process increasing the fluid velocity from 0 07 m s 1 to 0 3 m s 1 0 3 m s 1 is often considered a self cleaning velocity blokker et al 2011 produced a decrease of the tdl of 6 and an increase of the particle size threshold that defines the dp and ndp fractions of the initial ssc while it is clear that increasing fluid velocity has an impact on the particle size threshold it is still unclear how small particle sizes in suspension are rapidly deposited onto the pipe walls under turbulent flow conditions boxall and saul 2005 previous research suggested multiple mechanisms that might explain how particles reach the pipe walls while in suspension in turbulent flow van thienen et al 2011 but their attachment mechanisms and origins of adhesion forces are still poorly understood the fact that material deposits on the pipe wall were formed by the larger particle fractions of the initial ssc and that the pst increased with fluid velocity suggests that the gravitational settling mechanism might be driving the particle deposition process this hypothesis is also supported by the fact that no noticeable quantity of particles was observed to accumulate and adhere to the pipe obvert in previous experiments braga and filion 2021 in this context it is possible that current methods used to forecast the settling of suspended particles might not be appropriate for drinking water pipes due to fundamental differences of particle attachment mechanisms that are still poorly understood therefore further research is required to 1 confirm the processes that govern the possible gravitational settling of small particles in drinking water systems and 2 gain a better understanding of the effect of particle adhesion to the pipe wall in these deposition processes in addition the smaller differences between f2c1 and f3c1 in comparison to f1c1 and f2c1 seem to indicate a tapering of particle attachment effects at higher velocities this seems to be caused by the decreasing pool of available suspended particles at larger particle sizes fig 5 peaks of particle size distribution in fig 5 shows that most of the particle mass is concentrated around 2 µm 3 µm while the analysis of the experimental data suggests that a particle size threshold assumed as the d80 in the curves increased from 4 6 µm to 6 8 µm with the fluid velocity therefore the mass of particles larger than the threshold rapidly decreased with the increase in the particle size threshold further increasing the flow rate would continuously increase the particle size threshold and reduce the dp fraction until the threshold reached the maximum particle size and particle deposition would stop altogether however the microscopy data collected at the pipe wall samples located at pipe length of 106 m which for the current experiments had a negligible mass in comparison to the injected ssc seems to suggest that a different wall attachment process operates on the particles in this case the microscopy data analysis suggested that increasing the fluid velocity decreased the accumulation rate of larger particles while only smaller particles were able to remain attached to the pipe wall the similarity in the percent coverage area between f2c1 and f3c1 suggests that particles may have occupied all remaining roughness valleys on the pipe wall available for the attachment of selected fine particles of compatible size and inhibited any additional attachment of particles to the pipe wall this might be indicative that the self cleaning velocity concept is effective in inhibiting this second attachment mechanism which has the potential to dominate the particle attachment process in operational dwdss where larger particles remain immobile due to low fluid velocities during normal flow conditions in addition to this the similarity in the percent coverage area between the three sediment plumes of the f2c1 and f3c1 experiments further suggests that all roughness valleys may have been occupied by particles after the first plume which may have inhibited any additional particle accumulation in the second and third plumes of these experiments 4 1 experimental limitations the experiments performed mimicked the acute loading of suspended particles from an upstream turbidity event sunny et al 2020 in a downstream pipe under more normal daily conditions the experiments used simplified steady state conditions while daily demand patterns are known to have an impact on material accumulation husband et al 2008 these experiments were arguably performed under the highest daily peak flow which was greater than the self cleaning velocities blokker et al 2011 despite this particle accumulation was strongly evident it is also important to highlight that the acute and rapid process of particle attachment to the pipe wall only represents a fraction of the material accumulation processes that occur inside dwdss the experiments made use of relative new pvc pipes free of biofilms in operational systems pipe materials have undergone changes and are populated with biofilm layers which likely play a role in the attachment dynamics of suspended particles a single pipe diameter was tested in the experiments whereas operational dwdss have a large range of pipe diameters it is expected that the pipe diameter effects mostly translate to impacts on fluid velocity and turbulence structures another key simplification consisted of the use of suspended particles with a stable density which greatly facilitated the analysis of particle size distributions both particle size and density are key to determine particle transport in suspension by turbulent flows guha 2008 in the case of operational dwdss such analysis is more challenging since a large range of particle types with multiple densities are expected from pipe wall material deposits additional biochemical processes that are responsible for the transformations between dissolved and particulate matter were also avoided in the experiments but they are commonly reported in dwdss including the precipitation of inorganic matter and growth of biofilms nonetheless only inorganic suspended sediments were considered here while previous research has shown that organic matter comprises a significant fraction of discolouration materials carrière et al 2005 husband and boxall 2011 mussared et al 2019 the combination of organic and inorganic matter adds further complexity to the problem since organic matter particles can rapidly change their size and density due to smaller cohesion forces and heterogeneous composition organic matter can also attach to inorganic particles and can change their density have an impact on the drag force of the flow and improve their capability to adhere to a solid surface these important simplifications adopted here limits the direct applicability of the research findings but also highlights the complexity of the material accumulation phenomena in dwdss further research is required to properly address each one of these aspects while experiments under controlled conditions are recommended in order to differentiate the multiple processes under investigation 5 conclusion a series of experiments were performed to evaluate the interplay between the ssc and the fluid velocity in the process of particle deposition during the passage of a highly concentrated plume of particles it was found that the magnitude of the ssc influenced the formation of deposits and was directly proportional to the total deposited load in the pipe loop by contrast the fluid velocity was inversely proportional to the total deposited load but increasing the velocity from 0 07 m s 1 to 0 3 m s 1 produced a 6 reduction in the fraction of particles deposited on the pipe walls a similar change of 6 was also observed by analyzing the particle size data for the fraction of injected particles that reached the end of the pipe loop this suggests that the increase in velocity inhibited the deposition of particles in the size range of 4 6 μm to 6 8 μm in addition the fitting of a first order exponential decay model to the ssc data also showed that a particle size threshold pst divided the initial injected particles into two fractions i a fraction of deposited particles dp and ii a fraction of non deposited particles ndp and that only the concentration corresponded to the dp fraction decay along the plume passage the exponential decay coefficients increased with the fluid velocity but the fraction of dp decreased with an increase in fluid velocity due the fast deposition of the dp most of the particles were deposited in the initial sections of the pipe loop in contrast the observations of pipe wall samples with brightfield microscopy collected far away from the particle injection position revealed that small particles with a dominant particle size of 5 µm were able to attach to the pipe wall the experimental data suggests that the gravitational settling of particles might explain the fast deposition of dp fraction while the observations of particles on the pipe coupon samples might indicate that another particle attachment mechanism with substantially smaller deposition rate might also occur the presence of particle deposits from previous plumes had a negligible impact on the particle deposition rate and attachment in the initial pipe sections but considering the second mechanism the microscopy data suggested that at high fluid velocities there was little difference in particle deposition between plumes whereas at lower fluid velocities the

19932,changes in climate season and vegetation can alter organic export from watersheds while an accepted tradeoff to protect public health disinfection processes during drinking water treatment can adversely react with organic compounds to form disinfection byproducts dbps by extension dbp monitoring can yield insights into hydrobiogeochemical dynamics within watersheds and their implications for water resource management in this study we analyzed temporal trends from a water treatment facility that sources water from coal creek in crested butte colorado these trends revealed a long term increase in haloacetic acid and trihalomethane formation over the period of 2005 2020 disproportionate export of dissolved organic carbon and formation of dbps that exceeded maximum contaminant levels were consistently recorded in association with late spring freshet synoptic sampling of the creek in 2020 and 2021 identified a biogeochemical hotspot for organic carbon export in the upper domain of the watershed that contained a prominent fulvic acid like fluorescent signature dbp formation potential analyses from this domain yielded similar ratios of regulated dbp classes to those formed at the drinking water facility spectrometric qualitative analyses of pre and post reacted waters with hypochlorite indicated lignin like and condensed hydrocarbon like molecules were the major reactive chemical classes during chlorine based disinfection this study demonstrates how drinking water quality archives combined with synoptic sampling and targeted analyses can be used to identify and understand export control points for dissolved organic matter this approach could be applied to identify and characterize analogous watersheds where seasonal or climate associated organic matter

byproducts organic matter watershed water treatment water quality 1 introduction environmental fluctuations associated with weather season climate change and acute disruptive events can have a pronounced influence on watershed biogeochemical processes for instance drought and insect induced tree mortality can increase organic inputs to surface water sources and alter soil chemistry kramer and chadwick 2018 mikkelson et al 2013 warmer temperatures can increase decomposition rates of available soil organic matter om freeman et al 2001 and soil freeze thaw cycles have been associated with increased release by disrupting om aggregates plant roots and lysing microbial cells tiwari et al 2019 during precipitation events these variables can lead to a higher flux of aqueous om ågren et al 2010 which can impact downstream water quality with an estimated 74 of water used in the united states sourced from surface waters biogeochemical shifts could have large scale impacts on downstream communities dieter et al 2018 water professionals are faced with the task of adapting treatment processes as source water chemistry and regulatory requirements change higher concentrations of om specifically pose challenges during chemical disinfection which is used at 70 of municipal treatment facilities within the united states awwa 2018 while an efficient method to inactivate pathogens ancillary reactions with aqueous om can lead to the creation of carcinogenic disinfection byproducts dbps richardson and plewa 2020 villanueva et al 2015 more than 700 dbps have been identified and eleven four trihalomethanes five haloacetic acids bromate and chlorite are currently regulated in the united states richardson and plewa 2020 with the disinfectants and disinfection byproducts rules enacted by the epa in 1998 and 2006 water systems adding disinfectant during treatment must comply with the established maximum contaminant levels mcl in addition distribution systems serving a population greater than 500 must conduct quarterly sampling for total trihalomethanes tthm and haloacetic acids haa5 to achieve regulatory compliance u s epa 2010 the presence of dbps is a prominent concern for municipal treatment facilities awwa 2020 but formation can be mitigated through a variety of approaches that target additional removal of dissolved organic carbon or with the adoption of alternative disinfection processes while prior studies have focused on dbp reduction by changing conventional unit processes during drinking water treatment andersson et al 2020 postigo et al 2021 zhang et al 2021 those methods present an additional economic and infrastructure burden that can be particularly pronounced for smaller facilities in addition disinfection methods that use alternatives to chlorine can form other less understood byproducts richardson and plewa 2020 as om is a complex constituent by nature screening typically focuses on total organic carbon concentrations normalization to specific uv absorbance as an indicator of reactivity and oxygen demand as an indicator of bioavailable organics u s epa 2005 these approaches however do not capture structural properties of om which are important indicators for dbp formation and can vary across watershed landscapes yamashita et al 2011 further these approaches do not capture contributions from specific structural properties that could mechanistically inform mitigation strategies for dbp formation during water treatment and proactive management of watershed source zones in this study we focused on the coal creek subalpine watershed in colorado to find localities within the landscape and temporal periods that contribute disproportionately toward higher aqueous om flux and dbps formed during drinking water treatment the terms biogeochemical hot spots and hot moments have been used in association with disproportionality high and localized export over short periods respectively to understand the episodic release of mobilized om mcclain et al 2003 these concepts have evolved to more succinctly describe the spatiotemporal release of organics as export control points which are defined as areas where high rates of reactants are exported into receiving streams during hydrologic events bernhardt et al 2017 we hypothesized that an export control point for om could be identified within this small 53 km2 headwater mountain catchment we further theorized that this understanding could be used to reveal reactive chemical classes that link to dbp formation during drinking water treatment to address these research goals we used historical records of drinking water dbp monitoring to assess drivers of a hot moment combined with synoptic stream sampling to identify the source hot spot and quality of om release dissolved om dom in the waters sourced from this export control point was further characterized to better understand specific properties associated with dbp formation 2 methods and materials 2 1 watershed attributes sampling the coal creek watershed is the primary water source for the town of crested butte co and serves a population of approximately 2500 cdphe 2021a the total drainage is 53 km2 with several tributaries that descend a variety of land covers zhi et al 2019 the total watershed land cover consists of 64 evergreen forest 20 herbaceous

ir 00 from a portion of the lake diverted as a trans basin diversion drinking water is diverted from the creek approximately 10 5 km downstream from lake irwin near site coal 11 vaughter 2013 hence this sampling location served as the most representative proxy for influent water before treatment fig s1 the watershed has established sampling locations from prior studies blazewicz et al 2012 ccwc 2018 vaughter 2017 three locations approximately equidistant from the lake to the water diversion cc 5 coal 20 and coal 11 were selected for targeted analyses in 2020 and 2021 that integrated fticr ms and dbp fp analyses as described below these targeted sampling events were conducted in july and october 2020 to align with routine quarter 3 and quarter 4 monitoring by the drinking water facility and june 2021 to align with synoptic sampling table s2 higher resolution synoptic sampling was conducted two days after peak flow on june 8th 2021 and during falling limb flow on july 28th 2021 to better constrain the hot spot region the samples were collected every 1 km or less along the transect beginning at the lake irwin outlet and ending at the lower end of the transect with major

caruso et al 2020 in brief a 12 tesla bruker solarix fourier transform ion cyclotron mass spectrometer bruker solarix billerica ma usa located at the environmental molecular sciences laboratory in richland wa was used to collect mass spectra of the pre and post chlorinated transect samples the fticr ms was equipped with a standard electrospray ionization esi source and data were acquired in negative mode with an ion accumulation time of 0 08 and 0 1 peaks were aligned 0 5 ppm threshold and chemical formulas were assigned using formularity tolić et al 2017 the compound identification algorithm in formularity considered the presence of c h o n s and p and excluded other elements it is important to note that fticr ms provides a non targeted approach to reliably identify molecular formulas of organic molecules with masses between 200 and 900 m z however it is not quantitative and does not provide information about the structure of the molecular formulas identified final data analysis and plots were conducted in r studio version 3 5 2 following the methods outlined in garayburu caruso et al 2020 the r package ftmsranalysis bramer et al 2020 was used to remove peaks outside

for optimal fp of each sample during a seven day reaction period apha 2017 in brief reagent grade 4 00 4 99 sodium hypochlorite and deionized water were used to prepare a stock hypochlorite solution a diphosphate buffer 1 m ph 7 and ascorbic acid 25 g l quenching solution were prepared amber vials were used for all reactions and pretreated with sodium hypochlorite stock solution filled headspace free for 24 h u s epa 2019 based on the doc results for each sample chlorine dose volumes were calculated to achieve chlorine doc mass ratios of 1 3 5 7 and 10 each filtered sample was added to 5 40 ml vials and buffered to 10 mm the determined hypochlorite stock solution volume was dosed into one of the five vials for each ratio headspace free vials were reacted in the dark for seven days at room temperature after which the residual chlorine concentration was measured using a hach chlorine free total colorimetric test kit to determine which chlorine doc mass ratio achieved a residual chlorine concentration of 3 5 mg l after this dose was determined bulk samples were filtered in 2 250 ml amber bottles buffered dosed with hypochlorite stock solution and filled headspace free after a seven day reaction time in the dark one of the 250 ml reacted vials for each sample was filtered at 0 22 µm and preserved with 85 phosphoric acid for fticr ms analysis as described in section 2 2 the second reacted 250 ml vial was quenched to achieve a concentration of 33 mg l ascorbic acid and acidified with 5 v v sulfuric acid to reach a ph of 3 7 the dbp samples were stored headspace free at 4 c and shipped overnight on ice to stanford university where the dbps were extracted according to epa methods 551 1 u s epa 1995 and 552 3 u s epa 2003 and analyzed using gas chromatography mass spectrometry as described previously chuang et al 2019 a suite of known dbp compounds was analyzed including thms chloroform bromodichloromethane dibromochloromethane bromoform the 5 regulated haas dibromoacetic acid dichloroacetic acid bromoacetic acid chloroacetic acid trichloroacetic acid additional haas bromochloroacetic acid bromodichloroacetic acid chlorodibromoacetic acid idoacetic acid tribromoacetic acid haloacetonitriles haloacetaldehydes iodinated trihalomethanes chloropicrin and haloketones 2 4 historical data access analysis historical dbp data were analyzed from 2005 to 2020 to understand seasonal and decadal trends at the water treatment facility of crested butte the dbp data is regularly reported by the crested butte drinking water treatment facility and was obtained from the colorado department of public health and environment cdphe drinking water compliance database cdphe 2021a dbp concentrations were available at annual quarterly intervals for total trihalomethanes tthm and the five regulated haloacetic acids haa5 in addition to the individual compounds that makes up each group linear trend lines for tthm and haa5 were fitted with the raw data using the ordinary least square regression fits in tableau version 2020 4 to account for seasonality the data were additionally separated by annual quarterly reporting dates for linear trend line analysis across each quarter p values less than 0 05 were considered significant historical coal creek daily hydrograph data was obtained from the u s geological survey usgs database for site number 09111250 coal creek abv mccormick ditch 38 872 n 106 985 w elevation 2700 m the hydrograph data was available starting in october 2014 which allowed for comparative analyses with the historical dbp data from 2015 to 2020 historic doc concentrations near the drinking water diversion at coal 11 fig s1 from 2016 to 2020 have been previously published zhi et al 2019 time series using the 2015 2020 flow rates and 2016 2020 doc concentrations were plotted in r studio version 3 5 2 pearson correlations were determined between the historical dbp concentrations and doc as well as dbps and flow in r studio and plotted in tableau version 2020 4 a p value less than 0 05 was considered significant for all linear fits and correlations finally daily doc mass loadings were determined with the historical hydrograph and doc data by multiplying the doc concentrations in mg l by flow in m3 s with each associated date and appropriate unit conversions to return units of kg day these daily calculations were used to determine monthly averages for each year 3 results and discussion 3 1 seasonal and decadal trends in dbps during drinking water treatment disinfection byproducts form when chlorine or other oxidants react with organic matter in water as a result trends in dbp concentrations can reflect carbon mobilization in the source water with implications for community health brouillard et al 2016 mikkelson et al 2013 the historical dbp concentrations from the crested butte treatment facility served to discern trends of source water reactivity with chlorine based disinfection while the temporal resolution of this dataset was confined to four samples per year seasonal trends of haa5 and tthm concentrations from 2005 to 2020 revealed repeated annual peaks in dbp concentrations after spring snowmelt fig 1 a over the past fifteen years the observed peak values frequently exceeded the maximum contaminant levels mcls of 80 and 60 μg l for tthm and haa5 respectively interestingly these higher concentrations were regularly associated with the third quarter of annual sampling q3 in july fig 1b while the crested butte drinking water treatment facility is in regulatory compliance with annual averages below mcls u s epa 2010 the trends and concentrations are alarming of the individual byproducts measured in the past five years the regulated total haa5s were dominated by dichloroacetic 42 3 and trichloroacetic 55 4 acids while tthms were dominated by chloroform 85 9 fig s2 based on the long term trends of haa5 and tthm concentrations at the treatment facility it appears that coal creek hosts a seasonal and reproducible hot moment for dbp formation trending toward higher future concentrations fig 1 specifically fitted linear trends using ordinary least squares regression returned significant increases p 0 04 r2 0 1 in haa5 concentrations however an analogous increase in tthm lacked this significance threshold p 0 1 quarterly trends further revealed that q3 typically sampled in july and to some degree q4 typically sampled in october are driving the temporal increases fig 1b these trends could be associated with watershed stress associated with climate change supported by previous studies in analogous forested ecosystems that experienced heightened tree mortality that correlated with increased dbps at drinking water facilities brouillard et al 2016 mikkelson et al 2013 in addition tthm and haa5 formation could be linked with the ambient temperature of the environment as demonstrated in a study that modeled future climate related trends in dbps and revealed a 1 8 c increase in mean summer temperatures could lead to a 39 increase in tthms in scotland valdivia garcia et al 2019 we were unable to directly associate the water treatment facility dbp concentrations with influent organic carbon or temperature in this study however the crested butte region has experienced recent shifts in fewer total days of minimum air temperatures less than 0 c and above average total maximum air temperatures greater than 20 c table s1 3 2 hydrochemical associations the quantity and structure of natural om present in source waters are also precursors to dbp formation during treatment as a result the historical hydrograph and coal 11 doc concentrations were used for targeted analysis to understand the relationships between stream hydrochemistry and dbp concentrations after treatment over the past five years the reported tthm and haa5 concentrations have consistently exceeded the epa mcls during q3 sampling while low in temporal resolution these seasonal peaks in dbps overlap with peak flow and doc concentrations fig 2 in the past five years peak flow has occurred near june 1st 13 days at 7 3 m3 s while peak doc has occurred near june 5th 16 days at 11 7 mg l by extension haa5 concentrations correlated with both stream doc p 0 001 and flowrates p 0 02 while tthm concentrations correlated with doc p 0 03 fig s3 consequently this hot moment for dbp formation in crested butte extends to doc mobilization and flow in association with the q3 season of increased seasonal temperatures and snowmelt this observed temporal window is relatively brief but responsible for the majority of doc export from the watershed each year with an average 78 10 of doc mobilized in may june from 2015 to 2020 this aligns with a previous study across 30 forested watersheds wherein up to 86 of total doc was exported during seasonal events associated with increased discharge and water temperatures raymond and saiers 2010 it is noted that the hydrograph data in this present study ends in october due to regularly frozen surface conditions that persist from november may fig s4 despite these missing data comparatively low doc concentrations were observed during the colder months of november march of 2016 2020 in contrast to the warmer months of april october by extension we assumed lower doc mass loading occurs during the winter months as a result of lower flow and doc this assumption is supported by a recent study that concluded higher temperatures are a major driver of doc concentrations with release influenced by high flow during wet conditions wen et al 2020 the interplay between seasonal drivers of doc export and temperature on reaction rates suggests that climate shifts could have a significant role in dbp formation specifically enhanced doc export has been associated with event controlling snowmelt and storm events across a variety of watersheds including mountain and forested catchments mcknight et al 2001 raymond and saiers 2010 high latitude watersheds finlay et al 2006 and agriculture dominated watersheds qiao et al 2017 doc concentrations and lability e g sugar and protein content easily consumed by microbes have been shown to positively correlate with frost duration in upper soil horizons of riparian zones exposed to frost haei et al 2011 in addition peatland studies have associated increased doc and humic acid like organics with more frost free days eskelinen et al 2016 and higher temperatures fenner et al 2007 these findings provide a possible explanation for the increasing trend in dbp concentrations over the past fifteen years that inversely mirror significant decreasing trends in total ice and frost days in crested butte fig s5 and could contribute to higher doc availability for release during spring snowmelt hence cumulative climate shifts can impact downstream doc concentrations and reactivity during drinking water treatment however dbp formation is also dependent on the treatment processes which can change with time andersson et al 2019 specific to this study the crested butte water treatment facility involves a relatively simple system with few publicly reported modifications none of which include changes to the chlorination process cdphe 2021b a holding pond provides storage for surface water flows coal creek is the primary water source for the town and a secondary intake from wildcat creek fig s1 is used for emergencies stantec 2005 from the holding pond incoming water is dosed with potassium permanganate to mitigate metal contamination from legacy mining operations in the watershed this pretreatment is followed by microfiltration and sodium hydroxide dosing for ph and alkalinity adjustments calcium hypochlorite is added for pathogen disinfection and flows through clear wells and storage tanks to achieve a targeted disinfection contact time this likely is also the stage most directly involved in the formation of disinfection byproducts when chlorine reacts with the remaining doc in the system broader studies have assessed a variety of water treatment facilities for associated processes that can impact dbp formation however a recent study determined despite differences in treatment across water distribution systems in scotland water conditions were significant predictors with the ambient temperature of the environment as the primary determinant of tthm and haa5 and concentrations of doc as a secondary determinant valdivia garcia et al 2016 additionally treatment related variables of reaction time and ph have a significant influence on dbp formation doederer et al 2014 water treatment potentially represents a confounding variable in observed dbp trends therefore synoptic and discrete sampling was conducted along the coal creek transect to better understand water properties before treatment 3 3 synoptic sampling to identify regions of enhanced export to evaluate whether a particular region was disproportionately responsible for reactive organic export a synoptic sampling campaign was conducted two days after peak flow on june 8th 2021 synoptic sampling focused on uv254 and doc concentrations which are strong indicators of haa5 and tthm formation potential brouillard et al 2016 golea et al 2017 correlations of these indicators with dbp formation potential in coal creek are investigated further in the next section as depicted in fig 3 indicator values peaked in the upper reach of the coal creek transect near the ohio fork in proximity to an extensive riparian wetland area with beaver activity as evidenced by dams indicator values began to decrease after this point fig 3a table s3 samples from downstream tributaries returned comparatively low values suggesting that dilution possibly in combination with transformation processes were responsible for this decrease a second synoptic sampling campaign was conducted on july 28th 2021 at lower flows and doc concentrations to target tributaries within the identified higher export region similar to the peak flow transect uv254 measurements returned higher values along the ohio fork red text in fig 3a orange points in fig 3b from the southern section of the basin and downstream to cc 8 in addition a tributary sourced from a peat like wetland in the northern region of the basin spg3 red point and text in fig 3b returned the highest uv254 values observed in our study this suggests that drainages on both sides of this reach may be contributing to organic loading fig 3b table s4 flow measurements conducted during the falling limb in 2021 upstream of the fork at coal 30 0 014 m3 s and downstream at cc 6 0 031 m3 s revealed that the ohio fork provides approximately 30 50 of headwater flow to coal creek with a margin of error depending on season the extent of water diversions from lake irwin to the total discharge and groundwater flow the northern spg3 tributary consisted of lower flow that was too modest for flowmeter measurements the identification of this export control region for organic matter sets a foundation for a more detailed inquiry into ecosystem contributions that are beyond the scope of our current study land cover is an important variable in understanding watershed inputs as aboveground litter can influence dbp formation and different plant litter leachates can produce comparatively different dbp profiles franklin et al 2021 the ohio fork is sourced from the southwest section of the watershed and is primarily composed of spruce fir forests that have experienced a degree of spruce beetle impact this is in contrast to the tributaries draining from the north side which are more dominated by grasslands with peat like wetlands near spg3 alexander and brown 2009 nlcd 2011 disruptive events such as insect induced tree mortality and fires have been associated with changes to soil doc and increased dbp formation downstream brouillard et al 2016 mikkelson et al 2013 olivares et al 2021 uzun et al 2020 peatlands have been associated with higher doc and aromaticity during summer rewetting events and past studies that have explored catchments dominated by forests and wetlands revealed a link between late season drought and increased doc concentrations chen et al 2020 tiwari et al 2019 snowmelt dynamics add further complexity where elevation and slope can impact runoff and soil moisture ryan et al 2007 and the timing of snowmelt across local climates can impact porewater doc in association with litter decomposition leonard et al 2021 3 4 formation potential of disinfection byproducts in coal creek we expanded our inquiry to connect this ecosystem control point to dissolved organic carbon doc reactivity correlative analyses of tthm and haa5 formation potential from the creek samples revealed significant relationships with associated doc and uv254 values fig s6 table s5 while these measurements are regularly used in water treatment plant monitoring this lends credence to the application of comparatively rapid and cost effective screening using uv254 during synoptic watershed sampling as depicted in fig 3 specific uv absorbance suva significantly correlated with dbp fp as well but with lower r2 values in contrast to doc and uv254 this is consistent with prior investigations in colorado forested watersheds and treatment facilities beauchamp et al 2018 brouillard et al 2016 the upstream peak dbp fp concentrations quantified in this study in june 2021 tables s3 s4 have implications for understanding total dbp during drinking water treatment when combined with flow and doc monitoring as depicted in fig 2 specifically annual sampling conducted by the crested butte treatment facility in early july was almost one month after peak doc june 5th 16 days hence this quarterly sampling benchmark in early july misses the true peak in dbp concentrations by design dbp formation potential dbp fp determines all reactive components within a sample this complete reaction differs from water treatment practice where facilities typically dose disinfectant to achieve two log inactivation of pathogens likely resulting in lower dbp concentrations while limited to haa5 and tthm the comparison of quarterly drinking water reports for summer and fall 2020 with temporally aligned sample collections reacted for dbp fp revealed similar types and fractions of this subset this was characterized by a dominance of the thms chloroform and bromodichloromethane and the haas dichloroacetic acid and trichloroacetic acid fig 4 the suite of additional dbp fp compounds analyzed were either not detected or comprised 1 or less of the total dbp concentrations measured with the exception of chloral hydrate in the haloacetaldehydes hals class detected at an average of 5 9 of the total fig s2b while hals are not regulated and could not be compared to the historical data correlative analyses were conducted and revealed analogous correlations with doc and uv254 fig s6 although unregulated dbp classes e g haloacetaldehydes and haloacetonitriles occur at lower concentrations than regulated thms and haas they can contribute more to the cytotoxicity associated with disinfection byproducts than regulated thms and haas in conventional drinking waters lau et al 2020 this lends further credence to the application of uv254 screening during synoptic watershed sampling to understand potential dbp formation during drinking water treatment dbp fp concentrations can be found in table s5 and the research data 3 5 reactivity of dom functional groups during disinfection a suite of spectroscopic and spectrometric tools was used to understand the reactive components of coal creek water leading to dbp formation uv254 measurements reflected significant correlations that served as a proxy for dbp formation in coal creek further eem spectra indicated the organic compounds present in the creek are mainly sourced from fulvic acid like organic inputs with a prominent peak associated with terrestrial sourced om excitation 240 250 nm emission 381 580 nm chen et al 2003 xue et al 2017 this peak was greatest in the identified hot spot region with reduced peaks downstream fig 5 while spectra were observed in the humic acid like region the humification index did not correlate with haa5 and tthm formation potential p 0 5 0 4 in contrast to the fluorescence index p 0 03 0 01 fig s6 these correlations agree with the peak analysis in which the fluorescence index has been used to characterize aqueous fulvic acid sources mcknight et al 2001 fticr ms results of pre and post hypochlorite dosed water provided additional insight into the reactive chemical classes within coal creek before and after the reaction with chlorine while not quantitative the analysis of fticr data from spatial and temporal samples together was used to statistically identify changes in om chemical classes associated with chlorination the chemical classes present in pre and post chlorinated samples revealed that the relative counts of lignin like tannin like and condensed hydrocarbon like classes decreased after reaction with hypochlorite as highlighted in van krevelen diagrams figs 6 and s7 lignin like molecules comprised the largest relative counts of chemical classes in coal creek samples before chlorination and significantly decreased p 0 009 by 28 13 after chlorination significant decreases 55 25 were also observed for condensed hydrocarbon hc like molecules after chlorination p 0 004 fig 7 a similar trend where tannin like relative counts also decreased lacked significance other analyzed classes amino sugar like protein like etc either did not significantly change or increased in relative counts with the addition of chlorine in contrast to the pre chlorination samples fig s8 the reactive chemical classes reduced in average relative counts after chlorination have been linked to the formation of dbp compounds previously specifically higher trichloroacetic acid formation has been associated with lignin phenols while chloroform with humic and fulvic acids hua et al 2014 further lignin phenols have been highlighted as important precursors to the unregulated class of haloacetaldehydes chuang et al 2015 a more recent study further corroborates these findings from drinking source waters in spain in which lignin was deemed a major component of natural surface waters and most reactive after chlorination along with condensed hydrocarbons the complexity of these reactions was also highlighted as the authors observed increases in certain lignin signals sanchís et al 2020 further given the presence of lignin content in evergreen needles leonard et al 2020 the spruce forest landcover could be a contributing source of lignin from the ohio fork while not investigated further herein this or other landcover contributions within the identified domain could provide clues toward reactive organic matter sources in similar watersheds 4 conclusions and implications we present an approach that combines historical dbp drinking water quality archives synoptic sampling and targeted spectroscopic characterizations of pre and post chlorinated creek samples to better understand a temporally and spatially dynamic watershed that harbors a pronounced om export control point hydrographs were used to inform synoptic sampling and identify a hot spot region in coal creek that exhibits seasonal temporal and spatial trends for increased om export targeted spectroscopic analyses contrasting chlorine reacted and unreacted waters revealed that lignin like and condensed hydrocarbon like classes reacted most strongly these classes likely contributed to heightened dbp formation during drinking water treatment and provide potential clues to identify watershed sources of reactive organic matter that may inform subsequent hydrobiogeochemical and drinking water treatment studies this study highlights an opportunity for more effective water management coupled with treatment that includes comprehensive monitoring plans from the source to tap due to the repeatability of the hot moments associated with seasonal hydrologic processes recurrent high dbp concentrations can be proactively addressed and peaks more precisely identified should these variables shift with climate change as suggested by our limited 15 year data set certain hot moments could become hotter from increased organic release to surface waters during climate induced stress mcdaniel et al 2014 suggesting this type of analysis could serve as a predictive tool to mitigate risk possible solutions include alternative disinfection methods such as uv irradiation and more aggressive toc attenuation through processes such as coagulation activated carbon biofiltration or nanofiltration alternatively dbps can be removed after formation with membrane filtration air stripping or granular activated carbon zazouli and kalankesh 2017 such technologies could be implemented during periods with the highest risk for formation however solutions beyond treatment should also be explored as these technological upgrades are not always economical for smaller treatment facilities such as crested butte in this case a more precise understanding of the temporal and spatial drivers of export peaks could be integrated into solutions such as temporary sourcing from a secondary water supply such as wildcat creek during the peak discharge window our findings more broadly reveal how seasonal and climate induced changes in hydrobiogeochemical processes have implications for human health and well being providing an opportunity for a proactive and holistic strategy that

19932,changes in climate season and vegetation can alter organic export from watersheds while an accepted tradeoff to protect public health disinfection processes during drinking water treatment can adversely react with organic compounds to form disinfection byproducts dbps by extension dbp monitoring can yield insights into hydrobiogeochemical dynamics within watersheds and their implications for water resource management in this study we analyzed temporal trends from a water treatment facility that sources water from coal creek in crested butte colorado these trends revealed a long term increase in haloacetic acid and trihalomethane formation over the period of 2005 2020 disproportionate export of dissolved organic carbon and formation of dbps that exceeded maximum contaminant levels were consistently recorded in association with late spring freshet synoptic sampling of the creek in 2020 and 2021 identified a biogeochemical hotspot for organic carbon export in the upper domain of the watershed that contained a prominent fulvic acid like fluorescent signature dbp formation potential analyses from this domain yielded similar ratios of regulated dbp classes to those formed at the drinking water facility spectrometric qualitative analyses of pre and post reacted waters with hypochlorite indicated lignin like and condensed hydrocarbon like molecules were the major reactive chemical classes during chlorine based disinfection this study demonstrates how drinking water quality archives combined with synoptic sampling and targeted analyses can be used to identify and understand export control points for dissolved organic matter this approach could be applied to identify and characterize analogous watersheds where seasonal or climate associated organic matter

byproducts organic matter watershed water treatment water quality 1 introduction environmental fluctuations associated with weather season climate change and acute disruptive events can have a pronounced influence on watershed biogeochemical processes for instance drought and insect induced tree mortality can increase organic inputs to surface water sources and alter soil chemistry kramer and chadwick 2018 mikkelson et al 2013 warmer temperatures can increase decomposition rates of available soil organic matter om freeman et al 2001 and soil freeze thaw cycles have been associated with increased release by disrupting om aggregates plant roots and lysing microbial cells tiwari et al 2019 during precipitation events these variables can lead to a higher flux of aqueous om ågren et al 2010 which can impact downstream water quality with an estimated 74 of water used in the united states sourced from surface waters biogeochemical shifts could have large scale impacts on downstream communities dieter et al 2018 water professionals are faced with the task of adapting treatment processes as source water chemistry and regulatory requirements change higher concentrations of om specifically pose challenges during chemical disinfection which is used at 70 of municipal treatment facilities within the united states awwa 2018 while an efficient method to inactivate pathogens ancillary reactions with aqueous om can lead to the creation of carcinogenic disinfection byproducts dbps richardson and plewa 2020 villanueva et al 2015 more than 700 dbps have been identified and eleven four trihalomethanes five haloacetic acids bromate and chlorite are currently regulated in the united states richardson and plewa 2020 with the disinfectants and disinfection byproducts rules enacted by the epa in 1998 and 2006 water systems adding disinfectant during treatment must comply with the established maximum contaminant levels mcl in addition distribution systems serving a population greater than 500 must conduct quarterly sampling for total trihalomethanes tthm and haloacetic acids haa5 to achieve regulatory compliance u s epa 2010 the presence of dbps is a prominent concern for municipal treatment facilities awwa 2020 but formation can be mitigated through a variety of approaches that target additional removal of dissolved organic carbon or with the adoption of alternative disinfection processes while prior studies have focused on dbp reduction by changing conventional unit processes during drinking water treatment andersson et al 2020 postigo et al 2021 zhang et al 2021 those methods present an additional economic and infrastructure burden that can be particularly pronounced for smaller facilities in addition disinfection methods that use alternatives to chlorine can form other less understood byproducts richardson and plewa 2020 as om is a complex constituent by nature screening typically focuses on total organic carbon concentrations normalization to specific uv absorbance as an indicator of reactivity and oxygen demand as an indicator of bioavailable organics u s epa 2005 these approaches however do not capture structural properties of om which are important indicators for dbp formation and can vary across watershed landscapes yamashita et al 2011 further these approaches do not capture contributions from specific structural properties that could mechanistically inform mitigation strategies for dbp formation during water treatment and proactive management of watershed source zones in this study we focused on the coal creek subalpine watershed in colorado to find localities within the landscape and temporal periods that contribute disproportionately toward higher aqueous om flux and dbps formed during drinking water treatment the terms biogeochemical hot spots and hot moments have been used in association with disproportionality high and localized export over short periods respectively to understand the episodic release of mobilized om mcclain et al 2003 these concepts have evolved to more succinctly describe the spatiotemporal release of organics as export control points which are defined as areas where high rates of reactants are exported into receiving streams during hydrologic events bernhardt et al 2017 we hypothesized that an export control point for om could be identified within this small 53 km2 headwater mountain catchment we further theorized that this understanding could be used to reveal reactive chemical classes that link to dbp formation during drinking water treatment to address these research goals we used historical records of drinking water dbp monitoring to assess drivers of a hot moment combined with synoptic stream sampling to identify the source hot spot and quality of om release dissolved om dom in the waters sourced from this export control point was further characterized to better understand specific properties associated with dbp formation 2 methods and materials 2 1 watershed attributes sampling the coal creek watershed is the primary water source for the town of crested butte co and serves a population of approximately 2500 cdphe 2021a the total drainage is 53 km2 with several tributaries that descend a variety of land covers zhi et al 2019 the total watershed land cover consists of 64 evergreen forest 20 herbaceous

ir 00 from a portion of the lake diverted as a trans basin diversion drinking water is diverted from the creek approximately 10 5 km downstream from lake irwin near site coal 11 vaughter 2013 hence this sampling location served as the most representative proxy for influent water before treatment fig s1 the watershed has established sampling locations from prior studies blazewicz et al 2012 ccwc 2018 vaughter 2017 three locations approximately equidistant from the lake to the water diversion cc 5 coal 20 and coal 11 were selected for targeted analyses in 2020 and 2021 that integrated fticr ms and dbp fp analyses as described below these targeted sampling events were conducted in july and october 2020 to align with routine quarter 3 and quarter 4 monitoring by the drinking water facility and june 2021 to align with synoptic sampling table s2 higher resolution synoptic sampling was conducted two days after peak flow on june 8th 2021 and during falling limb flow on july 28th 2021 to better constrain the hot spot region the samples were collected every 1 km or less along the transect beginning at the lake irwin outlet and ending at the lower end of the transect with major tributaries included all synoptic samples were analyzed for uv absorbance at 254 nm uv254 with a subset receiving more comprehensive analyses table s2 samples were collected and shipped on ice from

caruso et al 2020 in brief a 12 tesla bruker solarix fourier transform ion cyclotron mass spectrometer bruker solarix billerica ma usa located at the environmental molecular sciences laboratory in richland wa was used to collect mass spectra of the pre and post chlorinated transect samples the fticr ms was equipped with a standard electrospray ionization esi source and data were acquired in negative mode with an ion accumulation time of 0 08 and 0 1 peaks were aligned 0 5 ppm threshold and chemical formulas were assigned using formularity tolić et al 2017 the compound identification algorithm in formularity considered the presence of c h o n s and p and excluded other elements it is important to note that fticr ms provides a non targeted approach to reliably identify molecular formulas of organic molecules with masses between 200 and 900 m z however it is not quantitative and does not provide information about the structure of the molecular formulas identified final data analysis and plots were conducted in r studio version 3 5 2 following the methods outlined in garayburu caruso et al 2020 the r package ftmsranalysis bramer et al 2020 was used to remove peaks outside

for optimal fp of each sample during a seven day reaction period apha 2017 in brief reagent grade 4 00 4 99 sodium hypochlorite and deionized water were used to prepare a stock hypochlorite solution a diphosphate buffer 1 m ph 7 and ascorbic acid 25 g l quenching solution were prepared amber vials were used for all reactions and pretreated with sodium hypochlorite stock solution filled headspace free for 24 h u s epa 2019 based on the doc results for each sample chlorine dose volumes were calculated to achieve chlorine doc mass ratios of 1 3 5 7 and 10 each filtered sample was added to 5 40 ml vials and buffered to 10 mm the determined hypochlorite stock solution volume was dosed into one of the five vials for each ratio headspace free vials were reacted in the dark for seven days at room temperature after which the residual chlorine concentration was measured using a hach chlorine free total colorimetric test kit to determine which chlorine doc mass ratio achieved a residual chlorine concentration of 3 5 mg l after this dose was determined bulk samples were filtered in 2 250 ml amber bottles buffered dosed with hypochlorite stock solution and filled headspace free after a seven day reaction time in the dark one of the 250 ml reacted vials for each sample was filtered at 0 22 µm and preserved with 85 phosphoric acid for fticr ms analysis as described in section 2 2 the second reacted 250 ml vial was quenched to achieve a concentration of 33 mg l ascorbic acid and acidified with 5 v v sulfuric acid to reach a ph of 3 7 the dbp samples were stored headspace free at 4

spectrometry as described previously chuang et al 2019 a suite of known dbp compounds was analyzed including thms chloroform bromodichloromethane dibromochloromethane bromoform the 5 regulated haas dibromoacetic acid dichloroacetic acid bromoacetic acid chloroacetic acid trichloroacetic acid additional haas bromochloroacetic acid bromodichloroacetic acid chlorodibromoacetic acid idoacetic acid tribromoacetic acid haloacetonitriles haloacetaldehydes iodinated trihalomethanes chloropicrin and haloketones 2 4 historical data access analysis historical dbp data were analyzed from 2005 to 2020 to understand seasonal and decadal trends at the water treatment facility of crested butte the dbp data is regularly reported by the crested butte drinking water treatment facility and was obtained from the colorado department of public health and environment cdphe drinking water compliance database cdphe 2021a dbp concentrations were available at annual quarterly intervals for total trihalomethanes tthm and the five regulated haloacetic acids haa5 in addition to the individual compounds that makes up each group linear trend lines for tthm and haa5 were fitted with the raw data using the ordinary least square regression fits in tableau version 2020 4 to account for seasonality the data were additionally separated by annual quarterly reporting dates for linear trend line analysis across each quarter p values less than 0 05 were considered significant historical coal creek daily hydrograph data was obtained from the u s geological survey usgs database for site number 09111250 coal creek abv mccormick ditch 38 872 n 106 985 w elevation 2700 m the hydrograph data was available starting in october 2014 which allowed for comparative analyses with the historical dbp data from 2015 to 2020 historic doc concentrations near the drinking water diversion at coal 11 fig s1 from 2016 to 2020 have been previously published zhi et al 2019 time series using the 2015 2020 flow rates and 2016 2020 doc concentrations were plotted in r studio version 3 5 2 pearson correlations were determined between the historical dbp concentrations and doc as well as dbps and flow in r studio and plotted in tableau version 2020 4 a p value less than 0 05 was considered significant for all linear fits and correlations finally daily doc mass loadings were determined with the historical hydrograph and doc data by multiplying the doc concentrations in mg l by flow in m3 s with each associated date and appropriate unit conversions to return units of kg day these daily calculations were used to determine monthly averages for each year 3 results and discussion 3 1 seasonal and decadal trends in dbps during drinking water treatment disinfection byproducts form when chlorine or other oxidants react with organic matter in water as a result trends in dbp concentrations can reflect carbon mobilization in the source water with implications for community health brouillard et al 2016 mikkelson et al 2013 the historical dbp concentrations from the crested butte treatment facility served to discern trends of source water reactivity with chlorine based disinfection while the temporal resolution of this dataset was confined to four samples per year seasonal trends of haa5 and tthm concentrations from 2005 to 2020 revealed repeated annual peaks in dbp concentrations after spring snowmelt fig 1 a over the past fifteen years the observed peak values frequently exceeded the maximum contaminant levels mcls of 80 and 60 μg l for tthm and haa5 respectively interestingly these higher concentrations were regularly associated with the third quarter of annual sampling q3 in july fig 1b while the crested butte drinking water treatment facility is in regulatory compliance with annual averages below mcls u s epa 2010 the trends and concentrations are alarming of the individual byproducts measured in the past five years the regulated total haa5s were dominated by dichloroacetic 42 3 and trichloroacetic 55 4 acids while tthms were dominated by chloroform 85 9 fig s2 based on the long term trends of haa5 and tthm concentrations at the treatment facility it appears that coal creek hosts a seasonal and reproducible hot moment for dbp formation trending toward higher future concentrations fig 1 specifically fitted linear trends using ordinary least squares regression returned significant increases p 0 04 r2 0 1 in haa5 concentrations however an analogous increase in tthm lacked this significance threshold p 0 1 quarterly trends further revealed that q3 typically sampled in july and to some degree q4 typically sampled in october are driving the temporal increases fig 1b these trends could be associated with watershed stress associated with climate change supported by previous studies in analogous forested ecosystems that experienced heightened tree mortality that correlated with increased dbps at drinking water facilities brouillard et al 2016 mikkelson et al 2013 in addition tthm and haa5 formation could be linked with the ambient temperature of the environment as demonstrated in a study that modeled future climate related trends in dbps and revealed a 1 8 c increase in mean summer temperatures could lead to a 39 increase in tthms in scotland valdivia garcia et al 2019 we were unable to directly associate the water treatment facility dbp concentrations with influent organic carbon or temperature in this study however the crested butte region has experienced recent shifts in fewer total days of minimum air temperatures less than 0 c and above average total maximum air temperatures greater than 20 c table s1 3 2 hydrochemical associations the quantity and structure of natural om present in source waters are also precursors to dbp formation during treatment as a result the historical hydrograph and coal 11 doc concentrations were used for targeted analysis to understand the relationships between stream hydrochemistry and dbp concentrations after treatment over the past five years the reported tthm and haa5 concentrations have consistently exceeded the epa mcls during q3 sampling while low in temporal resolution these seasonal peaks in dbps overlap with peak flow and doc concentrations fig 2 in the past five years peak flow has occurred near june 1st 13 days at 7 3 m3 s while peak doc has occurred near june 5th 16 days at 11 7 mg l by extension haa5 concentrations correlated with both stream doc p 0 001 and flowrates p 0 02 while tthm concentrations correlated with doc p 0 03 fig s3 consequently this hot moment for dbp formation in crested butte extends to doc mobilization and flow in association with the q3 season of increased seasonal temperatures and snowmelt this observed temporal window is relatively brief but responsible for the majority of doc export from the watershed each year with an average 78 10 of doc mobilized in may june from 2015 to 2020 this aligns with a previous study across 30 forested watersheds wherein up to 86 of total doc was exported during seasonal events associated with increased discharge and water temperatures raymond and saiers 2010 it is noted that the hydrograph data in this present study ends in october due to regularly frozen surface conditions that persist from november may fig s4 despite these missing data comparatively low doc concentrations were observed during the colder months of november march of 2016 2020 in contrast to the warmer months of april october by extension we assumed lower doc mass loading occurs during the winter months as a result of lower flow and doc this assumption is supported by a recent study that concluded higher temperatures are a major driver of doc concentrations with release influenced by high flow during wet conditions wen et al 2020 the interplay between seasonal drivers of doc export and temperature on reaction rates suggests that climate shifts could have a significant role in dbp formation specifically enhanced doc export has been associated with event controlling snowmelt and storm events across a variety of watersheds including mountain and forested catchments mcknight et al 2001 raymond and saiers 2010 high latitude watersheds finlay et al 2006 and agriculture dominated watersheds qiao et al 2017 doc concentrations and lability e g sugar and protein content easily consumed by microbes have been shown to positively correlate with frost duration in upper soil horizons of riparian zones exposed to frost haei et al 2011 in addition peatland studies have associated increased doc and humic acid like organics with more frost free days eskelinen et al 2016 and higher temperatures fenner et al 2007 these findings provide a possible explanation for the increasing trend in dbp concentrations over the past fifteen years that inversely mirror significant decreasing trends in total ice and frost days in crested butte fig s5 and could contribute to higher doc availability for release during spring snowmelt hence cumulative climate shifts can impact downstream doc concentrations and reactivity during drinking water treatment however dbp formation is also dependent on the treatment processes which can change with time andersson et al 2019 specific to this study the crested butte water treatment facility involves a relatively simple system with few publicly reported modifications none of which include changes to the chlorination process cdphe 2021b a holding pond provides storage for surface water flows coal creek is the primary water source for the town and a secondary intake from wildcat creek fig s1 is used for emergencies stantec 2005 from the holding pond incoming water is dosed with potassium permanganate to mitigate metal contamination from legacy mining operations in the watershed this pretreatment is followed by microfiltration and sodium hydroxide dosing for ph and alkalinity adjustments calcium hypochlorite is added for pathogen disinfection and flows through clear wells and storage tanks to achieve a targeted disinfection contact time this likely is also the stage most directly involved in the formation of disinfection byproducts when chlorine reacts with the remaining doc in the system broader studies have assessed a variety of water treatment facilities for associated processes that can impact dbp formation however a recent study determined despite differences in treatment across water distribution systems in scotland water conditions were significant predictors with the ambient temperature of the environment as the primary determinant of tthm and haa5 and concentrations of doc as a secondary determinant valdivia garcia et al 2016 additionally treatment related variables of reaction time and ph have a significant influence on dbp formation doederer et al 2014 water treatment potentially represents a confounding variable in observed dbp trends therefore synoptic and discrete sampling was conducted along the coal creek transect to better understand water properties before treatment 3 3 synoptic sampling to identify regions of enhanced export to evaluate whether a particular region was disproportionately responsible for reactive organic export a synoptic sampling campaign was conducted two days after peak flow on june 8th 2021 synoptic sampling focused on uv254 and doc concentrations which are strong indicators of haa5 and tthm formation potential brouillard et al 2016 golea et al 2017 correlations of these indicators with dbp formation potential in coal creek are investigated further in the next section as depicted in fig 3 indicator values peaked in the upper reach of the coal creek transect near the ohio fork in proximity to an extensive riparian wetland area with beaver activity as evidenced by dams indicator values began to decrease after this point fig 3a table s3 samples from downstream tributaries returned comparatively low values suggesting that dilution possibly in combination with transformation processes were responsible for this decrease a second synoptic sampling campaign was conducted on july 28th 2021 at lower flows and doc concentrations to target tributaries within the identified higher export region similar to the peak flow transect uv254 measurements returned higher values along the ohio fork red text in fig 3a orange points in fig 3b from the southern section of the basin and downstream to cc 8 in addition a tributary sourced from a peat like wetland in the northern region of the basin spg3 red point and text in fig 3b returned the highest uv254 values observed in our study this suggests that drainages on both sides of this reach may be contributing to organic loading fig 3b table s4 flow measurements conducted during the falling limb in 2021 upstream of the fork at coal 30 0 014 m3 s and downstream at cc 6 0 031 m3 s revealed that the ohio fork provides approximately 30 50 of headwater flow to coal creek with a margin of error depending on season the extent of water diversions from lake irwin to the total discharge and groundwater flow the northern spg3 tributary consisted of lower flow that was too modest for flowmeter measurements the identification of this export control region for organic matter sets a foundation for a more detailed inquiry into ecosystem contributions that are beyond the scope of our current study land cover is an important variable in understanding watershed inputs as aboveground litter can influence dbp formation and different plant litter leachates can produce comparatively different dbp profiles franklin et al 2021 the ohio fork is sourced from the southwest section of the watershed and is primarily composed of spruce fir forests that have experienced a degree of spruce beetle impact this is in contrast to the tributaries draining from the north side which are more dominated by grasslands with peat like wetlands near spg3 alexander and brown 2009 nlcd 2011 disruptive events such as insect induced tree mortality and fires have been associated with changes to soil doc and increased dbp formation downstream brouillard et al 2016 mikkelson et al 2013 olivares et al 2021 uzun et al 2020 peatlands have been associated with higher doc and aromaticity during summer rewetting events and past studies that have explored catchments dominated by forests and wetlands revealed a link between late season drought and increased doc concentrations chen et al 2020 tiwari et al 2019 snowmelt dynamics add further complexity where elevation and slope can impact runoff and soil moisture ryan et al 2007 and the timing of snowmelt across local climates can impact porewater doc in association with litter decomposition leonard et al 2021 3 4 formation potential of disinfection byproducts in coal creek we expanded our inquiry to connect this ecosystem control point to dissolved organic carbon doc reactivity correlative analyses of tthm and haa5 formation potential from the creek samples revealed significant relationships with associated doc and uv254 values fig s6 table s5 while these measurements are regularly used in water treatment plant monitoring this lends credence to the application of comparatively rapid and cost effective screening using uv254 during synoptic watershed sampling as depicted in fig 3 specific uv absorbance suva significantly correlated with dbp fp as well but with lower r2 values in contrast to doc and uv254 this is consistent with prior investigations in colorado forested watersheds and treatment facilities beauchamp et al 2018 brouillard et al 2016 the upstream peak dbp fp concentrations quantified in this study in june 2021 tables s3 s4 have implications for understanding total dbp during drinking water treatment when combined with flow and doc monitoring as depicted in fig 2 specifically annual sampling conducted by the crested butte treatment facility in early july was almost one month after peak doc june 5th 16 days hence this quarterly sampling benchmark in early july misses the true peak in dbp concentrations by design dbp formation potential dbp fp determines all reactive components within a sample this complete reaction differs from water treatment practice where facilities typically dose disinfectant to achieve two log inactivation of pathogens likely resulting in lower dbp concentrations while limited to haa5 and tthm the comparison of quarterly drinking water reports for summer and fall 2020 with temporally aligned sample collections reacted for dbp fp revealed similar types and fractions of this subset this was characterized by a dominance of the thms chloroform and bromodichloromethane and the haas dichloroacetic acid and trichloroacetic acid fig 4 the suite of additional dbp fp compounds analyzed were either not detected or comprised 1 or less of the total dbp concentrations measured with the exception of chloral hydrate in the haloacetaldehydes hals class detected at an average of 5 9 of the total fig s2b while hals are not regulated and could not be compared to the historical data correlative analyses were conducted and revealed analogous correlations with doc and uv254 fig s6 although unregulated dbp classes e g haloacetaldehydes and haloacetonitriles occur at lower concentrations than regulated thms and haas they can contribute more to the cytotoxicity associated with disinfection byproducts than regulated thms and haas in conventional drinking waters lau et al 2020 this lends further credence to the application of uv254 screening during synoptic watershed sampling to understand potential dbp formation during drinking water treatment dbp fp concentrations can be found in table s5 and the research data 3 5 reactivity of dom functional groups during disinfection a suite of spectroscopic and spectrometric tools was used to understand the reactive components of coal creek water leading to dbp formation uv254 measurements reflected significant correlations that served as a proxy for dbp formation in coal creek further eem spectra indicated the organic compounds present in the creek are mainly sourced from fulvic acid like organic inputs with a prominent peak associated with terrestrial sourced om excitation 240 250 nm emission 381 580 nm chen et al 2003 xue et al 2017 this peak was greatest in the identified hot spot region with reduced peaks downstream fig 5 while spectra were observed in the humic acid like region the humification index did not correlate with haa5 and tthm formation potential p 0 5 0 4 in contrast to the fluorescence index p 0 03 0 01 fig s6 these correlations agree with the peak analysis in which the fluorescence index has been used to characterize aqueous fulvic acid sources mcknight et al 2001 fticr ms results of pre and post hypochlorite dosed water provided additional insight into the reactive chemical classes within coal creek before and after the reaction with chlorine while not quantitative the analysis of fticr data from spatial and temporal samples together was used to statistically identify changes in om chemical classes associated with chlorination the chemical classes present in pre and post chlorinated samples revealed that the relative counts of lignin like tannin like and condensed hydrocarbon like classes decreased after reaction with hypochlorite as highlighted in van krevelen diagrams figs 6 and s7 lignin like molecules comprised the largest relative counts of chemical classes in coal creek samples before chlorination and significantly decreased p 0 009 by 28 13 after chlorination significant decreases 55 25 were also observed for condensed hydrocarbon hc like molecules after chlorination p 0 004 fig 7 a similar trend where tannin like relative counts also decreased lacked significance other analyzed classes amino sugar like protein like etc either did not significantly change or increased in relative counts with the addition of chlorine in contrast to the pre chlorination samples fig s8 the reactive chemical classes reduced in average relative counts after chlorination have been linked to the formation of dbp compounds previously specifically higher trichloroacetic acid formation has been associated with lignin phenols while chloroform with humic and fulvic acids hua et al 2014 further lignin phenols have been highlighted as important precursors to the unregulated class of haloacetaldehydes chuang et al 2015 a more recent study further corroborates these findings from drinking source waters in spain in which lignin was deemed a major component of natural surface waters and most reactive after chlorination along with condensed hydrocarbons the complexity of these reactions was also highlighted as the authors observed increases in certain lignin signals sanchís et al 2020 further given the presence of lignin content in evergreen needles leonard et al 2020 the spruce forest landcover could be a contributing source of lignin from the ohio fork while not investigated further herein this or other landcover contributions within the identified domain could provide clues toward reactive organic matter sources in similar watersheds 4 conclusions and implications we present an approach that combines historical dbp drinking water quality archives synoptic sampling and targeted spectroscopic characterizations of pre and post chlorinated creek samples to better understand a temporally and spatially dynamic watershed that harbors a pronounced om export control point hydrographs were used to inform synoptic sampling and identify a hot spot region in coal creek that exhibits seasonal temporal and spatial trends for increased om export targeted spectroscopic analyses contrasting chlorine reacted and unreacted waters revealed that lignin like and condensed hydrocarbon like classes reacted most strongly these classes likely contributed to heightened dbp formation during drinking water treatment and provide potential clues to identify watershed sources of reactive organic matter that may inform subsequent hydrobiogeochemical and drinking water treatment studies this study highlights an opportunity for more effective water management coupled with treatment that includes comprehensive monitoring plans from the source to tap due to the repeatability of the hot moments associated with seasonal hydrologic processes recurrent high dbp concentrations can be proactively addressed and peaks more precisely identified should these variables shift with climate change as suggested by our limited 15 year data set certain hot moments could become hotter from increased organic release to surface waters during climate induced stress mcdaniel et al 2014 suggesting this type of analysis could serve as a predictive tool to mitigate risk possible solutions include alternative disinfection methods such as uv irradiation and more aggressive toc attenuation through processes such as coagulation activated carbon biofiltration or nanofiltration alternatively dbps can be removed after formation with membrane filtration air stripping or granular activated carbon zazouli and kalankesh 2017 such technologies could be implemented during periods with the highest risk for formation however solutions beyond treatment should also be explored as these technological upgrades are not always economical for smaller treatment facilities such as crested butte in this case a more precise understanding of the temporal and spatial drivers of export peaks could be integrated into solutions such as temporary sourcing from a secondary water supply such as wildcat creek during the peak discharge window our findings more broadly reveal how seasonal and climate induced changes in hydrobiogeochemical processes have implications for human health and well being providing an opportunity for a proactive and holistic strategy that integrates drinking water treatment and watershed management to address this challenge research data the raw water quality datasets are available in the supplementary information si raw data not

19933,as one of the most powerful approaches to mechanistically understanding complex chemical reactions and performing simulations or predictions kinetic modeling has been widely used to investigate advanced oxidation processes aops however most of the available models are built based on limited systems or reaction mechanisms so they cannot be readily extended to other systems or reaction conditions to overcome such limitations this study developed a comprehensive model on phenol oxidation using over 540 reactions covering the most common reaction mechanisms in nine aops four peroxymonosulfate pms four peroxydisulfate pds and one h2o2 systems and considering product formation and the effects of co existing anions chloride bromide and carbonate existing models in the literature were first gathered and then revised by correcting inaccurately used reactions and adding other necessary reactions extensive model tuning and validation were next conducted by fitting the model against experimental data from both this study and the literature the effects of anions were found to follow pds cuo h2o2 uv other pds or pms systems halogenated organic byproducts were mainly observed in the pms systems in the presence of halides most of the 543 reactions were found to be important based on the sensitivity analysis with some anions involved reactions being among the most important which explained why these anions substantially altered some of the reaction systems with this comprehensive model a deep understanding and reliable prediction can be made for the oxidation of phenol and likely other phenolic compounds in systems containing one or more of the above aops graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords h2o2 kinetic modeling peroxydisulfate peroxymonosulfate sensitivity analysis uv irradiation 1 introduction advanced oxidation processes aops are among the most important water treatment technologies for organic contaminant removal they often rely on the activation of oxidants such as peroxymonosulfate pms peroxydisulfate pds and h2o2 by either energy inputs or catalysts to induce the formation of reactive oxygen species ross including sulfate so4 and hydroxyl oh radicals lee et al 2020a wang and wang 2018 recent studies also reported the involvement of singlet oxygen 1o2 or direct electron transfer processes in some of the aop systems duan et al 2018b huang and zhang 2019 utilizing the unique long distance electron transfer property of the prepared catalyst recent studies developed a galvanic oxidation process that achieved contaminant oxidation even when pms and the contaminant were physically separated from each other huang and zhang 2019 2020a the reaction mechanisms in aops are usually complex as the reactions between ross and organic contaminants generate many intermediates products which can further react with the ross the persistence and risks of these intermediates products may also vary significantly moreover various impact factors such as the coexisting anions exist in real water treatment scenarios as mentioned later these anions can sometimes significantly alter the reaction mechanisms and impact the contaminant removal efficiency oxidant utilization efficiency and product formation therefore advanced experimental computational and modeling approaches are needed to investigate these aops kinetic modeling is a powerful approach to gaining mechanistic understandings of these systems and can help formulate strategies for improving the treatment efficiency extensive modeling studies have been reported for many aops such as h2o2 uv pds uv chlorine uv and chloramine uv chuang et al 2017 crittenden et al 1999 grebel et al 2010 yang et al 2014 2016 some best examples include 180 reactions for an h2o2 uv system grebel et al 2010 188 reactions for h2o2 uv and pds uv systems yang et al 2014 140 reactions for h2o2 uv and pds uv systems zhang et al 2015 and 203 reactions for hocl uv h2o2 uv and o3 uv systems bulman et al 2019 a number of studies have also considered intermediate transformation in their kinetic models duesterberg and waite 2006 c k 2007 guo et al 2014b kang et al 2002 li et al 2004 k 2007 luo et al 2021 mora et al 2011 qian et al 2016 zhao et al 2021 zhou et al 2018 for example li et al performed a kinetic modeling of trichloroethene degradation considering four intermediates and 67 reactions in one system h2o2 uv k li et al 2007 duesterberg and waite modeled the oxidation of p hydroxybenzoic acid in the h2o2 fe system with 49 reactions and considering one intermediate 3 4 dihydroxybenzoic acid c k duesterberg and waite 2007 however most of these models were built on limited numbers of systems under well defined experimental conditions so they cannot be readily applied to other systems or conditions new models therefore need to be developed every time for new systems this is time consuming and labor intensive furthermore a large portion of the reaction rate constants in some studies were set as the fitting parameters e g 12 out of 67 k li et al 2007 or 13 out of 101 qian et al 2016 the number of these fitting parameters is generally much larger than that of the datasets experimental conditions used for the model fitting which may cause overparameterization this is similar to solving multivariable equations where a unique solution is only possible when the number of the equations is equal to or larger than that of the variables if such a condition is not met the true values of the variables or in this case the unknown rate constants cannot be obtained therefore perfect fittings under the studied conditions can be easily obtained but poor fittings are usually expected for other conditions because the fitted rate constants are likely not accurate to overcome both the applicability limitation and overparameterization issues we need to build a robust and comprehensive model considering multiple systems and experimental conditions the performance of aops is also known to be affected by halides including cl and br or carbonate collectively referred to as the anions hereafter often through generating different reactive species for example grebel et al demonstrated that carbonate significantly decreased the phenol degradation rate in an h2o2 uv system because the reaction of oh with carbonate forms less reactive carbonate radicals co3 such an effect is much stronger than that of cl but weaker than that of br grebel et al 2010 in pms based systems halides have reportedly accelerated the contaminant removal because the reactions of pms with halides form non radical reactive halogen species rhss e g hox x2 x cl or br fang et al 2016 luo et al 2019 wang et al 2017 these non radical rhss can sometimes be very abundant compared to the original ross and result in significantly faster contaminant oxidation although they may also lead to inhibited mineralization and formation of toxic halogenated byproducts fang et al 2016 luo et al 2019 wang et al 2017 given the ubiquitous presence of these anions in the aquatic environment it is important to systematically evaluate their impacts on the performance of different aops under various conditions however current studies considering anions only focused on very limited numbers of oxidants activation approaches and reaction mechanisms in each model the inclusion of additional oxidants activation approaches may require many more reactions which have not been previously considered to address the above limitations a comprehensive model needs to be developed for a large number of systems covering multiple known oxidants and activation mechanisms it can also be easily applied to for instance compare the performance of different systems side by side or simulate scaled up water treatment systems under various conditions without having to conduct experimental tests when hybrid systems are employed in some water treatment scenarios where multiple reactants and or activation mechanisms are involved e g pds and h2o2 coupled with uv catalyst and heat monteagudo et al 2015 this comprehensive model would be very powerful to describe the systems and provide mechanistic insights in this work four pms four pds and one h2o2 systems were first experimentally evaluated for phenol oxidation in both the absence and presence of the anions then a comprehensive kinetic model was developed for 7 aops considering different oxidants activation approaches reaction mechanisms and other impact factors the hox uv systems were also included in the model because they existed under some conditions e g the pms uv system containing cl and br resulting in hocl uv and hobr uv systems the intermediate transformation was also modeled phenol was selected as the model compound because it is widely used in industries and is toxic to aquatic life olmez hanci and arslan alaton 2013 although phenol can be relatively easily oxidized by aops it is the most basic phenolic compound and shares significant similarity with many other contaminants using phenol would be therefore helpful to develop a model that can be easily adopted for a wide range of contaminants further recent advances in tools for oxidation pathway generation guo et al 2014a 2014b and reaction rate constant prediction e g quantitative structure activity relationship qsar models zhong et al 2020a 2020b can also greatly expand the application of this model to other organics extensive model tuning and validation were then carried out by fitting the model against the experimental data from both this study and the literature detailed balancing was performed to fix the reaction loop illegality issue and the model sensitivity analysis was conducted to evaluate the importance of each reaction with the developed model the effect of anions on the reaction mechanisms and the importance of different ross responsible for phenol degradation and product formation were finally evaluated 2 materials and methods details in chemicals and materials used in this study can be found in the supplementary material sm text s1 the aop systems were selected to include most of the known reaction mechanisms associated with the oxidants pms pds and h2o2 activation approaches and responsible ross a total of four pms four pds and one h2o2 systems were investigated details in text s2 detailed experimental procedures and analytical methods can be found in text s3 and table s1 including the uv intensity and pathlength determination catalyst preparation experimental setup and the quantification of pms pds h2o2 phenol and the degradation products 2 1 kinetic modeling the model development consisted of four stages i e initial development improvement tuning and validation we first conducted an extensive literature review and compiled all the major reactions that may occur in the studied systems using the search engine google scholar with the following keywords advanced oxidation processes aops kinetic modeling peroxymonosulfate pms peroxydisulfate pds h2o2 phenol oxidation pathways sulfate radicals hydroxyl radicals uv chlorine uv bromine and radical reaction rate constant the resulted records more than 5000 were screened by checking whether they contained useful contents such as the pathways and reaction rate constants of the oxidant activation reactions ros transformation and phenol transformation reactions and product formation this resulted in more than 100 kinetic modeling studies and various books and databases details in table s2 most of the reaction rate constants were obtained from the literature in case different values were found for a reaction rate constant reactions listed in table s3 the average was used if two were retrieved n 2 or median if more than two were retrieved n 2 for reactions with unknown rate constants if the reactions were between organics and radicals they were estimated based on the linear correlations between the natural log of the second order rate constant k ln k and the reduction potentials of the radicals grebel et al 2010 pavitt et al 2017 zagal et al 2019 details in fig s1 and table s4 others were assumed based on similar reactions and reactants a total of 40 were estimated or assumed table s2 as a result only eight rate constants were unknown and therefore set as the fitting parameters when fitting the model against the experimental data most of these eight rate constants were for initiation reactions for example the activation of pms by catalysts eqs 1 and 3 in table s5 for reactions that were inaccurately applied in the literature revisions were also made details in section 3 3 the whole model was built using the computer program kintecus 6 8 ianni 2019 to include the effects of ionic strength and temperature on the reaction rate constants the davies equation and the van t hoff rules respectively were applied details in text s4 for the uv based systems the photolysis rate of the oxidants for the formation of radicals may change considerably throughout the reaction due to the changing chemical composition more details about how to dynamically calculate the photolysis rate of a given system in kintecus can be found in text s5 and table s6 details of stages 1 4 of the model development can be found in text s6 2 2 detailed balancing using detbal model overparameterization control and model sensitivity analysis a variety of techniques were employed in this study during the model development including detailed balancing using detbal fig s2 model overparameterization control and model sensitivity analysis more details about these techniques can be found in texts s7 s9 3 results and discussion 3 1 performance of the nine aop systems the phenol degradation rates and oxidant utilization efficiencies were compared in the absence and presence of the anions including cl br and hco3 as shown in fig 1 in the three uv systems without the anions pds showed the highest phenol degradation rate followed by h2o2 and then pms while this order changed to pds pms h2o2 in the presence of the anions the orders of the oxidant utilization efficiencies were h2o2 pds pms and pms pds h2o2 under the uv condition with and without the anions respectively these different orders were mainly due to the different photoproperties of these oxidants and the reaction rate constants of phenol intermediates with different ross additional discussion of the observed performances can be found in text s10 3 2 initial model development stage 1 this stage of the model development mainly involved the initiation reactions table s5 and the transformation of ross overall the fittings were poor for most of the systems with r2 in the ranges of 0 94 0 96 and 0 16 0 97 for phenol and the oxidant respectively as shown in table s7 for example for the pms uv and pds uv systems the phenol degradation rates were underestimated at the beginning but overestimated at the end of the reactions fig s3 this is probably because some important reactions and intermediate transformations were not yet considered as the reaction continues intermediates may compete with the parent compound for the consumption of ross to decrease the phenol degradation rate therefore considering more reactions as well as the formation of intermediates products may significantly improve the model nevertheless at the current stage we also observed that according to the primary ros transformation pathways in the presence of halides scheme s1 some of the species such as cl2 br2 cl and ho2 served as important intermediates for the transformation of other species some of them such as cl2 and br2 were indeed later found to be important in the contaminant oxidation section 3 6 3 3 model improvement stage 2 in the process of model development we observed that some reactions had been inaccurately used in some of the previous modeling studies details in text s11 for example o2 was often treated as the product in the oh ho2 o2 type of reactions reactions 100 103 table s2 cheng et al 2018 crittenden et al 1999 grebel et al 2010 yang et al 2014 however recent studies have performed convincing experiments such as the enhancing and quenching tests on a chemiluminescence system electron spin resonance and chemical trapping by mass spectrometry to demonstrate the formation of 1o2 rather than o2 li et al 2015 lin and liu 2008 liu et al 2006 qi et al 2016 zhou et al 2013 the oh ho2 o2 type of reactions is the primary step in the formation of 1o2 in base activated pms duan et al 2018b qi et al 2016 the reactions of radical rhss with ho2 or o2 including reactions 56 57 78 79 119 137 and 138 in table s2 should also form 1o2 instead of o2 because these rhss can be easily converted from and to oh in addition the oxygen as a product in the reactions of h2o2 with hox x2 has been reported to be all at the excited state 1o2 as shown in reactions 108 111 112 123 128 129 130 and 134 in table s2 held et al 1978 khan and kasha 1970 piatt and o brien 1979 therefore although many modeling studies adopted o2 rather than 1o2 bulman et al 2019 cheng et al 2018 grebel et al 2010 yang et al 2014 zhang et al 2015 we adopted 1o2 as the product here studies have also frequently neglected the important roles of s2o8 and clo as they have been proven to be strong oxidants and can effectively oxidize a wide range of organic contaminants alfassi et al 1988 bulman et al 2019 duan et al 2018a kong et al 2018 wu et al 2016 they were included in the model more details can be found in text s11 upon the incorporation of the above reactions the improved model was fitted against the experimental data as shown in figs 2 a g by making the four unavailable rate constants reactions 1 3 5 and 6 in table s2 as the fitting parameters we were able to obtain good fittings for all the seven systems with and without the anions 14 systems in total with the r2 in the ranges of 0 98 0 999 and 0 62 0 99 for phenol and the oxidant respectively as shown in table s7 this suggested that the model can describe the systems well the correction and inclusion of the above reactions in the model significantly improved the model performance this improvement can also be explained by the important contributions of s2o8 and clo to phenol oxidation as examined in section 3 6 the sensitivity analysis in section 3 8 further confirmed that a number of the above reactions indeed ranked high in the overall importance table s8 when differences were found for some rate constants in the literature they generally differ by less than one order of magnitude the use of the mean n 2 or median n 2 for modeling did not differ significantly compared to using other values data not shown another indication of the good model performance is that the model fitted rate constant of pds activation by heat was 7 8 10 6 s 1 close to the reported value of 5 4 10 6 s 1 under similar conditions 70 c ph 5 yang et al 2019 3 4 model tuning stage 3 3 4 1 inclusion of degradation intermediates although the model developed in stage 2 showed satisfactory fitting results for both phenol and the oxidants the formation and further transformation of intermediates products were still not included overall the oxidation of phenol by radical and non radical species goes through two pathways as illustrated in schemes 1 a and b respectively more details can be found in text s12 and scheme s2 after incorporating the above pathways into the model we conducted another series of experiments with a higher initial phenol concentration for the systems of pms co3o4 pds uv and h2o2 uv with or without the anions note that although not all the 7 systems were evaluated this time the selected ones still covered all the three oxidants and two major activation approaches as it is challenging to model all possible intermediates in aops even for simple compounds kamath et al 2018 we initially only monitored some of the most important ones catechol hydroquinone and p benzoquinone the model was then fit against the experimental data as shown in figs 2h i and s4 by treating four additional unknown rate constants reactions 279 368 369 and 483 in table s2 as the fitting parameters we observed good fittings for most of the monitored systems r2 0 72 0 99 this suggested that this comprehensive model can simulate the product transformation well the details of the final model containing a total of 543 reactions can be found in table s2 3 4 2 detailed balancing using detbal the first round of detailed balancing analysis identified a total of 315 loops and two of them were illegal the fundamental elements of these loops were reactions the second round of analysis was performed by checking whether these small loops can form larger loops as a result a total of 24 illegal loops were further identified each containing small loops as the elements in addition a total of 16 loops were found to disagree with the wegscheider s condition fig s2 these issues were fixed following the approaches described in text s7 because such a detailed balancing process has not been widely adopted in the literature it would be helpful to keep but mark the reactions that were removed to illustrate the modifications as shown in table s2 26 crossed and highlighted reactions overall the removal of these reactions did not lead to significant changes in the concentrations of the species we monitored during the simulation especially when no anions were present data not shown 3 5 model validation stage 4 after the development of the model a third batch of experiments was carried out for four systems that is pms uv and pds heat with and without the anions to validate the model as shown in figs 3 a c and s5a b the model demonstrated very good simulation for phenol and the intermediates in all the four systems r2 0 68 0 99 the differences in the intermediate formation in the pms uv systems without fig 3a and with figs 3b and s5a the anions were mainly due to the significant alteration of the major ross responsible for the phenol oxidation tables s9 and s10 which resulted in different pathways of intermediate formation scheme 1 the effects of the anions are further discussed in section 3 6 in addition to the experimental data collected in this study the kinetic results for a few external systems were extracted from the literature for model validation for example an h2o2 uv system was selected under the experimental conditions of phenol 0 5 17 mm h2o2 0 0 245 m and temperature 45 c alnaizy and akgerman 2000 the uv irradiation parameters were slightly adjusted to reflect the different uv intensity effective path length and possible uv length as shown in fig 3d the model fitted moderately well to the degradation of phenol and the evolution of catechol and hydroquinone we believe these fits are reasonable given that some of the reaction conditions were unknown such as the ionic strength and potential introduction of halides during the solution preparation based on the kinetic data extrated from another study mora et al 2011 the phenol and toc total organic carbon removal was modeled for a pds heat system under three conditions as shown in figs 3e f and s5c the toc was calculated by the sum of the carbon weights from the major organic compounds including phenol o p benzoquinones and dihydroxybenzenes other species such as dihydroxybiphenyls and phenoxyphenols were also included but they did not make noticeable contributions see the excel file huang and zhang kinetic modeling xlsx in the supplementary material for details surprisingly the model demonstrated good fits r2 0 41 0 99 to the phenol and toc trends although toc was never used during the model development in addition we performed model fitting on a pds zvi zero valent iron system for p chlorophenol oxidation zhao et al 2010 a system which was not considered in our model because the mechanism is well known that is each pds forms one sulfate radical upon activation similar to the pms co3o4 system it is easy to simulate the system using our model as shown in fig s5d the fittings are also acceptable r2 0 63 0 82 given many uncertainties such as certain unknown interactions between zvi and pds unknown starting ph but likely near neutral unknown ionic strength and some potential co existing ions that were not reported in the study this further validated the obtained model 3 6 effects of the anions and contributions of different ross with the developed model the phenol degradation kinetics and the contribution of different ross can be easily simulated under different reaction conditions we added different combinations of cl br and hco3 to examine how the systems responded to the additions as shown in tables s9 and s10 in the absence of the anions the phenol degradation in all the systems is almost always attributed to well known ross or pathways this result was obtained by simply tracking the phenol reactions with all the reactive species in the kintecus program details in text s13 for example in table s9 so4 contributed to 99 8 of the phenol degradation in the pms co3o4 system and direct electron transfer was responsible for 100 in the pms femno system however in the presence of the three anions the largest contributors in the pms co3o4 system shifted to co3 72 2 and hobr 11 5 while so4 only contributed 4 6 a similar phenomenon existed in all other pms systems in addition to the reactions of the anions with the radicals cl and br can also react with pms at relatively high rates k 1 8 10 3 and 0 7 m 1 s 1 respectively to form hox and subsequently other non radical rhss huang and zhang 2020b these intermediates non radical rhss could be abundant and contributed to the fast phenol oxidation therefore the pms systems can be susceptible to the matrix effects for the pds systems in the absence of the anions table s10 direct electron transfer so4 and so4 contributed to around 100 of phenol degradation in the pds cuo pds heat and pds uv systems respectively in the presence of the three anions however the key species were found to be s2o8 in both the pds heat and pds uv systems none of the three anions affected the pds cuo system as mentioned earlier the pds cuo system under neutral conditions solely relies on direct electron transfer for phenol oxidation therefore no new ross were generated to a noticeable level to alter the reaction mechanism for the h2o2 uv system oh contributed to more than 80 of the phenol degradation under all the conditions this indicates that h2o2 uv has high robustness after pds cuo followed by all other systems this agrees well with a study reporting that cl did not exhibit noticeable effects on the 2 4 6 trichlorophenol oxidation and product formation in an h2o2 uv system fang et al 2016 this might be due to the milder scavenging effects of the anions on oh than on so4 as shown in eqs a and b x generally reacts with oh to form hox which proceeds to form oh and x in contrast x often reacts with so4 to directly form so4 2 and x according to the rate constants of reactions 37 42 62 64 66 and 67 table s2 such a scavenging effect is much more pronounced on so4 than on oh this has also been reported in another study zhang and parker 2018 therefore following the pds cuo system h2o2 uv would be the second most robust system regarding the effect of halides a oh x hox oh x b so4 x so4 2 x in addition we examined the effects of anion concentrations on the ros contribution to phenol degradation as shown in fig 4 upon the addition of the initial amounts of the anions the dominant ros in all the six systems shifted significantly from the original ones e g so4 and or oh to anion related analogues e g cl2 co3 hobr hocl with the further increase in the anion concentrations some ross showed increased and then decreased contributions while the rest demonstrated continuously increasing importance the detailed shifting patterns are highly system dependent however in the pds cuo system where phenol was always degraded through the direct electron transfer pathway the presence of the anions did not affect the ros contribution regardless of the anion concentrations data not shown the major reason that we did not consider additional anions such as phosphate and nitrate is that they generally have much less impact on the aop systems investigated in this study as shown in table s11 the second order reaction rate constants of these anions with sulfate and hydroxyl radicals are 2 6 orders of magnitude lower that those with the selected three anions the presence of nom was not considered either mainly due to its lower reaction rates with radicals in radical based systems lee et al 2020a in non radical systems nom is often less competitive compared to target pollutants due to its low electron richness while non radical systems are very selective toward electron rich species i e the target substrate duan et al 2018b lee et al 2020a in addition there are many different types of noms including different humic acids fulvic acids and humins it can be very challenging to examine all representative noms for this modeling study furthermore studies have reported that the effects of nom are much more complex than just scavenging ros which can occur in both the aqueous phase and the catalyst surface nom may also shade the photocatalytic materials from incoming photons or adsorb to the photocatalyst surfaces to potentially interfere with ros production brame et al 2015 the effects of different types of nom may also vary significantly considering such challenges and complexities we believe it is beyond the scope of this study to investigate the effects of nom in this work 3 7 prediction of intermediate formation another advantage of having a comprehensive model is to easily predict the intermediate formation under different conditions without having to carry out any experiments the simulated product formation for different systems and conditions are shown in tables s12 and s13 hco3 slightly altered the product distribution but did not change the types of products for all the systems upon the addition of cl and or br however significant amounts of halogenated products such as halophenols dihalophenols and haloresorcinols formed in all the pms based systems as mentioned above this shift was primarily due to the formed non radical rhss resulting in the halide substitution reactions in contrast halides did not exhibit such an effect in any of the pds or h2o2 systems because of the negligible formation of non radical rhss further although halides can result in radical rhss in some of the systems as mentioned above these rhss generally oxidize organic compounds through electron transfer reactions rather than halide substitution grebel et al 2010 this agrees well with another study reporting that only 0 03 of halophenols formed in an h2o2 uv system with a halide level similar to that in this study grebel et al 2010 therefore we conclude that the formation of halogenated byproducts would primarily be a concern for the pms based systems but not for the pds or h2o2 systems especially when the halide concentrations are low and the reaction time is short e g less than 60 min although not modeled the system of pms base may not form halogenated byproducts either because the reactions between pms and halides can be significantly retarded under alkaline conditions huang and zhang 2020b 3 8 model sensitivity analysis to understand the reaction importance we performed sensitivity analysis for all the systems in the presence of anions by including all the initiation reactions in table s5 in other words all the seven systems were included in one model because any changes in the system setup experimental conditions or reaction time as mentioned below can potentially change the ranking of the reactions this section mainly focuses on a qualitative demonstration rather than quantitative evaluation of the reaction importance one can use this model to perform similar sensitivity analysis for a given scenario and analyze the results with atropos in kintecus depending on their needs lee et al 2020b as shown in the excel file huang and zhang kinetic modeling xlsx in the supplementary material and fig s6 the model simulation based sensitivity analysis was conducted for the beginning 1 s the middle 480 s and the end 960 s of the reactions however as some of the reactions have not started at the beginning while others have already completed at the end the sensitivity analyses for the systems at these times may not accurately reflect the real importance of these reactions therefore hereafter we mainly interpret the results at the middle of the simulated reactions 480 s positive nscs indicate positive contributions of the corresponding reactions to the corresponding species while negative results suggest negative contributions larger absolute nsc values generally mean higher importance of the reactions as different reactions contribute differently to different species and the species of interest usually change from one case to another we decided to sum all the positive negative and absolute nsc values for each reaction to show their overall importance to the whole system as shown in the sheet sensitivity 480 s columns dp dq and dr in the excel file a total of 26 reactions highlighted were found to have no or minimum contributions to all the species most of these reactions involve uncommon species such as bro2 brocl h2o and brclo2 the reason that these reactions are not important might be related to the specific simulation conditions applied under other conditions they might be important on the other hand it is interesting to know that overall reaction 144 co3 h2o2 hco3 ho2 was the most important but negatively reaction 149 co3 s2o8 2 co3 2 s2o8 had the largest positive contribution followed by reaction 165 br hso5 hobr so4 2 this might be because the formed s2o8 and hobr are strong oxidants and can oxidize a wide range of organics or facilitate other reactions more details about the importance of each reaction can be found in the excel file by using the filters in the spreadsheet one can check which reaction is the most important for a specific species overall all the top reactions are those we are already familiar with and many of them have been included in scheme s1 it is also interesting to know that many reactions especially those related to the anions are more important than the initiation reactions in table s5 this explains why the presence of anions in some cases significantly altered the reaction pathways and the product formation with this sensitivity analysis approach one can also easily understand why and how different reaction conditions affect the target system 3 9 model applicability to other reaction systems or contaminants although the development of this model only involved seven systems it covers most of the known reaction mechanisms in aops using pms pds or h2o2 as the oxidant including radical non radical and direct electron transfer processes therefore this model can be easily applied to many other systems e g hybrid systems with only minor modifications mostly by adding necessary initiation reactions for example in a study where pds and h2o2 were activated simultaneously by uv catalyst and heat monteagudo et al 2015 existing models would not be able to provide mechanistic insights for the system however the model developed in this study can easily do so for other aops pertaining to different oxidants such as ozone e g o3 o3 uv o3 h2o2 and o3 pms these systems generally form oh and or so4 as the primary ross and thus can be well simulated using the current model as well this new model is also significant in that although only phenol was used as the parent compound it can be easily extended to many other contaminants this is because nearly half of the reactions are about the ros transformation and can be directly reused in addition phenol is the most basic phenolic compounds and shares significant similarity with many other contaminants the transformation pathways of phenol can therefore be largely applied to other phenolic compounds in future models as many phenol transformation intermediates such as monohalophenols dihalophenols dihydroxybenzenes and benzoquinones were involved in this model other aop systems involving any of these species either as parent compound or intermediate can also adopt many of these reactions moreover recent studies developed a computer program based on known reaction rules to automatically generate the reaction pathways for a given organic contaminant toward oh guo et al 2014a 2014b the reaction rate constants of the intermediates products with oh can also be predicted using reported qsar models which are under rapid development for different ross thanks to the application of machine learning zhong et al 2020a 2021 2020b the limitation of the computer program is that it is still limited to oh if it can be further improved to generate reaction pathways for other ross it can be coupled with qsar models and the model developed in this study to substantially expand the modeling applicability of these three tools in addition compared to most of the models in the literature the model developed in this study has provided both valuable methodologies and reusable contents with high quality for future model development 4 conclusion this study first evaluated the performance phenol degradation rates and oxidant utilization efficiencies of four pms four pds and one h2o2 systems for phenol oxidation in the absence or presence of halides and carbonate a comprehensive kinetic model was then built based on seven systems with over 540 reactions compared to previous modeling studies this work considerably improved the model by combining all the major reactions and revising the reactions that have been inaccurately applied in other models the observed transformation of a few intermediates products provided a more detailed understanding of the systems the application of various modeling approaches from detailed balancing using detbal and overparameterization control to model validation with additional measurements and external systems also significantly improved the reliability of the obtained model different from most other kinetic models which were built for mostly single systems the model developed in this study can be applied to complex hybrid systems involving different oxidants and or activation mechanisms our modeling results revealed that among the seven aops the pds cuo system was the most robust against the impact of halides and carbonate followed by the h2o2 uv system and then the other systems we observed that different aop systems usually share many reactions especially those associated with ros therefore developing a comprehensive model that can describe more than seven aop systems does not necessarily require many more reactions the development of this model was not simply a reaction gathering process but rather a systematic information integration process for the first time the dynamic radical formation rates for pms pds h2o2 hobr and hocl under uv irradiation were employed considering the dynamic effects of co existing species which can either block or absorb uv to reduce the intensity of uv available for radical formation studies have suggested that more attention should be paid to the important reactions and adding additional ones may not be able to improve the prediction accuracy bulman et al 2019 this is true and easy for simple systems and when the target species are the major ones however for complex systems e g hybrid systems that involve multiple oxidants activation approaches and reaction mechanisms it is usually hard to identify the most important reactions without having to compile many others in addition the importance of a reaction is always relative and subjective depending on the species of interest or the scope of the study for example the reactions that are important for mineralization of phenol are not necessarily important for its polymerization whereas both pathways are of great research interest it is tedious to develop new models each time for new goals even if they are for the same system a comprehensive model can therefore be beneficial to avoid this by capturing all these pathways in one model and help identify the important reactions for specific scopes it is then the user s decision about whether to use all or only the important ones however this model still has a few limitations first the number of the experimentally measured intermediates is small so the prediction of other intermediates may not be as reliable second only three co existing ions are considered in this study in reality many other ions and organics e g nom may also be present in the target water their roles in the kinetic model and effects on the water treatment should be investigated as well third the further transformation of some later stage species such as the ring opening acids and polymers are not well captured yet which requires additional work if they are of interest declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have

19933,as one of the most powerful approaches to mechanistically understanding complex chemical reactions and performing simulations or predictions kinetic modeling has been widely used to investigate advanced oxidation processes aops however most of the available models are built based on limited systems or reaction mechanisms so they cannot be readily extended to other systems or reaction conditions to overcome such limitations this study developed a comprehensive model on phenol oxidation using over 540 reactions covering the most common reaction mechanisms in nine aops four peroxymonosulfate pms four peroxydisulfate pds and one h2o2 systems and considering product formation and the effects of co existing anions chloride bromide and carbonate existing models in the literature were first gathered and then revised by correcting inaccurately used reactions and adding other necessary reactions extensive model tuning and validation were next conducted by fitting the model against experimental data from both this study and the literature the effects of anions were found to follow pds cuo h2o2 uv other pds or pms systems halogenated organic byproducts were mainly observed in the pms systems in the presence of halides most of the 543 reactions were found to be important based on the sensitivity analysis with some anions involved reactions being among the most important which explained why these anions substantially altered some of the reaction systems with this comprehensive model a deep understanding and reliable prediction can be made for the oxidation of phenol and likely other phenolic compounds in systems containing one or more of the above aops graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords h2o2 kinetic modeling peroxydisulfate peroxymonosulfate sensitivity analysis uv irradiation 1 introduction advanced oxidation processes aops are among the most important water treatment technologies for organic contaminant removal they often rely on the activation of oxidants such as peroxymonosulfate pms peroxydisulfate pds and h2o2 by either energy inputs or catalysts to induce the formation of reactive oxygen species ross including sulfate so4 and hydroxyl oh radicals lee et al 2020a wang and wang 2018 recent studies also reported the involvement of singlet oxygen 1o2 or direct electron transfer processes in some of the aop systems duan et al 2018b huang and zhang 2019 utilizing the unique long distance electron transfer property of the prepared catalyst recent studies developed a galvanic oxidation process that achieved contaminant oxidation even when pms and the contaminant were physically separated from each other huang and zhang 2019 2020a the reaction mechanisms in aops are usually complex as the reactions between ross and organic contaminants generate many intermediates products which can further react with the ross the persistence and risks of these intermediates products may also vary significantly moreover various impact factors such as the coexisting anions exist in real water treatment scenarios as mentioned later these anions can sometimes significantly alter the reaction mechanisms and impact the contaminant removal efficiency oxidant utilization efficiency and product formation therefore advanced experimental computational and modeling approaches are needed to investigate these aops kinetic modeling is a powerful approach to gaining mechanistic understandings of these systems and can help formulate strategies for improving the treatment efficiency extensive modeling studies have been reported for many aops such as h2o2 uv pds uv chlorine uv and chloramine uv chuang et al 2017 crittenden et al 1999 grebel et al 2010 yang et al 2014 2016 some best examples include 180 reactions for an h2o2 uv system grebel et al 2010 188 reactions for h2o2 uv and pds uv systems yang et al 2014 140 reactions for h2o2 uv and pds uv systems zhang et al 2015 and 203 reactions for hocl uv h2o2 uv and o3 uv systems bulman et al 2019 a number of studies have also considered intermediate transformation in their kinetic models duesterberg and waite 2006 c k 2007 guo et al 2014b kang et al 2002 li et al 2004 k 2007 luo et al 2021 mora et al 2011 qian et al 2016 zhao et al 2021 zhou et al 2018 for example li et al performed a kinetic modeling of trichloroethene degradation considering four intermediates and 67 reactions in one system h2o2 uv k li et al 2007 duesterberg and waite modeled the oxidation of p hydroxybenzoic acid in the h2o2 fe system with 49 reactions and considering one intermediate 3 4 dihydroxybenzoic acid c k duesterberg and waite 2007 however most of these models were built on limited numbers of systems under well defined experimental conditions so they cannot be readily applied to other systems or conditions new models therefore need to be developed every time for new systems this is time consuming and labor intensive furthermore a large portion of the reaction rate constants in some studies were set as the fitting parameters e g 12 out of 67 k li et al 2007 or 13 out of 101 qian et al 2016 the number of these fitting parameters is generally much larger than that of the datasets experimental conditions used for the model fitting which may cause overparameterization this is similar to solving multivariable equations where a unique solution is only possible when the number of the equations is equal to or larger than that of the variables if such a condition is not met the true values of the variables or in this case the unknown rate constants cannot be obtained therefore perfect fittings under the studied conditions can be easily obtained but poor fittings are usually expected for other conditions because the fitted rate constants are likely not accurate to overcome both the applicability limitation and overparameterization issues we need to build a robust and comprehensive model considering multiple systems and experimental conditions the performance of aops is also known to be affected by halides including cl and br or carbonate collectively referred to as the anions hereafter often through generating different reactive species for example grebel et al demonstrated that carbonate significantly decreased the phenol degradation rate in an h2o2 uv system because the reaction of oh with carbonate forms less reactive carbonate radicals co3 such an effect is much stronger than that of cl but weaker than that of br grebel et al 2010 in pms based systems halides have reportedly accelerated the contaminant removal because the reactions of pms with halides form non radical reactive halogen species rhss e g hox x2 x cl or br fang et al 2016 luo et al 2019 wang et al 2017 these non radical rhss can sometimes be very abundant compared to the original ross and result in significantly faster contaminant oxidation although they may also lead to inhibited mineralization and formation of toxic halogenated byproducts fang et al 2016 luo et al 2019 wang et al 2017 given the ubiquitous presence of these anions in the aquatic environment it is important to systematically evaluate their impacts on the performance of different aops under various conditions however current studies considering anions only focused on very limited numbers of oxidants activation approaches and reaction mechanisms in each model the inclusion of additional oxidants activation approaches may require many more reactions which have not been previously considered to address the above limitations a comprehensive model needs to be developed for a large number of systems covering multiple known oxidants and activation mechanisms it can also be easily applied to for instance compare the performance of different systems side by side or simulate scaled up water treatment systems under various conditions without having to conduct experimental tests when hybrid systems are employed in some water treatment scenarios where multiple reactants and or activation mechanisms are involved e g pds and h2o2 coupled with uv catalyst and heat monteagudo et al 2015 this comprehensive model would be very powerful to describe the systems and provide mechanistic insights in this work four pms four pds and one h2o2 systems were first experimentally evaluated for phenol oxidation in both the absence and presence of the anions then a comprehensive kinetic model was developed for 7 aops considering different oxidants activation approaches reaction mechanisms and other impact factors the hox uv systems were also included in the model because they existed under some conditions e g the pms uv system containing cl and br resulting in hocl uv and hobr uv systems the intermediate transformation was also modeled phenol was selected as the model compound because it is widely used in industries and is toxic to aquatic life olmez hanci and arslan alaton 2013 although phenol can be relatively easily oxidized by aops it is the most basic phenolic compound and shares significant similarity with many other contaminants using phenol would be therefore helpful to develop a model that can be easily adopted for a wide range of contaminants further recent advances in tools for oxidation pathway generation guo et al 2014a 2014b and reaction rate constant prediction e g quantitative structure activity relationship qsar models zhong et al 2020a 2020b can also greatly expand the application of this model to other organics extensive model tuning and validation were then carried out by fitting the model against the experimental data from both this study and the literature detailed balancing was performed to fix the reaction loop illegality issue and the model sensitivity analysis was conducted to evaluate the importance of each reaction with the developed model the effect of anions on the reaction mechanisms and the importance of different ross responsible for phenol degradation and product formation were finally evaluated 2 materials and methods details in chemicals and materials used in this study can be found in the supplementary material sm text s1 the aop systems were selected to include most of the known reaction mechanisms associated with the oxidants pms pds and h2o2 activation approaches and responsible ross a total of four pms four pds and one h2o2 systems were investigated details in text s2 detailed experimental procedures and analytical methods can be found in text s3 and table s1 including the uv intensity and pathlength determination catalyst preparation experimental setup and the quantification of pms pds h2o2 phenol and the degradation products 2 1 kinetic modeling the model development consisted of four stages i e initial development improvement tuning and validation we first conducted an extensive literature review and compiled all the major reactions that may occur in the studied systems using the search engine google scholar with the following keywords advanced oxidation processes aops kinetic modeling peroxymonosulfate pms peroxydisulfate pds h2o2 phenol oxidation pathways sulfate radicals hydroxyl radicals uv chlorine uv bromine and radical reaction rate constant the resulted records more than 5000 were screened by checking whether they contained useful contents such as the pathways and reaction rate constants of the oxidant activation reactions ros transformation and phenol transformation reactions and product formation this resulted in more than 100 kinetic modeling studies and various books and databases details in table s2 most of the reaction rate constants were obtained from the literature in case different values were found for a reaction rate constant reactions listed in table s3 the average was used if two were retrieved n 2 or median if more than two were retrieved n 2 for reactions with unknown rate constants if the reactions were between organics and radicals they were estimated based on the linear correlations between the natural log of the second order rate constant k ln k and the reduction potentials of the radicals grebel et al 2010 pavitt et al 2017 zagal et al 2019 details in fig s1 and table s4 others were assumed based on similar reactions and reactants a total of 40 were estimated or assumed table s2 as a result only eight rate constants were unknown and therefore set as the fitting parameters when fitting the model against the experimental data most of these eight rate constants were for initiation reactions for example the activation of pms by catalysts eqs 1 and 3 in table s5 for reactions that were inaccurately applied in the literature revisions were also made details in section 3 3 the whole model was built using the computer program kintecus 6 8 ianni 2019 to include the effects of ionic strength and temperature on the reaction rate constants the davies equation and the van t hoff rules respectively were applied details in text s4 for the uv based systems the photolysis rate of the oxidants for the formation of radicals may change considerably throughout the reaction due to the changing chemical composition more details about how to dynamically calculate the photolysis rate of a given system in kintecus can be found in text s5 and table s6 details of stages 1 4 of the model development can be found in text s6 2 2 detailed balancing using detbal model overparameterization control and model sensitivity analysis a variety of techniques were employed in this study during the model development including detailed balancing using detbal fig s2 model overparameterization control and model sensitivity analysis more details about these techniques can be found in texts s7 s9 3 results and discussion 3 1 performance of the nine aop systems the phenol degradation rates and oxidant utilization efficiencies were compared in the absence and presence of the anions including cl br and hco3 as shown in fig 1 in the three uv systems without the anions pds showed the highest phenol degradation rate followed by h2o2 and then pms while this order changed to pds pms h2o2 in the presence of the anions the orders of the oxidant utilization efficiencies were h2o2 pds pms and pms pds h2o2 under the uv condition with and without the anions respectively these different orders were mainly due to the different photoproperties of these oxidants and the reaction rate constants of phenol intermediates with different ross additional discussion of the observed performances can be found in text s10 3 2 initial model development stage 1 this stage of the model development mainly involved the initiation reactions table s5 and the transformation of ross overall the fittings were poor for most of the systems with r2 in the ranges of 0 94 0 96 and 0 16 0 97 for phenol and the oxidant respectively as shown in table s7 for example for the pms uv and pds uv systems the phenol degradation rates were underestimated at the beginning but overestimated at the end of the reactions fig s3 this is probably because some important reactions and intermediate transformations were not yet considered as the reaction continues intermediates may compete with the parent compound for the consumption of ross to decrease the phenol degradation rate therefore considering more reactions as well as the formation of intermediates products may significantly improve the model nevertheless at the current stage we also observed that according to the primary ros transformation pathways in the presence of halides scheme s1 some of the species such as cl2 br2 cl and ho2 served as important intermediates for the transformation of other species some of them such as cl2 and br2 were indeed later found to be important in the contaminant oxidation section 3 6 3 3 model improvement stage 2 in the process of model development we observed that some reactions had been inaccurately used in some of the previous modeling studies details in text s11 for example o2 was often treated as the product in the oh ho2 o2 type of reactions reactions 100 103 table s2 cheng et al 2018 crittenden et al 1999 grebel et al 2010 yang et al 2014 however recent studies have performed convincing experiments such as the enhancing and quenching tests on a chemiluminescence system electron spin resonance and chemical trapping by mass spectrometry to demonstrate the formation of 1o2 rather than o2 li et al 2015 lin and liu 2008 liu et al 2006 qi et al 2016 zhou et al 2013 the oh ho2 o2 type of reactions is the primary step in the formation of 1o2 in base activated pms duan et al 2018b qi et al 2016 the reactions of radical rhss with ho2 or o2 including reactions 56 57 78 79 119 137 and 138 in table s2 should also form 1o2 instead of o2 because these rhss can be easily converted from and to oh in addition the oxygen as a product in the reactions of h2o2 with hox x2 has been reported to be all at the excited state 1o2 as shown in reactions 108 111 112 123 128 129 130 and 134 in table s2 held et al 1978 khan and kasha 1970 piatt and o brien 1979 therefore although many modeling studies adopted o2 rather than 1o2 bulman et al 2019 cheng et al 2018 grebel et al 2010 yang et al 2014 zhang et al 2015 we adopted 1o2 as the product here studies have also frequently neglected the important roles of s2o8 and clo as they have been proven to be strong oxidants and can effectively oxidize a wide range of organic contaminants alfassi et al 1988 bulman et al 2019 duan et al 2018a kong et al 2018 wu et al 2016 they were included in the model more details can be found in text s11 upon the incorporation of the above reactions the improved model was fitted against the experimental data as shown in figs 2 a g by making the four unavailable rate constants reactions 1 3 5 and 6 in table s2 as the fitting parameters we were able to obtain good fittings for all the seven systems with and without the anions 14 systems in total with the r2 in the ranges of 0 98 0 999 and 0 62 0 99 for phenol and the oxidant respectively as shown in table s7 this suggested that the model can describe the systems well the correction and inclusion of the above reactions in the model significantly improved the model performance this improvement can also be explained by the important contributions of s2o8 and clo to phenol oxidation as examined in section 3 6 the sensitivity analysis in section 3 8 further confirmed that a number of the above reactions indeed ranked high in the overall importance table s8 when differences were found for some rate constants in the literature they generally differ by less than one order of magnitude the use of the mean n 2 or median n 2 for modeling did not differ significantly compared to using other values data not shown another indication of the good model performance is that the model fitted rate constant of pds activation by heat was 7 8 10 6 s 1 close to the reported value of 5 4 10 6 s 1 under similar conditions 70 c ph 5 yang et al 2019 3 4 model tuning stage 3 3 4 1 inclusion of degradation intermediates although the model developed in stage 2 showed satisfactory fitting results for both phenol and the oxidants the formation and further transformation of intermediates products were still not included overall the oxidation of phenol by radical and non radical species goes through two pathways as illustrated in schemes 1 a and b respectively more details can be found in text s12 and scheme s2 after incorporating the above pathways into the model we conducted another series of experiments with a higher initial phenol concentration for the systems of pms co3o4 pds uv and h2o2 uv with or without the anions note that although not all the 7 systems were evaluated this time the selected ones still covered all the three oxidants and two major activation approaches as it is challenging to model all possible intermediates in aops even for simple compounds kamath et al 2018 we initially only monitored some of the most important ones catechol hydroquinone and p benzoquinone the model was then fit against the experimental data as shown in figs 2h i and s4 by treating four additional unknown rate constants reactions 279 368 369 and 483 in table s2 as the fitting parameters we observed good fittings for most of the monitored systems r2 0 72 0 99 this suggested that this comprehensive model can simulate the product transformation well the details of the final model containing a total of 543 reactions can be found in table s2 3 4 2 detailed balancing using detbal the first round of detailed balancing analysis identified a total of 315 loops and two of them were illegal the fundamental elements of these loops were reactions the second round of analysis was performed by checking whether these small loops can form larger loops as a result a total of 24 illegal loops were further identified each containing small loops as the elements in addition a total of 16 loops were found to disagree with the wegscheider s condition fig s2 these issues were fixed following the approaches described in text s7 because such a detailed balancing process has not been widely adopted in the literature it would be helpful to keep but mark the reactions that were removed to illustrate the modifications as shown in table s2 26 crossed and highlighted reactions overall the removal of these reactions did not lead to significant changes in the concentrations of the species we monitored during the simulation especially when no anions were present data not shown 3 5 model validation stage 4 after the development of the model a third batch of experiments was carried out for four systems that is pms uv and pds heat with and without the anions to validate the model as shown in figs 3 a c and s5a b the model demonstrated very good simulation for phenol and the intermediates in all the four systems r2 0 68 0 99 the differences in the intermediate formation in the pms uv systems without fig 3a and with figs 3b and s5a the anions were mainly due to the significant alteration of the major ross responsible for the phenol oxidation tables s9 and s10 which resulted in different pathways of intermediate formation scheme 1 the effects of the anions are further discussed in section 3 6 in addition to the experimental data collected in this study the kinetic results for a few external systems were extracted from the literature for model validation for example an h2o2 uv system was selected under the experimental conditions of phenol 0 5 17 mm h2o2 0 0 245 m and temperature 45 c alnaizy and akgerman 2000 the uv irradiation parameters were slightly adjusted to reflect the different uv intensity effective path length and possible uv length as shown in fig 3d the model fitted moderately well to the degradation of phenol and the evolution of catechol and hydroquinone we believe these fits are reasonable given that some of the reaction conditions were unknown such as the ionic strength and potential introduction of halides during the solution preparation based on the kinetic data extrated from another study mora et al 2011 the phenol and toc total organic carbon removal was modeled for a pds heat system under three conditions as shown in figs 3e f and s5c the toc was calculated by the sum of the carbon weights from the major organic compounds including phenol o p benzoquinones and dihydroxybenzenes other species such as dihydroxybiphenyls and phenoxyphenols were also included but they did not make noticeable contributions see the excel file huang and zhang kinetic modeling xlsx in the supplementary material for details surprisingly the model demonstrated good fits r2 0 41 0 99 to the phenol and toc trends although toc was never used during the model development in addition we performed model fitting on a pds zvi zero valent iron system for p chlorophenol oxidation zhao et al 2010 a system which was not considered in our model because the mechanism is well known that is each pds forms one sulfate radical upon activation similar to the pms co3o4 system it is easy to simulate the system using our model as shown in fig s5d the fittings are also acceptable r2 0 63 0 82 given many uncertainties such as certain unknown interactions between zvi and pds unknown starting ph but likely near neutral unknown ionic strength and some potential co existing ions that were not reported in the study this further validated the obtained model 3 6 effects of the anions and contributions of different ross with the developed model the phenol degradation kinetics and the contribution of different ross can be easily simulated under different reaction conditions we added different combinations of cl br and hco3 to examine how the systems responded to the additions as shown in tables s9 and s10 in the absence of the anions the phenol degradation in all the systems is almost always attributed to well known ross or pathways this result was obtained by simply tracking the phenol reactions with all the reactive species in the kintecus program details in text s13 for example in table s9 so4 contributed to 99 8 of the phenol degradation in the pms co3o4 system and direct electron transfer was responsible for 100 in the pms femno system however in the presence of the three anions the largest contributors in the pms co3o4 system shifted to co3 72 2 and hobr 11 5 while so4 only contributed 4 6 a similar phenomenon existed in all other pms systems in addition to the reactions of the anions with the radicals cl and br can also react with pms at relatively high rates k 1 8 10 3 and 0 7 m 1 s 1 respectively to form hox and subsequently other non radical rhss huang and zhang 2020b these intermediates non radical rhss could be abundant and contributed to the fast phenol oxidation therefore the pms systems can be susceptible to the matrix effects for the pds systems in the absence of the anions table s10 direct electron transfer so4 and so4 contributed to around 100 of phenol degradation in the pds cuo pds heat and pds uv systems respectively in the presence of the three anions however the key species were found to be s2o8 in both the pds heat and pds uv systems none of the three anions affected the pds cuo system as mentioned earlier the pds cuo system under neutral conditions solely relies on direct electron transfer for phenol oxidation therefore no new ross were generated to a noticeable level to alter the reaction mechanism for the h2o2 uv system oh contributed to more than 80 of the phenol degradation under all the conditions this indicates that h2o2 uv has high robustness after pds cuo followed by all other systems this agrees well with a study reporting that cl did not exhibit noticeable effects on the 2 4 6 trichlorophenol oxidation and product formation in an h2o2 uv system fang et al 2016 this might be due to the milder scavenging effects of the anions on oh than on so4 as shown in eqs a and b x generally reacts with oh to form hox which proceeds to form oh and x in contrast x often reacts with so4 to directly form so4 2 and x according to the rate constants of reactions 37 42 62 64 66 and 67 table s2 such a scavenging effect is much more pronounced on so4 than on oh this has also been reported in another study zhang and parker 2018 therefore following the pds cuo system h2o2 uv would be the second most robust system regarding the effect of halides a oh x hox oh x b so4 x so4 2 x in addition we examined the effects of anion concentrations on the ros contribution to phenol degradation as shown in fig 4 upon the addition of the initial amounts of the anions the dominant ros in all the six systems shifted significantly from the original ones e g so4 and or oh to anion related analogues e g cl2 co3 hobr hocl with the further increase in the anion concentrations some ross showed increased and then decreased contributions while the rest demonstrated continuously increasing importance the detailed shifting patterns are highly system dependent however in the pds cuo system where phenol was always degraded through the direct electron transfer pathway the presence of the anions did not affect the ros contribution regardless of the anion concentrations data not shown the major reason that we did not consider additional anions such as phosphate and nitrate is that they generally have much less impact on the aop systems investigated in this study as shown in table s11 the second order reaction rate constants of these anions with sulfate and hydroxyl radicals are 2 6 orders of magnitude lower that those with the selected three anions the presence of nom was not considered either mainly due to its lower reaction rates with radicals in radical based systems lee et al 2020a in non radical systems nom is often less competitive compared to target pollutants due to its low electron richness while non radical systems are very selective toward electron rich species i e the target substrate duan et al 2018b lee et al 2020a in addition there are many different types of noms including different humic acids fulvic acids and humins it can be very challenging to examine all representative noms for this modeling study furthermore studies have reported that the effects of nom are much more complex than just scavenging ros which can occur in both the aqueous phase and the catalyst surface nom may also shade the photocatalytic materials from incoming photons or adsorb to the photocatalyst surfaces to potentially interfere with ros production brame et al 2015 the effects of different types of nom may also vary significantly considering such challenges and complexities we believe it is beyond the scope of this study to investigate the effects of nom in this work 3 7 prediction of intermediate formation another advantage of having a comprehensive model is to easily predict the intermediate formation under different conditions without having to carry out any experiments the simulated product formation for different systems and conditions are shown in tables s12 and s13 hco3 slightly altered the product distribution but did not change the types of products for all the systems upon the addition of cl and or br however significant amounts of halogenated products such as halophenols dihalophenols and haloresorcinols formed in all the pms based systems as mentioned above this shift was primarily due to the formed non radical rhss resulting in the halide substitution reactions in contrast halides did not exhibit such an effect in any of the pds or h2o2 systems because of the negligible formation of non radical rhss further although halides can result in radical rhss in some of the systems as mentioned above these rhss generally oxidize organic compounds through electron transfer reactions rather than halide substitution grebel et al 2010 this agrees well with another study reporting that only 0 03 of halophenols formed in an h2o2 uv system with a halide level similar to that in this study grebel et al 2010 therefore we conclude that the formation of halogenated byproducts would primarily be a concern for the pms based systems but not for the pds or h2o2 systems especially when the halide concentrations are low and the reaction time is short e g less than 60 min although not modeled the system of pms base may not form halogenated byproducts either because the reactions between pms and halides can be significantly retarded under alkaline conditions huang and zhang 2020b 3 8 model sensitivity analysis to understand the reaction importance we performed sensitivity analysis for all the systems in the presence of anions by including all the initiation reactions in table s5 in other words all the seven systems were included in one model because any changes in the system setup experimental conditions or reaction time as mentioned below can potentially change the ranking of the reactions this section mainly focuses on a qualitative demonstration rather than quantitative evaluation of the reaction importance one can use this model to perform similar sensitivity analysis for a given scenario and analyze the results with atropos in kintecus depending on their needs lee et al 2020b as shown in the excel file huang and zhang kinetic modeling xlsx in the supplementary material and fig s6 the model simulation based sensitivity analysis was conducted for the beginning 1 s the middle 480 s and the end 960 s of the reactions however as some of the reactions have not started at the beginning while others have already completed at the end the sensitivity analyses for the systems at these times may not accurately reflect the real importance of these reactions therefore hereafter we mainly interpret the results at the middle of the simulated reactions 480 s positive nscs indicate positive contributions of the corresponding reactions to the corresponding species while negative results suggest negative contributions larger absolute nsc values generally mean higher importance of the reactions as different reactions contribute differently to different species and the species of interest usually change from one case to another we decided to sum all the positive negative and absolute nsc values for each reaction to show their overall importance to the whole system as shown in the sheet sensitivity 480 s columns dp dq and dr in the excel file a total of 26 reactions highlighted were found to have no or minimum contributions to all the species most of these reactions involve uncommon species such as bro2 brocl h2o and brclo2 the reason that these reactions are not important might be related to the specific simulation conditions applied under other conditions they might be important on the other hand it is interesting to know that overall reaction 144 co3 h2o2 hco3 ho2 was the most important but negatively reaction 149 co3 s2o8 2 co3 2 s2o8 had the largest positive contribution followed by reaction 165 br hso5 hobr so4 2 this might be because the formed s2o8 and hobr are strong oxidants and can oxidize a wide range of organics or facilitate other reactions more details about the importance of each reaction can be found in the excel file by using the filters in the spreadsheet one can check which reaction is the most important for a specific species overall all the top reactions are those we are already familiar with and many of them have been included in scheme s1 it is also interesting to know that many reactions especially those related to the anions are more important than the initiation reactions in table s5 this explains why the presence of anions in some cases significantly altered the reaction pathways and the product formation with this sensitivity analysis approach one can also easily understand why and how different reaction conditions affect the target system 3 9 model applicability to other reaction systems or contaminants although the development of this model only involved seven systems it covers most of the known reaction mechanisms in aops using pms pds or h2o2 as the oxidant including radical non radical and direct electron transfer processes therefore this model can be easily applied to many other systems e g hybrid systems with only minor modifications mostly by adding necessary initiation reactions for example in a study where pds and h2o2 were activated simultaneously by uv catalyst and heat monteagudo et al 2015 existing models would not be able to provide mechanistic insights for the system however the model developed in this study can easily do so for other aops pertaining to different oxidants such as ozone e g o3 o3 uv o3 h2o2 and o3 pms these systems generally form oh and or so4 as the primary ross and thus can be well simulated using the current model as well this new model is also significant in that although only phenol was used as the parent compound it can be easily extended to many other contaminants this is because nearly half of the reactions are about the ros transformation and can be directly reused in addition phenol is the most basic phenolic compounds and shares significant similarity with many other contaminants the transformation pathways of phenol can therefore be largely applied to other phenolic compounds in future models as many phenol transformation intermediates such as monohalophenols dihalophenols dihydroxybenzenes and benzoquinones were involved in this model other aop systems involving any of these species either as parent compound or intermediate can also adopt many of these reactions moreover recent studies developed a computer program based on known reaction rules to automatically generate the reaction pathways for a given organic contaminant toward oh guo et al 2014a 2014b the reaction rate constants of the intermediates products with oh can also be predicted using reported qsar models which are under rapid development for different ross thanks to the application of machine learning zhong et al 2020a 2021 2020b the limitation of the computer program is that it is still limited to oh if it can be further improved to generate reaction pathways for other ross it can be coupled with qsar models and the model developed in this study to substantially expand the modeling applicability of these three tools in addition compared to most of the models in the literature the model developed in this study has provided both valuable methodologies and reusable contents with high quality for future model development 4 conclusion this study first evaluated the performance phenol degradation rates and oxidant utilization efficiencies of four pms four pds and one h2o2 systems for phenol oxidation in the absence or presence of halides and carbonate a comprehensive kinetic model was then built based on seven systems with over 540 reactions compared to previous modeling studies this work considerably improved the model by combining all the major reactions and revising the reactions that have been inaccurately applied in other models the observed transformation of a few intermediates products provided a more detailed understanding of the systems the application of various modeling approaches from detailed balancing using detbal and overparameterization control to model validation with additional measurements and external systems also significantly improved the reliability of the obtained model different from most other kinetic models which were built for mostly single systems the model developed in this study can be applied to complex hybrid systems involving different oxidants and or activation mechanisms our modeling results revealed that among the seven aops the pds cuo system was the most robust against the impact of halides and carbonate followed by the h2o2 uv system and then the other systems we observed that different aop systems usually share many reactions especially those associated with ros therefore developing a comprehensive model that can describe more than seven aop systems does not necessarily require many more reactions the development of this model was not simply a reaction gathering process but rather a systematic information integration process for the first time the dynamic radical formation rates for pms pds h2o2 hobr and hocl under uv irradiation were employed considering the dynamic effects of co existing species which can either block or absorb uv to reduce the intensity of uv available for radical formation studies have suggested that more attention should be paid to the important reactions and adding additional ones may not be able to improve the prediction accuracy bulman et al 2019 this is true and easy for simple systems and when the target species are the major ones however for complex systems e g hybrid systems that involve multiple oxidants activation approaches and reaction mechanisms it is usually hard to identify the most important reactions without having to compile many others in addition the importance of a reaction is always relative and subjective depending on the species of interest or the scope of the study for example the reactions that are important for mineralization of phenol are not necessarily important for its polymerization whereas both pathways are of great research interest it is tedious to develop new models each time for new goals even if they are for the same system a comprehensive model can therefore be beneficial to avoid this by capturing all these pathways in one model and help identify the important reactions for specific scopes it is then the user s decision about whether to use all or only the important ones however this model still has a few limitations first the number of the experimentally measured intermediates is small so the prediction of other intermediates may not be as reliable second only three co existing ions are considered in this study in reality many other ions and organics e g nom may also be present in the target water their roles in the kinetic model and effects on the water treatment should be investigated as well third the further transformation of some later stage species such as the ring opening acids and polymers are not well captured yet which requires additional work if they are of interest declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have

19934,potable reuse of municipal wastewater is often the lowest energy option for increasing the availability of fresh water however limited data are available on the energy consumption of potable reuse facilities and schemes and the many variables affecting energy consumption obscure the process of estimating energy requirements by synthesizing available data and developing a simple model for the energy consumption of centralized potable reuse schemes this study provides a framework for understanding when potable reuse is the lowest energy option for augmenting water supply the model is evaluated to determine a representative range for the specific electrical energy consumption of direct and indirect potable reuse schemes and compare potable reuse to other water supply augmentation options such as seawater desalination finally the model is used to identify the most promising avenues for further reducing the energy consumption of potable reuse including encouraging direct potable reuse without additional drinking water treatment avoiding reverse osmosis in indirect potable reuse when effluent quality allows it updating pipe networks or using more permeable membranes potable reuse already requires far less energy than seawater desalination and with a few investments in energy efficiency entire potable reuse schemes could operate with a specific electrical energy

widespread issue that only gains urgency as earth s human population grows and its climate changes under their influence vörösmarty et al 2000 several technologies exist for upgrading more plentiful non potable water to potable quality but all require some energy input plappally and lienhard 2012 all energy sources and particularly fossil energy sources have a significant environmental impact pehl et al 2017 as does most freshwater consumption pfister et al 2009 therefore identifying and optimizing water treatment technologies that use minimal freshwater and energy is essential for sustainable water security potable reuse of wastewater is one water regeneration paradigm that has the potential to supply people with safe potable water almost anywhere wastewater is created world health organization 2017 although the efficacy of potable reuse processes in producing clean water has been demonstrated drewes et al 2003 estimating the energy consumption associated with potable reuse is not straightforward energy requirements vary with location and water quality as well as the treatment processes selected gerrity et al 2013 it is generally accepted that the energy consumption of potable reuse is below that of seawater desalination but it is less clear how potable reuse compares to other water procurement methods such as brackish water desalination or long distance water transfer leverenz et al 2011 in contrast methods of modeling the energy consumption of seawater desalination has been considered extensively altmann et al 2019 elimelech and phillip 2011 mistry et al 2011 and we endeavor here to give the same attention to potable reuse sim and mauter 2021 used data and modeling to quantify the energy intensity of potable reuse in their review of 70 u s water reuse facilities they found four facilities with published energy consumption data which spanned the range 0 4 1 4 kwh 3 based on a wider dataset of treatment train processes and a model for treatment train energy consumption they also sim and mauter 2021 estimated that advanced treatment trains in the u s have energy consumption levels in the wide range of 0 23 2 5 kwh m3 and acknowledge that real facilities are more likely to fall on the lower end of that spectrum they also analyzed costs and air emissions externalities for these plants their study illustrates the high degree of variability in reuse processes costs and energy requirements and calls for more widespread reporting of reuse facility energy consumption in the future while it shares the aim to quantify the energy consumption of potable water reuse with the review by sim and mauter 2021 the present paper takes a different approach to quantifying the energy consumption of potable water reuse at the scheme level by modeling entire reuse schemes and examining the effects of hypothetical variations within reuse processes scheme level modeling includes processes that use energy or lose water beyond the advanced treatment plant such as soil aquifer treatment and pipe network losses and enables comparison of direct and indirect reuse schemes the present analysis aims both to fairly compare hypothetical water reuse schemes and to provide a tool for estimation of specific reuse schemes energy needs by incorporating case specific data such as the energy intensity of an existing drinking water treatment plant this study synthesizes information about the paths processes and choices involved in centralized potable water reuse to create and validate a simple model for estimating the energy consumption of both direct and indirect potable reuse schemes using the model the energy consumption of potable reuse is then compared to other methods of securing water including seawater and groundwater desalination and long distance water transfer finally we explore how design choices and future developments may affect the energy requirements of potable reuse in doing so we hope to enhance understanding of the energy consumption of potable reuse and identify influential directions for research and future practice 1 1 background potable water reuse potable water reuse is the treatment and reintroduction of wastewater into the potable drinkable water supply it holds promise as a relatively low energy way to augment the potable water supply in water scarce regions tang et al 2018 in addition potable reuse meets the need to safely reintroduce treated wastewater effluent to the water cycle although engineered potable reuse has occurred for decades it is just beginning to be adopted outside of severely drought ridden areas due to negative public perception and inconsistent legislation warsinger et al 2018a wastewater is also reused in non potable applications e g for irrigation but we limit the scope of this study to potable reuse engineered potable reuse is classified as direct or indirect depending on the path of water beyond the advanced treatment plant direct potable reuse dpr though rare in current practice sim and mauter 2021 describes a system where purified wastewater effluents are sent directly from an advanced treatment plant back into the water supply network typically passing through an engineered storage buffer and or a drinking water treatment plant on the way in indirect potable reuse ipr water is transferred from the advanced treatment plant to a natural buffer such as an aquifer or body of surface water which ultimately provides source water for drinking water treatment and subsequent potable use figure 1 illustrates the direct and indirect potable reuse schemes modeled in this paper planned potable reuse typically begins with conventional wastewater treatment and the effluent of that process then undergoes advanced water treatment processes in a reuse facility which may or may not be co located with the conventional wastewater treatment plant two previous studies provide an overview of the major steps in advanced water treatment awt gerrity et al 2013 who review the awt trains in use worldwide and sim and mauter 2021 who review the processes used at awt facilities in the u s to analyze energy consumption cost and environmental impact most advanced water treatment awt processes fig 2 begin with microfiltration mf or ultrafiltration uf to remove suspended matter including most microbes sim and mauter 2021 the mf uf permeate is passed through a cartridge filter and then usually treated with reverse osmosis ro to remove nearly all dissolved material gerrity et al 2013 the final major energy consuming step in advanced treatment is an advanced oxidation process aop to degrade remaining dissolved organics and inactivate any persisting viruses low energy post treatments such as remineralization may follow sim and mauter 2021 each major step in the reuse process plays a role in preparing water for drinking but each step consumes energy given the required pressure ro tends to be one of the more energy intensive steps although the combination of mf uf ro and aop is relatively common see table d 1 for a few examples or a more comprehensive list in office of ground water and drinking water 2017 some reuse plants forgo ro in favor of biologically active filtration if desalination is not necessary gerrity et al 2013 in large scale centralized reuse schemes a relatively small amount of reused water is blended with a larger stream from a conventional drinking water source before delivery to the consumer for example in the dpr scheme in big spring texas usa the advanced treatment plant product stream is blended in a ratio less than 1 4 with surface water before conventional drinking water treatment despite the fact that the advanced treated water is of higher quality than the surface water steinle darling et al 2016 in ipr blending occurs when advanced treated water is returned to the environment through a natural buffer where it can mix with natural groundwater as well as when water drawn from an environmental buffer is combined with water from other sources such as reservoirs the use of blending limits the size of advanced treatment plants particularly for small blending ratio dpr installations which tends to raise the cost of recycled water guo et al 2013 and can limit the efficiency of critical components such as ro pumps alternatively although they are beyond the scope of this study decentralized reuse schemes that minimize blending represent a promising approach to achieving net zero water by treating wastewater where it is created avoiding potential quality losses associated with blending and retaining thermal energy englehardt et al 2016 wu and englehardt 2016 2 contributors to energy consumption in potable reuse in this section common centralized potable reuse schemes are broken down into energy consuming processes to create a model for the total energy consumption associated with potable water reuse at the scheme level individual treatment processes are modeled using simple equations that allow for manipulation of variables that significantly affect energy consumption these process level models are combined at the treatment train and reuse scheme levels to provide a straightforward validated and replicable framework for estimating the energy consumption of potable reuse 2 1 energy consumption of advanced treatment processes this section reviews plant data and simple models for unit processes used in advanced water treatment it also specifies how unit processes will be modeled in analyzing the energy consumption of reuse schemes in section 4 2 1 1 microfiltration and ultrafiltration mf and uf are porous membrane filtration methods that have become the primary choice for ro pretreatment and are used in 71 of u s reuse facilities sim and mauter 2021 although energy consumption varies somewhat the typical energy consumption of an mf system is approximately 0 18 kwh m3 and that of a uf system is approximately 0 2 kwh m3 based on reported energy data compiled in appendix a table a 1 mf energy consumption varies primarily in proportion to transmembrane flux tangsubkul et al 2006 with higher flux and thus energy consumption potentially being tolerated to reduce the number of membrane modules and thus minimize water cost however the data in table a 1 suggest that the variations in mf uf energy consumption are small relative to the total seec of a potable reuse scheme rather than modeling these relatively low energy filtration processes in detail a default value of specific electrical energy consumption for mf uf of 0 2 kwh m3 of mf uf permeate was used in evaluating the present model and the sensitivity of scheme level seec to changes in mf uf energy consumption is reported in table 1 because the downstream ro step has a significant reject stream not all of the mf uf permeate will ultimately become potable water therefore the total energy consumption per unit volume of ro permeate of the mf uf step will slightly exceed the mf uf process seec reported above which will be accounted for in the treatment train model eq 8 2 1 2 reverse osmosis to achieve target water quality most water reclamation plants have implemented ro in their water treatment process lahnsteiner et al 2018 sim and mauter 2021 while ro processes require pumping water to high pressures typically more than 10 bar that exceed the osmotic pressure of the concentrated feedwater 1 1 typical total dissolved solids of secondary effluents fed to potable reuse plants is 600 1700 mg l with an osmotic pressure of approximately 0 3 to 1 1 bar see appendix d the advantage of using ro is that its membranes reject most solutes and produce nearly pure water baker 2004 several innovations in ro system design have served to reduce the energy consumption of ro and thus the seec of an ro system varies depending on the system design as well as the osmotic pressure of the source water and the way the system is operated almost all large scale ro plants operate in a continuous mode where water passes through the membranes continuously and the system operates near steady state although water recovery in a single stage of ro is generally limited to approximately 50 stover 2013 potable reuse systems tend to operate at much higher recovery by using a multi stage continuous ro system with two or three stages in a simple multi stage ro system the concentrate from each stage becomes the feed to the subsequent stage this design has the advantage of low capital cost due to the simplicity of the design but it requires more energy than designs involving inter stage pumps and energy recovery a multi stage ro system may use inter stage pumping to reduce energy consumption booster pumps may be added to the concentrate line between any two stages so that a lower pressure can be used in the earlier stage where the osmotic pressure is lower wei et al 2017 energy consumption may also be reduced by adding an energy recovery device erd to the reject stream from the final stage we also consider emerging semi batch and batch ro configurations due to their capabilities for high water recovery approaches to modeling energy consumption in ro systems vary widely in complexity see e g gude 2011 li 2012 li 2017 li and noh 2012 qiu and davies 2012 warsinger et al 2016 zhu et al 2009 given that ro is just one of many energy consuming steps in potable reuse this paper will utilize a basic model for ro energy consumption we assume that all ro stages operate with a given pressure pinch the minimum difference between hydraulic pressure and osmotic pressure we treat solutions as ideal because of the low salinity of municipal wastewater we assume fixed pump and energy recovery device efficiencies we neglect hydraulic pressure drop through the modules due to friction we assume each stage has an equal recovery ratio i e an equal fraction of the feed to each stage is produced as permeate membrane permeability decline over time due to fouling is not captured by the model but could be accounted for by changing the permeability input to the model the effect of permeability on reuse scheme seec is included in table 1 using these assumptions we combined the equations of werber et al 2017 and qiu and davies 2012 and added a term corresponding to a fixed pressure pinch as did warsinger et al 2016 to approximate the specific i e per unit permeate volume electrical energy consumption of continuous ro w cro 1 w cro 1 η p rr π f n 1 rr 1 n 1 n η e j w a m 1 η e 1 rr where rr is the total water recovery η p is the pump efficiency π f is the feed osmotic pressure n is the number of stages separated by inter stage pumps η e is the energy recovery device erd efficiency j w is the water flux and a m is the membranes water permeability this equation enables estimation of the energy consumption of many possible continuous ro configurations with or without inter stage pumping if no inter stage pumps are present use n 1 regardless of the number of stages and with or without an erd if no erd use η e 0 in potable reuse scenarios this model finds the energy requirement of the ro step is typically on the order of 0 6 kwh m3 of permeate far less energy than required for ro desalination of seawater which has a much higher osmotic pressure and thus requires higher applied pressure tow et al 2015 semi batch and batch ro batch ro processes are emerging desalination processes in which a volume of feed is concentrated by ro until reaching a desired salinity and then discharged batch ro configurations are promising techniques for wastewater reuse because they have been shown to have the potential for lower energy consumption at high water recovery cordoba et al 2021 efraty 2012 warsinger et al 2016 wei et al 2020 and higher resistance to inorganic scaling warsinger et al 2018b this study models the energy consumption of batch ro assuming a pressurized tank design which was demonstrated at laboratory scale with an internal bladder by wei et al 2020 semi batch ro is a commercially available process in which retentate is constantly mixed with fresh feed before recirculation through the ro module efraty 2012 semi batch ro desalitech s closed circuit ro system was demonstrated to increase water recovery in ro for potable reuse from 85 to 92 through a 2 year pilot test at the orange county water district groundwater replenishment system ocwd gwrs gu et al 2021 batch and semi batch ro may also be combined to reduce energy consumption and cost at high water recovery park and davies 2021 although the combination is not modeled in this study batch and semi batch ro have been modeled in prior studies swaminathan et al 2019 warsinger et al 2016 werber et al 2017 in this work we utilize a simplified model to estimate the energy consumption of batch and semi batch ro that is consistent with the assumptions used in the continuous ro model eq 1 while both batch and semi batch ro are susceptible to feed osmotic pressure elevation due to salt retention between cycles wei et al 2020 this effect is neglected by the simple model recommended here the low sensitivity of reuse scheme seec to feed osmotic pressure elevation is given in table 1 as explained in appendix b the seec of batch and semi batch ro can be estimated with the following equations 2 w bro 1 η p j w a m π f rr ln 1 1 rr 3 w sbro 1 η p j w a m π f 1 rr 2 1 rr where η p is high pressure pump efficiency ro concentrate management in addition to nearly pure water all types of ro create a concentrated reject stream that must be discharged appropriately the choice of method for managing the concentrate is a function of the local environment concentrate composition concentrate volume and local regulations younos 2005 large scale concentrate management methods include surface water disposal municipal sewer disposal deep well injection evaporation ponds and energy intensive brine minimization technologies subramani and jacangelo 2014 in the us surface discharge was utilized for concentrate disposal by 50 of municipal brackish water reverse osmosis plants followed by sewer discharge and deep well injection at 22 and 18 respectively mickley 2012 given that the majority of plants utilize surface or sewer discharge disposal related energy consumption will be neglected in evaluation of the model in section 4 however it is possible that future regulations may increasingly prohibit surface or sewer discharge of concentrates in situations where surface and sewer discharge are not possible the considerable and highly variable energy consumption associated with other concentrate management methods such as deep well injection would need to be taken into account sim and mauter 2021 2 1 3 advanced oxidation processes advanced oxidation processes aops are based on the in situ generation of strong oxidants primarily hydroxyl radicals for the oxidation of organic compounds and disinfection these processes are critical for wastewater treatment as wastewater contains microorganisms pharmaceutical residues disinfection byproducts and other compounds that must be degraded due to their potential effects on human health when these treated waters are used as drinking water in ultraviolet based aops the relevant reactions are initiated by absorption of ultraviolet uv photons by target molecules such as nucleic acids dna rna and trace organic chemicals torcs an aop is often one of the last treatment steps in an advanced treatment train as it can eliminate trace contaminants not removed by prior processes energy requirements for uv based aops depend on reactor design water quality treatment objectives e g log removal of specific contaminants such as the carcinogenic disinfection byproduct n nitrosodimethylamine ndma lamp type number of lamps and the choice of promoter molecule miklos et al 2018 as such reported values of energy consumption in aop systems demonstrate some variability the electrical efficiency per order e eo which is discussed in appendix c is defined as the energy in kwh needed to reduce the concentration of a target molecule by one order of magnitude in one cubic meter of water james et al 2014 in most municipal scale applications uv is applied in a continuous flow mode and as such the seec w ao can be calculated from e eo and the desired log removal lr for a given contaminant 4 w ao e eo lr we direct the reader to appendix c for further discussion of aop energy consumption modeling e eo and the derivation of eq 4 ozone based aops are also common miklos et al 2018 when ozone is used in wastewater tertiary treatment between 0 5 1 5 mg ozone is typically applied per mg dissolved organic matter the energy consumption for ozone production is between 6 to 18 kwh kg o 3 2 2 the source gives these values in kw kg but we assume units of kwh kg were intended which falls within the range of case studies for ozone production in drinking water treatment plants chang et al 2008 depending on the scale and feed gas characteristics bixio and wintgens 2006 there is little published data on the energy consumption of advanced oxidation in potable water reuse plants but a case study on the west basin water recycling facility an ipr plant in ca shows that uv h 2 o 2 advanced oxidation uses approximately 0 15 kwh m3 depending on the current plant flowrate and the number of reactors in use chang et al 2008 the ocwd gwrs reported a uv seec of 0 07 kwh m3 in 2019 burris 2019 sim and mauter s analysis sim and mauter 2021 of reuse facility data found a higher typical range of 0 28 1 0 kwh m3 for uv aops but acknowledged that the lower end of the range is more often reflected in real plants due to energy conscious process design in this paper the seec of advanced oxidation is modeled as 0 11 kwh m3 the average seec of the west basin and orange county facilities uv energy consumption data burris 2019 chang et al 2008 kawczynski 2020 in practice case specific effluent quality and the choice of other treatment steps will influence the lr required by the aop process and thus the seec of the aop 2 2 biologically active filtration biologically active filtration baf is a type of granular media filtration gmf using the biofilm that naturally occurrs on most media filters

treatment plants in the us including complementary treatment processes such as ozonation is approximately 0 37 kwh m3 office of ground water and drinking water 2017 many other baf treatment trains use gmf without gac office of ground water and drinking water 2017 gmf is also commonly used in non potable water reuse and as a pretreatment in potable reuse treatment schemes utilizing soil aquifer treatment sat as will be discussed in section 2 3 1 the energy consumption of gmf based advanced treatment in the us ranges from 0 16 0 32 kwh m3 office of ground water and drinking water 2017 2 3 energy consumption of complementary processes in centralized potable reuse schemes complementary processes both precede and follow advanced water treatment as shown earlier in fig 1 these processes include conventional wastewater treatment prior to advanced water treatment buffering environmental or engineered drinking water treatment and conveyance between treatment facilities and to end users each process involves energy consumption and or water loss both of which affect the overall energy consumption of the reuse scheme per unit volume delivered to the consumer the following sections summarize the energy consumption and when applicable water loss of these complementary processes and identify values that will be used in modeling reuse schemes energy consumption in section 4 conventional wastewater treatment is not included in the present model because it is required whether or not wastewater reuse occurs but it is discussed in appendix e 2 3 1 buffering managed aquifer recharge is a water management method by which an aquifer is recharged with treated wastewater or stormwater which is ultimately used to bolster water supply or protect depleted aquifers the two aquifer replenishment schemes generally employed are direct injection into suitable aquifers through injection wells and surface infiltration into aquifers through ponds and basins in the latter approach also known as soil aquifer treatment sat infiltration facilitates nutrient and pathogen removal from the reclaimed water in combined biological and physiochemical processes during infiltration amy and drewes 2007 reducing the need for additional post treatment steps page et al 2018 for example at the major reclamation reuse project in israel shafdan over 80 removal of dissolved organic carbon from 10 12 mg l to 1 2 mg l doc from secondary effluents occurs following a long hydraulic retention time of 6 12 months in the aquifer that enables effective biodegradation of organic matter icekson tal et al 2013 the typical water withdrawal after sat processes exceeds the volume of infiltrated water i e it includes some native groundwater to avoid contamination of neighboring pristine aquifers with recycled water negev et al 2017 therefore the sat process is modeled here as having a 100 recovery ratio with respect to the infiltrated water the energy consumption associated with a natural buffering treatment can vary widely due to the range of possible distances over which water must be transported and limited data is currently available energy consumption is mostly associated with water transfer to and from the replenishment zone injection and reclamation i e pumping out through wells from the aquifer for instance the energy consumption associated with sat in israel s shafdan reclamation system is estimated as 0 63 kwh m3 of recovered water elkayam et al 2020 this consumption includes energy for pumping effluent to the recharge basin at 0 14 kwh m3 and for recovering the water from the aquifer and transporting it approximately 30 km to the customer at 0 49 kwh m3 similarly at the ocwd gwrs 0 3 kwh m3 is used to pump to recharge basins and approximately another 0 3 kwh m3 is required for subsequent product water extraction and distribution due to the scarcity of sat seec data the total seec associated with sat including transport between the water use area and the aquifer but not including local conveyance to water users has been modeled as the average energy consumption at shafdan and ocwd 0 62kwh m3 minus the average energy consumption of potable water distribution 0 14 kwh m3 cooley et al 2012 0 48 kwh m3 of this 0 48 kwh m3 0 28 kwh m3 twice the local transport seec is modeled as being attributed to water conveyance to and from the aquifer and 0 2 kwh m3 e g for pumping up 37 m at 50 efficiency is attributed to sat itself for which the primary energy requirement is for pumping water out of the aquifer against gravity the energy consumption associated with an engineered storage buffer such as might be used in direct potable reuse is assumed to be negligible because it would ideally be placed near the reuse plant 2 3 2 conventional drinking water treatment both dpr and ipr typically blend treated water with other potable water sources and send the mixture through conventional drinking water treatment dwt which is aimed at removing dissolved organics and pathogens from water before supplying it for potable use energy consumption is affected by quality of raw water technologies used and guidelines for product quality wakeel et al 2016b from a range of water treatment plants from several countries plappally and lienhard 2012 a typical range of 0 11 kwh m3 to 0 91 kwh m3 was found we use the median energy consumption of 0 23 kwh m3 for a conventional water treatment plant as a representative value in the following analysis 2 3 3 local water conveyance local water conveyance occurs between the wastewater treatment plant and the end user and may involve several stop at facilities along the way the energy cost of this transfer varies widely between municipalities and largely depends on distance but it is also sensitive to changes in elevation pump efficiency and pipeline properties plappally and lienhard 2012 at longer distances energy cost is typically between 0 004 to 0 007 kwh km m3 but municipal pipelines delivering water to end users are usually of smaller diameter resulting in a total energy cost for water transfer of approximately 0 14 kwh m3 cooley et al 2012 most potable reuse treatment facilities are located at or near wastewater treatment facilities and so the only energy consumption of local water conveyance associated with potable reuse in this model is the average energy consumed in transporting water from the advanced treatment plant to end users which we treat as a constant 0 14 kwh m3 when evaluating reuse scheme energy requirements in section 4 however users wishing to evaluate the model for specific reuse scenarios may wish to use a different constant value based on published data for their region alternatively they may choose to model the local water conveyance energy consumption as proportional to distance traveled using a constant of proportionality derived for data in their region in modeling ipr additional energy is required to transport water to and from the environmental buffer as discussed in section 2 3 1 due to aging municipal piping systems are subject to water losses through leakage which are commonly around 10 20 in the u s and can be over 50 in developing countries hennigar 1984 hunaidi et al 2012 wakeel et al 2016b a 15 water loss in conveyance is assumed in the model based on typical water losses in the u s this loss influences the seec of reused water because more water must be produced by the reuse plant than is received by the end user 2 4 energy consumption of alternative water procurement methods the following sections briefly summarize the energy requirements of seawater and groundwater desalination and long distance water transfer which are alternative methods of augmenting water supply that will be compared with potable reuse in section 4 2 4 1 desalination desalination of natural saline water usually seawater or brackish groundwater is an increasingly common way to supplement freshwater supply ro is currently the most energy efficient process for seawater desalination altmann et al 2019 with the total energy consumption of large ro plants in the range of 3 5 4 5 kwh m3 desaldata accessed 2016 tow et al 2015 where lower salinity brackish groundwater or surface water is available it can be desalinated by ro or electrodialysis for less energy than required by seawater ro for example the wadi main jordan ro plant treats water with 2000 ppm total dissolved solids tds for 0 8 kwh m3 desaldata accessed 2016 which is in the typical range for groundwater desalination ahdab and lienhard 2021 2 4 2 long distance water transfer water may be transferred between regions when water is scarce where it is needed e g in a city or agricultural area but plentiful some distance away energy costs for this transfer depend on distance elevation gain pump efficiency and evaporation leakage rates for instance in the case of the hetch hetchy supply system water travels over 100 miles across californias central valley using the force of gravity at an energy consumption of just 5 3 10 4 kwh m3 cooley et al 2012 in contrast the energy cost for importing raw water from the colorado river and sacramento san joaquin delta to san diego is 2 kwh m3 cooley et al 2012 typical energy costs for transfer of imported water are 0 5 to 1 4 kwh m3 cooley et al 2012 3 modeling energy consumption of potable reuse schemes in this section we present a model that describes the three potable reuse schemes shown in fig 1 including two dpr schemes one with and one without drinking water treatment and one ipr scheme all scheme models explored in this study consider municipal wastewater effluent as their feedwater begin with advanced treatment and include the energy consumption and water loss associated with water conveyance energy consumption in domestic use sewage conveyance and at the conventional wastewater treatment plant see appendix e are excluded from the modeling based on the assumption that these processes would not be affected by the choice of reuse scheme as shown in fig 1 the water s path from the advanced water treatment plant to the consumers depends on the reuse scheme in the dpr scheme without drinking water treatment water moves from the advanced treatment facility to an engineered storage buffer whose energy consumption is assumed to be negligible compared to the other processes before being returned to consumers in the dpr scheme with drinking water treatment water moves from the advanced treatment facility through a drinking water treatment plant before being returned to consumers in the ipr scheme water leaving the advanced treatment plant is assumed to undergo soil aquifer treatment and then drinking water treatment and we assume no water is lost in soil aquifer treatment all reuse schemes involve the potential to lose water through leakage during conveyance and we model this leakage as occurring shortly before return to the consumer as indicated in fig 1 the model reflects this assumption by dividing the seec of all treatment processes by the recovery ratio of conveyance rr tr defined as the fraction of advanced treated water that is not lost to leakage the scheme level seec of dpr without drinking water treatment w dpr dpr with drinking water treatment w dpr d and ipr w ipr are shown in eqs 5 6 and 7 5 w dpr w awt rr tr w tr 6 w dpr d w awt w dwt rr tr w tr 7 w ipr w awt w sat w dwt rr tr w tr where w awt is the energy consumption of awt w dwt is the energy consumption of drinking water treatment w sat is the energy consumption of soil aquifer treatment and w tr is the energy consumption of transporting water locally some ipr schemes 23 in the u s sim and mauter 2021 avoid the long distance water transfer often associated with aquifer recharge by discharging advanced treated effluent to nearby surface water neglecting any surface discharge associated water losses such an ipr scheme could be modeled as dpr with drinking water treatment 3 1 the full advanced treatment train the most common awt train known as full advanced treatment consists of mf followed by ro and advanced oxidation for the three u s reuse facilities using full advanced treatment reviewed by sim and mauter 2021 train energy consumption spanned 1 1 1 4 kwh m3 the seec of the treatment train is approximately the sum of the seecs of the individual processes except that some water is removed as concentrate in the ro step because seec is calculated per unit product equal to the ro permeate volume the mf energy consumption per unit mf permeate is modified by the ro recovery ratio rr ro as shown previously by sim and mauter 2021 thus the overall seec of the full advanced treatment train w fat can be estimated with eq 8 sim and mauter 2021 8 w fat w mf rr ro w ro w ao at the ocwd gwrs mf ro and uv treatment comprise 98 of the plant s energy consumption excluding pumping to storage and injection sites 3 3 calculated from internal data from 2020 provided by mehul patel ocwd validating the focus on these three processes when estimating a full advanced treatment plant s seec if the energy consumption associated with ro concentrate disposal is significant that additional energy consumption per unit ro concentrate w disposal can be incorporated into the reuse plant s seec per unit permeate w fat disposal as follows 9 w fat disposal w mf rr ro w ro w ao w disposal 1 rr ro 1 the final term incorporates the fact that the ratio of concentrate volume to permeate volume is 1 rr ro 1 3 2 model evaluation in evaluating the model for analysis of scheme level potable reuse seec in the following sections the seec of ro if used in the reuse scheme is first estimated then the seec of full advanced treatment if used is estimated and finally the seec of the reuse scheme is estimated as described below significant variability exists within many of the processes involved in potable reuse however accuracy can be improved by using case specific values and more complex process models such as the water application value engine wave dupont water solutions 2021 the energy consumption of ro continuous batch and or semi batch was estimated with eqs 1 2 and 3 respectively using default parameters from table 1 except where noted energy consumption of the full advanced treatment train is estimated with eq 8 or eq 8 if accounting for concentrate disposal using the previously calculated ro seec and default parameters from table 1 below except where noted the energy consumption associated with ro concentrate disposal per unit volume of permeate was assumed to be negligible in the analysis that follows the energy consumption of advanced treatment whether full advanced treatment or another type for example seecs for gac based and gmf based awt are listed in table 1 was used as an input to eqs 5 7 along with default parameters from table 1 except where noted to estimate scheme level seec other researchers may estimate the seec of a reuse scheme of interest by following the procedure above making use of as many case specific values such as local water transport energy consumption or feed osmotic pressure as possible for examples of using case specific values in the estimation of seec see section 3 4 they may also choose to integrate other models for processes e g modeling uf and or ro with wave dupont water solutions 2021 or modeling the advanced treatment train with the water associated health and environmental air damages water ahead model gingerich and mauter 2012 the supplementary information contains a matlab script to facilitate evaluation of this model with default and or user specified values 3 3 model inputs and sensitivity a summary of default parameters chosen based on the literature review section 2 that are used in evaluating the model for energy consumption of reuse processes and schemes in section 4 is provided in table 1 table 1 also includes results of a one at a time sensitivity analysis in which the effects of 1 changes in each input to the model were evaluated as described in section 3 2 individually to determine the resulting change in the model output for the default scheme which was chosen to be ipr with ro with other relevant parameters equal to the default parameters in table 1 the seec sensitivity is reported as the fractional increase in scheme seec per fractional increase in the input parameter for example the seec sensitivity to osmotic pressure of 0 06 means that if the osmotic pressure of wastewater effluent increased by 10 from 0 7 to 0 77 bar the seec of the default ipr scheme would increase by approximately 0 6 from 2 078 to 2 091 kwh m3 3 4 model validation although the model is based on plant data to the extent possible published energy consumption data for potable reuse processes is limited and some theoretical modeling was required therefore this section aims to validate the model by comparing model produced estimates to available data to validate the ro portion of the model the model output was compared with data from an internal report from the ocwd gwrs which showed that the seec for a set of seven 5 million gallon per day mgd ro units with no inter stage pumping or energy recovery ranged from 0 54 0 64 kwh m3 in 2019 and with plant provided data for the gwrs overall which found an ro seec of 0 54 kwh m3 for an ro system treating feedwater with an osmotic pressure of 0 61 bar the middle of the plant s typical range see table d 1 that is otherwise modeled using default system values one isp etc see table 1 the model estimated seec is 0 56 kwh m3 in close agreement with the reported seecs internal ocwd gwrs data for energy consumption of unit processes provided by mehul patel ocwd s exercutive director of operations also lends confidence to the full advanced treatment model the total energy consumed by mf ro and uv as well as the less energy intensive flow equalization screenings lime post treatment and decarbonation during the reported period january to november 2020 was 0 908 kwh m3 4 4 while this seec is lower than that reported for the gwrs previously hutchinson 2017 the gwrs also supplies energy 0 17 kwh m3 to seawater barrier well sites or 0 30 kwh m3 to recharge basins which was likely included in the previously published figure for gwrs seec 1 12 kwh m3 using a feed osmotic pressure of 0 61 bar as described above and default values for other parameters eq 8 estimates an seec for the full advanced treatment system of 0 92 kwh m3 1 3 higher than reported to further validate the full advanced treatment train model eq 8 and the choice of relevant default values the model output was compared to published data from the leo j vander lans water treatment facility in long beach california schimmoller 2014 which treats wastewater effluent with a tds 5 5 given its proximity to the ocwd gwrs we use the gwrs s tds to osmotic pressure ratio see table d 1 to estimate the leo j vander lans facility s feed osmotic pressure as 0 41 bar of 703 mg kg fu 2014 utilizing an mf ro uv train with continuous three stage ro without either inter stage pumping or energy recovery at a recovery ratio of 92 this train requires 0 97 kwh m3 schimmoller 2014 the model predicted seec of this train using the known system parameters above and otherwise assuming default values from table 1 is 0 94 kwh m3 3 lower than actual scheme level energy data is not commonly reported but to validate the dpr model across the entire reuse scheme the predicted energy consumption has been compared to published data from the colorado river municipal water district s big spring texas dpr scheme mf ro uv aop and drinking water treatment office of ground water and drinking water 2017 which includes in its energy figure the pumping energy used for product water conveyance but does not account for water loss in pipe networks or drinking water treatment the energy consumption of the big spring dpr scheme was reported as 1 41 kwh m3 office of ground water and drinking water 2017 the modeled energy consumption of a dpr scheme without drinking water treatment using big spring s mid range osmotic pressure 1 21 bar see table d 1 and otherwise using default values table 1 and neglecting water loss in transport is 1 34 kwh m3 5 lower than the published data the consistent agreement between data and model outputs for energy consumption of ro full advanced treatment and dpr suggest that these models are capable of estimating the energy requirements of potable reuse processes facilities and schemes with reasonable accuracy even when relying on some default values for unknowns such as membrane permeability agreement of the full advanced treatment model is also reasonably good in comparison to reuse plant data reviewed by sim and mauter 2021 which found full advanced treatment plant energy consumption to vary between 1 1 kwh m3 the gwrs likely including water conveyance to an injection site and 1 4 kwh m3 the big spring facility including local conveyance and the range identified by their process based model 0 9 2 2 kwh m3 given the agreement between model outputs and treatment facility data the model described in this section and except where noted the default values provided in table d 1 will be used in the analysis that follows 4 analysis energy consumption of reuse schemes in this section the model described in section 3 is evaluated to estimate the energy consumption of several potable reuse schemes compare reuse schemes to alternative water procurement methods and evaluate the effects of design changes on reuse scheme energy consumption 4 1 energy consumption breakdown of potable reuse schemes figure 3 shows how various parts of the reuse process contribute to the energy consumption within several reuse schemes energy consumption was calculated as described in section 3 assuming 15 water loss in transit and when applicable utilizing continuous ro at 80 recovery with one inter stage pump and no energy recovery device other parameters were also assigned the default values listed in table 1 additional energy consumption required due to treating extra water to make up for water loss is tagged separately as water loss figure 3 shows that the largest contributors to seec are likely to be ro if used and in ipr water conveyance in ipr with aquifer recharge the conveyance seec shown in fig 3 includes the energy used to convey water to and from the aquifer used for recharge which can vary widely depending on the location of the aquifer relative to the wastewater and drinking water treatment facilities although the ro energy consumption is significant it is much lower than that of seawater ro see section 2 4 1 because the seec of ro scales approximately linearly with solution osmotic pressure eq 1 and municipal wastewater effluent has a very low osmotic pressure see table d 1 compared to seawater furthermore modern ro membranes designed for low salinity water tend to have a high permeability allowing for lower energy consumption cohen tanugi et al 2014 mf baf modeled here as an ozone gac process buffering drinking water treatment and the energetic effect of water loss are also significant in their energy use the energy use associated with local water transport and aops are relatively small but not negligible based on default values but these processes could be significant energy consumers in some regions the energy requirements of individual processes may vary between different treatment plants and reuse schemes and the sensitivity of overall seec to fractional changes in individual processes energy requirements is given in table 1 as a result of the energy consumption associated with these individual processes dpr without subsequent drinking water treatment and ipr using baf and natural buffering without ro use less energy than the other options which involve more redundancy 4 2 comparison of potable reuse to alternatives representative seecs for several reuse schemes and other water supply augmentation options are shown in fig 4 for potable reuse schemes model generated representative seec values are shown and the error bars estimate uncertainty in seec based on a propagation of uncertainty analysis 6 6 the propagation of uncertainty analysis assumed the following five sources of uncertainty might be most significant based on sensitivities reported in table 1 and the magnitude of variation in different parameters the water transport rr the seec of the awt process and the seecs associated with drinking water treatment and environmental buffering the uncertainty in each independent variable was estimated from variations seen in the literature review section 2 as 0 1 for transport rr 0 12 kwh m3 for drinking water treatment 0 175 kwh m3 for environmental buffering 0 08 kwh m3 for gmf based awt 0 05 kwh m3 for gac based awt 0 08 kwh m3 for full advanced treatment estimated from fig 5 a one at a time sensitivity analysis was conducted to determine the change in seec of each reuse scheme shown in fig 4 due to changing each of the parameters listed above by the stated amount consistent with a numerical propagation of uncertainty analysis the overall uncertainty shown as error bars in scheme seec was calculated as the square root of the sum of the squares of the changes to scheme seec due to the above changes in individual parameters reuse schemes involving more processes with significant uncertainty had higher uncertainty in seec for other options the chart shows the means and standard deviations of available data see section 2 4 with seecs of approximately 1 2 kwh m3 gmf based ipr and dpr without subsequent drinking water treatment and are predicted to be the lowest energy options for potable reuse among the situations considered dpr with dwt groundwater desalination when brackish groundwater is available and gac based ipr are all fairly low energy with scheme seecs of approximately 1 4 1 5 kwh m3 the ro free ipr options using baf have the advantage of not producing a brine reject stream 7 7 we reiterate that the model did not consider energy consumption due to deep well injection or further concentration of ro brine which would add to the energy consumption of reuse schemes involving ro anywhere surface or sewer discharge are not possible and likely shift favor toward ro free reuse schemes and more efficiently removing trace organic compounds schimmoller 2014 but a potential disadvantage is that they do not reduce water salinity among the higher energy options are ipr with ro long distance water transfer in many cases and seawater desalination an ipr scheme with ro has a predicted seec of 2 0 kwh m3 due to the combination of a relatively high energy reuse process ro and transportation to and from an environmental buffer long distance transportation including drinking water treatment with an estimated seec of 2 6 kwh m3 has a very large confidence interval due to the wide range of distances over which it has been implemented wakeel et al 2016a seawater desalination is the most energy intensive process considered with a mean seec of around 4 0 kwh m3 for modern ro plants cooley et al 2012 given the magnitude of variability and the importance of non energetic factors not analyzed here it is not possible to state that one of these options is universally superior however some findings are clear seawater desalination and some energy intensive water transfers use much more energy than potable reuse if no source of low salinity groundwater or surface water is nearby potable reuse is likely to be the least energy intensive option furthermore both dpr and ro free ipr use significantly less energy than ro based ipr and eliminating redundant drinking water treatment after dpr can have a significant energetic benefit 4 3 variation in energy consumption given the low energy use of potable reuse schemes relative to long distance water transfer and seawater desalination this section explores how variations in potable reuse system design and operation could affect energy consumption the baseline reuse scheme with respect to which variations are considered is ipr using full advanced treatment and sat as practiced at the ocwd gwrs default values from table 1 are used except where noted because ro can account for a large fraction of a reuse scheme s energy consumption see fig 3 changes to the design and operation of the ro subsystem affect the overall energy consumption considerably figure 5 shows how the energy consumption of a full advanced treatment train varies as a function of the type of ro and the recovery ratio of the ro step figure 5 was created by using eqs 1 3 to model ro energy consumption as a function of ro recovery ratio up to 0 555 per stage and inputting the recovery ratio and calculated ro seec into eq 8 to predict treatment train seec for continuous ro systems the number of isps was varied between 0 and 2 ro systems with isps are modeled as having one more stage than the number of isps indicated and systems were modeled both with and without 70 efficient energy recovery devices other parameters such as membrane permeability were assumed to have the default values provided in table 1 according to fig 5 batch ro semi batch ro and 3 stage continuous ro with inter stage pumps and energy recovery are predicted to be the most energy efficient processes although the seec of semi batch ro requires more energy at very high recovery ratios due to recirculation induced mixing warsinger et al 2016 depending on the ro process used the energy optimized operating rr for the ro step is in the range of 75 90 due to the balance of increasing concentrate osmotic pressure reduced mf uf flowrate per unit ro permeate and reduced brine throttling when erds are not used as the ro rr rises in general fig 5 shows that the energy consumption of continuous ro can be reduced by utilizing more complex process designs such as a time variant batch or semi batch system or a continuous system with one or more isps and an energy recovery device however complexity tends to be accompanied by capital costs as an example wei 2021 estimated that batch ro would have a 10 greater capital cost than conventional ro for seawater desalination but found that batch ro s more uniform flux distribution would enable recovery of the additional capital cost by operating at higher average flux future research on the capital cost energy efficiency trade off might shed light on which process improvements tend to be sound investments for potable reuse facilities the energy consumption of the full advanced treatment train as shown in fig 5 is largely in the range of 0 85 1 kwh m3 excluding complex ro configurations rarely used in practice for a set of default parameters table 1 including fixed feed osmotic pressure membrane permeability pump efficiency and average flux while this model was successfully validated with several reuse facilities data in section 3 4 this predicted energy consumption range is lower than the range of data reported by facilities 1 1 1 4 kwh m3 and on the low end of the range 0 9 2 2 kwh m3 estimated by the process based model of sim and mauter 2021 the higher range of facility energy use data reviewed by sim and mauter likely reflects the energy consumption associated with pumping treated water into the water supply network as it was in the 1 41 kwh m3 reported for the big spring dpr plant office of ground water and drinking water 2017 which was instead categorized as part of the reuse scheme beyond the full advanced treatment train in the present analysis figure 6 shows how different choices affect the seec of potable reuse it was created by using the present model and default values section 3 to calculate the seec of a baseline reuse scheme ipr utilizing continuous ro at 80 recovery with two stages one inter stage pump and no energy recovery device with a seec of 2 08 kwh m3 and then changing one parameter at a time and reporting the difference in scheme seec the differences explored included changes to the ro process and changes to the reuse scheme changes to the ro process such as adding an energy recovery device though not insignificant tend to have less impact on the overall seec of the potable reuse scheme the use of novel ultra high permeability ro membranes modeled as 18 lmh bar a 5 increase from the default value used in modeling could provide a 21 decrease in energy consumption this is consistent with previous findings that ultra high permeability membranes have significant promise in reducing the energy consumption of low salinity water desalination cohen tanugi et al 2014 eliminating transit water losses by updating pipe networks could significantly reduce energy consumption per unit volume delivered to the user by reducing the volume of water that must pass through the reuse process such a fix would also save non reused water from loss eliminating either ro or environmental buffering i e using dpr or a non ro ipr process reduces energy consumption substantially dpr schemes with ro may be able to forego drinking water treatment which is a significant user of energy relative to the differences between these low energy reuse schemes by blending upstream of a drinking water plant therefore dpr without subsequent drinking water treatment was also considered although uncertainty in these effects was not quantified we anticipate the uncertainties in seec associated with changes modeled in fig 6 would be smaller than seen in scheme level predictions e g error bars in fig 4 due to only changing one parameter at a time by incorporating several energy efficiency improvements the model demonstrates how the energy consumption of potable reuse might be reduced further for example a dpr scheme using a three stage ro system with 85 recovery 80 efficiency pumps two inter stage pumps an energy recovery device with 70 efficiency and membranes with a permeability of 4 l m2 hr bar 33 higher than the base case without further drinking water treatment and with only 7 5 water lost in transit was predicted to have an seec of 0 90 kwh m3 for the entire reuse scheme in this high efficiency scenario potable reuse of wastewater effluent could be accomplished for less than one quarter of the energy required for seawater desalination 5 discussion context and limitations this study s focus on direct energy consumption in potable reuse schemes does not account for embodied energy cost or environmental harm in limiting the focus to direct energy consumption we have not considered the embodied energy of the chemicals used in advanced water treatment even though the embodied energy of chemicals can be significant in drinking water treatment mo 2012 while sim and mauter 2021 showed that the vast majority of health and greenhouse gas externalities associated with potable reuse result from the generation of electricity consumed the capital costs pretreatment and cleaning chemicals labor and other inputs must be considered in techno economic environmental analysis of any water reuse project gingerich and mauter 2012 present the water ahead model and associated software for conducting a holistic environmental analysis of water treatment processes and facilities which they have already used to analyze the environmental impact of existing potable reuse plants in the united states sim and mauter 2021 in widening the scope of analysis to encompass entire reuse schemes including complementary processes such as environmental buffering the present study narrowed its focus to direct energy consumption as a single aspect of environmental impact however it could be fruitful for future research to employ the water ahead model in combination with the scheme level model presented here to analyze the environmental impact of reuse schemes given the correlation between direct energy consumption and environmental harm sim and mauter 2021 the lowest energy reuse schemes identified by the present analysis could be ideal candidates for full environmental analysis at the reuse scheme level an additional limitation of this study is that the analysis does not consider decentralized potable reuse in contrast to the centralized reuse schemes explored in this study decentralized potable reuse has the potential to reduce the energy consumption required for water conveyance and domestic water heating as well as enable almost complete local recycling of wastewater englehardt et al 2016 based on pilot scale testing and modeling a 1 mgd decentralized plant was predicted to more than offset the primary energy it requires for water treatment at a seec of 2 98 kwh m3 similar to the 2 76 kwh m3 this study predicts for ipr with ro plus conventional wastewater treatment by retaining heat and thus reducing the primary energy required for domestic water heating wu and englehardt 2016 while energy positive water reuse is a promising concept small scale systems have additional challenges related to robustness and the need for operator intervention as shown in the development of a potable reuse system to meet the water needs of 120 people at davis station antarctica zhang et al 2017 energy consumption is also not the only challenge limiting the spread of potable reuse although potable reuse has been implemented across the globe gerrity et al 2013 challenges of public perception due to disgust at the idea of drinking recycled wastewater englehardt et al 2016 persist furthermore fluctuations in the feeling of urgency surrounding water supply augmentation often on drought driven timescales too short for development of reuse facilities impede the implementation of potable reuse as demonstrated by australia s history with water reuse radcliffe and page 2020 continuous improvement to potable reuse technology at the process facility and scheme levels increasing public awareness of reused water quality and anticipation of the effects of climate change on water resources may shift attitudes in favor of potable water reuse 6 conclusions modeling based analysis found a range of 1 2 to 2 1 kwh m3 for the typical energy consumption of potable water reuse schemes including advanced treatment processes and water conveyance but excluding conventional wastewater treatment the lower end of the energy range corresponds to ipr without ro and dpr without drinking water treatment while the higher end corresponds to ipr processes that include ro groundwater desalination and water transfer over moderate distances fall within the same range of energy cost as potable reuse so those options may be competitive with potable reuse when low salinity groundwater or surface water are accessible however seawater desalination uses far more energy than potable reuse and should only be implemented once lower energy options have been exhausted examining entire reuse schemes rather than individual plants or processes revealed the similarity in energy consumption of dpr and ro free ipr which were the lowest energy options identified depending on the proximity of a suitable aquifer for sat and the availability of surface sewer discharge of ro concentrate either a natural process based ipr scheme or a membrane based dpr scheme especially without redundant drinking water treatment is likely to be the lowest energy water reuse option further reductions in energy consumption are possible fixing leaks in the water supply network would have a significant effect on each scheme s energy consumption by reducing the amount of water subject to energy intensive advanced treatment high permeability ro membranes which are an area of ongoing research would also reduce energy consumption in potable reuse meaningfully other changes to ro systems used in reuse plants such as installing energy recovery devices would have small but still significant effects on energy consumption with a few efficiency upgrades a dpr system without subsequent drinking water treatment could have a total scheme energy consumption of less than 1 kwh m3 as potable reuse becomes more widespread the technology will continue to benefit from research and optimization additional analysis of the environmental impact cost and efficacy of direct and ro free indirect potable reuse schemes is needed to increase adoption of water reuse and improve the sustainability of water supplies however future potential aside potable reuse is already a far less energy intensive option than seawater desalination and often long distance water transfer and a

are pumps feed pump backwash pump cleaning pumps backwash and concentrate transfer pump and the air compressors and air blowers used for air scouring in cleaning as an example the orange county water district advanced water purification facility ocwd awpf utilizes a multiple barrier approach to recycle secondary treated wastewater for ipr which includes mf ishida et al 2015 their mf system is designed for 86 mgd production of mf filtrate using 0 2 μ m polypropylene hollow fiber membranes operating at 88 90 recovery backwashing and air scouring was conducted every 22 min the normalized energy cost for the mf system was 0 072 kwh m3 additional data for mf uf energy consumption in a range of plants are reported in table a 1 appendix b batch and semi batch ro energy modeling in the present model osmotic pressure will be assumed to vary linearly with salinity reasonable for low salinity feeds lienhard et al 2017 such as municipal wastewater and the ro module will be assumed to be very short additionally concentration polarization salt permeation and viscous friction will be neglected due to the final assumption the power required by the circulation pumps shown in fig 1 is calculated as zero as shown by warsinger et al 2016 batch and semi batch ro have lower osmotic pressure at the ro module feed outlet than continuous ro for an idealized very short ro module with an infinitesimal recovery ratio the feed pressure can be related to instantaneous recovery ratio rr i defined as the ratio of the volume of permeate produced by a given time to the volume of feed that will be consumed in an entire batch cycle as follows for batch ro the total salt mass in the system stays constant throughout each cycle so the salinity and thus assuming it is proportional osmotic pressure rises inversely with the remaining volume of feed in the absence of concentration polarization the feed pressure required for batch ro δ p bro i is approximated by eq b 1 b 1 δ p bro i j w a m π f 1 1 rr i where j w is the water flux a m is the membranes water permeability and π f is the feed osmotic pressure in semi batch ro the system volume is constant and therefore feed must be introduced at a constant rate to make up for the permeate produced as a result the feed osmotic pressure increases linearly with permeate production and instantaneous recovery ratio see fig 10 in warsinger et al 2016 therefore the feed pressure required for semi batch ro δ p sbro can be approximated by eq b 2 b 2 δ p sbro i j w a m π f 1 rr rr i 1 rr where rr is the total recovery ratio of the ro system for a constant volume batch or semi batch ro system the flow rate through high pressure pump is equal to the permeate flow rate during permeate production and concentrate is discharged at atmospheric pressure at the end of a cycle the seec for either of these systems w is then the ratio of the permeate volume averaged pressure to the pump efficiency b 3 w 1 η p v p 0 v p δ p i d v p i 1 η p rr 0 rr δ p i drr i where η p is the high pressure pump efficiency and v p is the permeate volume of one cycle and v p i is the permeate volume produced during a cycle at a particular time integrating eq b 3 for batch ro and semi batch ro lead to eqs 2 and 3 respectively in the main text byt appendix c energy consumption of advanced oxidation processes for direct photolysis applications in which the contaminant is present at low concentration it can be shown that local reaction rates are first order with respect to local fluence rate and reactant concentration for uv based aops the governing reactions are first order or pseudo first order processes as well at least to a first approximation as such the concept of e eo can be used for approximate comparisons of energy use among uv based water treatment processes and for approximate scaling of energy costs from small scale reactors to larger reactors of similar design bolton et al 2001 a fundamental expression to describe photochemical kinetics is as follows c 1 r b d b d t i a ϕ λ where r b is the rate of reaction of the target molecule b in mol l s b is the activity of b in solution mol l t equals time s i a is the volumetric rate of photon absorption by b einstein l s and ϕ is the primary quantum yield for reaction of interest mol einstein the volumetric rate of photon absorption by the photochemical target b will depend on system geometry and other factors perhaps the simplest reactor system to consider is a shallow well mixed batch reactor that is subjected to a beam of uniform collimated radiation if the effects of reflection dissipation and beam divergence are ignored it is possible to define the volumetric rate of photon absorption for this system c 2 i a a e i e t v u where a is the surface area of irradiated fluid e i and e t are the incident and transmitted fluences respectively v is the volume of irradiated fluid and u is the energy per einstein of incident radiation by application of the beer lambert law eq 2 can be re written as c 3 i a e i 1 10 ε b l l u for dilute solutions the exponent of the term on the right hand side of this system can be re defined using a taylor series expansion such that c 4 r b d b d t 2 3 e i ϵ b u ϕ equation 4 indicates that in the limit of dilute solution the kinetics of a photochemical process are first order with respect to the fluence rate and the concentration of the reacting compound this equation also indicates that the rate of this photochemical reaction is directly proportional to the values of the molar absorption coefficient ϵ and the quantum yield ϕ thus the reaction extent and the actual power consumption per unit flow rate w can be related to single parameter the electrical efficiency per order e eo as follows bolton et al 2001 bolton and stefan 2002 c 5 e eo w log 10 b 0 b thus the energy consumption of the uv aop scales linearly with both e eo and log removal as seen in eq 4 appendix d potable reuse plants and their feedwater characteristics the composition of secondary wastewater effluent affects the reuse process in terms of the treatment steps needed their energy consumption and practical limits on water

wastewater treatment wastewater treatment improves wastewater quality to allow its discharge to the environment or reuse in an awt plant in 2013 a report from the electric power research institute

19934,potable reuse of municipal wastewater is often the lowest energy option for increasing the availability of fresh water however limited data are available on the energy consumption of potable reuse facilities and schemes and the many variables affecting energy consumption obscure the process of estimating energy requirements by synthesizing available data and developing a simple model for the energy consumption of centralized potable reuse schemes this study provides a framework for understanding when potable reuse is the lowest energy option for augmenting water supply the model is evaluated to determine a representative range for the specific electrical energy consumption of direct and indirect potable reuse schemes and compare potable reuse to other water supply augmentation options such as seawater desalination finally the model is used to identify the most promising avenues for further reducing the energy consumption of potable reuse including encouraging direct potable reuse without additional drinking water treatment avoiding reverse osmosis in indirect potable reuse when effluent quality allows it updating pipe networks or using more permeable membranes potable reuse already requires far less energy than seawater desalination and with a few investments in energy efficiency entire potable reuse schemes could operate with a specific electrical energy

widespread issue that only gains urgency as earth s human population grows and its climate changes under their influence vörösmarty et al 2000 several technologies exist for upgrading more plentiful non potable water to potable quality but all require some energy input plappally and lienhard 2012 all energy sources and particularly fossil energy sources have a significant environmental impact pehl et al 2017 as does most freshwater consumption pfister et al 2009 therefore identifying and optimizing water treatment technologies that use minimal freshwater and energy is essential for sustainable water security potable reuse of wastewater is one water regeneration paradigm that has the potential to supply people with safe potable water almost anywhere wastewater is created world health organization 2017 although the efficacy of potable reuse processes in producing clean water has been demonstrated drewes et al 2003 estimating the energy consumption associated with potable reuse is not straightforward energy requirements vary with location and water quality as well as the treatment processes selected gerrity et al 2013 it is generally accepted that the energy consumption of potable reuse is below that of seawater desalination but it is less clear how potable reuse compares to other water procurement methods such as brackish water desalination or long distance water transfer leverenz et al 2011 in contrast methods of modeling the energy consumption of seawater desalination has been considered extensively altmann et al 2019 elimelech and phillip 2011 mistry et al 2011 and we endeavor here to give the same attention to potable reuse sim and mauter 2021 used data and modeling to quantify the energy intensity of potable reuse in their review of 70 u s water reuse facilities they found four facilities with published energy consumption data which spanned the range 0 4 1 4 kwh 3 based on a wider dataset of treatment train processes and a model for treatment train energy consumption they also sim and mauter 2021 estimated that advanced treatment trains in the u s have energy consumption levels in the wide range of 0 23 2 5 kwh m3 and acknowledge that real facilities are more likely to fall on the lower end of that spectrum they also analyzed costs and air emissions externalities for these plants their study illustrates the high degree of variability in reuse processes costs and energy requirements and calls for more widespread reporting of reuse facility energy consumption in the future while it shares the aim to quantify the energy consumption of potable water reuse with the review by sim and mauter 2021 the present paper takes a different approach to quantifying the energy consumption of potable water reuse at the scheme level by modeling entire reuse schemes and examining the effects of hypothetical variations within reuse processes scheme level modeling includes processes that use energy or lose water beyond the advanced treatment plant such as soil aquifer treatment and pipe network losses and enables comparison of direct and indirect reuse schemes the present analysis aims both to fairly compare hypothetical water reuse schemes and to provide a tool for estimation of specific reuse schemes energy needs by incorporating case specific data such as the energy intensity of an existing drinking water treatment plant this study synthesizes information about the paths processes and choices involved in centralized potable water reuse to create and validate a simple model for estimating the energy consumption of both direct and indirect potable reuse schemes using the model the energy consumption of potable reuse is then compared to other methods of securing water including seawater and groundwater desalination and long distance water transfer finally we explore how design choices and future developments may affect the energy requirements of potable reuse in doing so we hope to enhance understanding of the energy consumption of potable reuse and identify influential directions for research and future practice 1 1 background potable water reuse potable water reuse is the treatment and reintroduction of wastewater into the potable drinkable water supply it holds promise as a relatively low energy way to augment the potable water supply in water scarce regions tang et al 2018 in addition potable reuse meets the need to safely reintroduce treated wastewater effluent to the water cycle although engineered potable reuse has occurred for decades it is just beginning to be adopted outside of severely drought ridden areas due to negative public perception and inconsistent legislation warsinger et al 2018a wastewater is also reused in non potable applications e g for irrigation but we limit the scope of this study to potable reuse engineered potable reuse is classified as direct or indirect depending on the path of water beyond the advanced treatment plant direct potable reuse dpr though rare in current practice sim and mauter 2021 describes a system where purified wastewater effluents are sent directly from an advanced treatment plant back into the water supply network typically passing through an engineered storage buffer and or a drinking water treatment plant on the way in indirect potable reuse ipr water is transferred from the advanced treatment plant to a natural buffer such as an aquifer or body of surface water which ultimately provides source water for drinking water treatment and subsequent potable use figure 1 illustrates the direct and indirect potable reuse schemes modeled in this paper planned potable reuse typically begins with conventional wastewater treatment and the effluent of that process then undergoes advanced water treatment processes in a reuse facility which may or may not be co located with the conventional wastewater treatment plant two previous studies provide an overview of the major steps in advanced water treatment awt gerrity et al 2013 who review the awt trains in use worldwide and sim and mauter 2021 who review the processes used at awt facilities in the u s to analyze energy consumption cost and environmental impact most advanced water treatment awt processes fig 2 begin with microfiltration mf or ultrafiltration uf to remove suspended matter including most microbes sim and mauter 2021 the mf uf permeate is passed through a cartridge filter and then usually treated with reverse osmosis ro to remove nearly all dissolved material gerrity et al 2013 the final major energy consuming step in advanced treatment is an advanced oxidation process aop to degrade remaining dissolved organics and inactivate any persisting viruses low energy post treatments such as remineralization may follow sim and mauter 2021 each major step in the reuse process plays a role in preparing water for drinking but each step consumes energy given the required pressure ro tends to be one of the more energy intensive steps although the combination of mf uf ro and aop is relatively common see table d 1 for a few examples or a more comprehensive list in office of ground water and drinking water 2017 some reuse plants forgo ro in favor of biologically active filtration if desalination is not necessary gerrity et al 2013 in large scale centralized reuse schemes a relatively small amount of reused water is blended with a larger stream from a conventional drinking water source before delivery to the consumer for example in the dpr scheme in big spring texas usa the advanced treatment plant product stream is blended in a ratio less than 1 4 with surface water before conventional drinking water treatment despite the fact that the advanced treated water is of higher quality than the surface water steinle darling et al 2016 in ipr blending occurs when advanced treated water is returned to the environment through a natural buffer where it can mix with natural groundwater as well as when water drawn from an environmental buffer is combined with water from other sources such as reservoirs the use of blending limits the size of advanced treatment plants particularly for small blending ratio dpr installations which tends to raise the cost of recycled water guo et al 2013 and can limit the efficiency of critical components such as ro pumps alternatively although they are beyond the scope of this study decentralized reuse schemes that minimize blending represent a promising approach to achieving net zero water by treating wastewater where it is created avoiding potential quality losses associated with blending and retaining thermal energy englehardt et al 2016 wu and englehardt 2016 2 contributors to energy consumption in potable reuse in this section common centralized potable reuse schemes are broken down into energy consuming processes to create a model for the total energy consumption associated with potable water reuse at the scheme level individual treatment processes are modeled using simple equations that allow for manipulation of variables that significantly affect energy consumption these process level models are combined at the treatment train and reuse scheme levels to provide a straightforward validated and replicable framework for estimating the energy consumption of potable reuse 2 1 energy consumption of advanced treatment processes this section reviews plant data and simple models for unit processes used in advanced water treatment it also specifies how unit processes will be modeled in analyzing the energy consumption of reuse schemes in section 4 2 1 1 microfiltration and ultrafiltration mf and uf are porous membrane filtration methods that have become the primary choice for ro pretreatment and are used in 71 of u s reuse facilities sim and mauter 2021 although energy consumption varies somewhat the typical energy consumption of an mf system is approximately 0 18 kwh m3 and that of a uf system is approximately 0 2 kwh m3 based on reported energy data compiled in appendix a table a 1 mf energy consumption varies primarily in proportion to transmembrane flux tangsubkul et al 2006 with higher flux and thus energy consumption potentially being tolerated to reduce the number of membrane modules and thus minimize water cost however the data in table a 1 suggest that the variations in mf uf energy consumption are small relative to the total seec of a potable reuse scheme rather than modeling these relatively low energy filtration processes in detail a default value of specific electrical energy consumption for mf uf of 0 2 kwh m3 of mf uf permeate was used in evaluating the present model and the sensitivity of scheme level seec to changes in mf uf energy consumption is reported in table 1 because the downstream ro step has a significant reject stream not all of the mf uf permeate will ultimately become potable water therefore the total energy consumption per unit volume of ro permeate of the mf uf step will slightly exceed the mf uf process seec reported above which will be accounted for in the treatment train model eq 8 2 1 2 reverse osmosis to achieve target water quality most water reclamation plants have implemented ro in their water treatment process lahnsteiner et al 2018 sim and mauter 2021 while ro processes require pumping water to high pressures typically more than 10 bar that exceed the osmotic pressure of the concentrated feedwater 1 1 typical total dissolved solids of secondary effluents fed to potable reuse plants is 600 1700 mg l with an osmotic pressure of approximately 0 3 to 1 1 bar see appendix d the advantage of using ro is that its membranes reject most solutes and produce nearly pure water baker 2004 several innovations in ro system design have served to reduce the energy consumption of ro and thus the seec of an ro system varies depending on the system design as well as the osmotic pressure of the source water and the way the system is operated almost all large scale ro plants operate in a continuous mode where water passes through the membranes continuously and the system operates near steady state although water recovery in a single stage of ro is generally limited to approximately 50 stover 2013 potable reuse systems tend to operate at much higher recovery by using a multi stage continuous ro system with two or three stages in a simple multi stage ro system the concentrate from each stage becomes the feed to the subsequent stage this design has the advantage of low capital cost due to the simplicity of the design but it requires more energy than designs involving inter stage pumps and energy recovery a multi stage ro system may use inter stage pumping to reduce energy consumption booster pumps may be added to the concentrate line between any two stages so that a lower pressure can be used in the earlier stage where the osmotic pressure is lower wei et al 2017 energy consumption may also be reduced by adding an energy recovery device erd to the reject stream from the final stage we also consider emerging semi batch and batch ro configurations due to their capabilities for high water recovery approaches to modeling energy consumption in ro systems vary widely in complexity see e g gude 2011 li 2012 li 2017 li and noh 2012 qiu and davies 2012 warsinger et al 2016 zhu et al 2009 given that ro is just one of many energy consuming steps in potable reuse this paper will utilize a basic model for ro energy consumption we assume that all ro stages operate with a given pressure pinch the minimum difference between hydraulic pressure and osmotic pressure we treat solutions as ideal because of the low salinity of municipal wastewater we assume fixed pump and energy recovery device efficiencies we neglect hydraulic pressure drop through the modules due to friction we assume each stage has an equal recovery ratio i e an equal fraction of the feed to each stage is produced as permeate membrane permeability decline over time due to fouling is not captured by the model but could be accounted for by changing the permeability input to the model the effect of permeability on reuse scheme seec is included in table 1 using these assumptions we combined the equations of werber et al 2017 and qiu and davies 2012 and added a term corresponding to a fixed pressure pinch as did warsinger et al 2016 to approximate the specific i e per unit permeate volume electrical energy consumption of continuous ro w cro 1 w cro 1 η p rr π f n 1 rr 1 n 1 n η e j w a m 1 η e 1 rr where rr is the total water recovery η p is the pump efficiency π f is the feed osmotic pressure n is the number of stages separated by inter stage pumps η e is the energy recovery device erd efficiency j w is the water flux and a m is the membranes water permeability this equation enables estimation of the energy consumption of many possible continuous ro configurations with or without inter stage pumping if no inter stage pumps are present use n 1 regardless of the number of stages and with or without an erd if no erd use η e 0 in potable reuse scenarios this model finds the energy requirement of the ro step is typically on the order of 0 6 kwh m3 of permeate far less energy than required for ro desalination of seawater which has a much higher osmotic pressure and thus requires higher applied pressure tow et al 2015 semi batch and batch ro batch ro processes are emerging desalination processes in which a volume of feed is concentrated by ro until reaching a desired salinity and then discharged batch ro configurations are promising techniques for wastewater reuse because they have been shown to have the potential for lower energy consumption at high water recovery cordoba et al 2021 efraty 2012 warsinger et al 2016 wei et al 2020 and higher resistance to inorganic scaling warsinger et al 2018b this study models the energy consumption of batch ro assuming a pressurized tank design which was demonstrated at laboratory scale with an internal bladder by wei et al 2020 semi batch ro is a commercially available process in which retentate is constantly mixed with fresh feed before recirculation through the ro module efraty 2012 semi batch ro desalitech s closed circuit ro system was demonstrated to increase water recovery in ro for potable reuse from 85 to 92 through a 2 year pilot test at the orange county water district groundwater replenishment system ocwd gwrs gu et al 2021 batch and semi batch ro may also be combined to reduce energy consumption and cost at high water recovery park and davies 2021 although the combination is not modeled in this study batch and semi batch ro have been modeled in prior studies swaminathan et al 2019 warsinger et al 2016 werber et al 2017 in this work we utilize a simplified model to estimate the energy consumption of batch and semi batch ro that is consistent with the assumptions used in the continuous ro model eq 1 while both batch and semi batch ro are susceptible to feed osmotic pressure elevation due to salt retention between cycles wei et al 2020 this effect is neglected by the simple model recommended here the low sensitivity of reuse scheme seec to feed osmotic pressure elevation is given in table 1 as explained in appendix b the seec of batch and semi batch ro can be estimated with the following equations 2 w bro 1 η p j w a m π f rr ln 1 1 rr 3 w sbro 1 η p j w a m π f 1 rr 2 1 rr where η p is high pressure pump efficiency ro concentrate management in addition to nearly pure water all types of ro create a concentrated reject stream that must be discharged appropriately the choice of method for managing the concentrate is a function of the local environment concentrate composition concentrate volume and local regulations younos 2005 large scale concentrate management methods include surface water disposal municipal sewer disposal deep well injection evaporation ponds and energy intensive brine minimization technologies subramani and jacangelo 2014 in the us surface discharge was utilized for concentrate disposal by 50 of municipal brackish water reverse osmosis plants followed by sewer discharge and deep well injection at 22 and 18 respectively mickley 2012 given that the majority of plants utilize surface or sewer discharge disposal related energy consumption will be neglected in evaluation of the model in section 4 however it is possible that future regulations may increasingly prohibit surface or sewer discharge of concentrates in situations where surface and sewer discharge are not possible the considerable and highly variable energy consumption associated with other concentrate management methods such as deep well injection would need to be taken into account sim and mauter 2021 2 1 3 advanced oxidation processes advanced oxidation processes aops are based on the in situ generation of strong oxidants primarily hydroxyl radicals for the oxidation of organic compounds and disinfection these processes are critical for wastewater treatment as wastewater contains microorganisms pharmaceutical residues disinfection byproducts and other compounds that must be degraded due to their potential effects on human health when these treated waters are used as drinking water in ultraviolet based aops the relevant reactions are initiated by absorption of ultraviolet uv photons by target molecules such as nucleic acids dna rna and trace organic chemicals torcs an aop is often one of the last treatment steps in an advanced treatment train as it can eliminate trace contaminants not removed by prior processes energy requirements for uv based aops depend on reactor design water quality treatment objectives e g log removal of specific contaminants such as the carcinogenic disinfection byproduct n nitrosodimethylamine ndma lamp type number of lamps and the choice of promoter molecule miklos et al 2018 as such reported values of energy consumption in aop systems demonstrate some variability the electrical efficiency per order e eo which is discussed in appendix c is defined as the energy in kwh needed to reduce the concentration of a target molecule by one order of magnitude in one cubic meter of water james et al 2014 in most municipal scale applications uv is applied in a continuous flow mode and as such the seec w ao can be calculated from e eo and the desired log removal lr for a given contaminant 4 w ao e eo lr we direct the reader to appendix c for further discussion of aop energy consumption modeling e eo and the derivation of eq 4 ozone based aops are also common miklos et al 2018 when ozone is used in wastewater tertiary treatment between 0 5 1 5 mg ozone is typically applied per mg dissolved organic matter the energy consumption for ozone production is between 6 to 18 kwh kg o 3 2 2 the source gives these values in kw kg but we assume units of kwh kg were intended which falls within the range of case studies for ozone production in drinking water treatment plants chang et al 2008 depending on the scale and feed gas characteristics bixio and wintgens 2006 there is little published data on the energy consumption of advanced oxidation in potable water reuse plants but a case study on the west basin water recycling facility an ipr plant in ca shows that uv h 2 o 2 advanced oxidation uses approximately 0 15 kwh m3 depending on the current plant flowrate and the number of reactors in use chang et al 2008 the ocwd gwrs reported a uv seec of 0 07 kwh m3 in 2019 burris 2019 sim and mauter s analysis sim and mauter 2021 of reuse facility data found a higher typical range of 0 28 1 0 kwh m3 for uv aops but acknowledged that the lower end of the range is more often reflected in real plants due to energy conscious process design in this paper the seec of advanced oxidation is modeled as 0 11 kwh m3 the average seec of the west basin and orange county facilities uv energy consumption data burris 2019 chang et al 2008 kawczynski 2020 in practice case specific effluent quality and the choice of other treatment steps will influence the lr required by the aop process and thus the seec of the aop 2 2 biologically active filtration biologically active filtration baf is a type of granular media filtration gmf using the biofilm that naturally occurrs on most media filters to biodegrade dissolved organic contaminants khan 2013 office of ground water and drinking water 2017 schimmoller 2014 baf alone is inadequate for high salinity applications due to its inability to remove tds office of ground water and drinking water 2017 most baf based potable water reuse treatment trains in the u s use granular activated carbon gac as a filter medium schimmoller 2014 gac is absorptive and highly porous allowing for more microbial growth than other media such as sand and anthracite office of ground water and drinking water 2017 the energy consumption of gac based advanced treatment plants in the us including complementary treatment processes such as ozonation is approximately 0 37 kwh m3 office of ground water and drinking water 2017 many other baf treatment trains use gmf without gac office of ground water and drinking water 2017 gmf is also commonly used in non potable water reuse and as a pretreatment in potable reuse treatment schemes utilizing soil aquifer treatment sat as will be discussed in section 2 3 1 the energy consumption of gmf based advanced treatment in the us ranges from 0 16 0 32 kwh m3 office of ground water and drinking water 2017 2 3 energy consumption of complementary processes in centralized potable reuse schemes complementary processes both precede and follow advanced water treatment as shown earlier in fig 1 these processes include conventional wastewater treatment prior to advanced water treatment buffering environmental or engineered drinking water treatment and conveyance between treatment facilities and to end users each process involves energy consumption and or water loss both of which affect the overall energy consumption of the reuse scheme per unit volume delivered to the consumer the following sections summarize the energy consumption and when applicable water loss of these complementary processes and identify values that will be used in modeling reuse schemes energy consumption in section 4 conventional wastewater treatment is not included in the present model because it is required whether or not wastewater reuse occurs but it is discussed in appendix e 2 3 1 buffering managed aquifer recharge is a water management method by which an aquifer is recharged with treated wastewater or stormwater which is ultimately used to bolster water supply or protect depleted aquifers the two aquifer replenishment schemes generally employed are direct injection into suitable aquifers through injection wells and surface infiltration into aquifers through ponds and basins in the latter approach also known as soil aquifer treatment sat infiltration facilitates nutrient and pathogen removal from the reclaimed water in combined biological and physiochemical processes during infiltration amy and drewes 2007 reducing the need for additional post treatment steps page et al 2018 for example at the major reclamation reuse project in israel shafdan over 80 removal of dissolved organic carbon from 10 12 mg l to 1 2 mg l doc from secondary effluents occurs following a long hydraulic retention time of 6 12 months in the aquifer that enables effective biodegradation of organic matter icekson tal et al 2013 the typical water withdrawal after sat processes exceeds the volume of infiltrated water i e it includes some native groundwater to avoid contamination of neighboring pristine aquifers with recycled water negev et al 2017 therefore the sat process is modeled here as having a 100 recovery ratio with respect to the infiltrated water the energy consumption associated with a natural buffering treatment can vary widely due to the range of possible distances over which water must be transported and limited data is currently available energy consumption is mostly associated with water transfer to and from the replenishment zone injection and reclamation i e pumping out through wells from the aquifer for instance the energy consumption associated with sat in israel s shafdan reclamation system is estimated as 0 63 kwh m3 of recovered water elkayam et al 2020 this consumption includes energy for pumping effluent to the recharge basin at 0 14 kwh m3 and for recovering the water from the aquifer and transporting it approximately 30 km to the customer at 0 49 kwh m3 similarly at the ocwd gwrs 0 3 kwh m3 is used to pump to recharge basins and approximately another 0 3 kwh m3 is required for subsequent product water extraction and distribution due to the scarcity of sat seec data the total seec associated with sat including transport between the water use area and the aquifer but not including local conveyance to water users has been modeled as the average energy consumption at shafdan and ocwd 0 62kwh m3 minus the average energy consumption of potable water distribution 0 14 kwh m3 cooley et al 2012 0 48 kwh m3 of this 0 48 kwh m3 0 28 kwh m3 twice the local transport seec is modeled as being attributed to water conveyance to and from the aquifer and 0 2 kwh m3 e g for pumping up 37 m at 50 efficiency is attributed to sat itself for which the primary energy requirement is for pumping water out of the aquifer against gravity the energy consumption associated with an engineered storage buffer such as might be used in direct potable reuse is assumed to be negligible because it would ideally be placed near the reuse plant 2 3 2 conventional drinking water treatment both dpr and ipr typically blend treated water with other potable water sources and send the mixture through conventional drinking water treatment dwt which is aimed at removing dissolved organics and pathogens from water before supplying it for potable use energy consumption is affected by quality of raw water technologies used and guidelines for product quality wakeel et al 2016b from a range of water treatment plants from several countries plappally and lienhard 2012 a typical range of 0 11 kwh m3 to 0 91 kwh m3 was found we use the median energy consumption of 0 23 kwh m3 for a conventional water treatment plant as a representative value in the following analysis 2 3 3 local water conveyance local water conveyance occurs between the wastewater treatment plant and the end user and may involve several stop at facilities along the way the energy cost of this transfer varies widely between municipalities and largely depends on distance but it is also sensitive to changes in elevation pump efficiency and pipeline properties plappally and lienhard 2012 at longer distances energy cost is typically between 0 004 to 0 007 kwh km m3 but municipal pipelines delivering water to end users are usually of smaller diameter resulting in a total energy cost for water transfer of approximately 0 14 kwh m3 cooley et al 2012 most potable reuse treatment facilities are located at or near wastewater treatment facilities and so the only energy consumption of local water conveyance associated with potable reuse in this model is the average energy consumed in transporting water from the advanced treatment plant to end users which we treat as a constant 0 14 kwh m3 when evaluating reuse scheme energy requirements in section 4 however users wishing to evaluate the model for specific reuse scenarios may wish to use a different constant value based on published data for their region alternatively they may choose to model the local water conveyance energy consumption as proportional to distance traveled using a constant of proportionality derived for data in their region in modeling ipr additional energy is required to transport water to and from the environmental buffer as discussed in section 2 3 1 due to aging municipal piping systems are subject to water losses through leakage which are commonly around 10 20 in the u s and can be over 50 in developing countries hennigar 1984 hunaidi et al 2012 wakeel et al 2016b a 15 water loss in conveyance is assumed in the model based on typical water losses in the u s this loss influences the seec of reused water because more water must be produced by the reuse plant than is received by the end user 2 4 energy consumption of alternative water procurement methods the following sections briefly summarize the energy requirements of seawater and groundwater desalination and long distance water transfer which are alternative methods of augmenting water supply that will be compared with potable reuse in section 4 2 4 1 desalination desalination of natural saline water usually seawater or brackish groundwater is an increasingly common way to supplement freshwater supply ro is currently the most energy efficient process for seawater desalination altmann et al 2019 with the total energy consumption of large ro plants in the range of 3 5 4 5 kwh m3 desaldata accessed 2016 tow et al 2015 where lower salinity brackish groundwater or surface water is available it can be desalinated by ro or electrodialysis for less energy than required by seawater ro for example the wadi main jordan ro plant treats water with 2000 ppm total dissolved solids tds for 0 8 kwh m3 desaldata accessed 2016 which is in the typical range for groundwater desalination ahdab and lienhard 2021 2 4 2 long distance water transfer water may be transferred between regions when water is scarce where it is needed e g in a city or agricultural area but plentiful some distance away energy costs for this transfer depend on distance elevation gain pump efficiency and evaporation leakage rates for instance in the case of the hetch hetchy supply system water travels over 100 miles across californias central valley using the force of gravity at an energy consumption of just 5 3 10 4 kwh m3 cooley et al 2012 in contrast the energy cost for importing raw water from the colorado river and sacramento san joaquin delta to san diego is 2 kwh m3 cooley et al 2012 typical energy costs for transfer of imported water are 0 5 to 1 4 kwh m3 cooley et al 2012 3 modeling energy consumption of potable reuse schemes in this section we present a model that describes the three potable reuse schemes shown in fig 1 including two dpr schemes one with and one without drinking water treatment and one ipr scheme all scheme models explored in this study consider municipal wastewater effluent as their feedwater begin with advanced treatment and include the energy consumption and water loss associated with water conveyance energy consumption in domestic use sewage conveyance and at the conventional wastewater treatment plant see appendix e are excluded from the modeling based on the assumption that these processes would not be affected by the choice of reuse scheme as shown in fig 1 the water s path from the advanced water treatment plant to the consumers depends on the reuse scheme in the dpr scheme without drinking water treatment water moves from the advanced treatment facility to an engineered storage buffer whose energy consumption is assumed to be negligible compared to the other processes before being returned to consumers in the dpr scheme with drinking water treatment water moves from the advanced treatment facility through a drinking water treatment plant before being returned to consumers in the ipr scheme water leaving the advanced treatment plant is assumed to undergo soil aquifer treatment and then drinking water treatment and we assume no water is lost in soil aquifer treatment all reuse schemes involve the potential to lose water through leakage during conveyance and we model this leakage as occurring shortly before return to the consumer as indicated in fig 1 the model reflects this assumption by dividing the seec of all treatment processes by the recovery ratio of conveyance rr tr defined as the fraction of advanced treated water that is not lost to leakage the scheme level seec of dpr without drinking water treatment w dpr dpr with drinking water treatment w dpr d and ipr w ipr are shown in eqs 5 6 and 7 5 w dpr w awt rr tr w tr 6 w dpr d w awt w dwt rr tr w tr 7 w ipr w awt w sat w dwt rr tr w tr where w awt is the energy consumption of awt w dwt is the energy consumption of drinking water treatment w sat is the energy consumption of soil aquifer treatment and w tr is the energy consumption of transporting water locally some ipr schemes 23 in the u s sim and mauter 2021 avoid the long distance water transfer often associated with aquifer recharge by discharging advanced treated effluent to nearby surface water neglecting any surface discharge associated water losses such an ipr scheme could be modeled as dpr with drinking water treatment 3 1 the full advanced treatment train the most common awt train known as full advanced treatment consists of mf followed by ro and advanced oxidation for the three u s reuse facilities using full advanced treatment reviewed by sim and mauter 2021 train energy consumption spanned 1 1 1 4 kwh m3 the seec of the treatment train is approximately the sum of the seecs of the individual processes except that some water is removed as concentrate in the ro step because seec is calculated per unit product equal to the ro permeate volume the mf energy consumption per unit mf permeate is modified by the ro recovery ratio rr ro as shown previously by sim and mauter 2021 thus the overall seec of the full advanced treatment train w fat can be estimated with eq 8 sim and mauter 2021 8 w fat w mf rr ro w ro w ao at the ocwd gwrs mf ro and uv treatment comprise 98 of the plant s energy consumption excluding pumping to storage and injection sites 3 3 calculated from internal data from 2020 provided by mehul patel ocwd validating the focus on these three processes when estimating a full advanced treatment plant s seec if the energy consumption associated with ro concentrate disposal is significant that additional energy consumption per unit ro concentrate w disposal can be incorporated into the reuse plant s seec per unit permeate w fat disposal as follows 9 w fat disposal w mf rr ro w ro w ao w disposal 1 rr ro 1 the final term incorporates the fact that the ratio of concentrate volume to permeate volume is 1 rr ro 1 3 2 model evaluation in evaluating the model for analysis of scheme level potable reuse seec in the following sections the seec of ro if used in the reuse scheme is first estimated then the seec of full advanced treatment if used is estimated and finally the seec of the reuse scheme is estimated as described below significant variability exists within many of the processes involved in potable reuse however accuracy can be improved by using case specific values and more complex process models such as the water application value engine wave dupont water solutions 2021 the energy consumption of ro continuous batch and or semi batch was estimated with eqs 1 2 and 3 respectively using default parameters from table 1 except where noted energy consumption of the full advanced treatment train is estimated with eq 8 or eq 8 if accounting for concentrate disposal using the previously calculated ro seec and default parameters from table 1 below except where noted the energy consumption associated with ro concentrate disposal per unit volume of permeate was assumed to be negligible in the analysis that follows the energy consumption of advanced treatment whether full advanced treatment or another type for example seecs for gac based and gmf based awt are listed in table 1 was used as an input to eqs 5 7 along with default parameters from table 1 except where noted to estimate scheme level seec other researchers may estimate the seec of a reuse scheme of interest by following the procedure above making use of as many case specific values such as local water transport energy consumption or feed osmotic pressure as possible for examples of using case specific values in the estimation of seec see section 3 4 they may also choose to integrate other models for processes e g modeling uf and or ro with wave dupont water solutions 2021 or modeling the advanced treatment train with the water associated health and environmental air damages water ahead model gingerich and mauter 2012 the supplementary information contains a matlab script to facilitate evaluation of this model with default and or user specified values 3 3 model inputs and sensitivity a summary of default parameters chosen based on the literature review section 2 that are used in evaluating the model for energy consumption of reuse processes and schemes in section 4 is provided in table 1 table 1 also includes results of a one at a time sensitivity analysis in which the effects of 1 changes in each input to the model were evaluated as described in section 3 2 individually to determine the resulting change in the model output for the default scheme which was chosen to be ipr with ro with other relevant parameters equal to the default parameters in table 1 the seec sensitivity is reported as the fractional increase in scheme seec per fractional increase in the input parameter for example the seec sensitivity to osmotic pressure of 0 06 means that if the osmotic pressure of wastewater effluent increased by 10 from 0 7 to 0 77 bar the seec of the default ipr scheme would increase by approximately 0 6 from 2 078 to 2 091 kwh m3 3 4 model validation although the model is based on plant data to the extent possible published energy consumption data for potable reuse processes is limited and some theoretical modeling was required therefore this section aims to validate the model by comparing model produced estimates to available data to validate the ro portion of the model the model output was compared with data from an internal report from the ocwd gwrs which showed that the seec for a set of seven 5 million gallon per day mgd ro units with no inter stage pumping or energy recovery ranged from 0 54 0 64 kwh m3 in 2019 and with plant provided data for the gwrs overall which found an ro seec of 0 54 kwh m3 for an ro system treating feedwater with an osmotic pressure of 0 61 bar the middle of the plant s typical range see table d 1 that is otherwise modeled using default system values one isp etc see table 1 the model estimated seec is 0 56 kwh m3 in close agreement with the reported seecs internal ocwd gwrs data for energy consumption of unit processes provided by mehul patel ocwd s exercutive director of operations also lends confidence to the full advanced treatment model the total energy consumed by mf ro and uv as well as the less energy intensive flow equalization screenings lime post treatment and decarbonation during the reported period january to november 2020 was 0 908 kwh m3 4 4 while this seec is lower than that reported for the gwrs previously hutchinson 2017 the gwrs also supplies energy 0 17 kwh m3 to seawater barrier well sites or 0 30 kwh m3 to recharge basins which was likely included in the previously published figure for gwrs seec 1 12 kwh m3 using a feed osmotic pressure of 0 61 bar as described above and default values for other parameters eq 8 estimates an seec for the full advanced treatment system of 0 92 kwh m3 1 3 higher than reported to further validate the full advanced treatment train model eq 8 and the choice of relevant default values the model output was compared to published data from the leo j vander lans water treatment facility in long beach california schimmoller 2014 which treats wastewater effluent with a tds 5 5 given its proximity to the ocwd gwrs we use the gwrs s tds to osmotic pressure ratio see table d 1 to estimate the leo j vander lans facility s feed osmotic pressure as 0 41 bar of 703 mg kg fu 2014 utilizing an mf ro uv train with continuous three stage ro without either inter stage pumping or energy recovery at a recovery ratio of 92 this train requires 0 97 kwh m3 schimmoller 2014 the model predicted seec of this train using the known system parameters above and otherwise assuming default values from table 1 is 0 94 kwh m3 3 lower than actual scheme level energy data is not commonly reported but to validate the dpr model across the entire reuse scheme the predicted energy consumption has been compared to published data from the colorado river municipal water district s big spring texas dpr scheme mf ro uv aop and drinking water treatment office of ground water and drinking water 2017 which includes in its energy figure the pumping energy used for product water conveyance but does not account for water loss in pipe networks or drinking water treatment the energy consumption of the big spring dpr scheme was reported as 1 41 kwh m3 office of ground water and drinking water 2017 the modeled energy consumption of a dpr scheme without drinking water treatment using big spring s mid range osmotic pressure 1 21 bar see table d 1 and otherwise using default values table 1 and neglecting water loss in transport is 1 34 kwh m3 5 lower than the published data the consistent agreement between data and model outputs for energy consumption of ro full advanced treatment and dpr suggest that these models are capable of estimating the energy requirements of potable reuse processes facilities and schemes with reasonable accuracy even when relying on some default values for unknowns such as membrane permeability agreement of the full advanced treatment model is also reasonably good in comparison to reuse plant data reviewed by sim and mauter 2021 which found full advanced treatment plant energy consumption to vary between 1 1 kwh m3 the gwrs likely including water conveyance to an injection site and 1 4 kwh m3 the big spring facility including local conveyance and the range identified by their process based model 0 9 2 2 kwh m3 given the agreement between model outputs and treatment facility data the model described in this section and except where noted the default values provided in table d 1 will be used in the analysis that follows 4 analysis energy consumption of reuse schemes in this section the model described in section 3 is evaluated to estimate the energy consumption of several potable reuse schemes compare reuse schemes to alternative water procurement methods and evaluate the effects of design changes on reuse scheme energy consumption 4 1 energy consumption breakdown of potable reuse schemes figure 3 shows how various parts of the reuse process contribute to the energy consumption within several reuse schemes energy consumption was calculated as described in section 3 assuming 15 water loss in transit and when applicable utilizing continuous ro at 80 recovery with one inter stage pump and no energy recovery device other parameters were also assigned the default values listed in table 1 additional energy consumption required due to treating extra water to make up for water loss is tagged separately as water loss figure 3 shows that the largest contributors to seec are likely to be ro if used and in ipr water conveyance in ipr with aquifer recharge the conveyance seec shown in fig 3 includes the energy used to convey water to and from the aquifer used for recharge which can vary widely depending on the location of the aquifer relative to the wastewater and drinking water treatment facilities although the ro energy consumption is significant it is much lower than that of seawater ro see section 2 4 1 because the seec of ro scales approximately linearly with solution osmotic pressure eq 1 and municipal wastewater effluent has a very low osmotic pressure see table d 1 compared to seawater furthermore modern ro membranes designed for low salinity water tend to have a high permeability allowing for lower energy consumption cohen tanugi et al 2014 mf baf modeled here as an ozone gac process buffering drinking water treatment and the energetic effect of water loss are also significant in their energy use the energy use associated with local water transport and aops are relatively small but not negligible based on default values but these processes could be significant energy consumers in some regions the energy requirements of individual processes may vary between different treatment plants and reuse schemes and the sensitivity of overall seec to fractional changes in individual processes energy requirements is given in table 1 as a result of the energy consumption associated with these individual processes dpr without subsequent drinking water treatment and ipr using baf and natural buffering without ro use less energy than the other options which involve more redundancy 4 2 comparison of potable reuse to alternatives representative seecs for several reuse schemes and other water supply augmentation options are shown in fig 4 for potable reuse schemes model generated representative seec values are shown and the error bars estimate uncertainty in seec based on a propagation of uncertainty analysis 6 6 the propagation of uncertainty analysis assumed the following five sources of uncertainty might be most significant based on sensitivities reported in table 1 and the magnitude of variation in different parameters the water transport rr the seec of the awt process and the seecs associated with drinking water treatment and environmental buffering the uncertainty in each independent variable was estimated from variations seen in the literature review section 2 as 0 1 for transport rr 0 12 kwh m3 for drinking water treatment 0 175 kwh m3 for environmental buffering 0 08 kwh m3 for gmf based awt 0 05 kwh m3 for gac based awt 0 08 kwh m3 for full advanced treatment estimated from fig 5 a one at a time sensitivity analysis was conducted to determine the change in seec of each reuse scheme shown in fig 4 due to changing each of the parameters listed above by the stated amount consistent with a numerical propagation of uncertainty analysis the overall uncertainty shown as error bars in scheme seec was calculated as the square root of the sum of the squares of the changes to scheme seec due to the above changes in individual parameters reuse schemes involving more processes with significant uncertainty had higher uncertainty in seec for other options the chart shows the means and standard deviations of available data see section 2 4 with seecs of approximately 1 2 kwh m3 gmf based ipr and dpr without subsequent drinking water treatment and are predicted to be the lowest energy options for potable reuse among the situations considered dpr with dwt groundwater desalination when brackish groundwater is available and gac based ipr are all fairly low energy with scheme seecs of approximately 1 4 1 5 kwh m3 the ro free ipr options using baf have the advantage of not producing a brine reject stream 7 7 we reiterate that the model did not consider energy consumption due to deep well injection or further concentration of ro brine which would add to the energy consumption of reuse schemes involving ro anywhere surface or sewer discharge are not possible and likely shift favor toward ro free reuse schemes and more efficiently removing trace organic compounds schimmoller 2014 but a potential disadvantage is that they do not reduce water salinity among the higher energy options are ipr with ro long distance water transfer in many cases and seawater desalination an ipr scheme with ro has a predicted seec of 2 0 kwh m3 due to the combination of a relatively high energy reuse process ro and transportation to and from an environmental buffer long distance transportation including drinking water treatment with an estimated seec of 2 6 kwh m3 has a very large confidence interval due to the wide range of distances over which it has been implemented wakeel et al 2016a seawater desalination is the most energy intensive process considered with a mean seec of around 4 0 kwh m3 for modern ro plants cooley et al 2012 given the magnitude of variability and the importance of non energetic factors not analyzed here it is not possible to state that one of these options is universally superior however some findings are clear seawater desalination and some energy intensive water transfers use much more energy than potable reuse if no source of low salinity groundwater or surface water is nearby potable reuse is likely to be the least energy intensive option furthermore both dpr and ro free ipr use significantly less energy than ro based ipr and eliminating redundant drinking water treatment after dpr can have a significant energetic benefit 4 3 variation in energy consumption given the low energy use of potable reuse schemes relative to long distance water transfer and seawater desalination this section explores how variations in potable reuse system design and operation could affect energy consumption the baseline reuse scheme with respect to which variations are considered is ipr using full advanced treatment and sat as practiced at the ocwd gwrs default values from table 1 are used except where noted because ro can account for a large fraction of a reuse scheme s energy consumption see fig 3 changes to the design and operation of the ro subsystem affect the overall energy consumption considerably figure 5 shows how the energy consumption of a full advanced treatment train varies as a function of the type of ro and the recovery ratio of the ro step figure 5 was created by using eqs 1 3 to model ro energy consumption as a function of ro recovery ratio up to 0 555 per stage and inputting the recovery ratio and calculated ro seec into eq 8 to predict treatment train seec for continuous ro systems the number of isps was varied between 0 and 2 ro systems with isps are modeled as having one more stage than the number of isps indicated and systems were modeled both with and without 70 efficient energy recovery devices other parameters such as membrane permeability were assumed to have the default values provided in table 1 according to fig 5 batch ro semi batch ro and 3 stage continuous ro with inter stage pumps and energy recovery are predicted to be the most energy efficient processes although the seec of semi batch ro requires more energy at very high recovery ratios due to recirculation induced mixing warsinger et al 2016 depending on the ro process used the energy optimized operating rr for the ro step is in the range of 75 90 due to the balance of increasing concentrate osmotic pressure reduced mf uf flowrate per unit ro permeate and reduced brine throttling when erds are not used as the ro rr rises in general fig 5 shows that the energy consumption of continuous ro can be reduced by utilizing more complex process designs such as a time variant batch or semi batch system or a continuous system with one or more isps and an energy recovery device however complexity tends to be accompanied by capital costs as an example wei 2021 estimated that batch ro would have a 10 greater capital cost than conventional ro for seawater desalination but found that batch ro s more uniform flux distribution would enable recovery of the additional capital cost by operating at higher average flux future research on the capital cost energy efficiency trade off might shed light on which process improvements tend to be sound investments for potable reuse facilities the energy consumption of the full advanced treatment train as shown in fig 5 is largely in the range of 0 85 1 kwh m3 excluding complex ro configurations rarely used in practice for a set of default parameters table 1 including fixed feed osmotic pressure membrane permeability pump efficiency and average flux while this model was successfully validated with several reuse facilities data in section 3 4 this predicted energy consumption range is lower than the range of data reported by facilities 1 1 1 4 kwh m3 and on the low end of the range 0 9 2 2 kwh m3 estimated by the process based model of sim and mauter 2021 the higher range of facility energy use data reviewed by sim and mauter likely reflects the energy consumption associated with pumping treated water into the water supply network as it was in the 1 41 kwh m3 reported for the big spring dpr plant office of ground water and drinking water 2017 which was instead categorized as part of the reuse scheme beyond the full advanced treatment train in the present analysis figure 6 shows how different choices affect the seec of potable reuse it was created by using the present model and default values section 3 to calculate the seec of a baseline reuse scheme ipr utilizing continuous ro at 80 recovery with two stages one inter stage pump and no energy recovery device with a seec of 2 08 kwh m3 and then changing one parameter at a time and reporting the difference in scheme seec the differences explored included changes to the ro process and changes to the reuse scheme changes to the ro process such as adding an energy recovery device though not insignificant tend to have less impact on the overall seec of the potable reuse scheme the use of novel ultra high permeability ro membranes modeled as 18 lmh bar a 5 increase from the default value used in modeling could provide a 21 decrease in energy consumption this is consistent with previous findings that ultra high permeability membranes have significant promise in reducing the energy consumption of low salinity water desalination cohen tanugi et al 2014 eliminating transit water losses by updating pipe networks could significantly reduce energy consumption per unit volume delivered to the user by reducing the volume of water that must pass through the reuse process such a fix would also save non reused water from loss eliminating either ro or environmental buffering i e using dpr or a non ro ipr process reduces energy consumption substantially dpr schemes with ro may be able to forego drinking water treatment which is a significant user of energy relative to the differences between these low energy reuse schemes by blending upstream of a drinking water plant therefore dpr without subsequent drinking water treatment was also considered although uncertainty in these effects was not quantified we anticipate the uncertainties in seec associated with changes modeled in fig 6 would be smaller than seen in scheme level predictions e g error bars in fig 4 due to only changing one parameter at a time by incorporating several energy efficiency improvements the model demonstrates how the energy consumption of potable reuse might be reduced further for example a dpr scheme using a three stage ro system with 85 recovery 80 efficiency pumps two inter stage pumps an energy recovery device with 70 efficiency and membranes with a permeability of 4 l m2 hr bar 33 higher than the base case without further drinking water treatment and with only 7 5 water lost in transit was predicted to have an seec of 0 90 kwh m3 for the entire reuse scheme in this high efficiency scenario potable reuse of wastewater effluent could be accomplished for less than one quarter of the energy required for seawater desalination 5 discussion context and limitations this study s focus on direct energy consumption in potable reuse schemes does not account for embodied energy cost or environmental harm in limiting the focus to direct energy consumption we have not considered the embodied energy of the chemicals used in advanced water treatment even though the embodied energy of chemicals can be significant in drinking water treatment mo 2012 while sim and mauter 2021 showed that the vast majority of health and greenhouse gas externalities associated with potable reuse result from the generation of electricity consumed the capital costs pretreatment and cleaning chemicals labor and other inputs must be considered in techno economic environmental analysis of any water reuse project gingerich and mauter 2012 present the water ahead model and associated software for conducting a holistic environmental analysis of water treatment processes and facilities which they have already used to analyze the environmental impact of existing potable reuse plants in the united states sim and mauter 2021 in widening the scope of analysis to encompass entire reuse schemes including complementary processes such as environmental buffering the present study narrowed its focus to direct energy consumption as a single aspect of environmental impact however it could be fruitful for future research to employ the water ahead model in combination with the scheme level model presented here to analyze the environmental impact of reuse schemes given the correlation between direct energy consumption and environmental harm sim and mauter 2021 the lowest energy reuse schemes identified by the present analysis could be ideal candidates for full environmental analysis at the reuse scheme level an additional limitation of this study is that the analysis does not consider decentralized potable reuse in contrast to the centralized reuse schemes explored in this study decentralized potable reuse has the potential to reduce the energy consumption required for water conveyance and domestic water heating as well as enable almost complete local recycling of wastewater englehardt et al 2016 based on pilot scale testing and modeling a 1 mgd decentralized plant was predicted to more than offset the primary energy it requires for water treatment at a seec of 2 98 kwh m3 similar to the 2 76 kwh m3 this study predicts for ipr with ro plus conventional wastewater treatment by retaining heat and thus reducing the primary energy required for domestic water heating wu and englehardt 2016 while energy positive water reuse is a promising concept small scale systems have additional challenges related to robustness and the need for operator intervention as shown in the development of a potable reuse system to meet the water needs of 120 people at davis station antarctica zhang et al 2017 energy consumption is also not the only challenge limiting the spread of potable reuse although potable reuse has been implemented across the globe gerrity et al 2013 challenges of public perception due to disgust at the idea of drinking recycled wastewater englehardt et al 2016 persist furthermore fluctuations in the feeling of urgency surrounding water supply augmentation often on drought driven timescales too short for development of reuse facilities impede the implementation of potable reuse as demonstrated by australia s history with water reuse radcliffe and page 2020 continuous improvement to potable reuse technology at the process facility and scheme levels increasing public awareness of reused water quality and anticipation of the effects of climate change on water resources may shift attitudes in favor of potable water reuse 6 conclusions modeling based analysis found a range of 1 2 to 2 1 kwh m3 for the typical energy consumption of potable water reuse schemes including advanced treatment processes and water conveyance but excluding conventional wastewater treatment the lower end of the energy range corresponds to ipr without ro and dpr without drinking water treatment while the higher end corresponds to ipr processes that include ro groundwater desalination and water transfer over moderate distances fall within the same range of energy cost as potable reuse so those options may be competitive with potable reuse when low salinity groundwater or surface water are accessible however seawater desalination uses far more energy than potable reuse and should only be implemented once lower energy options have been exhausted examining entire reuse schemes rather than individual plants or processes revealed the similarity in energy consumption of dpr and ro free ipr which were the lowest energy options identified depending on the proximity of a suitable aquifer for sat and the availability of surface sewer discharge of ro concentrate either a natural process based ipr scheme or a membrane based dpr scheme especially without redundant drinking water treatment is likely to be the lowest energy water reuse option further reductions in energy consumption are possible fixing leaks in the water supply network would have a significant effect on each scheme s energy consumption by reducing the amount of water subject to energy intensive advanced treatment high permeability ro membranes which are an area of ongoing research would also reduce energy consumption in potable reuse meaningfully other changes to ro systems used in reuse plants such as installing energy recovery devices would have small but still significant effects on energy consumption with a few efficiency upgrades a dpr system without subsequent drinking water treatment could have a total scheme energy consumption of less than 1 kwh m3 as potable reuse becomes more widespread the technology will continue to benefit from research and optimization additional analysis of the environmental impact cost and efficacy of direct and ro free indirect potable reuse schemes is needed to increase adoption of water reuse and improve the sustainability of water supplies however future potential aside potable reuse is already a far less energy intensive option than seawater desalination and often long distance water transfer and a

district advanced water purification facility ocwd awpf utilizes a multiple barrier approach to recycle secondary treated wastewater for ipr which includes mf ishida et al 2015 their mf system is designed for 86 mgd production of mf filtrate using 0 2 μ m polypropylene hollow fiber membranes operating at 88 90 recovery backwashing and air scouring was conducted every 22 min the normalized energy cost for the mf system was 0 072 kwh m3 additional data for mf uf energy consumption in a range of plants are reported in table a 1 appendix b batch and semi batch ro energy modeling in the present model osmotic pressure will be assumed to vary linearly with salinity reasonable for low salinity feeds lienhard et al 2017 such as municipal wastewater and the ro module will be assumed to be very short additionally concentration polarization salt permeation and viscous friction will be neglected due to the final assumption the power required by the circulation pumps shown in fig 1 is calculated as zero as shown by warsinger et al 2016 batch and semi batch ro have lower osmotic pressure at the ro module feed outlet than continuous ro for an idealized very short ro module with an infinitesimal recovery ratio the feed pressure can be related to instantaneous recovery ratio rr i defined as the ratio of the volume of permeate produced by a given time to the volume of feed that will be consumed in an entire batch cycle as follows for batch ro the total salt mass in the system stays constant throughout each cycle so the salinity and thus assuming it is proportional osmotic pressure rises inversely with the remaining volume of feed in the absence of concentration polarization the feed pressure required for batch ro δ p bro i is approximated by eq b 1 b 1 δ p bro i j w a m π f 1 1 rr i where j w is the water flux a m is the membranes water permeability and π f is the feed osmotic pressure in semi batch ro the system volume is constant and therefore feed must be introduced at a constant rate to make up for the permeate produced as a result the feed osmotic pressure increases linearly with permeate production and instantaneous recovery ratio see fig 10 in warsinger et al 2016 therefore the feed pressure required for semi batch ro δ p sbro can be approximated by eq b 2 b 2 δ p sbro i j w a m π f 1 rr rr i 1 rr where rr is the total recovery ratio of the ro system for a constant volume batch or semi batch ro system the flow rate through high pressure pump is equal to the permeate flow rate during permeate production and concentrate is discharged at atmospheric pressure at the end of a cycle the seec for either of these systems w is then the ratio of the permeate volume averaged pressure to the pump efficiency b 3 w 1 η p v p 0 v p δ p i d v p i 1 η p rr 0 rr δ p i drr i where η p is the high pressure pump efficiency and v p is the permeate volume of one cycle and v p i is the permeate volume produced during a cycle at a particular time integrating eq b 3 for batch ro and semi batch ro lead to eqs 2 and 3 respectively in the main text byt appendix c energy consumption of advanced oxidation processes for direct photolysis applications in which the contaminant is present at low concentration it can be shown that local reaction rates are first order with respect to local fluence rate and reactant concentration for uv based aops the governing reactions are first order or pseudo first order processes as well at least to a first approximation as such the concept of e eo can be used for approximate comparisons of energy use among uv based water treatment processes and for approximate scaling of energy costs from small scale reactors to larger reactors of similar design bolton et al 2001 a fundamental expression to describe photochemical kinetics is as follows c 1 r b d b d t i a ϕ λ where r b is the rate of reaction of the target molecule b in mol l s b is the activity of b in solution mol l t equals time s i a is the volumetric rate of photon absorption by b einstein l s and ϕ is the primary quantum yield for reaction of interest mol einstein the volumetric rate of photon absorption by the photochemical target b will depend on system geometry and other factors perhaps the simplest reactor system to consider is a shallow well mixed batch reactor that is subjected to a beam of uniform collimated radiation if the effects of reflection dissipation and beam divergence are ignored it is possible to define the volumetric rate of photon absorption for this system c 2 i a a e i e t v u where a is the surface area of irradiated fluid e i and e t are the incident and transmitted fluences respectively v is the volume of irradiated fluid and u is the energy per einstein of incident radiation by application of the beer lambert law eq 2 can be re written as c 3 i a e i 1 10 ε b l l u for dilute solutions the exponent of the term on the right hand side of this system can be re defined using a taylor series expansion such that c 4 r b d b d t 2 3 e i ϵ b u ϕ equation 4 indicates that in the limit of dilute solution the kinetics of a photochemical process are first order with respect to the fluence rate and the concentration of the reacting compound this equation also indicates that the rate of this photochemical reaction is directly proportional to the values of the molar absorption coefficient ϵ and the quantum yield ϕ thus the reaction extent and the actual power consumption per unit flow rate w can be related to single parameter the electrical efficiency per order e eo as follows bolton et al 2001 bolton and stefan 2002 c 5 e eo w log 10 b 0 b thus the energy consumption of the uv aop scales linearly with both e eo and log removal as seen in eq 4 appendix d potable reuse plants and their feedwater characteristics the composition of secondary wastewater effluent affects the reuse process in terms of the treatment steps needed their energy consumption and practical limits on water recovery due to the fouling and scaling potential of concentrated wastewater effluent warsinger et al 2018a the wastewater effluents fed to potable reuse tend to be low salinity compared to other types of desalination plant feeds table d 1 lists the feed total dissolved solids tds and osmotic pressure from several potable reuse plants which publish this data appendix e seec of conventional wastewater treatment wastewater treatment improves wastewater quality to allow its discharge to the environment or reuse in an awt plant in 2013 a report from the electric power research institute estimated an overall energy consumption by wwtps in the u s of 30 2 billion kwh year almost 1 of the countrys energy use to treat approximately 32 200 mgd at an average seec of 0 68 kwh m3 pabi et al 2013 the seec typically ranges from 0 42 to 0 87 kwh m3 with lower seecs occurring in larger plants especially those treating more than 16 mgd pabi et al 2013 these values from the u s are comparable to those found from surveys of wwtps worldwide longo et al 2016 m mauricio iglesias 2016 within wastewater treatment aeration is the principal energy consumption step accounting for approximately 54 of the wwtp s total energy consumption gude 2015 because wastewater requires conventional treatment whether or not it goes on to engineered reuse the energy consumption associated with conventional
