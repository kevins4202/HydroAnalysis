22540,in this paper a multi method approach is used to setup and validate a monitoring system applied to a small sailing boat during real sailing conditions this monitoring system is able to transform the data coming from some typical devices installed on board into information about the deformed state of the boat gps wind data logger and cameras have been installed on the boat to measure its route and speed the apparent wind velocity and direction and the positions of the crew members these data are processed to determine the equilibrium of the boat and estimate the loads applied on it then a cad fem model calculates the effects of these loads on the boat shape the resulting deformed model is compared with measurements of local strains obtained with electrical resistance strain gauges applied on the hull and on reinforcements of the boat onboard measuring devices are real time monitored with a home made software while the numerical prediction of the global boat deformation is obtained a posteriori once fem computation is achieved a test at sea has been performed to check the efficiency of the system data computed with the proposed procedure have been compared with those

the design phase during the early stage the focus is mainly oriented toward aero hydro dynamic analyses aimed to find the best of the hull shape with the best of rigging and sails a step forward is the structural dimensioning of the hull skin and of the internal reinforcement frame once a first tentative set of shape and dimensions has been found an iterative design refinement can start this loop as well known is the most complex to be set up the more the designer wants to optimise the more information are needed these information can be provided by numerical simulations e g computational fluid dynamics finite element analyses and or experimental tests e g towing tank material characterization strain sensors however because of the problem complexity the availability of real data acquired during sailing becomes fundamental in order to correctly validate a design approach most of the recent literature concerning yacht design deals with the rig sail system or with the hull system one by one concerning sails for instance fluid structure interaction analyses are performed to find the flying shape of the sails by coupling stress sensors data measured on the rig and image processing of video acquisitions in upwind augier et al 2012 and downwind deparday et al 2016 sailing conditions an interesting approach aimed to evaluate the real time flying shape of the sails is described in ferreira et al 2017 in which the authors make use of bragg sensors installed on a glass fibre laminate emulating the batten instead of image processing techniques numerical approaches aimed to optimise the sail plane are discussed in nascimbene 2013 from the structural point of view without experimental validation and in laverón simavilla et al 2008 from the fluid dynamic point of view and wind tunnel test applied to the olympic class catamaran tornado cella et al 2017 have developed a numerical optimization tool applied to sail plan and appendages of a catamaran to improve speed performances concerning the rigging in grabe 2003 the authors adopt force transducer data coming from an existing yacht to validate a finite element model of the rig while in ortigosa et al 2015 structural analyses of rig elements coupled with an aerodynamic solver gives real time information to the crew about the sailing performances concerning hulls the application of strain sensors is a well known methodology allowing to monitor structure deformations according to rigging and navigation loads in roy et al 2005 from the knowledge of the pressure map on the hull panels the mechanical behavior of the structure can be determined using fem code integrated into the cad catia from dassault an interesting application developed in bourgeon et al 2010 is the installation of strain gauges on board of the trimaran hydroptère the world fastest sailing boat reaching a record speed of about 53 knots in 2008 a similar approach described in murayama et al 2013 permits the structural health monitoring of america s cup class yacht thanks to fibre optic strain sensors at the beginning because of economical reasons the over mentioned numerical and experimental tools were especially applied to america s cup yachts where the research of extreme solutions to improve performances was mandatory nowadays thanks to the cost reduction of hardware and software and to the increasing of computational capabilities of desktop pcs these instruments find applications also in commercial and pleasure sailing and motor yachts baronti et al 2010 an interesting review of research activities focused on sailing dinghy performances can be found in garcia and martinez 2015 in some cases sailing dinghies became object of innovative experimentation to overcome classic design approaches as shown in andersson et al 2017 with regards to foil applications to a small optimist not only rig sail or structures have been numerically and or experimentally investigated but even regatta s strategies in spenkuch et al 2010 and banks et al 2010 cfd analyses permit a real time evaluation of the manoeuvring effect during tacking or gybe in pennanen et al 2016 a laser dinghy is studied from a numerical point of view to predict the optimal heel and trim while in tagliaferri and viola 2017 a real time software based on neural networks drives the skipper toward optimal routes during races in augustyniak et al 2012 a graphical interface collecting data from strain gauges gps and other sensors becomes an instrument useful for the crew training in this work a numerical experimental procedure applied to a small sailing yacht during real navigation is proposed the aim of this procedure is to process measured data of wind route and crew positions stored during the test and evaluate hull global and local deformation at this stage the calculated result can be obtained a posteriori and requires the visual determination of the crew member movements the peculiarity of the proposed method is that hydro aero dynamic loads applied on the boat are not directly measured there are no load cells applied on the rig but are obtained by the equilibrium of moments around the longitudinal and transvers axes of the boat given the apparent wind angle and velocity the boat see fig 1 is a dinghy with the hull and the deck made of an hybrid flax cork sandwich and internal reinforcements made of marine plywood this 15 skiff acronym of sail keep it flat and fast has been designed and manufactured at the university of palermo italy for the purpose of this work instruments have been installed on board gps wind data logger cameras as will be detailed in section 2 1 the boat was also instrumented with electrical resistance strain gauges and rosettes to validate numerical predictions obtained with the present procedure all the data provided by the instruments during the 2 h of test at sea have been stored in a computer and remotely managed with a home made software section 2 2 particular care has been taken to the data filtering in order to find stable sailing conditions in terms of wind velocity route speed heeling etc for a correct numerical model setup as explained in section 2 3 finally in section 3 the numerical experimental comparison will be detailed 2 materials and methods fig 2 shows the block diagram of the numerical experimental approach followed in the present paper to determine the global boat deformation by post processing the navigation data the core of the activity is the acquisition of some in field experimental information given by different measurement devices then process these data by means of analytical models and give them as input to a numerical cad fem model able to determine the final outputs which are the global local deformations of the boat these experimental data are the boat position measured with a gps the apparent wind angle awa and the apparent wind velocity awv measured with a wind data logger the crew member positions estimated with two digital cameras these data are elaborated by an in house made management software compiled in visual basic that turns out the boundary conditions requested by a cad fem model of the boat these boundary conditions are the set of local and distributed forces applied to the boat together with the rigging pre loads on mast shrouds forestay as previously calculated in mancuso et al 2018 the numerical model is generated in a cae environment constituted by a 3d solid model of the boat and its relative finite element mesh the final output of the numerical calculation is the deformed state of the boat consequent to the application of constant plus variable loads during real sailing conditions to ensure the reliability of this procedure local boat deformation given by electrical resistance gauges are also measured and finally compared with correspondent numerical results it must be remarked that in this procedure the use of er strain gauges is not mandatory to obtain the final numerical result but only to give comparison values to the predictions in fact in contrast with the idea of a low cost impact for the adopted tools er could be very expensive especially the data acquisition system and in some cases very difficult to install on an existent boat all the other devices used to measure the experimental entities are easy and cheap to obtain a gps receiver a wind data logger and a couple of digital cameras the numerical model can easily run on a medium performance pc in our case a 4 core i3 based laptop was used to run both the data acquisition software and the numerical model 2 1 experimental equipment the wind direction and intensity measurements during the experimental campaign were carried out using a dedicated acquisition board based on the arduino uno microcontroller programmed with the dedicated software arduino ide the board was based on an atmega 328p processor connected through serial peripheral interface spi to a real time clock module and an sd card reader for data logging purpose the acquisition board is connected to a commercial wind data logger wdl in particular a ws3080 from velleman has been used composed of an anemometer for the apparent wind velocity and a vane for the apparent wind direction the wind velocity sensor produces a pulsed output signal proportional to the wind speed with a sensitivity of 1 m s the wind direction was acquired through a rotary encoder that gives an analog output signal dependent on the position of a wind vane the sensitivity of the encoder is 22 5 the rtc modules produced a pulsed signal with a frequency of 1 hz that was used as a trigger for the signals acquisition using the interrupt capabilities of the microcontroller in between two measurements points the average value for each of the variables was computed in order to compensate small oscillation of the wind vane the time relative to each measurement was also stored in the sd card in order to be able to synchronise the wind data with the position of the boat that was acquired separately the whole system was power supplied by a battery pack with four alkaline aa type batteries a diode was inserted in between the main power switch and the arduino board in order to reduce the voltage to approximately 5 v and prevent polarity reversal fig 3 left shows the detailed schematics of the device the measurement system was tested and calibrated in laboratory using artificial wind produced by a blower and a high precision anemometer to compare the reading of the sensors with varying the wind speed the whole system was hence inserted into a waterproof case fig 3 right mounted on top of the mast together with the sensors electrical resistance strain gauges er have been applied on reinforcements and panels of the boat to measure local strains due to internal and external loads in some critical areas in particular four three grid rectangular rosettes hbm type ry81 6 350 and four single grid hbm type ly11 6 350 er gauges have been installed on specific locations shown in fig 4 left each installation is coded with three letters the first letter s r stands for single grid or rosette the second letter f a stands for forward or aft respectively the last letter p s stands for port side or starboard side rosettes are glued on the upper lamina in board side of the hull sandwich material while single grids are bonded on the plywood reinforcements in particular on opposite faces of the keel sfp and sfs and on the tilted sections sap and sas more details about the installation of the er gauges can be found in mancuso et al 2018 a 16 channel hbm quantumx data logger was used to connect all ers and synchronously acquire all signals each grid was connected using a quarter bridge 4 wire scheme from each of the four single grid installations only one signal is measured corresponding to the strain occurring along the grid direction from each of the four rosette installations three signals are measured by the three grids independently all the measured data are stored in an external hard drive disk the quantumx is power supplied by a dc battery at 24 v all the components have been located in a water resistant case see fig 4 right fixed on the deck of the boat just ahead of the mast the route of the boat has been recorded with a commercial gps receiver housed in the same case of the quantumx and connected to a power bank see fig 4 right two gopro cameras have been used to film the boat during navigation each working at 60 fps in full hd mode one is fixed on top of the mast focusing the deck of led the other one is hand held by a member of the shore team with the first one it is possible to monitor where the crew members are during navigation and control the deck rigging while with the second camera trim or heel rotations of the boat can be observed at this stage of the research activity these data can be estimated only with a visual analysis made a posteriori by the operator 2 2 data management the measured data are sampled by different devices and managed by an in house software compiled in visual basic able to synchronise all the multimodal signals sorce et al 2007 and show them on the customizable user interface in fig 5 by default in the upper area of the screen two windows are located showing the images captured by the camera 1 and 2 in the bottom area of the screen there are two oscilloscopes where the user can plot the preferred signals and a meter where the instant value of the selected signals are reported in particular in the screenshot in fig 5 in the left oscilloscopes are plotted the velocity of the boat calculated from the gps data the apparent wind velocity and the apparent wind angle both calculated from the wind data logger data in the right oscilloscope are plotted measurements given by the single grid er gauges sap and sas mounted on the tilted sections the software can work simply as a real time monitor of the instruments mounted on board if it is required the deformed state of any part of the boat then the operator has to select a time instant acquired during the test evaluate the crew member positions by looking at the acquired videos and run the fem model in the latter case an intrinsic delay must be considered due to the operator activity and to the computational time required by the fem model to converge with the low performance pc used in this work the running time was estimated around 30 s but with a more powerful pc it could be sensibly reduced the data measured during this test at sea have been downloaded at the end of the test and numerically post processed first step of the analysis is to synchronise these data in order to have a common starting point at time t 0 data from the wind data logger and from the gps appear very noisy for this reason a median filter has been applied to these data over a moving interval of 5 s this procedure returns smoother curves over the whole period of the test and allows a critic analysis about the time points to be considered as input data for the fem model it is important to extract a period of time long enough to attain constant conditions of navigation in terms of route wind boat flat on the sea and crew positions otherwise it could be selected an instant where inertial forces on the boat are present and the assumptions needed to solve the static equilibrium equations in mancuso et al 2018 are missing it has been observed that in the period from t 180 and t 380 the boat has navigated windward and with starboard tack with a reasonably constant speed after this period the wind speed decreased too much and the crew had to change the route several time to increase the boat speed absolute wind entities can be calculated from the measured data considering that the following equation applies 1 v w v a w v b where v w is the true wind vector v a w is the apparent wind vector and v b is the boat speed vector in particular v a w is measured by the wind data logger while v b can be calculated by means of numerical derivative of the instant positions measured by the gps in fig 6 it can be observed that between t 300 and t 380 speed and direction data are quite regular and the time instants for subsequent experimental and numerical calculations can be selected within this interval the path covered by the boat in this time interval is plotted on a satellite map of the area in fig 7 it can be observed that the boat runs on mostly beam reach conditions on starboard tack and with the true wind coming from ese at t 200 and rotating to s after t 300 triangles of velocity of the boat corresponding to speed quantities in eq 1 are drawn at some instants and show a good repeatability after t 300 2 3 numerical model the cad model has been imported into the cae environment of the software ansys workbench via stp files the original 3d model is constituted of the mid surface of hull deck and internal reinforcements due to the type of material used for the hull building the acp pre post module has been used in order to simulate the orthotropic behavior of the composite material in this module the elastic characteristics of the unidirectional laminate and the stacking sequence adopted in each component of the model must be assigned in particular the hull is built as a sandwich panel where the skins are made of a 0 45 90 flax epoxy composite and the internal core is made of cork the direction 0 is considered parallel to the longitudinal x axis of the boat the global sequence of the sandwich 0 45 90 cork 90 45 0 is balanced and symmetric with respect to the mid plane for the deck and the internal reinforcements a homogeneous isotropic marine okoumè plywood has been used details about the determination of the mechanical characteristics of the material and the manufacturing process can be found in the following references pitarresi et al 2015 mancuso et al 2015 a mesh of the boat is obtained with shell elements in order to reduce the total number of degrees of freedom of the model this choice is suggested by the thin aspect of each component of the boat where a maximum of 11 mm thick panel has been used the thickness has been added to the original cad surfaces of the boat in the inward direction for the hull and the deck and symmetrically for the internal reinforcements a total number of 120185 shell elements constitutes the whole model the value of 30 mm is the average side dimension of the shell elements in some particular areas where a high precision of the solution is required stress concentration areas due to geometrical singularity or areas where the er gauges are located local refinements of the mesh has been applied up to a minimum element size of 5 mm value similar to the measuring grid length of the er gauges attention has been particularly paid to the joints between surfaces a patch conformity tool is used to give correspondence to the nodes belonging to different surfaces on the intersection curve in some cases when the adjacent surfaces have different mesh size edge to area contact elements are used to rigidly bond the surfaces each other simulations are performed under linear elastic behavior conditions at each er installation a user coordinate system is created with the axes aligned to the grid directions the three deformations corresponding to the three grids of rosettes were in particular taken from the deformations of the upper in board lamina of the hull sandwich these deformations were further combined to derive principal strains ajovalasit and pitarresi 2011 to be compared with the correspondent value calculated from experiments 2 4 load cases loads carried by shrouds forestay and mast are applied directly on the boat reinforcements and are the results of the over position of two load systems a constant one coming from the internal rigging preload and a variable one coming from the equilibrium with the external aero hydro forces the over mentioned load systems consist of mostly vertical forces while horizontal forces are applied in correspondence of the terraces where the crew rest when hung on trapeze on the mast by the aerodynamic pressure on sails and on the trunk by the hydrodynamic pressure on the centerboard given awa and awv from the instruments active drive and heel forces generated by the sails are estimated using a free commercial vpp program these forces together with the crew member weights are used to determine the equilibrium of the moments around x and y during navigation following a simplified analytical procedure mancuso et al 2018 under the assumption of null heel and trim angles the gravity is applied on the entire model on the deck in the proximity of the trunk some areas have been created to simulate the presence of one or both crew members when in conditions of light breeze trapeze is not used the hydrostatic pressure is applied as a variable distributed pressure over the hull it must be remarked that the assumption of a hydrostatic distribution of pressure does not take into account of any dynamic effect on the hull this assumption appears reasonable especially in calm water and with a reduced boat speed three different load cases have been simulated and compared with correspondent instants of time during the test at sea as shown in fig 8 a b and c the first load case case a in fig 8 a takes into account only of preload on the rig point loads a b c and d the boat is assumed to be supported by a trailer at bow and stern point supports e and f a constant distributed gravity is applied on the entire boat distributed load g and the deck is not loaded reactions at bow and stern must equal the dry weight of the boat the second load case case b in fig 8 b is selected at time t 0 and assumes that the boat is at sea in calm water with the head to wind as case a preload is applied on the rig the boat is supported at bow and stern and a constant gravity is applied moreover the boat is supported by the hydrostatic pressure on the hull variable pressure h and both crew members are located on the deck seated near the mast foot surface loads i and j in this case the hydrostatic distribution must equal the mass displacement sum of the dry weight of the boat and the crew weight and the presence of support e and f is required by the fem solver only to avoid undesired rigid body motions it has been verified that reactions calculated by the solver at the end of the simulations are of several order of magnitude smaller than the typical loads applied to the boat this fact gives reliability to the adopted procedure the last load case case c in fig 8 c is selected at time t 374 when the boat navigates in mostly constant condition of wind and speed with the helmsman on trapeze see also fig 6 point loads a b c and d are now the sum of preload of the previous cases plus the external loads due to the equilibrium between the aerodynamic forces and the weight of the helmsman on trapeze supports e and f and distributed loads g and h are the same as previous cases horizontal forces applied by the helmsman on terrace are loads i and j while surface load k assumes the presence of the bowman at the port side of the centerboard it must be remarked that in case a and case b all loads are symmetric with respect to the longitudinal plane of the boat while in case c loads are non symmetric for this reason in addition to the simply supports at bow and stern a constraint l is applied on the side faces of the trunk along the y direction in order to balance the transversal component of the aerodynamic wind force in fig 8 d the distribution on the hull of the hydrostatic pressure used for case b and case c is shown then applied loads are summarized in table 1 3 results 3 1 numerical simulation data 3 1 1 global deformation when dealing with small sized boats like the one studied in this paper one of the aspects that should be taken into account when the boat is rigged is that the preload level can affect the final shape of the hull in fact a very high preload on the mast causes a global longitudinal deflection of the keel in the area between the shrouds and the forestay in this sense modifications of the original waterlines should be considered and as a consequence a new hydrodynamic behavior should be expected nevertheless the preload level cannot be reduced too much in order to avoid an excessive drop of load on the upwind shroud during navigation numerical analyses performed on the boat in the three different cases over mentioned allow a quick evaluation of the global deformation of the boat the principal deformation induced on the hull after rigging is the displacement in the z direction the absolute values of this entity depend on the global constrains applied to the boat and change in the three load configurations in fig 9 left the contour map of u z is reported for case a when only the preload is applied on mast and shrouds and the boat is simply supported at the stern post and at the right ahead it can be observed that the whole boat is subjected to a negative deformation along z and the maximum negative displacement is calculated under the mast foot as 5 24 mm this value is not meaningful by itself but must be related to the original immersion of the boat in that point 130 mm the ratio of these values estimates an immersion change of 4 0 with respect to the original boat design the deformed state of the hull slightly improves in case b where the boat is supported by the hydrostatic pressure and the crew is on the deck see fig 9 middle in fact the distributed support on the hull given by the water relieves the global bending deformation of the keel caused by the preload on mast and shrouds the maximum negative displacement calculated under the mast foot is 4 92 mm and the immersion change is 3 78 during navigation in case c one element of the crew is on trapeze and his weight must be summed to the original preload of the mast the global deformation observed in this load case is the worse among the three the maximum negative displacement under the mast foot is 5 6 mm that means an immersion change of 4 3 see fig 9 right 3 1 2 local deformation the unloaded shape of the boat and the one deformed in case c have been compared to investigate about the effects on hydrostatics of the local deformation of the hull under the mast foot with respect to the original mass displacement in fig 1 the deformation of the hull should lead to an increase of the mass displacement equal to 2 1 indeed it must be assumed that the mass displacement doesn t change because of a variation of the floatation line the hydrostatic equilibrium of the deformed shape is reached by lowering the floatation line by 1 3 mm in fig 10 the unloaded shape of the boat in blue is compared with the deformed shape in red in the position that fulfills the original mass displacement the transversal sections of both shapes have been extracted in correspondence of the mast foot that is at x 1740 mm see fig 10 a it can be noticed that the deformed section moves outwards of the unloaded one in proximity of the keel while it moves inwards near both the round bilges the curvature is very similar along the section unless in the area near the keel where the deformed shape in red exhibits a higher curvature the area of the immersed transverse section increases by the 1 4 with respect to the unloaded shape the deformation of the hull in case c has a consequence on the waterlines horizontal planes have been created from the floatation line every δz 10 mm downwards and the result of the intersection of these planes with the unloaded and the deformed hull shape is visible in fig 10 b the difference between the two series of waterlines is concentrated in inner part of the hull where the deformed waterlines in red are stretched along the x direction it has been verified that the area of the wet surface remains substantially unchanged finally it has been compared the curvature of the keel lines of the two hulls as shown in fig 10 c the portion of the curvature near the bow has been removed because it is out of scale and the jump at the mid section is due to the presence of the trunk of the centerboard it can be noticed that the curvature has a very different behavior along the keel line and in particular the deformed keel has a curvature more than two times higher than the one calculated for the unloaded keel in correspondence of the mast foot this can result in a different local hydrodynamic efficiency of the hull high local curvature values generally lead to boundary layer separation and to a turbulent transition nevertheless these phenomena can be investigated only with more sophisticated approaches as computational fluid dynamic simulations 3 2 comparison with experiments in the following numerical and experimental data of local strain measurement of the hull are compared at first single grid gauges calculations are examined on keel and tilted section of the hull reinforcements then rosettes calculations on the hull sandwich panels for experimental case b and case c the relative standard deviation rsd has been calculated over a 5 s time interval centered on the acquisition time 3 2 1 keel strains have been measured on the forward of the keel with single grid er on port and starboard side namely sfp and sfs for the three load cases previously defined experimental results are summarized in histograms in fig 11 left while fem predictions are reported in fig 11 right the two grids are oriented parallel to the global x direction of the boat if we compare experimental results coming from different load cases fig 11 left we can notice that the two grids sfp and sfs give some discrepancies also under symmetric load conditions see case a for example this happens because of some small errors in locating the two grids on the opposite sides of the keel in fact in that area the longitudinal strain of the keel varies very quickly with the z coordinate and small differences of z for sfp and sfs can result as relevant difference in measured strain post check of the installations revealed a difference of about 5 mm in the coordinate z between sfp and sfs we take into account of this difference also when calculating strains from fem simulations a consistent drop on the strain level is observed between case a and case b this result is due to the fact that in case a the boat is subjected to its own weight and is supported at the bow and at the stern in a similar way as a simply supported beam is loaded with a force distributed along its length in case b the boat has a distributed support given by the water acting on the wetted surface with the hydrostatic pressure this scenario leads to a reduced global flexural strain on the keel in case c strains increase with respect to case b and are similar to those measured in case a this derives by the fact that the strain increasing effect caused by the external forces is partially balanced by the strain releasing effect caused by the hydrostatic support on the wetted surface it can be remarked that although in this case the load system is not symmetric the ratio between measurements at sfp and sfs is almost the same as under symmetric load cases such a behavior evidences that the keel is mainly affected by the preload due to rigging of forestay mast and it is less sensitive to variable loads caused by navigation conditions almost the same considerations can be done if we look at calculations obtained with fem simulations in fig 11 right case a and case c are the scenarios where higher strains are calculated differences between fem results and correspondent er measurements are very small maximum difference is calculated as 12 3 at sfp in case c 3 2 2 tilted sections strains have been measured on the tilted sections of the boat with single grid er on port and starboard side namely sap and sas for the three load cases previously defined experimental results are summarized in histograms in fig 12 left while fem predictions are reported in fig 12 right the two grids are oriented tangent to the shape of the reinforcement comparing experimental results coming from different load cases fig 12 left we can notice that the two grids sap and sas give under the same load conditions similar discrepancies as those already mentioned for the strain measurement on the keel also in the area of the sas and sap a high gradient of strain is present and a small asymmetry in locating the grids can result as a relevant difference in measured strain we take into account of this difference also when calculating strains from fem simulations it can be observed that strains measured by the single grids on the tilted sections are almost 3 4 times higher than those measured at the keel level this suggests that after preload the most deformed area is the one between the mast foot and the shroud attacks this area looks poorly sensitive to boat external supports in fact negligible differences can be appreciated between case a and case b the situation changes during navigation in case c we can notice that the downwind grid sap is subjected to a consistent increase of the strain level from 1733 με to 1966 με while the upwind grid sas is subjected to a small reduction from 1870 με to 1841 με the explanation of this behavior consists in the fact that during navigation the helmsman is on trapeze on the upwind side to maintain the boat flat on the sea this causes a partial unloading of the upwind shroud and an extra load on the downwind shroud similar considerations can be done regarding calculations obtained with fem simulations in fig 12 right also numerical analyses confirms the behavior observed in experiments the upwind grid sas shows a decrease in the strain level during navigation in case c while the downwind grid sap shows an increase of the strain level differences between fem results and correspondent er measurements are again very small maximum difference is calculated as 4 4 at sas in case c 3 2 3 hull panels principal strains have been measured on the hull panels of the boat with rosettes on port and starboard side at forward of the mast namely rfp and rfs and at aft of the mast namely rap and ras for the three load cases previously defined the maximum principal strain has been calculated and experimental results are summarized in histograms in fig 13 left and 14 left while fem predictions are reported in fig 13 right and 14 right fig 13 left shows that forward of the mast very small differences have been measured between port and starboard side both for symmetric and asymmetric load systems this means that the positions of rfp and rfs are almost specular and that port and starboard sides of the hull panels are not much influenced by the external loads for the panels forward of the mast a slight strain relief effect can be observed in case b with respect to case a during navigation in case c the strain levels increase but no difference can be appreciated between port and starboard side very similar considerations can be done for rosettes rap and ras that are located on hull panels at aft of the mast see fig 14 left there is a small difference between port and starboard side probably caused by the positions of the two rosettes that are not perfectly specular during navigation in case c a generalized strain level increase is measured at both sides of the panel looking at results given by the fem model in fig 13 right and 14 right it is evident that the differences to the respective experimental data are very small this is a proof of the robustness of the numerical model that simulate correctly the orthotropy of the sandwich panel also fem results demonstrate that case c is the most demanding for the boat but also that in the conditions of light breeze hull panels are not very sensitive to the aero hydro dynamic force system accordance between fem results and correspondent er measurements is very high the maximum difference is calculated as 8 2 at ras in case c 4 discussion from results reported in the previous sections it can be observed an overall very good agreement between the boat deformations numerically predicted and those measured during the test at sea in the different loading conditions examined results show that for such boat class under the meteorological conditions of the test light breeze and calm water the most relevant cause of the boat deformation is the preload of the rig preload leads to a relevant deformed state of the boat symmetric with respect to the longitudinal plane and concentrated in the area under the mast during navigation at beam reach it has been observed that the crew on trapeze causes an unloading of the upwind shroud and an overloading of the downwind shroud consequently the deformed state of the boat is no more symmetric starboard and port side of transverse reinforcement are differently influenced by the tack side of navigation not the same happens for longitudinal reinforcements and hull panels that are more sensitive to longitudinal loads coming from the forestay 5 conclusions in this paper it is described a multi approach procedure applied to a small sailing yacht during real navigation and able to process data coming from typical instruments mounted on a boat and evaluate a posteriori its global and local deformation state low cost devices as gps wind data logger and digital cameras have been used to obtain information about the boat route the wind parameters and the positions of the crew members all these data are elaborated to determine the load set applied to the boat that ensures the equilibrium condition a numerical model of the boat has been implemented in a cad fem environment in order to use this load set as a boundary condition for a structural analysis as final result of the procedure the global deformation state of the boat has been obtained a test at sea has been performed and numerical results have been compared with local values of deformation measured by electrical resistance strain gauges mounted on the hull and on reinforcement of the boat from the test three load conditions have been analysed corresponding to different time moments the boat supported on a trailer the boat on the sea head to wind and the boat during navigation at beam reach during the test local deformations of the boat have been also measured with er strain gauges from the numerical simulations run after the test the global deformed state of the boat has been obtained for the three load conditions over mentioned results have been compared with those measured with strain gauges and an optimal agreement has been attained hence it has been demonstrated that the proposed procedure can work as a post processing tool to evaluate the global deformed state that the boat has experienced during navigation maximum values of local deformation can be compared with limit values characteristic of the construction material to verify the integrity of structures and panels furthermore modification of the global aspect of the boat can be calculated in terms of variation of transverse sections waterlines and keel line curvature these data could be useful to evaluate the hydrodynamic efficiency of the boat in the deformed state future developments of this work will regard the use of tracking algorithms to automatically measure the positions of the crew members from the video captured by the digital cameras an encoder with a higher sensitivity and the implementation in the numerical model of the heeling angle measured via inclinometers to be mounted on board acknowledgments the authors gratefully

22540,in this paper a multi method approach is used to setup and validate a monitoring system applied to a small sailing boat during real sailing conditions this monitoring system is able to transform the data coming from some typical devices installed on board into information about the deformed state of the boat gps wind data logger and cameras have been installed on the boat to measure its route and speed the apparent wind velocity and direction and the positions of the crew members these data are processed to determine the equilibrium of the boat and estimate the loads applied on it then a cad fem model calculates the effects of these loads on the boat shape the resulting deformed model is compared with measurements of local strains obtained with electrical resistance strain gauges applied on the hull and on reinforcements of the boat onboard measuring devices are real time monitored with a home made software while the numerical prediction of the global boat deformation is obtained a posteriori once fem computation is achieved a test at sea has been performed to check the efficiency of the system data computed with the proposed procedure have been compared with those

the design phase during the early stage the focus is mainly oriented toward aero hydro dynamic analyses aimed to find the best of the hull shape with the best of rigging and sails a step forward is the structural dimensioning of the hull skin and of the internal reinforcement frame once a first tentative set of shape and dimensions has been found an iterative design refinement can start this loop as well known is the most complex to be set up the more the designer wants to optimise the more information are needed these information can be provided by numerical simulations e g computational fluid dynamics finite element analyses and or experimental tests e g towing tank material characterization strain sensors however because of the problem complexity the availability of real data acquired during sailing becomes fundamental in order to correctly validate a design approach most of the recent literature concerning yacht design deals with the rig sail system or with the hull system one by one concerning sails for instance fluid structure interaction analyses are performed to find the flying shape of the sails by coupling stress sensors data measured on the rig and image processing of video acquisitions in upwind augier et al 2012 and downwind deparday et al 2016 sailing conditions an interesting approach aimed to evaluate the real time flying shape of the sails is described in ferreira et al 2017 in which the authors make use of bragg sensors installed on a glass fibre laminate emulating the batten instead of image processing techniques numerical approaches aimed to optimise the sail plane are discussed in nascimbene 2013 from the structural point of view without experimental validation and in laverón simavilla et al 2008 from the fluid dynamic point of view and wind tunnel test applied to the olympic class catamaran tornado cella et al 2017 have developed a numerical optimization tool applied to sail plan and appendages of a catamaran to improve speed performances concerning the rigging in grabe 2003 the authors adopt force transducer data coming from an existing yacht to validate a finite element model of the rig while in ortigosa et al 2015 structural analyses of rig elements coupled with an aerodynamic solver gives real time information to the crew about the sailing performances concerning hulls the application of strain sensors is a well known methodology allowing to monitor structure deformations according to rigging and navigation loads in roy et al 2005 from the knowledge of the pressure map on the hull panels the mechanical behavior of the structure can be determined using fem code integrated into the cad catia from dassault an interesting application developed in bourgeon et al 2010 is the installation of strain gauges on board of the trimaran hydroptère the world fastest sailing boat reaching a record speed of about 53 knots in 2008 a similar approach described in murayama et al 2013 permits the structural health monitoring of america s cup class yacht thanks to fibre optic strain sensors at the beginning because of economical reasons the over mentioned numerical and experimental tools were especially applied to america s cup yachts where the research of extreme solutions to improve performances was mandatory nowadays thanks to the cost reduction of hardware and software and to the increasing of computational capabilities of desktop pcs these instruments find applications also in commercial and pleasure sailing and motor yachts baronti et al 2010 an interesting review of research activities focused on sailing dinghy performances can be found in garcia and martinez 2015 in some cases sailing dinghies became object of innovative experimentation to overcome classic design approaches as shown in andersson et al 2017 with regards to foil applications to a small optimist not only rig sail or structures have been numerically and or experimentally investigated but even regatta s strategies in spenkuch et al 2010 and banks et al 2010 cfd analyses permit a real time evaluation of the manoeuvring effect during tacking or gybe in pennanen et al 2016 a laser dinghy is studied from a numerical point of view to predict the optimal heel and trim while in tagliaferri and viola 2017 a real time software based on neural networks drives the skipper toward optimal routes during races in augustyniak et al 2012 a graphical interface collecting data from strain gauges gps and other sensors becomes an instrument useful for the crew training in this work a numerical experimental procedure applied to a small sailing yacht during real navigation is proposed the aim of this procedure is to process measured data of wind route and crew positions stored during the test and evaluate hull global and local deformation at this stage the calculated result can be obtained a posteriori and requires the visual determination of the crew member movements the peculiarity of the proposed method is that hydro aero dynamic loads applied on the boat are not directly measured there are no load cells applied on the rig but are obtained by the equilibrium of moments around the longitudinal and transvers axes of the boat given the apparent wind angle and velocity the boat see fig 1 is a dinghy with the hull and the deck made of an hybrid flax cork sandwich and internal reinforcements made of marine plywood this 15 skiff acronym of sail keep it flat and fast has been designed and manufactured at the university of palermo italy for the purpose of this work instruments have been installed on board gps wind data logger cameras as will be detailed in section 2 1 the boat was also instrumented with electrical resistance strain gauges and rosettes to validate numerical predictions obtained with the present procedure all the data provided by the instruments during the 2 h of test at sea have been stored in a computer and remotely managed with a home made software section 2 2 particular care has been taken to the data filtering in order to find stable sailing conditions in terms of wind velocity route speed heeling etc for a correct numerical model setup as explained in section 2 3 finally in section 3 the numerical experimental comparison will be detailed 2 materials and methods fig 2 shows the block diagram of the numerical experimental approach followed in the present paper to determine the global boat deformation by post processing the navigation data the core of the activity is the acquisition of some in field experimental information given by different measurement devices then process these data by means of analytical models and give them as input to a numerical cad fem model able to determine the final outputs which are the global local deformations of the boat these experimental data are the boat position measured with a gps the apparent wind angle awa and the apparent wind velocity awv measured with a wind data logger the crew member positions estimated with two digital cameras these data are elaborated by an in house made management software compiled in visual basic that turns out the boundary conditions requested by a cad fem model of the boat these boundary conditions are the set of local and distributed forces applied to the boat together with the rigging pre loads on mast shrouds forestay as previously calculated in mancuso et al 2018 the numerical model is generated in a cae environment constituted by a 3d solid model of the boat and its relative finite element mesh the final output of the numerical calculation is the deformed state of the boat consequent to the application of constant plus variable loads during real sailing conditions to ensure the reliability of this procedure local boat deformation given by electrical resistance gauges are also measured and finally compared with correspondent numerical results it must be remarked that in this procedure the use of er strain gauges is not mandatory to obtain the final numerical result but only to give comparison values to the predictions in fact in contrast with the idea of a low cost impact for the adopted tools er could be very expensive especially the data acquisition system and in some cases very difficult to install on an existent boat all the other devices used to measure the experimental entities are easy and cheap to obtain a gps receiver a wind data logger and a couple of digital cameras the numerical model can easily run on a medium performance pc in our case a 4 core i3 based laptop was used to run both the data acquisition software and the numerical model 2 1 experimental equipment the wind direction and intensity measurements during the experimental campaign were carried out using a dedicated acquisition board based on the arduino uno microcontroller programmed with the dedicated software arduino ide the board was based on an atmega 328p processor connected through serial peripheral interface spi to a real time clock module and an sd card reader for data logging purpose the acquisition board is connected to a commercial wind data logger wdl in particular a ws3080 from velleman has been used composed of an anemometer for the apparent wind velocity and a vane for the apparent wind direction the wind velocity sensor produces a pulsed output signal proportional to the wind speed with a sensitivity of 1 m s the wind direction was acquired through a rotary encoder that gives an analog output signal dependent on the position of a wind vane the sensitivity of the encoder is 22 5 the rtc modules produced a pulsed signal with a frequency of 1 hz that was used as a trigger for the signals acquisition using the interrupt capabilities of the microcontroller in between two measurements points the average value for each of the variables was computed in order to compensate small oscillation of the wind vane the time relative to each measurement was also stored in the sd card in order to be able to synchronise the wind data with the position of the boat that was acquired separately the whole system was power supplied by a battery pack with four alkaline aa type batteries a diode was inserted in between the main power switch and the arduino board in order to reduce the voltage to approximately 5 v and prevent polarity reversal fig 3 left shows the detailed schematics of the device the measurement system was tested and calibrated in laboratory using artificial wind produced by a blower and a high precision anemometer to compare the reading of the sensors with varying the wind speed the whole system was hence inserted into a waterproof case fig 3 right mounted on top of the mast together with the sensors electrical resistance strain gauges er have been applied on reinforcements and panels of the boat to measure local strains due to internal and external loads in some critical areas in particular four three grid rectangular rosettes hbm type ry81 6 350 and four single grid hbm type ly11 6 350 er gauges have been installed on specific locations shown in fig 4 left each installation is coded with three letters the first letter s r stands for single grid or rosette the second letter f a stands for forward or aft respectively the last letter p s stands for port side or starboard side rosettes are glued on the upper lamina in board side of the hull sandwich material while single grids are bonded on the plywood reinforcements in particular on opposite faces of the keel sfp and sfs and on the tilted sections sap and sas more details about the installation of the er gauges can be found in mancuso et al 2018 a 16 channel hbm quantumx data logger was used to connect all ers and synchronously acquire all signals each grid was connected using a quarter bridge 4 wire scheme from each of the four single grid installations only one signal is measured corresponding to the strain occurring along the grid direction from each of the four rosette installations three signals are measured by the three grids independently all the measured data are stored in an external hard drive disk the quantumx is power supplied by a dc battery at 24 v all the components have been located in a water resistant case see fig 4 right fixed on the deck of the boat just ahead of the mast the route of the boat has been recorded with a commercial gps receiver housed in the same case of the quantumx and connected to a power bank see fig 4 right two gopro cameras have been used to film the boat during navigation each working at 60 fps in full hd mode one is fixed on top of the mast focusing the deck of led the other one is hand held by a member of the shore team with the first one it is possible to monitor where the crew members are during navigation and control the deck rigging while with the second camera trim or heel rotations of the boat can be observed at this stage of the research activity these data can be estimated only with a visual analysis made a posteriori by the operator 2 2 data management the measured data are sampled by different devices and managed by an in house software compiled in visual basic able to synchronise all the multimodal signals sorce et al 2007 and show them on the customizable user interface in fig 5 by default in the upper area of the screen two windows are located showing the images captured by the camera 1 and 2 in the bottom area of the screen there are two oscilloscopes where the user can plot the preferred signals and a meter where the instant value of the selected signals are reported in particular in the screenshot in fig 5 in the left oscilloscopes are plotted the velocity of the boat calculated from the gps data the apparent wind velocity and the apparent wind angle both calculated from the wind data logger data in the right oscilloscope are plotted measurements given by the single grid er gauges sap and sas mounted on the tilted sections the software can work simply as a real time monitor of the instruments mounted on board if it is required the deformed state of any part of the boat then the operator has to select a time instant acquired during the test evaluate the crew member positions by looking at the acquired videos and run the fem model in the latter case an intrinsic delay must be considered due to the operator activity and to the computational time required by the fem model to converge with the low performance pc used in this work the running time was estimated around 30 s but with a more powerful pc it could be sensibly reduced the data measured during this test at sea have been downloaded at the end of the test and numerically post processed first step of the analysis is to synchronise these data in order to have a common starting point at time t 0 data from the wind data logger and from the gps appear very noisy for this reason a median filter has been applied to these data over a moving interval of 5 s this procedure returns smoother curves over the whole period of the test and allows a critic analysis about the time points to be considered as input data for the fem model it is important to extract a period of time long enough to attain constant conditions of navigation in terms of route wind boat flat on the sea and crew positions otherwise it could be selected an instant where inertial forces on the boat are present and the assumptions needed to solve the static equilibrium equations in mancuso et al 2018 are missing it has been observed that in the period from t 180 and t 380 the boat has navigated windward and with starboard tack with a reasonably constant speed after this period the wind speed decreased too much and the crew had to change the route several time to increase the boat speed absolute wind entities can be calculated from the measured data considering that the following equation applies 1 v w v a w v b where v w is the true wind vector v a w is the apparent wind vector and v b is the boat speed vector in particular v a w is measured by the wind data logger while v b can be calculated by means of numerical derivative of the instant positions measured by the gps in fig 6 it can be observed that between t 300 and t 380 speed and direction data are quite regular and the time instants for subsequent experimental and numerical calculations can be selected within this interval the path covered by the boat in this time interval is plotted on a satellite map of the area in fig 7 it can be observed that the boat runs on mostly beam reach conditions on starboard tack and with the true wind coming from ese at t 200 and rotating to s after t 300 triangles of velocity of the boat corresponding to speed quantities in eq 1 are drawn at some instants and show a good repeatability after t 300 2 3 numerical model the cad model has been imported into the cae environment of the software ansys workbench via stp files the original 3d model is constituted of the mid surface of hull deck and internal reinforcements due to the type of material used for the hull building the acp pre post module has been used in order to simulate the orthotropic behavior of the composite material in this module the elastic characteristics of the unidirectional laminate and the stacking sequence adopted in each component of the model must be assigned in particular the hull is built as a sandwich panel where the skins are made of a 0 45 90 flax epoxy composite and the internal core is made of cork the direction 0 is considered parallel to the longitudinal x axis of the boat the global sequence of the sandwich 0 45 90 cork 90 45 0 is balanced and symmetric with respect to the mid plane for the deck and the internal reinforcements a homogeneous isotropic marine okoumè plywood has been used details about the determination of the mechanical characteristics of the material and the manufacturing process can be found in the following references pitarresi et al 2015 mancuso et al 2015 a mesh of the boat is obtained with shell elements in order to reduce the total number of degrees of freedom of the model this choice is suggested by the thin aspect of each component of the boat where a maximum of 11 mm thick panel has been used the thickness has been added to the original cad surfaces of the boat in the inward direction for the hull and the deck and symmetrically for the internal reinforcements a total number of 120185 shell elements constitutes the whole model the value of 30 mm is the average side dimension of the shell elements in some particular areas where a high precision of the solution is required stress concentration areas due to geometrical singularity or areas where the er gauges are located local refinements of the mesh has been applied up to a minimum element size of 5 mm value similar to the measuring grid length of the er gauges attention has been particularly paid to the joints between surfaces a patch conformity tool is used to give correspondence to the nodes belonging to different surfaces on the intersection curve in some cases when the adjacent surfaces have different mesh size edge to area contact elements are used to rigidly bond the surfaces each other simulations are performed under linear elastic behavior conditions at each er installation a user coordinate system is created with the axes aligned to the grid directions the three deformations corresponding to the three grids of rosettes were in particular taken from the deformations of the upper in board lamina of the hull sandwich these deformations were further combined to derive principal strains ajovalasit and pitarresi 2011 to be compared with the correspondent value calculated from experiments 2 4 load cases loads carried by shrouds forestay and mast are applied directly on the boat reinforcements and are the results of the over position of two load systems a constant one coming from the internal rigging preload and a variable one coming from the equilibrium with the external aero hydro forces the over mentioned load systems consist of mostly vertical forces while horizontal forces are applied in correspondence of the terraces where the crew rest when hung on trapeze on the mast by the aerodynamic pressure on sails and on the trunk by the hydrodynamic pressure on the centerboard given awa and awv from the instruments active drive and heel forces generated by the sails are estimated using a free commercial vpp program these forces together with the crew member weights are used to determine the equilibrium of the moments around x and y during navigation following a simplified analytical procedure mancuso et al 2018 under the assumption of null heel and trim angles the gravity is applied on the entire model on the deck in the proximity of the trunk some areas have been created to simulate the presence of one or both crew members when in conditions of light breeze trapeze is not used the hydrostatic pressure is applied as a variable distributed pressure over the hull it must be remarked that the assumption of a hydrostatic distribution of pressure does not take into account of any dynamic effect on the hull this assumption appears reasonable especially in calm water and with a reduced boat speed three different load cases have been simulated and compared with correspondent instants of time during the test at sea as shown in fig 8 a b and c the first load case case a in fig 8 a takes into account only of preload on the rig point loads a b c and d the boat is assumed to be supported by a trailer at bow and stern point supports e and f a constant distributed gravity is applied on the entire boat distributed load g and the deck is not loaded reactions at bow and stern must equal the dry weight of the boat the second load case case b in fig 8 b is selected at time t 0 and assumes that the boat is at sea in calm water with the head to wind as case a preload is applied on the rig the boat is supported at bow and stern and a constant gravity is applied moreover the boat is supported by the hydrostatic pressure on the hull variable pressure h and both crew members are located on the deck seated near the mast foot surface loads i and j in this case the hydrostatic distribution must equal the mass displacement sum of the dry weight of the boat and the crew weight and the presence of support e and f is required by the fem solver only to avoid undesired rigid body motions it has been verified that reactions calculated by the solver at the end of the simulations are of several order of magnitude smaller than the typical loads applied to the boat this fact gives reliability to the adopted procedure the last load case case c in fig 8 c is selected at time t 374 when the boat navigates in mostly constant condition of wind and speed with the helmsman on trapeze see also fig 6 point loads a b c and d are now the sum of preload of the previous cases plus the external loads due to the equilibrium between the aerodynamic forces and the weight of the helmsman on trapeze supports e and f and distributed loads g and h are the same as previous cases horizontal forces applied by the helmsman on terrace are loads i and j while surface load k assumes the presence of the bowman at the port side of the centerboard it must be remarked that in case a and case b all loads are symmetric with respect to the longitudinal plane of the boat while in case c loads are non symmetric for this reason in addition to the simply supports at bow and stern a constraint l is applied on the side faces of the trunk along the y direction in order to balance the transversal component of the aerodynamic wind force in fig 8 d the distribution on the hull of the hydrostatic pressure used for case b and case c is shown then applied loads are summarized in table 1 3 results 3 1 numerical simulation data 3 1 1 global deformation when dealing with small sized boats like the one studied in this paper one of the aspects that should be taken into account when the boat is rigged is that the preload level can affect the final shape of the hull in fact a very high preload on the mast causes a global longitudinal deflection of the keel in the area between the shrouds and the forestay in this sense modifications of the original waterlines should be considered and as a consequence a new hydrodynamic behavior should be expected nevertheless the preload level cannot be reduced too much in order to avoid an excessive drop of load on the upwind shroud during navigation numerical analyses performed on the boat in the three different cases over mentioned allow a quick evaluation of the global deformation of the boat the principal deformation induced on the hull after rigging is the displacement in the z direction the absolute values of this entity depend on the global constrains applied to the boat and change in the three load configurations in fig 9 left the contour map of u z is reported for case a when only the preload is applied on mast and shrouds and the boat is simply supported at the stern post and at the right ahead it can be observed that the whole boat is subjected to a negative deformation along z and the maximum negative displacement is calculated under the mast foot as 5 24 mm this value is not meaningful by itself but must be related to the original immersion of the boat in that point 130 mm the ratio of these values estimates an immersion change of 4 0 with respect to the original boat design the deformed state of the hull slightly improves in case b where the boat is supported by the hydrostatic pressure and the crew is on the deck see fig 9 middle in fact the distributed support on the hull given by the water relieves the global bending deformation of the keel caused by the preload on mast and shrouds the maximum negative displacement calculated under the mast foot is 4 92 mm and the immersion change is 3 78 during navigation in case c one element of the crew is on trapeze and his weight must be summed to the original preload of the mast the global deformation observed in this load case is the worse among the three the maximum negative displacement under the mast foot is 5 6 mm that means an immersion change of 4 3 see fig 9 right 3 1 2 local deformation the unloaded shape of the boat and the one deformed in case c have been compared to investigate about the effects on hydrostatics of the local deformation of the hull under the mast foot with respect to the original mass displacement in fig 1 the deformation of the hull should lead to an increase of the mass displacement equal to 2 1 indeed it must be assumed that the mass displacement doesn t change because of a variation of the floatation line the hydrostatic equilibrium of the deformed shape is reached by lowering the floatation line by 1 3 mm in fig 10 the unloaded shape of the boat in blue is compared with the deformed shape in red in the position that fulfills the original mass displacement the transversal sections of both shapes have been extracted in correspondence of the mast foot that is at x 1740 mm see fig 10 a it can be noticed that the deformed section moves outwards of the unloaded one in proximity of the keel while it moves inwards near both the round bilges the curvature is very similar along the section unless in the area near the keel where the deformed shape in red exhibits a higher curvature the area of the immersed transverse section increases by the 1 4 with respect to the unloaded shape the deformation of the hull in case c has a consequence on the waterlines horizontal planes have been created from the floatation line every δz 10 mm downwards and the result of the intersection of these planes with the unloaded and the deformed hull shape is visible in fig 10 b the difference between the two series of waterlines is concentrated in inner part of the hull where the deformed waterlines in red are stretched along the x direction it has been verified that the area of the wet surface remains substantially unchanged finally it has been compared the curvature of the keel lines of the two hulls as shown in fig 10 c the portion of the curvature near the bow has been removed because it is out of scale and the jump at the mid section is due to the presence of the trunk of the centerboard it can be noticed that the curvature has a very different behavior along the keel line and in particular the deformed keel has a curvature more than two times higher than the one calculated for the unloaded keel in correspondence of the mast foot this can result in a different local hydrodynamic efficiency of the hull high local curvature values generally lead to boundary layer separation and to a turbulent transition nevertheless these phenomena can be investigated only with more sophisticated approaches as computational fluid dynamic simulations 3 2 comparison with experiments in the following numerical and experimental data of local strain measurement of the hull are compared at first single grid gauges calculations are examined on keel and tilted section of the hull reinforcements then rosettes calculations on the hull sandwich panels for experimental case b and case c the relative standard deviation rsd has been calculated over a 5 s time interval centered on the acquisition time 3 2 1 keel strains have been measured on the forward of the keel with single grid er on port and starboard side namely sfp and sfs for the three load cases previously defined experimental results are summarized in histograms in fig 11 left while fem predictions are reported in fig 11 right the two grids are oriented parallel to the global x direction of the boat if we compare experimental results coming from different load cases fig 11 left we can notice that the two grids sfp and sfs give some discrepancies also under symmetric load conditions see case a for example this happens because of some small errors in locating the two grids on the opposite sides of the keel in fact in that area the longitudinal strain of the keel varies very quickly with the z coordinate and small differences of z for sfp and sfs can result as relevant difference in measured strain post check of the installations revealed a difference of about 5 mm in the coordinate z between sfp and sfs we take into account of this difference also when calculating strains from fem simulations a consistent drop on the strain level is observed between case a and case b this result is due to the fact that in case a the boat is subjected to its own weight and is supported at the bow and at the stern in a similar way as a simply supported beam is loaded with a force distributed along its length in case b the boat has a distributed support given by the water acting on the wetted surface with the hydrostatic pressure this scenario leads to a reduced global flexural strain on the keel in case c strains increase with respect to case b and are similar to those measured in case a this derives by the fact that the strain increasing effect caused by the external forces is partially balanced by the strain releasing effect caused by the hydrostatic support on the wetted surface it can be remarked that although in this case the load system is not symmetric the ratio between measurements at sfp and sfs is almost the same as under symmetric load cases such a behavior evidences that the keel is mainly affected by the preload due to rigging of forestay mast and it is less sensitive to variable loads caused by navigation conditions almost the same considerations can be done if we look at calculations obtained with fem simulations in fig 11 right case a and case c are the scenarios where higher strains are calculated differences between fem results and correspondent er measurements are very small maximum difference is calculated as 12 3 at sfp in case c 3 2 2 tilted sections strains have been measured on the tilted sections of the boat with single grid er on port and starboard side namely sap and sas for the three load cases previously defined experimental results are summarized in histograms in fig 12 left while fem predictions are reported in fig 12 right the two grids are oriented tangent to the shape of the reinforcement comparing experimental results coming from different load cases fig 12 left we can notice that the two grids sap and sas give under the same load conditions similar discrepancies as those already mentioned for the strain measurement on the keel also in the area of the sas and sap a high gradient of strain is present and a small asymmetry in locating the grids can result as a relevant difference in measured strain we take into account of this difference also when calculating strains from fem simulations it can be observed that strains measured by the single grids on the tilted sections are almost 3 4 times higher than those measured at the keel level this suggests that after preload the most deformed area is the one between the mast foot and the shroud attacks this area looks poorly sensitive to boat external supports in fact negligible differences can be appreciated between case a and case b the situation changes during navigation in case c we can notice that the downwind grid sap is subjected to a consistent increase of the strain level from 1733 με to 1966 με while the upwind grid sas is subjected to a small reduction from 1870 με to 1841 με the explanation of this behavior consists in the fact that during navigation the helmsman is on trapeze on the upwind side to maintain the boat flat on the sea this causes a partial unloading of the upwind shroud and an extra load on the downwind shroud similar considerations can be done regarding calculations obtained with fem simulations in fig 12 right also numerical analyses confirms the behavior observed in experiments the upwind grid sas shows a decrease in the strain level during navigation in case c while the downwind grid sap shows an increase of the strain level differences between fem results and correspondent er measurements are again very small maximum difference is calculated as 4 4 at sas in case c 3 2 3 hull panels principal strains have been measured on the hull panels of the boat with rosettes on port and starboard side at forward of the mast namely rfp and rfs and at aft of the mast namely rap and ras for the three load cases previously defined the maximum principal strain has been calculated and experimental results are summarized in histograms in fig 13 left and 14 left while fem predictions are reported in fig 13 right and 14 right fig 13 left shows that forward of the mast very small differences have been measured between port and starboard side both for symmetric and asymmetric load systems this means that the positions of rfp and rfs are almost specular and that port and starboard sides of the hull panels are not much influenced by the external loads for the panels forward of the mast a slight strain relief effect can be observed in case b with respect to case a during navigation in case c the strain levels increase but no difference can be appreciated between port and starboard side very similar considerations can be done for rosettes rap and ras that are located on hull panels at aft of the mast see fig 14 left there is a small difference between port and starboard side probably caused by the positions of the two rosettes that are not perfectly specular during navigation in case c a generalized strain level increase is measured at both sides of the panel looking at results given by the fem model in fig 13 right and 14 right it is evident that the differences to the respective experimental data are very small this is a proof of the robustness of the numerical model that simulate correctly the orthotropy of the sandwich panel also fem results demonstrate that case c is the most demanding for the boat but also that in the conditions of light breeze hull panels are not very sensitive to the aero hydro dynamic force system accordance between fem results and correspondent er measurements is very high the maximum difference is calculated as 8 2 at ras in case c 4 discussion from results reported in the previous sections it can be observed an overall very good agreement between the boat deformations numerically predicted and those measured during the test at sea in the different loading conditions examined results show that for such boat class under the meteorological conditions of the test light breeze and calm water the most relevant cause of the boat deformation is the preload of the rig preload leads to a relevant deformed state of the boat symmetric with respect to the longitudinal plane and concentrated in the area under the mast during navigation at beam reach it has been observed that the crew on trapeze causes an unloading of the upwind shroud and an overloading of the downwind shroud consequently the deformed state of the boat is no more symmetric starboard and port side of transverse reinforcement are differently influenced by the tack side of navigation not the same happens for longitudinal reinforcements and hull panels that are more sensitive to longitudinal loads coming from the forestay 5 conclusions in this paper it is described a multi approach procedure applied to a small sailing yacht during real navigation and able to process data coming from typical instruments mounted on a boat and evaluate a posteriori its global and local deformation state low cost devices as gps wind data logger and digital cameras have been used to obtain information about the boat route the wind parameters and the positions of the crew members all these data are elaborated to determine the load set applied to the boat that ensures the equilibrium condition a numerical model of the boat has been implemented in a cad fem environment in order to use this load set as a boundary condition for a structural analysis as final result of the procedure the global deformation state of the boat has been obtained a test at sea has been performed and numerical results have been compared with local values of deformation measured by electrical resistance strain gauges mounted on the hull and on reinforcement of the boat from the test three load conditions have been analysed corresponding to different time moments the boat supported on a trailer the boat on the sea head to wind and the boat during navigation at beam reach during the test local deformations of the boat have been also measured with er strain gauges from the numerical simulations run after the test the global deformed state of the boat has been obtained for the three load conditions over mentioned results have been compared with those measured with strain gauges and an optimal agreement has been attained hence it has been demonstrated that the proposed procedure can work as a post processing tool to evaluate the global deformed state that the boat has experienced during navigation maximum values of local deformation can be compared with limit values characteristic of the construction material to verify the integrity of structures and panels furthermore modification of the global aspect of the boat can be calculated in terms of variation of transverse sections waterlines and keel line curvature these data could be useful to evaluate the hydrodynamic efficiency of the boat in the

22541,this paper analyzes the characteristics of the wake dynamics of a propeller operating before a rudder under open water conditions the analysis is conducted using a numerical method based on the detached eddy simulation des in particular the evolution mechanism of the propeller wake is explored under different advance coefficient and rudder angle conditions under heavy load conditions the topology of the vortex system becomes more complex and is accompanied by a stronger interaction between the wake and the rudder in addition a secondary vortical structure bridging the tip vortices is formed in the vicinity of the tip vortex followed by the growth of a secondary vortex and the formation of a secondary vortex pair at nonzero rudder angles the interaction between the tip vortex and the rudder becomes stronger yielding a more complex vortex topology furthermore an intertwined vortical structure is formed on the suction side and the ω shaped vortical structures form much earlier analysis of the kinetic energy ke and pressure spectra on the rudder surface provides additional insights into the evolution pattern of the vortical structures the objective of this study is to further identify the dynamic characteristics of the propeller vortices before the rudder under multiple operating conditions keywords propeller des wake dynamics interaction effect 1 introduction propellers are used as the major propulsion method in modern ships analysis of the performance and viscous flow field associated with propellers has attracted considerable attention in research into ship dynamics and propulsion felli et al 2011 chase and carrica 2013 muscari et al 2017 wang et al 2018a b the wake generated by the propeller evolves from the near to far field regions in a complex physical fashion accompanied by the formation of very complex vortical structures thus understanding the physical nature and evolution mechanism of the propeller wake has significant implications zhu 2015 zhu et al 2017 wang et al 2018a b magionesi et al 2018 this knowledge is directly related to the hydrodynamic performance vibration noise and structural issues of modern ships and helps to provide a more accurate prediction of the propeller performance which enhances the design and optimization of propellers for various requirements many experimental and numerical studies have explored the viscous flow field associated with an isolated propeller under various operating conditions experimental studies of the propeller wake include that of felli et al 2006 who experimentally analyzed the wake evolution of a propeller from pressure and velocity phase measurements their study showed that the tip vortex passage is an important factor in the generation of the pressure field in the near wake zone furthermore the breakdown of the vortex can result in a strong deformation of the hub vortex paik et al 2007 employed a double frame particle image velocimetry piv technique to measure the wake field of a four bladed propeller under a high reynolds number condition they analyzed the spatial evolution of the vortex from near the propeller to a distance of one propeller diameter away the results demonstrated that piv can capture details of the wake field of the propeller which are very useful in propeller optimization and design felli et al 2011 measured the wake field of propellers with different numbers of blades using a time resolved visualization device and a velocity measurement device their study focused on exploring the effect of the spiral to spiral distance and blade number on the evolution and instability of the hub vortex and tip vortex test results showed that the vortex breakdown is induced by the mutual inductance of adjacent spirals felli and falchi 2018 performed an experimental piv analysis of the propeller wake field under oblique inflow conditions using a multi camera configuration their study compared the systematic topology of the wake behavior in axisymmetric and oblique inflow conditions this work extended the knowledge of propeller wake dynamics and revealed the evolution instability and breakdown mechanisms of propeller wake vortices under non axisymmetric inflow conditions the propeller wake field has also been numerically studied such as when muscari et al 2013 investigated the capabilities and limitations of detached eddy simulation des and reynolds averaged navier stokes rans methods for simulating the wake of a marine propeller their results demonstrated that rans provides better predictions of macroscale quantities such as thrust and torque but is too dissipative when unsteady flow fluctuations or unstable wake processes are of interest in contrast des can successfully predict the onset of instabilities in the wake jang and mahesh 2013 analyzed the flow around a reverse rotating propeller in a uniform free stream using the large eddy simulation les method rotation of the propeller in the reverse direction causes the interaction between the free stream and the reverse flow to yield a vortex ring in the vicinity of the propeller disk flow separation occurred along the sharp edge of the blade resulting in high amplitude transient propeller loads dubbioso et al 2013 2014 evaluated the performances of a marine propeller in oblique flow conditions under a wide range of incidence angles they mainly focused on the behavior of the propeller with respect to global loads although the blade pressure distribution and downstream wake also supported the force generation in terms of velocity and vorticity fields di mascio et al 2014 investigated the onset and nature of dynamic instabilities experienced by the wake of a propeller set in oblique flow by means of des their results showed that the destabilization of the wake in oblique inflow is mainly triggered by the secondary vorticity and hub vortex kumar and mahesh 2017 studied the wake of a five bladed marine propeller under the designed operating conditions they examined the mechanisms of wake instability by analyzing the phase averaged and azimuthal averaged flow fields and identified a mutual induction mechanism of instability wang et al 2018b examined the relationship between the characteristics of a trailing vortex wake from the propeller and its skew angle the results showed that increasing the skew angle can alleviate the blade to blade interaction thereby delaying the deformation of the hub vortex and destabilization of the tip vortices compared with the wake of an isolated propeller the wake flow field of a propeller in a propeller rudder configuration is much more complex because of the interaction between the vortical structure and the solid boundary rockwell 1998 this interaction is closely related to the unsteady load on the solid surface which induces structural vibrations radiated noise and energy loss therefore the interaction between vortical structures and the solid boundary is an important topic in ship hydrodynamics muscari et al 2017 analyzed the wake flow of a single blade propeller operating before the rudder using des their study showed that the tip vortex and hub vortex evolve independently during the approaching and interaction phases and eventually reconnect and merge in the middle and far wake under the strong interaction with the boundary layer on the rudder badoe et al 2015 computed the time resolved flow around the hull propeller rudder system based on rans equations and an arbitrary mesh interface ami model the results were in good agreement with wind tunnel investigations and the variation of the upstream body length and drift angle were found to effectively vary the magnitude of the crossflow and wake at the propeller plane felli et al 2009 studied the flow field in a propeller rudder system using laser doppler velocimetry and time resolved camera instruments the effects of the potential collision at the rudder leading edge the double helix breakdown of the vortex filaments while moving chordwise and the chordwise and spanwise misalignments between the vertical filaments were all characterized in detail di mascio et al 2015 studied the flow field in a propeller rudder system using an unsteady rans method their simulation accurately predicted the distortion of the tip vortex and the strong deformation of the tip vortex while passing the leading edge of the rudder as observed in experimental tests based on the above literature review determining the wake flow of a propeller operating before the rudder is a challenging task further research is also needed to assess the characteristics of the wake flow in this study the flow field of a marine propeller insean e779a operating before a rudder with a symmetrical cross sectional shape naca0020 profile is analyzed using the des method the objectives of this study are as follows i reveal the mechanism of wake evolution under different loading and rudder angle conditions ii analyze the wake evolution quantitatively based on the power spectrum density psd of the kinetic energy ke of the wake flow field and iii discuss the unsteady load on the rudder surface under different conditions the remainder of this paper is structured as follows section 2 presents details of the numerical simulations section 3 discusses the level of uncertainty associated with the mesh used in the numerical simulation and section 4 analyzes the average flow field and instantaneous flow details section 5 then discusses the results of the psd analysis of the ke and unsteady load on the rudder surface finally concluding remarks are presented in section 6 2 simulation details the three dimensional viscous flow field is solved using the finite volume method based on the segregated flow solver in the star ccm computational fluid dynamics code the des version of the spalart allmaras turbulence model spalart and allmaras 1994 is employed to resolve the turbulent wake structures for more details and a complete description of the des approach readers are referred to muscari et al 2017 di mascio et al 2014 and gong et al 2018 2 1 test case the simple propeller rudder system used by felli et al 2009 is employed in this numerical simulation this system has been used by cnr insean for many experiments in a cavitation tunnel the geometric model and reference coordinate system are shown in fig 1 the geometric characteristics are summarized in table 1 the distance between the propeller and rudder is equal to the distance from the rotation center of the propeller to the leading edge of the rudder i e d 2 note that the rudder modeled in this study is sufficiently long to mitigate the effect induced by the rudder tip rudder angles of β 0 and β 20 trailing edge of the rudder towards the side with y 0 are used in the numerical simulation together with advance coefficients of j 0 71 and j 0 45 where the advance coefficient is defined by j u n d these two coefficients correspond to light and heavy loading conditions respectively the different advance coefficients are obtained by changing the freestream velocity u with a fixed rotation speed n n 25 rps unless stated otherwise all physical quantities are nondimensionalized using the characteristic parameters specifically the characteristic length is the radius of the propeller l ref 0 1135 m the characteristic velocity is the velocity at the tip of the propeller blade u ref n π d 17 83 m s and the characteristic density is the density of the fluid ρ 1000 kg m3 under such conditions the reynolds number is given by re u r e f l r e f ν 1 78 10 6 based on the discretization of the final mesh the dimensionless period of revolution and time step are set as t 2 π and δ t 0 01745 which corresponds to the time taken for the propeller to rotate by 1 respectively 2 2 mesh details when simulating the wake flow field of a propeller operating before a rudder the numerical transmission of the unsteady flow field during the rotation of the propeller is realized by the overset grid technique carrica et al 2007 tang et al 2014 wang et al 2017 the computational domain is a cylinder with a diameter of 16d that extends 2d and 8d upstream and downstream from the propeller respectively according to kumar and mahesh 2017 the size effect of the computational domain on the evolution of the propeller wake is negligible in this study an unstructured mesh is used in the simulations multiple control volumes are employed to increase the mesh density in the tip vortex and hub vortex regions in addition the rotation region containing the propeller is discretized using a polyhedral mesh the static region including the rudder is discretized using the trimmed mesh to satisfy the requirements of the des algorithm the dimensionless distance between the first grid node and the wall y is always less than 1 i e y 1 the number of prism boundary layers is set to 20 the distribution of the control volume and the details of the local mesh are shown in fig 2 for the mesh convergence analysis two sets of meshes are considered the medium mesh has 14 81 million cells in total with the rotation region and static region containing 5 52 million and 9 29 million cells respectively the fine mesh has 25 89 million cells in total with the rotation region and static region containing 9 65 million and 16 24 million cells respectively 3 mesh verification to assess the numerical uncertainty in this study two sets of meshes are developed a constant value of δ t δ min is used to ensure that the cfl number remains constant note that it is not possible to evaluate the numerical uncertainty based on three sets of meshes because any further reduction in the number of cells will yield a coarse mesh that cannot resolve many important flow characteristics whereas any further increase in the number of cells will require too much computational power based on the work of muscari et al 2013 the two grid assessment procedure proposed by roache 1997 is used to perform the uncertainty analysis the refinement ratio of the mesh must be determined before the mesh convergence study according to baek et al 2015 and gong et al 2018 the refinement ratio of the mesh is defined by 1 r n f i n e n c o a r s e 1 d where n is the total number of cells and d is the dimension of the problem explored in the simulation as this study considers a three dimensional problem d 3 the refinement ratio of both meshes used in this study is approximately 1 2 the error of the fine mesh is defined by 2 e f 2 f 1 1 r p where f 1 and f 2 correspond to the calculation results of the fine mesh and the medium mesh and p is the formal order of accuracy p 2 the uncertainty is estimated by 3 u n f s e where f s is a safety factor assumed to be 3 the mesh convergence analysis in the present numerical simulation is based on the thrust and torque of the propeller the results are summarized in table 2 note that the results obtained using the medium mesh are very close to those obtained using the fine mesh this suggests that the simulation results are reliable muscari et al 2017 in addition the uncertainty in the propeller load is less than 2 in all cases fig 3 shows the computation results of the open water characteristics in the single propeller and propeller rudder configurations as shown in the figure the open water characteristics calculated for the single propeller match the experimental results closely however the presence of the rudder results in a slight increase in both the thrust coefficient and torque coefficient furthermore this increase can be reduced by applying a greater loading coefficient on the propeller this trend agrees with the results reported by wang et al 2011 based on the current number of cells and computational resources the medium mesh is fully capable of performing the simulation task considered in this study therefore all computational results are obtained using the medium mesh 4 wake dynamics to better understand the evolution mechanism of the wake vortex of a propeller operating before a rudder the wake dynamics of the propeller are analyzed from two different perspectives i e the mean flow field and the instantaneous flow field note that the vortical structures explored in this paper are all displayed using the q criterion iso surface hunt et al 1988 the q is defined as follow 4 q 1 2 u x 2 v y 2 w z 2 u y v x u z w x v z w y for all the visualizations of spatial structures of this paper the values of iso surfaces are set to q 3000 s 2 4 1 mean wake field characteristics the average physical quantities associated with the wake are analyzed to verify whether the shape of the transient wake represents a statistically stable interval muscari et al 2013 for a common variable ξ x t its time averaged value is given by 5 ξ x t 1 t t 0 t 0 t ξ x τ d τ where t 0 is the time at which the sampling starts t 0 40 in this study figs 4 and 5 show the change in the mean velocity along directions u v and w as well as the reynolds stress u i u j u i u j u i u j at downstream probe p6 see fig 14 under the two different loading conditions probe p6 is selected because the convergence rate is minimized at this location as shown in the figure the flow field reaches a statistically stable condition after 80 dimensionless time steps the rate of stabilization increases with the advance coefficient fig 6 shows the contour of the mean axial velocity on the downstream cross section at a distance of x r 0 75 from the propeller under different operating conditions as shown in the figure the high velocity region is concentrated in the outer portion of the propeller disc however the presence of the rudder results in a non uniform distribution of the average axial velocity in the near field of the propeller when β 0 the rudder blockage results in the low velocity zone being distributed along the span direction of the rudder under the heavy loading condition the high velocity zone tends to be distributed in the second and fourth quadrants of the propeller disc under the light loading condition the drop in axial velocity is more significant this is also associated with the rudder blockage effect and the resulting perturbations at the propeller depend on the loading conditions the lower the propeller load the more sensitive it is to perturbations when β 20 the inclination of the rudder causes the low velocity zone to be mainly focused in the first and fourth quadrants this leads to a change in the flow distribution on the propeller disc with the mean velocity in the first and fourth quadrants becoming smaller while the high velocity zone becomes more concentrated in the second and third quadrants this distribution pattern is especially evident under the light loading condition in which case the propeller wake is more sensitive to perturbations figs 7 and 8 show the characteristics of the vortical structure based on the average flow at j 0 45 as shown in fig 7 the vortical structure exhibits a tube like profile in the approaching phase in the collision phase the tip vortex and hub vortex are divided into a left part y 0 and a right part y 0 by the pressure and suction sides of the rudder during the convection phase the left tip vortex l tv right tip vortex r tv left hub vortex l hv and right hub vortex r hv can all be clearly identified the tip vortex merges in the far field of the wake for convenience of analysis the pressure side is defined as the regions with y 0 z 0 or y 0 z 0 whereas the suction side is defined as the regions with y 0 z 0 or y 0 z 0 details of the average vortical structure in the near field of the wake are shown in fig 8 the profile of the vortex in the near field of the wake experiences a downward and upward displacement indicated by the red dashed line in the figure when y 0 and y 0 respectively on the pressure side the upward and downward displacements are monotonic along the chord however on the suction side these displacements are not monotonic which is in accordance with the observations reported by muscari et al 2017 when β 0 the profile of the vortex exhibits a similar range for y 0 and y 0 when β 20 however the range of the vortex profile is smaller in the y 0 region than in the y 0 region this suggests that the vortical structure is affected by a stronger interaction in the y 0 region furthermore attached vortical structures are also found on the surface of the rudder namely the upper collision vortex u cv and lower collision vortex l cv these vortices are formed by the interaction and collision between the propeller tip vortex and the leading edge of the rudder in both the y 0 and y 0 regions u cv keeps growing along the positive z axis while l cv keeps growing along the negative z axis when β 20 a large number of small vortical structures become detached from the surface of the rudder in the y 0 region these vortical structures will eventually interact and merge with the u cv and l cv 4 2 instantaneous wake field characteristics all the comparisons of instantaneous wake vortex in this section represent the same instant in the time domain for consistency and the related dimensionless time and rotation period are stated in each figure the characteristics of the wake vortex dynamics of a propeller operating before a rudder are now analyzed based on the instantaneous flow field under different operating conditions to better describe the characteristics of the instantaneous wake vortex the tip vortex generated by different propeller blades is marked accordingly for example the tip vortex generated by the propeller blade at θ 90 is labelled as b90 figs 9 and 10 show the evolution characteristics of the instantaneous vortical structure at j 0 45 and β 0 as shown in fig 9 the vortex evolution exhibits a regular spiral shape in the approaching phase this feature is consistent with the average vortex morphology shown in fig 8 in the collision phase however the vortex and the rudder start to interact with each other and the tip vortex splits into two branches on the pressure and suction sides of the rudder on the pressure side the tip vortex experiences an upward fig 9 a or downward fig 9 b displacement indicated by the blue dashed line in the figure such displacement is monotonic along the chord on the suction side these upward and downward displacements are not monotonic which is in agreement with the situation shown in fig 8 in addition in the collision phase a viscous interaction occurs between the tip vortex and the boundary layer of the rudder accompanied by an exchange of vorticity such behavior induces the formation of vortical structures attached to the rudder surface as the tip vortex evolves along the downstream direction these attached vortices continue to be distributed along the span direction of the rudder and interact with the rudder furthermore these attached vortical structures exhibit different morphologies on the pressure and suction sides specifically the attached vortical structures become thicker on the pressure side but thinner and longer on the suction side this is because the interaction between the tip vortex and the boundary layer of the rudder is stronger on the pressure side than on the suction side of the rudder in the convection phase a pairing phenomenon starts to emerge among the tip vortices the early vortex pairings formed in the flow are the b0 b90 and b180 b270 pairings as the vortical structures continue to evolve towards the far field a second round of vortex pairings is observed i e the b0b90 b180b270 pairing labelled in the figure while the merged tip vortices continue to evolve along the downstream direction they start to form ω shapes on the leeward side and windward side when the tip vortices detach from the rudder they start to spawn secondary vortical structures these secondary structures wrap around the tip vortices and function as bridges connecting adjacent tip vortices fig 10 reveals further details of the instantaneous vortical structures at j 0 45 and β 0 as shown in the figure the tip vortices buckle during the initial collision phase as reflected by the local vortex v b0 of the tip vortex b0 as the tip vortex continues to evolve the collision between the vortical structure and the rudder results in a viscous interaction between the tip vortex and the boundary layer of the rudder accompanied by an exchange of vorticity subsequently local vortices v b90 v b180 and v b270 evolve from tip vortices b90 b180 and b270 respectively these local vortices are not shown in the instantaneous vortical structure in fig 10 with further evolution new pairings of vortices occur in the system including the formation of the b180 b270 pairing these new vortex pairings induce the subsequent formation of the v b180 v b270 pairing v b0 v b90 pairing and ultimately the formation of v b0b90 and v b180b270 after the tip vortices detach from the trailing edge of the rudder the secondary vortices bridging the adjacent tip vortices start to evolve with a certain pattern when the tip vortices have just detached from the rudder i e within a short distance from the surface of the rudder the neighboring tip vortices are connected by a single secondary vortex such as s1 and s2 in the figure as these secondary vortices continue to evolve the neighboring tip vortices are no longer connected by a single secondary vortex but by a secondary vortex pairing such as the s3 s6 region shown in the figure these secondary vortex pairings start to interact with each other within the red dashed rectangle shown in the figure as the vortex pitch increases after the tip vortices merge the secondary vortex pairing becomes longer and thicker fig 11 shows the instantaneous vortical structures at j 0 71 and β 0 compared with the small advance coefficient case the vortex system exhibits a simpler topological structure and different evolution pattern with increasing convection velocity the displacement of the tip vortices becomes smaller and the viscous interaction between the tip vortex and the boundary layer of the rudder weakens in the collision phase at the same time the attached vortical structure becomes less obvious in addition the increase in the advance coefficient results in a delay to the pairing process of tip vortices and a significant backward shift in the location where the ω shaped vortical structures are formed nevertheless the bridging vortical structures between neighboring tip vortices are still clear and evident fig 12 shows the evolution of the instantaneous vortical structures at j 0 45 and β 20 as shown in the figure the evolution of the vortices in the approaching phase follows a similar pattern as for the case where the rudder angle is zero when β 20 a large deviation can be observed in the collision phase unlike the case β 0 specifically increasing the rudder angle results in a more intense collision between the vortex and the rudder a more complex evolution pattern of the tip vortex and a more complex topological structure of the vortex system on the leeward side the upward displacement of the tip vortex is very strong on the pressure side but relatively gentle on the suction side indicated by the blue dashed line in fig 12 a however on the windward side the displacement of the tip vortices is very gentle on both the pressure and suction sides the increase in rudder angle means that no ω shaped vortical structures form on the leeward side during the evolution of the tip vortex on the windward side the ω shaped vortical structures now form much earlier on the suction side the stronger interaction between the tip vortex and boundary layer of the rudder on the leeward side induces local vortical structures that evolve from regions v1 to v5 the b0 b90 pairing indicates that vortices v b0 and v b90 are not paired simply as shown in fig 10 instead v b0 winds around v b90 in region v1 and both vortices gradually split into multiple smaller branches after the tip vortices detach from the trailing edge of the rudder these smaller branches of vortices become entangled in a spiral shape this process is clearly captured in regions v2 v3 as the vortices continue to evolve the smaller branches generated from the splitting appear to merge again and form the specific vortical structure shown in region v5 on the windward side a large number of small vortical structures detach from the surface of the rudder because of the increased rudder angle as shown in regions a and a in fig 12 b these small vortical structures interact and merge with local vortices v b0 v b90 v b180 and v b270 which are formed by the interaction between the tip vortex and the boundary layer of the rudder such behavior induces a certain impact on the further evolution of the tip vortex in addition the evolution of the wake vortical structure of the propeller becomes more complex in the presence of the increased rudder angle an example is the entanglement of the secondary vortices connecting the neighboring tip vortices as shown in fig 12 b fig 13 shows the evolution of the instantaneous vortical structures at j 0 71 and β 20 compared with the heavy loading condition j 0 45 the process of b0 b90 pairing and b180 b270 pairing in the downstream region is delayed on the pressure side of the leeward side the upward displacement of the tip vortex becomes smaller than under the heavy loading condition this displacement is very gentle on the suction side indicated by the blue dashed line in fig 13 a on the windward side however the displacement of the tip vortex is very gentle on both the pressure and suction sides during the tip vortex evolution process no ω shaped vortical structures form on the leeward side the ω shaped vortical structures form much later on the windward side than under the heavy loading condition on the suction side of the leeward side a significant buckling occurs after the tip vortex interacts with the boundary layer of the rudder after detaching from the trailing edge of the rudder the tip vortex continues to evolve along the downstream direction with the buckling feature the pairing of buckled vortices is now composed of two parts as shown in region v1 in fig 13 a the main body of the vortices starts pairing before the buckled parts start to pair with further merging of the main bodies of the tip vortices the buckled parts of the vortices start to wind together as shown in region v2 finally both the main bodies and the buckled parts of the tip vortices merge completely as shown in region v3 on the windward side the presence of the rudder angle induces the small vortical structures to detach from the surface of the rudder as shown in regions b and b in fig 13 b these detached vortical structures interact and merge with local vortices v b0 v b90 v b180 and v b270 which are formed by the interaction between the tip vortex and the boundary layer of the rudder thereby affecting the further evolution of the tip vortex in addition the evolution of the wake vortical structure of the propeller becomes more complex in the presence of the increased rudder angle an example is the entanglement of the secondary vortices shown in fig 13 b 5 power spectrum density analysis the evolution of the propeller wake can also be explored by analyzing the energy transfer process felli et al 2011 di mascio et al 2014 specifically this involves the psd analysis of the ke where ke 0 5 u 2 v 2 w 2 additionally the complexity of the propeller wake evolution is also reflected in the unsteady load on the rudder because this load is directly related to the structural vibrations and radiated noise therefore the pressure on the rudder surface is also explored by psd analysis 5 1 kinetic energy spectra the change in ke at different locations is determined by setting up a series of probe points in the wake field a sketch of the arrangement of the probes in the wake is shown in fig 14 to ensure that the probe points are positioned on the trajectory of the tip vortex the radial locations of the probe points are set as y r 0 9 whereas the axial locations of these points with non uniform spacing downstream of the propeller are set as x r 0 5 1 0 1 5 2 5 3 5 4 5 6 0 and 8 0 note that the z coordinates of the probe points will be adjusted to approach the trajectory of the tip vortex core in the presence of the ω shaped vortical structures after the flow field becomes stable the ke values are recorded over 10 revolutions of the propeller as it is difficult to capture the position of the tip vortex core in the far field under nonzero rudder angles the psd analysis only considers the case in which the rudder angle is zero for convenience of description the aforementioned probe points are divided into three groups namely the near field p 1 p 2 p 3 middle field p 4 p 5 p 6 and far field p 7 p 8 here the near field includes both the approaching phase and collision phase of the tip vortex while the middle field and far field only contain the convection phase of the tip vortex the wavenumber k is standardized based on the blade passing frequency bpf it corresponds to the value of f bpf where f is frequency in other words if k 1 corresponds to the bpf then the shaft frequency will yield k 0 25 fig 15 shows box charts of the ke fluctuations in the time domain with two different advance coefficients j 0 45 and j 0 71 this chart demonstrates the fluctuation and average value of ke at different probe points in the time domain as shown in the figure the trend in the average ke is similar with both advance coefficients in the near field the fluctuation in ke is more intense and the average ke first decreases and then increases this process corresponds to the approaching phase p 1 and p 2 and collision phase p 3 of the tip vortex respectively the reduction in ke from p 1 to p 2 is caused by the increasing distance between the tip vortex and the propeller the increase in ke when approaching p 3 is related to the interaction between the tip vortex and the rudder in the middle and far fields the fluctuation of ke and the average ke value both become smaller because of energy dissipation comparing the heavy and light loading conditions it is clear that the energy dissipation under the light loading condition is relatively slower at probe points far away from the propeller in addition special attention should be paid to the difference in the ke fluctuations at p 3 under the heavy loading condition the ke fluctuations at p 3 are greater than under the light loading condition this indicates that under the light loading condition the interaction between the tip vortex and the rudder is weaker fig 16 shows the spectrum analysis of ke with two different advance coefficients by comparing these results several common features can be observed in the spectrum characteristics under the two different conditions 1 rapid attenuation is observed in the low frequency range however the rate of attenuation decreases in the high frequency range 2 the rate of attenuation in the low frequency range is fastest in the far field followed by the middle field and finally the near field 3 the leading frequency gradually shifts towards the shaft frequency k 0 25 when changing from the near field to the far field 4 the main peak is an integer multiple of the bpf in the near field in the near field the trend in the change from the middle to high frequency range differs under each loading condition when j 0 71 the average value in the spectrum gradually reduces from p 1 to p 3 because of viscous dissipation this phenomenon is related to the interaction between the tip vortex and the rudder however when j 0 45 the reduction in the vortex pitch results in a strong interaction between the neighboring tip vortices therefore the decreasing trend is less significant in addition the spectrum peak at k 0 5 is particularly apparent when j 0 45 this point marks the initial pairing process of the neighboring tip vortices in the middle field the tip vortex detaches from the rudder structure and moves into the convection phase in the low frequency range faster attenuation occurs under the light loading condition in the middle and high frequency ranges a significant peak occurs at p 4 under the heavy loading condition in the far field the vortex system becomes unstable at j 0 45 such behavior changes the spectrum completely where the maximum peak coincides with the shaft frequency the region with the highest rate of attenuation is reduced to k 3 furthermore no peak is observed in the middle and high frequency ranges when j 0 71 two peaks appear at k 0 5 and k 1 5 in the spectrum these peaks indicate the initiation of vortex pairing the corresponding peaks associated with the blade frequencies disappear when k 3 fig 17 shows the spectra at p 1 in the near field under the two loading conditions and two rudder angles i e β 0 and β 20 to clarify the overlapping parts in the spectra the peaks for β 20 are connected by dashed lines as shown in the figure the spectrum obtained with β 20 is very similar to that for β 0 a similar slope of energy attenuation is obtained in the low frequency range over the entire wavenumber range the average value of the spectrum for β 20 is greater than that for β 0 this indicates that increasing the rudder angle reduces the viscous dissipation in addition the difference between the average values of the spectra obtained with two different rudder angles is quite large under the light loading condition this suggests that the viscous dissipation in the near field is more severe under the light loading condition compared with the heavy loading condition the peaks corresponding to non integer values of k are not so significant to further explore the relationship between the characteristics of the ke spectrum and the morphological evolution of the local wake vortex the wake vortex morphology and the associated psd spectra obtained with j 0 45 and j 0 71 at β 0 at probe points p 3 p 5 and p 7 located in the near medium and far fields respectively are plotted in figs 18 and 19 under the heavy loading condition fig 18 the peaks associated with the shaft frequency blade frequency and their harmonics k 0 5 0 75 and k 1 2 are very clear at p 3 p 5 and p 7 in the low frequency range according to the reports of muscari et al 2013 and di mascio et al 2014 the occurrence of peaks associated with non integer values of k represents the pairing process between neighboring tip vortices or the growth of a secondary vortex and its interaction with the main vortical structure at probe point p 3 the pairing and grouping of tip vortices such as the b0 b90 pairing shown in fig 9 a has already occurred at an earlier time this vortex pairing results in the peak at k 0 5 in the leading frequency in addition probe point p 5 corresponds to the location where self induction and mutual induction occurs therefore the original morphology of the tip vortex is severely deformed at this location and the overall tip vortical structure transforms into an ω shape this change results in a gradual shift of the leading frequency to the shaft frequency associated with k 0 25 furthermore probe point p 7 corresponds to the location of re grouping during this process the tip vortex becomes more unstable resulting in the breakdown of the tip vortex and higher energy dissipation therefore the peaks associated with k 0 25 k 0 5 and k 0 75 become smaller when moving towards the far field the maximum peak at a probe point in the far field is obtained at k 0 25 as shown in fig 19 some similar characteristics of the tip vortex region are observed under the light loading condition the bpf and its harmonics k 1 2 in the low frequency range as well as the peaks associated with non integer k k 0 5 0 75 are present in the spectrum at probe point p 3 the peak associated with k 0 5 is smaller than under the heavy loading condition this suggests that the pairing process is delayed at this location which further reflects the interaction effect between the rudder structure and the tip vortex in the near field probe point p 5 is the first to experience the vortex pairing process therefore the peak associated with k 0 5 is intensified here in addition the initial tip vortex starts to weaken at probe point p 7 which is experiencing a strong interaction effect from the secondary vortex therefore the peak associated with k 0 75 is maintained at p 7 in the spectrum 5 2 pressure on the rudder the pressure on the rudder is measured by setting up different probe points these probe points are distributed on the surface of the rudder y 0 and in the region passed by the tip vortex four rows of probe points are arranged on both the pressure side z 0 and the suction side z 0 fig 20 shows the layout of the probes under three different operating conditions after the flow becomes stable the pressures are recorded over 10 revolutions of the propeller subsequently pressure spectrum analysis is performed at probe points in certain important regions figs 21 and 22 show the pressure spectra at probe points in key regions obtained with j 0 45 and j 0 71 respectively with β 0 the probe points along the span direction of the rudder e g p a p b and p c are selected because they are closest to the trajectory of the tip vortex distributed along the span direction of the rudder the probe points along the chord direction e g p a and p d are selected because they are closest to the trajectory of the tip vortex core as shown in fig 21 the harmonic amplitudes associated with the blade frequencies measured at p a p b and p c on the pressure side gradually decrease along the positive z axis this suggests that the strength of the tip vortex gradually decreases as the z coordinate increases this is because as the vortex evolves along the downstream direction it will further interact with the rudder along the span direction in the form of an attached vortex however such interaction becomes weaker as the tip vortex evolves along the downstream direction furthermore these attached vortices distributed along the span direction of the rudder interact differently with the rudder on the pressure and suction sides as shown in fig 21 a and c the average value in the spectrum decreases rapidly at probe point p c located at the far end along the rudder span direction on the pressure side however the decrease is less severe at probe point p g on the suction side this is because the interaction between the tip vortex and the rudder is stronger on the pressure side these results are confirmed by the pressure spectrum recorded at probe points along the chord direction as shown in fig 21 b and d the strong interaction between the tip vortex and the rudder causes the average harmonic and pressure spectrum amplitudes to decrease gradually from one probe to another along the chord direction however this decrease is not significant on the suction side increasing the advance coefficient makes the harmonic amplitudes and average values of the pressure spectra more similar on the pressure and suction sides this is because an increase in the convection velocity weakens the interaction between the tip vortex and the rudder this finding is consistent with the phenomena in fig 11 however as shown in fig 22 a and c the amplitude of the pressure spectra associated with the blade frequency drops rapidly from one probe to another along the rudder span direction the amplitude associated with the blade frequency measured at probe points p j p k and p n p o are much smaller than those measured at p i and p m this shows that the impact of the attached vortex on the rudder becomes weaker as the tip vortex evolves along the downstream direction in addition the harmonic amplitudes and average values of the pressure spectra measured on the pressure and suction sides do not differ significantly along the chord direction as shown in fig 22 b and d this indicates that the viscous interaction between the tip vortex and the rudder is weaker under the light loading condition than under the heavy loading condition the pressure spectra of the typical probe points obtained at j 0 45 β 20 are shown in fig 23 compared with the zero rudder angle case the pressure spectra now exhibit different characteristics in particular the amplitudes and average values of the harmonics measured on the suction side increase rather than decrease along the probe points in the downstream section this is possibly because the presence of a nonzero rudder angle changes the evolution of the topological structure of the tip vortex which induces the spiral vortical structure on the suction side described in fig 12 a 6 conclusion the propeller rudder system is a key component in the successful design of marine ships it plays a crucial role in managing the propulsion efficiency vibration noise radiation and control of the vessel because both the propeller and rudder are placed towards the rear of the ship they can interfere with each other during operation this interference means that the hydrodynamic force acting on the propeller is not only determined by the propeller itself but is also closely related to the rudder behind the propeller therefore analyzing the wake flow field of a propeller rudder system is far more complex than the analysis of an isolated propeller in this paper the wake dynamics of a propeller before a rudder under open water conditions have been analyzed by numerical methods based on des in particular the evolution mechanism of the propeller wake under different advance coefficients and different rudder angles has been explored a detailed analysis of the flow field was performed based on the mean flow field instantaneous flow field ke spectra and characteristics of the pressure spectrum on the rudder surface the results presented in this study lead to the following conclusions 1 the wake behavior of a propeller operating before a rudder can differ significantly under different conditions the instantaneous vortical structures and psd analysis of the ke demonstrate that the vortex system exhibits a simpler topological structure under light loading conditions with heavy loading conditions and a finite rudder angle the topological structure of the vortex system becomes very complex 2 both the instantaneous vortical structures and the psd analysis of the pressure spectrum have shown that the viscous interaction between the tip vortex and the boundary layer of the rudder is weaker under light loading conditions than under heavy loading and finite rudder angle conditions at the same time the amplitudes and average values of the pressure spectra measured on the pressure side are less different than those measured on the suction side 3 under heavy loading conditions the tip vortex and the boundary layer of the rudder exchange vorticity accompanied by the formation of vortical structures attached to the rudder surface these vortical structures exhibit different morphologies on the pressure and suction sides as the tip vortex evolves along the downstream direction these attached vortices continue to interact and collide with the rudder along the rudder span direction accompanied by the pairing of tip vortices once the tip vortices detach from the rudder secondary vortical structures evolve from the tip vortices and act as bridges connecting neighboring tip vortices as the tip vortices start to merge these secondary vortical structures start to interact with the rudder and grow 4 under heavy loading and finite rudder angle conditions the evolution of the tip vortex and the topological structure of the vortex system become much more complex intertwined spiral vortical structures form on the suction side the ω shaped vortical structures also form at a much earlier time finally the secondary vortices connecting the neighboring tip vortices become intertwined with each other the results reported in the present study are limited to the case of a specific propeller and a non lifting rudder surface although further cases should be considered to investigate how vortical structures evolve in practical configurations represented by other propellers rudders and parameters such as the distance between the propeller and rudder this study provides new insight on the phenomenology with respect to the current literature which can support the explanation and analysis of complex propeller rudder configurations acknowledgments this work is supported by china scholarship council the national natural science foundation of china grant no

22541,this paper analyzes the characteristics of the wake dynamics of a propeller operating before a rudder under open water conditions the analysis is conducted using a numerical method based on the detached eddy simulation des in particular the evolution mechanism of the propeller wake is explored under different advance coefficient and rudder angle conditions under heavy load conditions the topology of the vortex system becomes more complex and is accompanied by a stronger interaction between the wake and the rudder in addition a secondary vortical structure bridging the tip vortices is formed in the vicinity of the tip vortex followed by the growth of a secondary vortex and the formation of a secondary vortex pair at nonzero rudder angles the interaction between the tip vortex and the rudder becomes stronger yielding a more complex vortex topology furthermore an intertwined vortical structure is formed on the suction side and the ω shaped vortical structures form much earlier analysis of the kinetic energy ke and pressure spectra on the rudder surface provides additional insights into the evolution pattern of the vortical structures the objective of this study is to further identify the dynamic characteristics of the propeller vortices before the rudder under multiple operating conditions keywords propeller des wake dynamics interaction effect 1 introduction propellers are used as the major propulsion method in modern ships analysis of the performance and viscous flow field associated with propellers has attracted considerable attention in research into ship dynamics and propulsion felli et al 2011 chase and carrica 2013 muscari et al 2017 wang et al 2018a b the wake generated by the propeller evolves from the near to far field regions in a complex physical fashion accompanied by the formation of very complex vortical structures thus understanding the physical nature and evolution mechanism of the propeller wake has significant implications zhu 2015 zhu et al 2017 wang et al 2018a b magionesi et al 2018 this knowledge is directly related to the hydrodynamic performance vibration noise and structural issues of modern ships and helps to provide a more accurate prediction of the propeller performance which enhances the design and optimization of propellers for various requirements many experimental and numerical studies have explored the viscous flow field associated with an isolated propeller under various operating conditions experimental studies of the propeller wake include that of felli et al 2006 who experimentally analyzed the wake evolution of a propeller from pressure and velocity phase measurements their study showed that the tip vortex passage is an important factor in the generation of the pressure field in the near wake zone furthermore the breakdown of the vortex can result in a strong deformation of the hub vortex paik et al 2007 employed a double frame particle image velocimetry piv technique to measure the wake field of a four bladed propeller under a high reynolds number condition they analyzed the spatial evolution of the vortex from near the propeller to a distance of one propeller diameter away the results demonstrated that piv can capture details of the wake field of the propeller which are very useful in propeller optimization and design felli et al 2011 measured the wake field of propellers with different numbers of blades using a time resolved visualization device and a velocity measurement device their study focused on exploring the effect of the spiral to spiral distance and blade number on the evolution and instability of the hub vortex and tip vortex test results showed that the vortex breakdown is induced by the mutual inductance of adjacent spirals felli and falchi 2018 performed an experimental piv analysis of the propeller wake field under oblique inflow conditions using a multi camera configuration their study compared the systematic topology of the wake behavior in axisymmetric and oblique inflow conditions this work extended the knowledge of propeller wake dynamics and revealed the evolution instability and breakdown mechanisms of propeller wake vortices under non axisymmetric inflow conditions the propeller wake field has also been numerically studied such as when muscari et al 2013 investigated the capabilities and limitations of detached eddy simulation des and reynolds averaged navier stokes rans methods for simulating the wake of a marine propeller their results demonstrated that rans provides better predictions of macroscale quantities such as thrust and torque but is too dissipative when unsteady flow fluctuations or unstable wake processes are of interest in contrast des can successfully predict the onset of instabilities in the wake jang and mahesh 2013 analyzed the flow around a reverse rotating propeller in a uniform free stream using the large eddy simulation les method rotation of the propeller in the reverse direction causes the interaction between the free stream and the reverse flow to yield a vortex ring in the vicinity of the propeller disk flow separation occurred along the sharp edge of the blade resulting in high amplitude transient propeller loads dubbioso et al 2013 2014 evaluated the performances of a marine propeller in oblique flow conditions under a wide range of incidence angles they mainly focused on the behavior of the propeller with respect to global loads although the blade pressure distribution and downstream wake also supported the force generation in terms of velocity and vorticity fields di mascio et al 2014 investigated the onset and nature of dynamic instabilities experienced by the wake of a propeller set in oblique flow by means of des their results showed that the destabilization of the wake in oblique inflow is mainly triggered by the secondary vorticity and hub vortex kumar and mahesh 2017 studied the wake of a five bladed marine propeller under the designed operating conditions they examined the mechanisms of wake instability by analyzing the phase averaged and azimuthal averaged flow fields and identified a mutual induction mechanism of instability wang et al 2018b examined the relationship between the characteristics of a trailing vortex wake from the propeller and its skew angle the results showed that increasing the skew angle can alleviate the blade to blade interaction thereby delaying the deformation of the hub vortex and destabilization of the tip vortices compared with the wake of an isolated propeller the wake flow field of a propeller in a propeller rudder configuration is much more complex because of the interaction between the vortical structure and the solid boundary rockwell 1998 this interaction is closely related to the unsteady load on the solid surface which induces structural vibrations radiated noise and energy loss therefore the interaction between vortical structures and the solid boundary is an important topic in ship hydrodynamics muscari et al 2017 analyzed the wake flow of a single blade propeller operating before the rudder using des their study showed that the tip vortex and hub vortex evolve independently during the approaching and interaction phases and eventually reconnect and merge in the middle and far wake under the strong interaction with the boundary layer on the rudder badoe et al 2015 computed the time resolved flow around the hull propeller rudder system based on rans equations and an arbitrary mesh interface ami model the results were in good agreement with wind tunnel investigations and the variation of the upstream body length and drift angle were found to effectively vary the magnitude of the crossflow and wake at the propeller plane felli et al 2009 studied the flow field in a propeller rudder system using laser doppler velocimetry and time resolved camera instruments the effects of the potential collision at the rudder leading edge the double helix breakdown of the vortex filaments while moving chordwise and the chordwise and spanwise misalignments between the vertical filaments were all characterized in detail di mascio et al 2015 studied the flow field in a propeller rudder system using an unsteady rans method their simulation accurately predicted the distortion of the tip vortex and the strong deformation of the tip vortex while passing the leading edge of the rudder as observed in experimental tests based on the above literature review determining the wake flow of a propeller operating before the rudder is a challenging task further research is also needed to assess the characteristics of the wake flow in this study the flow field of a marine propeller insean e779a operating before a rudder with a symmetrical cross sectional shape naca0020 profile is analyzed using the des method the objectives of this study are as follows i reveal the mechanism of wake evolution under different loading and rudder angle conditions ii analyze the wake evolution quantitatively based on the power spectrum density psd of the kinetic energy ke of the wake flow field and iii discuss the unsteady load on the rudder surface under different conditions the remainder of this paper is structured as follows section 2 presents details of the numerical simulations section 3 discusses the level of uncertainty associated with the mesh used in the numerical simulation and section 4 analyzes the average flow field and instantaneous flow details section 5 then discusses the results of the psd analysis of the ke and unsteady load on the rudder surface finally concluding remarks are presented in section 6 2 simulation details the three dimensional viscous flow field is solved using the finite volume method based on the segregated flow solver in the star ccm computational fluid dynamics code the des version of the spalart allmaras turbulence model spalart and allmaras 1994 is employed to resolve the turbulent wake structures for more details and a complete description of the des approach readers are referred to muscari et al 2017 di mascio et al 2014 and gong et al 2018 2 1 test case the simple propeller rudder system used by felli et al 2009 is employed in this numerical simulation this system has been used by cnr insean for many experiments in a cavitation tunnel the geometric model and reference coordinate system are shown in fig 1 the geometric characteristics are summarized in table 1 the distance between the propeller and rudder is equal to the distance from the rotation center of the propeller to the leading edge of the rudder i e d 2 note that the rudder modeled in this study is sufficiently long to mitigate the effect induced by the rudder tip rudder angles of β 0 and β 20 trailing edge of the rudder towards the side with y 0 are used in the numerical simulation together with advance coefficients of j 0 71 and j 0 45 where the advance coefficient is defined by j u n d these two coefficients correspond to light and heavy loading conditions respectively the different advance coefficients are obtained by changing the freestream velocity u with a fixed rotation speed n n 25 rps unless stated otherwise all physical quantities are nondimensionalized using the characteristic parameters specifically the characteristic length is the radius of the propeller l ref 0 1135 m the characteristic velocity is the velocity at the tip of the propeller blade u ref n π d 17 83 m s and the characteristic density is the density of the fluid ρ 1000 kg m3 under such conditions the reynolds number is given by re u r e f l r e f ν 1 78 10 6 based on the discretization of the final mesh the dimensionless period of revolution and time step are set as t 2 π and δ t 0 01745 which corresponds to the time taken for the propeller to rotate by 1 respectively 2 2 mesh details when simulating the wake flow field of a propeller operating before a rudder the numerical transmission of the unsteady flow field during the rotation of the propeller is realized by the overset grid technique carrica et al 2007 tang et al 2014 wang et al 2017 the computational domain is a cylinder with a diameter of 16d that extends 2d and 8d upstream and downstream from the propeller respectively according to kumar and mahesh 2017 the size effect of the computational domain on the evolution of the propeller wake is negligible in this study an unstructured mesh is used in the simulations multiple control volumes are employed to increase the mesh density in the tip vortex and hub vortex regions in addition the rotation region containing the propeller is discretized using a polyhedral mesh the static region including the rudder is discretized using the trimmed mesh to satisfy the requirements of the des algorithm the dimensionless distance between the first grid node and the wall y is always less than 1 i e y 1 the number of prism boundary layers is set to 20 the distribution of the control volume and the details of the local mesh are shown in fig 2 for the mesh convergence analysis two sets of meshes are considered the medium mesh has 14 81 million cells in total with the rotation region and static region containing 5 52 million and 9 29 million cells respectively the fine mesh has 25 89 million cells in total with the rotation region and static region containing 9 65 million and 16 24 million cells respectively 3 mesh verification to assess the numerical uncertainty in this study two sets of meshes are developed a constant value of δ t δ min is used to ensure that the cfl number remains constant note that it is not possible to evaluate the numerical uncertainty based on three sets of meshes because any further reduction in the number of cells will yield a coarse mesh that cannot resolve many important flow characteristics whereas any further increase in the number of cells will require too much computational power based on the work of muscari et al 2013 the two grid assessment procedure proposed by roache 1997 is used to perform the uncertainty analysis the refinement ratio of the mesh must be determined before the mesh convergence study according to baek et al 2015 and gong et al 2018 the refinement ratio of the mesh is defined by 1 r n f i n e n c o a r s e 1 d where n is the total number of cells and d is the dimension of the problem explored in the simulation as this study considers a three dimensional problem d 3 the refinement ratio of both meshes used in this study is approximately 1 2 the error of the fine mesh is defined by 2 e f 2 f 1 1 r p where f 1 and f 2 correspond to the calculation results of the fine mesh and the medium mesh and p is the formal order of accuracy p 2 the uncertainty is estimated by 3 u n f s e where f s is a safety factor assumed to be 3 the mesh convergence analysis in the present numerical simulation is based on the thrust and torque of the propeller the results are summarized in table 2 note that the results obtained using the medium mesh are very close to those obtained using the fine mesh this suggests that the simulation results are reliable muscari et al 2017 in addition the uncertainty in the propeller load is less than 2 in all cases fig 3 shows the computation results of the open water characteristics in the single propeller and propeller rudder configurations as shown in the figure the open water characteristics calculated for the single propeller match the experimental results closely however the presence of the rudder results in a slight increase in both the thrust coefficient and torque coefficient furthermore this increase can be reduced by applying a greater loading coefficient on the propeller this trend agrees with the results reported by wang et al 2011 based on the current number of cells and computational resources the medium mesh is fully capable of performing the simulation task considered in this study therefore all computational results are obtained using the medium mesh 4 wake dynamics to better understand the evolution mechanism of the wake vortex of a propeller operating before a rudder the wake dynamics of the propeller are analyzed from two different perspectives i e the mean flow field and the instantaneous flow field note that the vortical structures explored in this paper are all displayed using the q criterion iso surface hunt et al 1988 the q is defined as follow 4 q 1 2 u x 2 v y 2 w z 2 u y v x u z w x v z w y for all the visualizations of spatial structures of this paper the values of iso surfaces are set to q 3000 s 2 4 1 mean wake field characteristics the average physical quantities associated with the wake are analyzed to verify whether the shape of the transient wake represents a statistically stable interval muscari et al 2013 for a common variable ξ x t its time averaged value is given by 5 ξ x t 1 t t 0 t 0 t ξ x τ d τ where t 0 is the time at which the sampling starts t 0 40 in this study figs 4 and 5 show the change in the mean velocity along directions u v and w as well as the reynolds stress u i u j u i u j u i u j at downstream probe p6 see fig 14 under the two different loading conditions probe p6 is selected because the convergence rate is minimized at this location as shown in the figure the flow field reaches a statistically stable condition after 80 dimensionless time steps the rate of stabilization increases with the advance coefficient fig 6 shows the contour of the mean axial velocity on the downstream cross section at a distance of x r 0 75 from the propeller under different operating conditions as shown in the figure the high velocity region is concentrated in the outer portion of the propeller disc however the presence of the rudder results in a non uniform distribution of the average axial velocity in the near field of the propeller when β 0 the rudder blockage results in the low velocity zone being distributed along the span direction of the rudder under the heavy loading condition the high velocity zone tends to be distributed in the second and fourth quadrants of the propeller disc under the light loading condition the drop in axial velocity is more significant this is also associated with the rudder blockage effect and the resulting perturbations at the propeller depend on the loading conditions the lower the propeller load the more sensitive it is to perturbations when β 20 the inclination of the rudder causes the low velocity zone to be mainly focused in the first and fourth quadrants this leads to a change in the flow distribution on the propeller disc with the mean velocity in the first and fourth quadrants becoming smaller while the high velocity zone becomes more concentrated in the second and third quadrants this distribution pattern is especially evident under the light loading condition in which case the propeller wake is more sensitive to perturbations figs 7 and 8 show the characteristics of the vortical structure based on the average flow at j 0 45 as shown in fig 7 the vortical structure exhibits a tube like profile in the approaching phase in the collision phase the tip vortex and hub vortex are divided into a left part y 0 and a right part y 0 by the pressure and suction sides of the rudder during the convection phase the left tip vortex l tv right tip vortex r tv left hub vortex l hv and right hub vortex r hv can all be clearly identified the tip vortex merges in the far field of the wake for convenience of analysis the pressure side is defined as the regions with y 0 z 0 or y 0 z 0 whereas the suction side is defined as the regions with y 0 z 0 or y 0 z 0 details of the average vortical structure in the near field of the wake are shown in fig 8 the profile of the vortex in the near field of the wake experiences a downward and upward displacement indicated by the red dashed line in the figure when y 0 and y 0 respectively on the pressure side the upward and downward displacements are monotonic along the chord however on the suction side these displacements are not monotonic which is in accordance with the observations reported by muscari et al 2017 when β 0 the profile of the vortex exhibits a similar range for y 0 and y 0 when β 20 however the range of the vortex profile is smaller in the y 0 region than in the y 0 region this suggests that the vortical structure is affected by a stronger interaction in the y 0 region furthermore attached vortical structures are also found on the surface of the rudder namely the upper collision vortex u cv and lower collision vortex l cv these vortices are formed by the interaction and collision between the propeller tip vortex and the leading edge of the rudder in both the y 0 and y 0 regions u cv keeps growing along the positive z axis while l cv keeps growing along the negative z axis when β 20 a large number of small vortical structures become detached from the surface of the rudder in the y 0 region these vortical structures will eventually interact and merge with the u cv and l cv 4 2 instantaneous wake field characteristics all the comparisons of instantaneous wake vortex in this section represent the same instant in the time domain for consistency and the related dimensionless time and rotation period are stated in each figure the characteristics of the wake vortex dynamics of a propeller operating before a rudder are now analyzed based on the instantaneous flow field under different operating conditions to better describe the characteristics of the instantaneous wake vortex the tip vortex generated by different propeller blades is marked accordingly for example the tip vortex generated by the propeller blade at θ 90 is labelled as b90 figs 9 and 10 show the evolution characteristics of the instantaneous vortical structure at j 0 45 and β 0 as shown in fig 9 the vortex evolution exhibits a regular spiral shape in the approaching phase this feature is consistent with the average vortex morphology shown in fig 8 in the collision phase however the vortex and the rudder start to interact with each other and the tip vortex splits into two branches on the pressure and suction sides of the rudder on the pressure side the tip vortex experiences an upward fig 9 a or downward fig 9 b displacement indicated by the blue dashed line in the figure such displacement is monotonic along the chord on the suction side these upward and downward displacements are not monotonic which is in agreement with the situation shown in fig 8 in addition in the collision phase a viscous interaction occurs between the tip vortex and the boundary layer of the rudder accompanied by an exchange of vorticity such behavior induces the formation of vortical structures attached to the rudder surface as the tip vortex evolves along the downstream direction these attached vortices continue to be distributed along the span direction of the rudder and interact with the rudder furthermore these attached vortical structures exhibit different morphologies on the pressure and suction sides specifically the attached vortical structures become thicker on the pressure side but thinner and longer on the suction side this is because the interaction between the tip vortex and the boundary layer of the rudder is stronger on the pressure side than on the suction side of the rudder in the convection phase a pairing phenomenon starts to emerge among the tip vortices the early vortex pairings formed in the flow are the b0 b90 and b180 b270 pairings as the vortical structures continue to evolve towards the far field a second round of vortex pairings is observed i e the b0b90 b180b270 pairing labelled in the figure while the merged tip vortices continue to evolve along the downstream direction they start to form ω shapes on the leeward side and windward side when the tip vortices detach from the rudder they start to spawn secondary vortical structures these secondary structures wrap around the tip vortices and function as bridges connecting adjacent tip vortices fig 10 reveals further details of the instantaneous vortical structures at j 0 45 and β 0 as shown in the figure the tip vortices buckle during the initial collision phase as reflected by the local vortex v b0 of the tip vortex b0 as the tip vortex continues to evolve the collision between the vortical structure and the rudder results in a viscous interaction between the tip vortex and the boundary layer of the rudder accompanied by an exchange of vorticity subsequently local vortices v b90 v b180 and v b270 evolve from tip vortices b90 b180 and b270 respectively these local vortices are not shown in the instantaneous vortical structure in fig 10 with further evolution new pairings of vortices occur in the system including the formation of the b180 b270 pairing these new vortex pairings induce the subsequent formation of the v b180 v b270 pairing v b0 v b90 pairing and ultimately the formation of v b0b90 and v b180b270 after the tip vortices detach from the trailing edge of the rudder the secondary vortices bridging the adjacent tip vortices start to evolve with a certain pattern when the tip vortices have just detached from the rudder i e within a short distance from the surface of the rudder the neighboring tip vortices are connected by a single secondary vortex such as s1 and s2 in the figure as these secondary vortices continue to evolve the neighboring tip vortices are no longer connected by a single secondary vortex but by a secondary vortex pairing such as the s3 s6 region shown in the figure these secondary vortex pairings start to interact with each other within the red dashed rectangle shown in the figure as the vortex pitch increases after the tip vortices merge the secondary vortex pairing becomes longer and thicker fig 11 shows the instantaneous vortical structures at j 0 71 and β 0 compared with the small advance coefficient case the vortex system exhibits a simpler topological structure and different evolution pattern with increasing convection velocity the displacement of the tip vortices becomes smaller and the viscous interaction between the tip vortex and the boundary layer of the rudder weakens in the collision phase at the same time the attached vortical structure becomes less obvious in addition the increase in the advance coefficient results in a delay to the pairing process of tip vortices and a significant backward shift in the location where the ω shaped vortical structures are formed nevertheless the bridging vortical structures between neighboring tip vortices are still clear and evident fig 12 shows the evolution of the instantaneous vortical structures at j 0 45 and β 20 as shown in the figure the evolution of the vortices in the approaching phase follows a similar pattern as for the case where the rudder angle is zero when β 20 a large deviation can be observed in the collision phase unlike the case β 0 specifically increasing the rudder angle results in a more intense collision between the vortex and the rudder a more complex evolution pattern of the tip vortex and a more complex topological structure of the vortex system on the leeward side the upward displacement of the tip vortex is very strong on the pressure side but relatively gentle on the suction side indicated by the blue dashed line in fig 12 a however on the windward side the displacement of the tip vortices is very gentle on both the pressure and suction sides the increase in rudder angle means that no ω shaped vortical structures form on the leeward side during the evolution of the tip vortex on the windward side the ω shaped vortical structures now form much earlier on the suction side the stronger interaction between the tip vortex and boundary layer of the rudder on the leeward side induces local vortical structures that evolve from regions v1 to v5 the b0 b90 pairing indicates that vortices v b0 and v b90 are not paired simply as shown in fig 10 instead v b0 winds around v b90 in region v1 and both vortices gradually split into multiple smaller branches after the tip vortices detach from the trailing edge of the rudder these smaller branches of vortices become entangled in a spiral shape this process is clearly captured in regions v2 v3 as the vortices continue to evolve the smaller branches generated from the splitting appear to merge again and form the specific vortical structure shown in region v5 on the windward side a large number of small vortical structures detach from the surface of the rudder because of the increased rudder angle as shown in regions a and a in fig 12 b these small vortical structures interact and merge with local vortices v b0 v b90 v b180 and v b270 which are formed by the interaction between the tip vortex and the boundary layer of the rudder such behavior induces a certain impact on the further evolution of the tip vortex in addition the evolution of the wake vortical structure of the propeller becomes more complex in the presence of the increased rudder angle an example is the entanglement of the secondary vortices connecting the neighboring tip vortices as shown in fig 12 b fig 13 shows the evolution of the instantaneous vortical structures at j 0 71 and β 20 compared with the heavy loading condition j 0 45 the process of b0 b90 pairing and b180 b270 pairing in the downstream region is delayed on the pressure side of the leeward side the upward displacement of the tip vortex becomes smaller than under the heavy loading condition this displacement is very gentle on the suction side indicated by the blue dashed line in fig 13 a on the windward side however the displacement of the tip vortex is very gentle on both the pressure and suction sides during the tip vortex evolution process no ω shaped vortical structures form on the leeward side the ω shaped vortical structures form much later on the windward side than under the heavy loading condition on the suction side of the leeward side a significant buckling occurs after the tip vortex interacts with the boundary layer of the rudder after detaching from the trailing edge of the rudder the tip vortex continues to evolve along the downstream direction with the buckling feature the pairing of buckled vortices is now composed of two parts as shown in region v1 in fig 13 a the main body of the vortices starts pairing before the buckled parts start to pair with further merging of the main bodies of the tip vortices the buckled parts of the vortices start to wind together as shown in region v2 finally both the main bodies and the buckled parts of the tip vortices merge completely as shown in region v3 on the windward side the presence of the rudder angle induces the small vortical structures to detach from the surface of the rudder as shown in regions b and b in fig 13 b these detached vortical structures interact and merge with local vortices v b0 v b90 v b180 and v b270 which are formed by the interaction between the tip vortex and the boundary layer of the rudder thereby affecting the further evolution of the tip vortex in addition the evolution of the wake vortical structure of the propeller becomes more complex in the presence of the increased rudder angle an example is the entanglement of the secondary vortices shown in fig 13 b 5 power spectrum density analysis the evolution of the propeller wake can also be explored by analyzing the energy transfer process felli et al 2011 di mascio et al 2014 specifically this involves the psd analysis of the ke where ke 0 5 u 2 v 2 w 2 additionally the complexity of the propeller wake evolution is also reflected in the unsteady load on the rudder because this load is directly related to the structural vibrations and radiated noise therefore the pressure on the rudder surface is also explored by psd analysis 5 1 kinetic energy spectra the change in ke at different locations is determined by setting up a series of probe points in the wake field a sketch of the arrangement of the probes in the wake is shown in fig 14 to ensure that the probe points are positioned on the trajectory of the tip vortex the radial locations of the probe points are set as y r 0 9 whereas the axial locations of these points with non uniform spacing downstream of the propeller are set as x r 0 5 1 0 1 5 2 5 3 5 4 5 6 0 and 8 0 note that the z coordinates of the probe points will be adjusted to approach the trajectory of the tip vortex core in the presence of the ω shaped vortical structures after the flow field becomes stable the ke values are recorded over 10 revolutions of the propeller as it is difficult to capture the position of the tip vortex core in the far field under nonzero rudder angles the psd analysis only considers the case in which the rudder angle is zero for convenience of description the aforementioned probe points are divided into three groups namely the near field p 1 p 2 p 3 middle field p 4 p 5 p 6 and far field p 7 p 8 here the near field includes both the approaching phase and collision phase of the tip vortex while the middle field and far field only contain the convection phase of the tip vortex the wavenumber k is standardized based on the blade passing frequency bpf it corresponds to the value of f bpf where f is frequency in other words if k 1 corresponds to the bpf then the shaft frequency will yield k 0 25 fig 15 shows box charts of the ke fluctuations in the time domain with two different advance coefficients j 0 45 and j 0 71 this chart demonstrates the fluctuation and average value of ke at different probe points in the time domain as shown in the figure the trend in the average ke is similar with both advance coefficients in the near field the fluctuation in ke is more intense and the average ke first decreases and then increases this process corresponds to the approaching phase p 1 and p 2 and collision phase p 3 of the tip vortex respectively the reduction in ke from p 1 to p 2 is caused by the increasing distance between the tip vortex and the propeller the increase in ke when approaching p 3 is related to the interaction between the tip vortex and the rudder in the middle and far fields the fluctuation of ke and the average ke value both become smaller because of energy dissipation comparing the heavy and light loading conditions it is clear that the energy dissipation under the light loading condition is relatively slower at probe points far away from the propeller in addition special attention should be paid to the difference in the ke fluctuations at p 3 under the heavy loading condition the ke fluctuations at p 3 are greater than under the light loading condition this indicates that under the light loading condition the interaction between the tip vortex and the rudder is weaker fig 16 shows the spectrum analysis of ke with two different advance coefficients by comparing these results several common features can be observed in the spectrum characteristics under the two different conditions 1 rapid attenuation is observed in the low frequency range however the rate of attenuation decreases in the high frequency range 2 the rate of attenuation in the low frequency range is fastest in the far field followed by the middle field and finally the near field 3 the leading frequency gradually shifts towards the shaft frequency k 0 25 when changing from the near field to the far field 4 the main peak is an integer multiple of the bpf in the near field in the near field the trend in the change from the middle to high frequency range differs under each loading condition when j 0 71 the average value in the spectrum gradually reduces from p 1 to p 3 because of viscous dissipation this phenomenon is related to the interaction between the tip vortex and the rudder however when j 0 45 the reduction in the vortex pitch results in a strong interaction between the neighboring tip vortices therefore the decreasing trend is less significant in addition the spectrum peak at k 0 5 is particularly apparent when j 0 45 this point marks the initial pairing process of the neighboring tip vortices in the middle field the tip vortex detaches from the rudder structure and moves into the convection phase in the low frequency range faster attenuation occurs under the light loading condition in the middle and high frequency ranges a significant peak occurs at p 4 under the heavy loading condition in the far field the vortex system becomes unstable at j 0 45 such behavior changes the spectrum completely where the maximum peak coincides with the shaft frequency the region with the highest rate of attenuation is reduced to k 3 furthermore no peak is observed in the middle and high frequency ranges when j 0 71 two peaks appear at k 0 5 and k 1 5 in the spectrum these peaks indicate the initiation of vortex pairing the corresponding peaks associated with the blade frequencies disappear when k 3 fig 17 shows the spectra at p 1 in the near field under the two loading conditions and two rudder angles i e β 0 and β 20 to clarify the overlapping parts in the spectra the peaks for β 20 are connected by dashed lines as shown in the figure the spectrum obtained with β 20 is very similar to that for β 0 a similar slope of energy attenuation is obtained in the low frequency range over the entire wavenumber range the average value of the spectrum for β 20 is greater than that for β 0 this indicates that increasing the rudder angle reduces the viscous dissipation in addition the difference between the average values of the spectra obtained with two different rudder angles is quite large under the light loading condition this suggests that the viscous dissipation in the near field is more severe under the light loading condition compared with the heavy loading condition the peaks corresponding to non integer values of k are not so significant to further explore the relationship between the characteristics of the ke spectrum and the morphological evolution of the local wake vortex the wake vortex morphology and the associated psd spectra obtained with j 0 45 and j 0 71 at β 0 at probe points p 3 p 5 and p 7 located in the near medium and far fields respectively are plotted in figs 18 and 19 under the heavy loading condition fig 18 the peaks associated with the shaft frequency blade frequency and their harmonics k 0 5 0 75 and k 1 2 are very clear at p 3 p 5 and p 7 in the low frequency range according to the reports of muscari et al 2013 and di mascio et al 2014 the occurrence of peaks associated with non integer values of k represents the pairing process between neighboring tip vortices or the growth of a secondary vortex and its interaction with the main vortical structure at probe point p 3 the pairing and grouping of tip vortices such as the b0 b90 pairing shown in fig 9 a has already occurred at an earlier time this vortex pairing results in the peak at k 0 5 in the leading frequency in addition probe point p 5 corresponds to the location where self induction and mutual induction occurs therefore the original morphology of the tip vortex is severely deformed at this location and the overall tip vortical structure transforms into an ω shape this change results in a gradual shift of the leading frequency to the shaft frequency associated with k 0 25 furthermore probe point p 7 corresponds to the location of re grouping during this process the tip vortex becomes more unstable resulting in the breakdown of the tip vortex and higher energy dissipation therefore the peaks associated with k 0 25 k 0 5 and k 0 75 become smaller when moving towards the far field the maximum peak at a probe point in the far field is obtained at k 0 25 as shown in fig 19 some similar characteristics of the tip vortex region are observed under the light loading condition the bpf and its harmonics k 1 2 in the low frequency range as well as the peaks associated with non integer k k 0 5 0 75 are present in the spectrum at probe point p 3 the peak associated with k 0 5 is smaller than under the heavy loading condition this suggests that the pairing process is delayed at this location which further reflects the interaction effect between the rudder structure and the tip vortex in the near field probe point p 5 is the first to experience the vortex pairing process therefore the peak associated with k 0 5 is intensified here in addition the initial tip vortex starts to weaken at probe point p 7 which is experiencing a strong interaction effect from the secondary vortex therefore the peak associated with k 0 75 is maintained at p 7 in the spectrum 5 2 pressure on the rudder the pressure on the rudder is measured by setting up different probe points these probe points are distributed on the surface of the rudder y 0 and in the region passed by the tip vortex four rows of probe points are arranged on both the pressure side z 0 and the suction side z 0 fig 20 shows the layout of the probes under three different operating conditions after the flow becomes stable the pressures are recorded over 10 revolutions of the propeller subsequently pressure spectrum analysis is performed at probe points in certain important regions figs 21 and 22 show the pressure spectra at probe points in key regions obtained with j 0 45 and j 0 71 respectively with β 0 the probe points along the span direction of the rudder e g p a p b and p c are selected because they are closest to the trajectory of the tip vortex distributed along the span direction of the rudder the probe points along the chord direction e g p a and p d are selected because they are closest to the trajectory of the tip vortex core as shown in fig 21 the harmonic amplitudes associated with the blade frequencies measured at p a p b and p c on the pressure side gradually decrease along the positive z axis this suggests that the strength of the tip vortex gradually decreases as the z coordinate increases this is because as the vortex evolves along the downstream direction it will further interact with the rudder along the span direction in the form of an attached vortex however such interaction becomes weaker as the tip vortex evolves along the downstream direction furthermore these attached vortices distributed along the span direction of the rudder interact differently with the rudder on the pressure and suction sides as shown in fig 21 a and c the average value in the spectrum decreases rapidly at probe point p c located at the far end along the rudder span direction on the pressure side however the decrease is less severe at probe point p g on the suction side this is because the interaction between the tip vortex and the rudder is stronger on the pressure side these results are confirmed by the pressure spectrum recorded at probe points along the chord direction as shown in fig 21 b and d the strong interaction between the tip vortex and the rudder causes the average harmonic and pressure spectrum amplitudes to decrease gradually from one probe to another along the chord direction however this decrease is not significant on the suction side increasing the advance coefficient makes the harmonic amplitudes and average values of the pressure spectra more similar on the pressure and suction sides this is because an increase in the convection velocity weakens the interaction between the tip vortex and the rudder this finding is consistent with the phenomena in fig 11 however as shown in fig 22 a and c the amplitude of the pressure spectra associated with the blade frequency drops rapidly from one probe to another along the rudder span direction the amplitude associated with the blade frequency measured at probe points p j p k and p n p o are much smaller than those measured at p i and p m this shows that the impact of the attached vortex on the rudder becomes weaker as the tip vortex evolves along the downstream direction in addition the harmonic amplitudes and average values of the pressure spectra measured on the pressure and suction sides do not differ significantly along the chord direction as shown in fig 22 b and d this indicates that the viscous interaction between the tip vortex and the rudder is weaker under the light loading condition than under the heavy loading condition the pressure spectra of the typical probe points obtained at j 0 45 β 20 are shown in fig 23 compared with the zero rudder angle case the pressure spectra now exhibit different characteristics in particular the amplitudes and average values of the harmonics measured on the suction side increase rather than decrease along the probe points in the downstream section this is possibly because the presence of a nonzero rudder angle changes the evolution of the topological structure of the tip vortex which induces the spiral vortical structure on the suction side described in fig 12 a 6 conclusion the propeller rudder system is a key component in the successful design of marine ships it plays a crucial role in managing the propulsion efficiency vibration noise radiation and control of the vessel because both the propeller and rudder are placed towards the rear of the ship they can interfere with each other during operation this interference means that the hydrodynamic force acting on the propeller is not only determined by the propeller itself but is also closely related to the rudder behind the propeller therefore analyzing the wake flow field of a propeller rudder system is far more complex than the analysis of an isolated propeller in this paper the wake dynamics of a propeller before a rudder under open water conditions have been analyzed by numerical methods based on des in particular the evolution mechanism of the propeller wake under different advance coefficients and different rudder angles has been explored a detailed analysis of the flow field was performed based on the mean flow field instantaneous flow field ke spectra and characteristics of the pressure spectrum on the rudder surface the results presented in this study lead to the following conclusions 1 the wake behavior of a propeller operating before a rudder can differ significantly under different conditions the instantaneous vortical structures and psd analysis of the ke demonstrate that the vortex system exhibits a simpler topological structure under light loading conditions with heavy loading conditions and a finite rudder angle the topological structure of the vortex system becomes very complex 2 both the instantaneous vortical structures and the psd analysis of the pressure spectrum have shown that the viscous interaction between the tip vortex and the boundary layer of the rudder is weaker under light loading conditions than under heavy loading and finite rudder angle conditions at the same time the amplitudes and average values of the pressure spectra measured on the pressure side are less different than those measured on the suction side 3 under heavy loading conditions the tip vortex and the boundary layer of the rudder exchange vorticity accompanied by the formation of vortical structures attached to the rudder surface these vortical structures exhibit different morphologies on the pressure and suction sides as the tip vortex evolves along the downstream direction these attached vortices continue to interact and collide with the rudder along the rudder span direction accompanied by the pairing of tip vortices once the tip vortices detach from the rudder secondary vortical structures evolve from the tip vortices and act as bridges connecting neighboring tip vortices as the tip vortices start to merge these secondary vortical structures start to interact with the rudder and grow 4 under heavy loading and finite rudder angle conditions the evolution of the tip vortex and the topological structure of the vortex system become much more complex intertwined spiral vortical structures form on the suction side the ω shaped vortical structures also form at a much earlier time finally the secondary vortices connecting the neighboring tip vortices become intertwined with each other the results reported in the present study are limited to the case of a specific propeller and a non lifting rudder surface although further cases should be considered to investigate how vortical structures evolve in practical configurations represented by other propellers rudders and parameters such as the distance between the propeller and rudder this study provides new insight on the phenomenology with respect to the current literature which can support the explanation and analysis of complex propeller rudder configurations acknowledgments this work is supported by china scholarship council the national natural science foundation of china grant no

keywords underactuated underwater vehicle rendezvous problem game theory way point tracking jel classification 93c85 93b51 65p40 1 introduction for the multiple agents coordination control problem the overall target is likely to be related to one or a few sets for example there is a deep research background of the problem of target set aggregation in multiple agents systems a multiple agents system such as a biological group or a robot team often has a target set where agents are expected to gather this target set can be a food enrichment area collective nesting or habitat location or a task coverage area how to control a multiple agents system to a target area has become a significant problem moreover in the process of collection optimization each individual only optimized its own index but the objective is the optimization of the whole system at the same time the information exchange among agents is often time varying for this kind of situation it is still faced with many important challenges to solve the problem of distributed collection optimization of the agent under the condition of complete system topology in addition collective aggregation coordination control can provide a new method and idea for the research of multiple agents system in theory therefore study the role of the target set in the multiple agents system has a broad practical background and theoretical significance the rendezvous problem has been considered as one of the most direct manifestation of group behavior in the biological community many scholars have done a lot of contribution in this field the rendezvous problem is mainly studied in a group of agents who are initially scattered in the space how these agents independently determine their own movement by using information from the surrounding neighbors in the end every agent is kept on the basis of keeping a certain distance between each other so as to form an organic whole the main idea is that there is a kind of comprehensive force among the agents in the system which includes both the attraction of the group and the agent s ability to avoid collision kuriki and namerikawa 2015 falconi et al 2015 chen et al 2016 kun is one of the scholars who had used mathematical equations to study the rendezvous of a group of agents in literature li et al 2015 kun proposed a group rendezvous model which is made up of simple attractive repulsive functions ma and his collaborators have made a very important contribution in the stability analysis of the rendezvous of the group ma and ji 2015 based on the lyapunov stability theory the stability of the rendezvous of the group is proved with disturbances and input saturation in literature ma and ji 2015 in literature lee and ahn 2016 lee generalized group aggregation model to the n dimensional space and proved the stability of the group aggregation model based on the theory of lyapunov stability analysis game theory is an important tool to solve the problem of multiple agents and multiple objectives game theory has been widely used in coordination control problem of multiple agents system jeffrey rosenschein and his colleagues are the first to introduce the game theory to the study of multiple agents system in his doctoral thesis rosenschein 1985 the interaction of a large number of agents has been analyzed by game theory and the conclusion that a certain kind of scene can achieve cooperation and coordination in the absence of communication has been deduced in paper rosenschein 1985 under the assumption that all the agents are rational the game theory provides a theoretical basis for the prediction of the possible choice of other individuals however due to the absence of communication each agent can not consider the influence from other agents each agent makes a decision only based on the behavior of the environment mo and xu use a recursive iterative model mo and xu 2015 to study coordination control problem a agent could predict its own and other agents reasonable behavior and probability distribution based on not only their own environmental information but also the information from other agents and the dynamic programming method is used to solve the recursive problem in paper mo and xu 2015 zhang and zhao zhang et al 2016 considered all the effects of the joint action on individual behavior and introduced the concept of virtual game to improve the original method of individual reinforcement learning this method can guarantee the convergence of the system but can not achieve optimal overall objective based on above theories tatarenko 2015 further proposed the adaptive learning method in the unknown environment and the presence of multiple nash equilibrium solution in paper turnwald and wollherr 2018 motion planning of multiple robots were studied an open loop non cooperative differential game is proposed to formulate the motion planning problem the nash equilibrium of the game is computed by a distributed algorithm the cow path game was proposed in paper alinaghian et al 2017 to study strategic decision in multiple agents system the agents sensing capabilities and prior knowledge of the target s location were assumed limited based on the scenarios of interest each agent must find a way to explore the environment in light of interagent competition in lin and liu 2015 a systematic distributed optimization approach has been established based on a learning game algorithm the designed algorithm inherited the properties in learning game theory for problem simplification and proof of convergence the behavior of learning endowed the algorithm with robustness and autonomy to realize rendezvous control for multiple underactuated underwater vehicles uuvs based on game theory the following three problems should be solved firstly a game theory model for a distributed multiple uuvs needs to be constructed in the game theory multiple uuvs are considered as myopic and rational players secondly based on a global cost function which will reflect the performance of the joint actions for multiple uuvs an optimal strategy should be derived out finally based on the established optimal strategy control force and torque will be designed for multiple uuvs based on the above presented discussion the author proposes a strategy for multiple uuvs rendezvous task in three dimensional space the proposed approach is based on cooperative game theory and bargain game theory a distributed optimization algorithm is designed based on the state potential game framework based on the deduced algorithm the way point tracking control problem of a single uuv is taken into account the line of sight method is introduced to design the way point tracking controller this method can transform the control of the position error into the asymptotically stable control of speed error pitch error and yaw angle error this can transform the stabilization of the nonholonomic system into the stabilization of the holonomic system the proposed method can not be bound by the necessary condition of the brockett lemma and it provides a new method for way point tracking control of an uuv in three dimensional space jia 2012

this part the dynamic model of the i th uuv in three dimensional space is introduced i 1 2 n in a general case the shape of the uuv considered in this paper is shown in fig 1 the influence of the roll

therefore the dynamics of the actuators and thrusters are reasonably neglected in this paper 2 2 the rendezvous problem based on empirical probity the rendezvous problem is that the multiple uuvs are required to approach the confluence in three dimensional space the rendezvous task does not require the multiple uuvs gather at the same place simultaneously the communication between multiple uuvs occurs on a predefined time interval the control inputs of an uuv will be readjusted according to available updated information in order to meet the demands of designing controller the relevant knowledge of graph theory will be introduced in this part let g υ ƛ be the interaction topology of a network with υ denoting the set of n nodes and ƛ the set of edges further let ℵ i j υ i j ƛ denote the set of the neighbors of the i th uuv ℵ i is related to the position of uuvs and the connectivity of communication the adjacency matrix of a graph denoted a a i j r n n is a square matrix with rows and columns indexed by the nodes such that the i j entry of a is 1 if j ℵ i and zero otherwise that is a i j 1 i j ƛ a i j 0 i j ƛ the laplacian matrix l l i j r n n of a graph is defined as l i j j 1 j i n a i j i j a i j i j let ϒ υ u i i υ j i i υ be a game where u i μ i r 3 1 represents the i th uuv s strategy domain with its element as μ i r 3 1 u i υ u i denotes the collected strategy domain of u i the element of u is written as μ μ i μ i where μ i denotes the set of other uuvs strategies besides the i th uuv the cost function for the i th uuv is represented by j i μ i μ i the value of the cost function j i μ i μ i is influenced by both the i th uuv s strategy and every other uuv s strategy in this paper we will introduce fictitious play algorithm which is used to design a distributed optimization algorithm here we draw on the idea of the static game take two uuvs as an example 3 μ 2 1 μ 2 2 μ 1 1 b 11 c 11 b 12 c 12 μ 1 2 b 21 c 21 b 22 c 22 where b i j i 1 2 j 1 2 is the cost of uuv1 based on its strategies μ 1 i μ 2 j and c i j i 1 2 j 1 2 denotes the cost of uuv2 according to its strategies μ 1 i μ 2 j the multiple uuvs will choose their strategies according to their current empirical probity which is affected by their opponents the initial empirical probity for the fictitious play algorithm could be chosen as follows 4 e 1 2 0 ω 1 2 ω 2 2 e 2 1 0 ω 1 1 ω 2 1 where e 1 2 is the empirical probity for the uuv1 whose opponent is uuv2 e 2 1 is the empirical probity for the uuv2 whose opponent is uuv1 ω i j i 1 2 j 1 2 denotes the desired weight for the i th strategy of the j th uuv for uuv1 based on its empirical probity the cost function for each strategy is described as follows 5 j 1 μ 1 1 e 1 2 ω 1 2 b 11 ω 2 2 b 12 ω 1 2 ω 2 2 j 1 μ 1 2 e 1 2 ω 1 2 b 21 ω 2 2 b 22 ω 1 2 ω 2 2 the principle of selecting strategy for both uuvs is that the cost function is minimized based on the opponents strategies in the previous game both uuvs will readjust their empirical probity for the further game 2 3 potential games in this part the potential game concept is introduced to help design convergence control algorithm definition 1 lin and liu 2015 a game ϒ υ u i i υ j i i υ is a potential game if there exists a global function φ μ i μ i such that 6 j i μ i μ i j i μ ˆ i μ i φ μ i μ i φ μ ˆ i μ i where i υ μ i μ ˆ i u i μ i u i μ i and μ ˆ i are different strategies for the i th uuv the construction of theoretical framework of potential game is helpful to study the coordination control of multiple uuvs a nash equilibrium is guaranteed to be exist in the potential game system in potential game system the nash equilibrium for every local cost function is consistent with the global objective lin and liu 2015 potential game theory provides theoretical support for distributed coordination control the application of potential game theory can be referred to the references yong yuan et al 2017 la 2016 di et al 2017 cheng et al 2015 zazo et al 2016 in which the potential games are derived based on the global objectives 3 distributed controller design and stability analysis in practice the rendezvous problem of multiple uuvs should be considered for the rendezvous task based on the communication topology multiple uuvs need to reach a set point in this section we assume that the position sensing digraph has a spanning tree liu and jiang 2013 the rendezvous problem for multiple uuvs will be solved by a distributed optimization algorithm 3 1 distributed optimization algorithm the initial states of multiple uuvs are different from

lin and liu 2015 the sequence ζ t converges to ζ if and only if there is a t 0 such that ζ t ζ for all t t theorem 1 consider the consensus problem proposed in 7 with finite iteration steps the

finite iteration steps with the proposed distributed optimization algorithm assume the algorithm will converge to a certain state η and η η where η is the equilibrium state as detailed in 18 in this paper the network topology is distributed and connected so there must exist uuv j ℵ i such that 19 η i η j η i ζ and η j ζ where ζ is the state of convergence according to the empirical probity updating protocol 9 and definition 2 the empirical probity for the i th uuv and the j th uuv will be 20 lim k e i j k f η j σ j 2 21 lim k e j i k f η i σ i 2 therefore according to 14 16 the new updating process is 22 η i η j η j η i since η i η j the updated state ζ η 1 η 2 η n is not equal to ζ according to the definition of convergence as definition 2 the assumption does not hold therefore if the algorithm converges it will only converge to the consensus state as 18 this ends the proof of theorem 1 q e d 3 2 rendezvous controller design for multiple uuvs in this section based on the

k 1 i 0 k 2 i 0 k 3 i 0 k 4 i 0 and k 5 i 0 in order to make the controllers 45 and 46 effective the condition u i 0 is required the following hypothesis applies to the full text assumption 1 liu and jiang 2013 for the i th uuv the derivative of the longitudinal velocity is in existence and bounded on 0 the upper and lower constant bounds of the longitudinal velocity u i are denoted as u i and u i and they satisfy the conditions u i 0 u i 0 and u i u i t u i for all t 0 for any given value b i 1 satisfying the condition 0 b i 1 u i we can design the control law for the i th uuv to meet the following condition 50 u i e u i b i 1 u i b i 1 based on the equation 50 the condition u i u i e b i 1 b i 1 0 is guaranteed and thus u i 0 in this way the singularity problem can be avoided in practical applications the longitudinal velocity of each uuv is usually required to be less than a expected value for any given value b i 2 satisfying the condition b i 2 u i we can also design the control law for the i th uuv to meet the following condition 51 u i e b i 2 u i for any given values b i 1 b i 2 u i u i satisfying the condition 0 b i 1 u i u i b i 2 we can design a new constant as follows 52 b i 3 min u i b i 1 b i 2 u i subsequently conditions 50 and 51 can be satisfied when the following inequality is established 53 u i e b i 3 based on the above analysis the control laws are designed as follows 54 q i f θ i θ i θ i d q i d 55 r i f ψ i ψ i ψ i d r i d cos θ i d cos θ i where f θ i f ψ i r r are nonlinear functions q i d and r i d are expected values which satisfy θ i d q i d and ψ i d r i d cos θ i d based on the control laws 54 55 the derivatives of θ i e and ψ i e can be derived as follows 56 θ i e f θ i θ i e 57 ψ i e f ψ i ψ i e proposition 1 by designing f θ i and f ψ i such that f θ i s f θ i s f ψ i s and f ψ i s are positive definite for s r the asymptotic stability of system 56 57 can be guaranteed proof let v θ i e 1 2 θ i e 2 v θ i e θ i e θ i e θ i e f θ i θ i e when θ i e 0 f θ i θ i e is positive definite and then v θ i e 0 when θ i e 0 f θ i θ i e is positive definite and then v θ i e 0 the asymptotic stability of system 56 can be guaranteed we can prove the asymptotic stability of system 57 in the same way q e d moreover there exist kl functions β θ i e and β ψ i e such that θ i e t β θ i e θ i e 0 t and ψ i e t β ψ i e ψ i e 0 t according to the property of continuous functions there exist c u i 0 c v i 0 c w i 0 c θ i 0 and c ψ i 0 such that for all u i u i u i v i w i θ i ψ i r c u i c u i c v i c v i c w i c w i c θ i c θ i c ψ i c

b i 3 based on the proposed control laws 54 55 there exists a finite time t i 1 for the i th uuv such that θ i t i 1 θ i d t i 1 c θ i ψ i t i 1 ψ i d t i 1 c ψ i and thus condition 53 is satisfied at time t i 1 moreover if u i 0 b i 2 then the proposed control laws 54 55 can guarantee that u i t b i 2 for t 0 t i 1 because of u i t u i t b i 2 remark 2 controllers 54 55 do not conflict with 45 46 they belong to different control stages in the initial control stage controllers 54 55 are used to guarantee the i th uuv s velocity u i 0 at t t i 1 in the same time the errors θ i e and ψ i e tend to 0 based on controllers 54 55 when u i 0 the controllers 45 46 are validity the second control stage is using control laws 45 49 to achieve formation control objective the initial control stage is necessary because the formation control stage cannot solely guarantee u i 0 if 53 is not satisfied at the beginning of the controller designing procedure 3 3 main result and stability analysis the main result of this paper is proposed as follows theorem 2 consider the kinematic and dynamic models of multiple uuvs which are given by 1 and 2 the interaction topology g υ ƛ is undirected fixed and connected the systematic distributed optimization approach is established based on a learning game algorithm 17 in the initial control stage controllers 54 55 are used to guarantee the i th uuv s velocity u i 0 at t t i 1 in the second control stage the distributed control laws 45 49 with parameters k i 1 0 k i 2 0 k i 3 0 k i 4 0 and k i 5 0 are deduced by backstepping technique then under assumption 1 the states η i x i y i z i t and the angles θ i ψ i of the i th uuv asymptotically converge to η i x i y i z i t θ i d and ψ i d respectively proof based on the definition of b i 3 proposed in 52 and the condition 53 satisfied after t i 1 the result u i 0 is derived from the above analysis and thus the controllers proposed in 45 and 46 are valid for all t t i 1 according to the condition of u i 0 b i 2 we can directly prove that u i t is bounded by b i 2 i e u i t b i 2 based on the backstepping technique detailed in section 3 2 the total lyapunov function v 2 is defined in 43 and its derivative is described in 44 by substituting 45 49 into 44 one obtains 61 v 2 i 1 n h i 1 t k i h i 1 k 1 i v i α i 2 2 k 2 i w i α i 3 2 k 3 i u i α i 1 2 k 4 i q i α i 4 2 k 5 i r i α i 5 2 0 the controller designed in this paper can make the tracking error vector h i 1 h i 2 converge to the equilibrium point 0 0 this makes multiple uuvs achieve the precise tracking of the desired space path based on theorem 1 the algorithm 17 will converge to the consensus state η i x i y i z i t that is the i th uuv asymptotically converge to η i θ i d and ψ i d respectively this ends the proof of theorem 2 q e d 4 simulation analysis to illustrate that the approach is applicable to uuv systems simulation study is carried out based on five uuvs moving in 3d space that is i 1 2 3 4 5 all of simulations are carried out using matlab software platform it is assumed that all of uuvs are equipped with propellers to provide the surge force pitch moment and yaw moment for this simulation the system parameters are shown in table 1 the initial positions and orientations of multiple uuvs are shown in table 2 the neighbor sets of the uuvs are defined as follows ℵ 1 2 3 ℵ 2 1 3 ℵ 3 1 5 ℵ 4 2 5 ℵ 5 3 4 in this paper the collision and obstacle avoidance of multiple uuvs are not involved for simplicity choose u i 3 m s u i 3 5 m s and u i 0 3 m s satisfies u i u i u i choose b i 1 0 2 and b i 2 7 2 the distributed control laws for the initialization stage are in the form of 54 55 with f θ i s f ψ i s 0 5 1 exp 0 5 s 1 exp 0 5 s the distributed control laws for the formation control stage are in the form of 45 49 with k i 1 k i 2 k i 3 k i 4 k i 5 1 u i d 3 m s and k i 2 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 1 the trajectories for five uuvs in 3d space are demonstrated in fig 3 under the control of the forces and torques five uuvs moved from their initial positions respectively and finally rendezvous at a nash equilibrium of the game the corresponding global cost function convergence result with regard to time is illustrated in fig 4 according to the mission requirement of a distributed multiple uuvs cooperation problem the global cost function is defined as equation 7 the optimization purpose of this problem is to find optimal η i x i y i z i t defined in equations 13 15 that satisfies η i argmin η i u i j g η 1 η 2 η n i υ from fig 4 the distributed optimization algorithm 17 can achieve an asymptotic convergence of the state of each uuv η i k i υ according to the global objective in equation 7 the convergence of the state x y and z for each vehicle are demonstrated in fig 5 fig 7 fig 8 fig 9 show the simulation results of the state θ and ψ the advantage of path tracking is that the expected target path points generated in the next moment the target path points is not stored in the main control computer navigation system of an uuv in advance thus the pc operation workload is reduced and the calculation speed of navigation is improved the line of sight navigation is an important precondition for uuv to realize precise path tracking in this paper line of sight los system is used to map the desired position η i k 1 to the instruction heading angles θ i d k ψ i d k and tracking errors e i k from η i k from figs 5 9 this method can improve the accuracy of path tracking in 3d space and shorten the redundant track of an uuv the distributed control laws for the formation control stage are in the form of 54 55 with q i d θ i d r i d 0 and f θ i r f ψ i r 1 5 1 e 0 5 r 1 e 0 5 r the stage changing of the distributed controllers are shown in fig 10 with 0 representing initialization stage and 1 representing formation control stage fig 11 shows the comparison results of global cost functions under two different algorithms it can be seen from the graph that the convergence speed of the algorithm with empirical probity is faster than that of the algorithm without empirical probity qi and cai 2017 from the simulation diagrams we can get that the distributed optimal control algorithm proposed in this paper can achieve the rendezvous task for multiple uuvs 5 conclusion there are three aspects of innovation in this paper firstly based on learning game theory a systematic distributed optimization algorithm has been deduced under the framework of game theory the convergence of the proposed algorithm is proved based on the learning game theory the agents can learn their opponents behaviour patterns from the game secondly based on the distributed optimization algorithm path point tracking controller for the i th uuv in three dimensional space is proposed the main research work is based on line of sight navigation and thus the motion error model of the i th uuv in three dimensional space is established based on this method the position tracking control problem of the i th uuv can be transformed to the steady control of the speed error the heading angle error and the vertical inclination error and then the stabilization control of nonholonomic systems can be transformed to the stabilization control of the holonomic systems the transformation guarantees that the constraint suffered from the necessary condition of the brockett theorem can be avoided finally based on the two stages designing process for controllers the singularity problem has been solved future work will mainly focus on multiple robots coordinated

22542,this paper proposes a distributed controller for a rendezvous problem of multiple underactuated underwater vehicles uuvs the multiple uuvs move in three dimensional space the formation controller designing process is divided into two parts in the first part a systematic distributed optimization method will be established on the basis of a learning game algorithm this algorithm

keywords underactuated underwater vehicle rendezvous problem game theory way point tracking jel classification 93c85 93b51 65p40 1 introduction for the multiple agents coordination control problem the overall target is likely to be related to one or a few sets for example there is a deep research background of the problem of target set aggregation in multiple agents systems a multiple agents system such as a biological group or a robot team often has a target set where agents are expected to gather this target set can be a food enrichment area collective nesting or habitat location or a task coverage area how to control a multiple agents system to a target area has become a significant problem moreover in the process of collection optimization each individual only optimized its own index but the objective is the optimization of the whole system at the same time the information exchange among agents is often time varying for this kind of situation it is still faced with many important challenges to solve the problem of distributed collection optimization of the agent under the condition of complete system topology in addition collective aggregation coordination control can provide a new method and idea for the research of multiple agents system in theory therefore study the role of the target set in the multiple agents system has a broad practical background and theoretical significance the rendezvous problem has been considered as one of the most direct manifestation of group behavior in the biological community many scholars have done a lot of contribution in this field the rendezvous problem is mainly studied in a group of agents who are initially scattered in the space how these agents independently determine their own movement by using information from the surrounding neighbors in the end every agent is kept on the basis of keeping a certain distance between each other so as to form an organic whole the main idea is that there is a kind of comprehensive force among the agents in the system which includes both the attraction of the group and the agent s ability to avoid collision kuriki and namerikawa 2015 falconi et al 2015 chen et al 2016 kun is one of the scholars who had used mathematical equations to study the rendezvous of a group of agents in literature li et al 2015 kun proposed a group rendezvous model which is made up of simple attractive repulsive functions ma and his collaborators have made a very important contribution in the stability analysis of the rendezvous of the group ma and ji 2015 based on the lyapunov stability theory the stability of the rendezvous of the group is proved with disturbances and input saturation in literature ma and ji 2015 in literature lee and ahn 2016 lee generalized group aggregation model to the n dimensional space and proved the stability of the group aggregation model based on the theory of lyapunov stability analysis game theory is an important tool to solve the problem of multiple agents and multiple objectives game theory has been widely used in coordination control problem of multiple agents system jeffrey rosenschein and his colleagues are the first to introduce the game theory to the study of multiple agents system in his doctoral thesis rosenschein 1985 the interaction of a large number of agents has been analyzed by game theory and the conclusion that a certain kind of scene can achieve cooperation and coordination in the absence of communication has been deduced in paper rosenschein 1985 under the assumption that all the agents are rational the game theory provides a theoretical basis for the prediction of the possible choice of other individuals however due to the absence of communication each agent can not consider the influence from other agents each agent makes a decision only based on the behavior of the environment mo and xu use a recursive iterative model mo and xu 2015 to study coordination control problem a agent could predict its own and other agents reasonable behavior and probability distribution based on not only their own environmental information but also the information from other agents and the dynamic programming method is used to solve the recursive problem in paper mo and xu 2015 zhang and zhao zhang et al 2016 considered all the effects of the joint action on individual behavior and introduced the concept of virtual game to improve the original method of individual reinforcement learning this method can guarantee the convergence of the system but can not achieve optimal overall objective based on above theories tatarenko 2015 further proposed the adaptive learning method in the unknown environment and the presence of multiple nash equilibrium solution in paper turnwald and wollherr 2018 motion planning of multiple robots were studied an open loop non cooperative differential game is proposed to formulate the motion planning problem the nash equilibrium of the game is computed by a distributed algorithm the cow path game was proposed in paper alinaghian et al 2017 to study strategic decision in multiple agents system the agents sensing capabilities and prior knowledge of the target s location were assumed limited based on the scenarios of interest each agent must find a way to explore the environment in light of interagent competition in lin and liu 2015 a systematic distributed optimization approach has been established based on a learning game algorithm the designed algorithm inherited the properties in learning game theory for problem simplification and proof of convergence the behavior of learning endowed the algorithm with robustness and autonomy to realize rendezvous control for multiple underactuated underwater vehicles uuvs based on game theory the following three problems should be solved firstly a game theory model for a distributed multiple uuvs needs to be constructed in the game theory multiple uuvs are considered as myopic and rational players secondly based on a global cost function which will reflect the performance of the joint actions for multiple uuvs an optimal strategy should be derived out finally based on the established optimal strategy control force and torque will be designed for multiple uuvs based on the above presented discussion the author proposes a strategy for multiple uuvs rendezvous task in three dimensional space the proposed approach is based on cooperative game theory and bargain game theory a distributed optimization algorithm is designed based on the state potential game framework based on the deduced algorithm the way point tracking control problem of a single uuv is taken into account the line of sight method is introduced to design the way point tracking controller this method can transform the control of the position error into the asymptotically stable control of speed error pitch error and yaw angle error this can transform the stabilization of the nonholonomic system into the stabilization of the holonomic system the proposed method can not be bound by the necessary condition of the brockett lemma and it provides a new method for way point tracking control of an uuv in three dimensional space jia 2012

this part the dynamic model of the i th uuv in three dimensional space is introduced i 1 2 n in a general case the shape of the uuv considered in this paper is shown in fig 1 the influence of the roll effect is ignored in this paper a group of n uuvs whose mathematical models are described as follows jia 2012 1 x i u i cos ψ i cos θ i v i sin ψ i w i cos ψ i sin θ i y i u i sin ψ i cos θ i v i cos

therefore the dynamics of the actuators and thrusters are reasonably neglected in this paper 2 2 the rendezvous problem based on empirical probity the rendezvous problem is that the multiple uuvs are required to approach the confluence in three dimensional space the rendezvous task does not require the multiple uuvs gather at the same place simultaneously the communication between multiple uuvs occurs on a predefined time interval the control inputs of an uuv will be readjusted according to available updated information in order to meet the demands of designing controller the relevant knowledge of graph theory will be introduced in this part let g υ ƛ be the interaction topology of a network with υ denoting the set of n nodes and ƛ the set of edges further let ℵ i j υ i j ƛ denote the set of the neighbors of the i th uuv ℵ i is related to the position of uuvs and the connectivity of communication the adjacency matrix of a graph denoted a a i j r n n is a square matrix with rows and columns indexed by the nodes such that the i j entry of a is 1 if j ℵ i and zero otherwise that is a i j 1 i j ƛ a i j 0 i j ƛ the laplacian matrix l l i j r n n of a graph is defined as l i j j 1 j i n a i j i j a i j i j let ϒ υ u i i υ j i i υ be a game where u i μ i r 3 1 represents the i th uuv s strategy domain with its element as μ i r 3 1 u i υ u i denotes the collected strategy domain of u i the element of u is written as μ μ i μ i where μ i denotes the set of other uuvs strategies besides the i th uuv the cost function for the i th uuv is represented by j i μ i μ i the value of the cost function j i μ i μ i is influenced by both the i th uuv s strategy and every other uuv s strategy in this paper we will introduce fictitious play algorithm which is used to design a distributed optimization algorithm here we draw on the idea of the static game take two uuvs as an example 3 μ 2 1 μ 2 2 μ 1 1 b 11 c 11 b 12 c 12 μ 1 2 b 21 c 21 b 22 c 22 where b i j i 1 2 j 1 2 is the cost of uuv1 based on its strategies μ 1 i μ 2 j and c i j i 1 2 j 1 2 denotes the cost of uuv2 according to its strategies μ 1 i μ 2 j the multiple uuvs will choose their strategies according to their current empirical probity which is affected by their opponents the initial empirical probity for the fictitious play algorithm could be chosen as follows 4 e 1 2 0 ω 1 2 ω 2 2 e 2 1 0 ω 1 1 ω 2 1 where e 1 2 is the empirical probity for the uuv1 whose opponent is uuv2 e 2 1 is the empirical probity for the uuv2 whose opponent is uuv1 ω i j i 1 2 j 1 2 denotes the desired weight for the i th strategy of the j th uuv for uuv1 based on its empirical probity the cost function for each strategy is described as follows 5 j 1 μ 1 1 e 1 2 ω 1 2 b 11 ω 2 2 b 12 ω 1 2 ω 2 2 j 1 μ 1 2 e 1 2 ω 1 2 b 21 ω 2 2 b 22 ω 1 2 ω 2 2 the principle of selecting strategy for both uuvs is that the cost function is minimized based on the opponents strategies in the previous game both uuvs will readjust their empirical probity for the further game 2 3 potential games in this part the potential game concept is introduced to help design convergence control algorithm definition 1 lin and liu 2015 a game ϒ υ u i i υ j i i υ is a potential game if there exists a global function φ μ i μ i such that 6 j i μ i μ i j i μ ˆ i μ i φ μ i μ i φ μ ˆ i μ i where i υ μ i μ ˆ i u i μ i u i μ i and μ ˆ i are different strategies for the i th uuv the construction of theoretical framework of potential game is helpful to study the coordination control of multiple uuvs a nash equilibrium is guaranteed to be exist in the potential game system in potential game system the nash equilibrium for every local cost function is consistent with the global objective lin and liu 2015 potential game theory provides theoretical support for distributed coordination control the application of potential game theory can be referred to the references yong yuan et al 2017 la 2016 di et al 2017 cheng et al 2015 zazo et al 2016 in which the potential games are derived based on the global objectives 3 distributed controller design and stability analysis in practice the rendezvous problem of multiple uuvs should be considered for the rendezvous task based on the communication topology multiple uuvs need to reach a set point in this section we assume that the position sensing digraph has a spanning tree liu and jiang 2013 the rendezvous problem for multiple uuvs will be solved by a distributed optimization algorithm 3 1 distributed optimization algorithm the initial states of multiple uuvs are different from each other the states set of each uuv is continuous convex and bounded communication topology among the multiple uuvs is not a full graph for three dimensional consensus problem the global cost function is defined as follows 7 j g η 1 η 2 η n i j a i j x i x j 2 y i y j 2 z i z j 2 where j g η 1 η 2 η n is the global cost function i j υ a i j 0 η i x i y i z i t based on the analyzing of the cost function the only equilibrium is achieved when η i η j i j υ lin and liu 2015 based on the above analysis the local cost function can be defined as follows 8 j i η i η i j ℵ i a i j x i x j 2 y i y j 2 z i z j 2 according to the above local cost function the proposed game is a bounded potential game monderer and shapley 1996 equation 7 is chosen as the global cost function for the potential game based on the important results of a potential game there is a nash equilibrium for the proposed game according to the global objective 7 and the local cost function 8 the equilibrium is consistent monderer and shapley 1996 the information among multiple uuvs will be exchanged from an uuv to its neighbors let e i e i 1 e i 2 e i n be the local empirical probity of the i th uuv e i j is the empirical probity for the i th uuv whose opponent is the j th uuv take e i j e i x j e i y j e i z j for example e i x j e i y j and e i z j are calculated by functions f i x η j f i y η j and f i z η j respectively and these functions are assumed to comply with joint gauss distribution that is f i x η j n d i x j σ i x j 2 f i y η j n d i y j σ i y j 2 and f i z η j n d i z j σ i z j 2 for the i th uuv whose opponent is the j th uuv in the direction of x d i x j and σ i x j 2 are mean and variance of the random variable x i and its probability distribution e i x j respectively for the direction of y d i y j and σ i y j 2 are mean and variance of the random variable y i and its probability distribution e i y j respectively for the direction of z d i z j and σ i z j 2 are mean and variance of the random variable z i and its probability distribution e i z j respectively if the j th strategy chosen by the i th uuv at k 1 time is μ j k 1 f d j k 1 σ j 2 k 1 the empirical probity e i j k is updated as 9 e i j k 1 1 2 e i j k μ j k 1 n d i j k 1 σ i j 2 k 1 with d i j k 1 1 2 d i j k d j k 1 σ i j 2 k 1 1 4 σ i j 2 k σ j 2 k 1 and the distribution function for e i j k is denoted as f i μ j k formula 9 is an algorithmic model based on the game theory so it is the game theory based model based on the illustration for the local empirical probity the cost function of a strategy η i x i y i z i t u i is defined as follows 10 j i η i e i j ℵ i a i j x i x j 2 f i x η 1 f i x η i 1 f i x η i 1 f i x η n d x 1 d x i 1 d x i 1 d x n j ℵ i a i j y i y j 2 f i y η 1 f i y η i 1 f i y

empirical probity of the i th uuv moreover when the sum of the weights a i j equals 1 and the memory step of the i th uuv s empirical probity admits to 1 that is f i x η j k f x j k σ i x j 2 k f i y

potential game has approximate finite improvement property lemma 1 means that the use of the empirical probity e i j can realize the minimization of global cost function 7 more quickly definition 2 lin and liu 2015 the sequence ζ t converges to ζ if and only if there is a t 0 such that ζ t ζ for all t t theorem 1 consider the consensus problem proposed in 7 with finite iteration steps the algorithm derived from 17 can converge to the consensus state as follows 18 η i x i y i z i t i υ x 1 x 2 x n y 1 y 2 y n z 1 z 2 z n proof from lemma 1 we know that the problem will converge in finite iteration steps with the proposed distributed optimization algorithm assume the algorithm will converge to a certain state η and η η where η is the equilibrium state as detailed in 18 in this paper the network topology is distributed and connected so there must exist uuv j ℵ i such that 19 η i η j η i ζ and η j ζ where ζ is the state of convergence according to the empirical probity updating protocol 9 and definition 2 the empirical probity for the i th uuv and the j th uuv will be 20 lim k e i j k f η j σ j 2 21 lim k e j i k f η i σ i 2 therefore according to 14 16 the new updating process is 22 η i η j η j η i since η i η j the updated state ζ η 1 η 2 η n is not equal to ζ according to the definition of convergence as definition 2 the assumption does not hold therefore if the algorithm converges it will only converge to the consensus state as 18 this ends the proof of theorem 1 q e d 3 2 rendezvous controller design for multiple uuvs in this section based on the

f θ i θ i e when θ i e 0 f θ i θ i e is positive definite and then v θ i e 0 when θ i e 0 f θ i θ i e is positive definite and then v θ i e 0 the asymptotic stability of system 56 can be guaranteed we can prove the asymptotic stability of system 57 in the same way q e d moreover there exist kl functions β θ i e and β ψ i e such that θ i e t β θ i e θ i e 0 t and ψ i e t β ψ i e ψ i e 0 t according

b i 3 based on the proposed control laws 54 55 there exists a finite time t i 1 for the i th uuv such that θ i t i 1 θ i d t i 1 c θ i ψ i t i 1 ψ i d t i 1 c ψ i and thus condition 53 is satisfied at time t i 1 moreover if u i 0 b i 2 then the proposed control laws 54 55 can guarantee that u i t b i 2 for t 0 t i 1 because of u i t u i t b i 2 remark 2 controllers 54 55 do not conflict with 45 46 they belong to different control stages in the initial control stage controllers 54 55 are used to guarantee the i th uuv s velocity u i 0 at t t i 1 in the same time the errors θ i e and ψ i e tend to 0 based on controllers 54 55 when u i 0 the controllers 45 46 are validity the second control stage is using control laws 45 49 to achieve formation control objective the initial control stage is necessary because the formation control stage cannot solely guarantee u i 0 if 53 is not satisfied at the beginning of the controller designing procedure 3 3 main result and stability analysis the main result of this paper is proposed as follows theorem 2 consider the kinematic and dynamic models of multiple uuvs which are given by 1 and 2 the interaction topology g υ ƛ is undirected fixed and connected the systematic distributed optimization approach is established based on a learning game algorithm 17 in the initial control stage controllers 54 55 are used to guarantee the i th uuv s velocity u i 0 at t t i 1 in the second control stage the distributed control laws 45 49 with parameters k i 1 0 k i 2 0 k i 3 0 k i 4 0 and k i 5 0 are deduced by backstepping technique then under assumption 1 the states η i x i y i z i t and the angles θ i ψ i of the i th uuv asymptotically converge to η i x i y i z i t θ i d and ψ i d respectively proof based on the definition of b i 3 proposed in 52 and the condition 53 satisfied after t i 1 the result u i 0 is derived from the above analysis and thus the controllers proposed in 45 and 46 are valid for all t t i 1 according to the condition of u i 0 b i 2 we can directly prove that u i t is bounded by b i 2 i e u i t b i 2 based on the backstepping technique detailed in section 3 2 the total lyapunov function v 2 is defined in 43 and its derivative is described in 44 by substituting 45 49 into 44 one obtains 61 v 2 i 1 n h i 1 t k i h i 1 k 1 i v i α i 2 2 k 2 i w i α i 3 2 k 3 i u i α i 1 2 k 4 i q i α i 4 2 k 5 i r i α i 5 2 0 the controller designed in this paper can make the tracking error vector h i 1 h i 2 converge to the equilibrium point 0 0 this makes multiple uuvs achieve the precise tracking of the desired space path based on theorem 1 the algorithm 17 will converge to the consensus state η i x i y i z i t that is the i th uuv asymptotically converge to η i θ i d and ψ i d respectively this ends the proof of theorem 2 q e d 4 simulation analysis to illustrate that the approach is applicable to uuv systems simulation study is carried out based on five uuvs moving in 3d space that is i 1 2 3 4 5 all of simulations are carried out using matlab software platform it is assumed that all of uuvs are equipped with propellers to provide the surge force pitch moment and yaw moment for this simulation the system parameters are shown in table 1 the initial positions and orientations of multiple uuvs are shown in table 2 the neighbor sets of the uuvs are defined as follows ℵ 1 2 3 ℵ 2 1 3 ℵ 3 1 5 ℵ 4 2 5 ℵ 5 3 4 in this paper the collision and obstacle avoidance of multiple uuvs are not involved for simplicity choose u i 3 m s u i 3 5 m s and u i 0 3 m s satisfies u i u i u i choose b i 1 0 2 and b i 2 7 2 the distributed control laws for the initialization stage are in the form of 54 55 with f θ i s f ψ i s 0 5 1 exp 0 5 s 1 exp 0 5 s the distributed control laws for the formation control stage are in the form of 45 49 with k i 1 k i 2 k i 3 k i 4 k i 5 1 u i d 3 m s and k i 2 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 1 the trajectories for five uuvs in 3d space are demonstrated in fig 3 under the control of the forces and torques five uuvs moved from their initial positions respectively and finally rendezvous at a nash equilibrium of the game the corresponding global cost function convergence result with regard to time is illustrated in fig 4 according to the mission requirement of a distributed multiple uuvs cooperation problem the global cost function is defined as equation 7 the optimization purpose of this problem is to find optimal η i x i y i z i t defined in equations 13 15 that satisfies η i argmin η i u i j g η 1 η 2 η n i υ from fig 4 the distributed optimization algorithm 17 can achieve an asymptotic convergence of the state of each uuv η i k i υ according to the global objective in equation 7 the convergence of the state x y and z for each vehicle are demonstrated in fig 5 fig 7 fig 8 fig 9 show the simulation results of the state θ and ψ the advantage of path tracking is that the expected target path points generated in the next moment the target path points is not stored in the main control computer navigation system of an uuv in advance thus the pc operation workload is reduced and the calculation speed of navigation is improved the line of sight navigation is an important precondition for uuv to realize precise path tracking in this paper line of sight los system is used to map the desired position η i k 1 to the instruction heading angles θ i d k ψ i d k and tracking errors e i k from η i k from figs 5 9 this method can improve the accuracy of path tracking in 3d space and shorten the redundant track of an uuv the distributed control laws for the formation control stage are in the form of 54 55 with q i d θ i d r i d 0 and f θ i r f ψ i r 1 5 1 e 0 5 r 1 e 0 5 r the stage changing of the distributed controllers are shown in fig 10 with 0 representing initialization stage and 1 representing formation control stage fig 11 shows the comparison results of global cost functions under two different algorithms it can be seen from the graph that the convergence speed of the algorithm with empirical probity is faster than that of the algorithm without empirical probity qi and cai 2017 from the simulation diagrams we can get that the distributed optimal control algorithm proposed in this paper can achieve the rendezvous task for multiple uuvs 5 conclusion there are three aspects of innovation in this paper firstly based on learning game theory a systematic distributed optimization algorithm has been deduced under the framework of game theory the convergence of the proposed algorithm is proved based on the learning game theory the agents can learn their opponents behaviour patterns from the game secondly based on the distributed optimization algorithm path point tracking controller for the i th uuv in three dimensional space is proposed the main research work is based on line of sight navigation and thus the motion error model of the i th uuv in three dimensional space is established based on this method the position tracking control problem of the i th uuv can be transformed to the steady control of the speed error the heading angle error and the vertical inclination error and then the stabilization control of nonholonomic systems can be transformed to the stabilization control of the holonomic systems the transformation guarantees that the constraint suffered from the necessary condition of the brockett theorem can be avoided finally based on the two stages designing process for controllers the singularity problem has been solved future work will mainly focus on multiple robots coordinated control under complex communication conditions specifically it includes time varying delays tight energy budgets reduced channel capacity and so on acknowledgements this work was supported by the

22543,stress corrosion behavior of astm a131 a and a131 ah32 steels were investigated in simulated seawater ssw through slow strain rate test ssrt static load test in combination with fracture observation and also electrochemical assessments according to the results both steel showed susceptibility to stress corrosion cracking scc in ssw but the scc susceptibility was higher in steel grade a131 ah32 scanning electron microscopy sem observation of fractured surfaces exhibited scc occurrence on both steel the application of tensile stresses in the elastic range caused an increase in corrosion rate of the two steel in marine environments however the corrosion potential presented no changes in the tensile stress of 70 of yield stress the a131 ah32 steel demonstrated a higher increase in the corrosion rate than that of the grade a131 a steel it was found that the general corrosion rate of steel grade a131 a was higher than that of grade a131 ah32 steel in the marine environment and the reason was attributed to the differences on the steels alloying elements in particular on carbon content keywords low carbon steel stress corrosion ssrt simulated seawater 1 introduction low carbon steels are widely used in marine structures among which two hot rolled steel grades astm a131 a a and astm a131 ah32 ah32 have general uses in the construction of vessels hull and offshore structures as per marine classification societies standard dnv the steels are generally classified into three groups of normal strength high strength and extra high strength steels steels with a minimum yield strength of 235 mpa and a tensile strength of 400 529 mpa are defined as normal strength those with a yield strength of 265 400 mpa and a tensile strength of 400 660 mpa are defined as high strength based on the standard classification steel grades a131 a and a131 ah32 are classified as normal and high strength steels respectively v and 2011 rules for the 2011 structures subjected to the marine environment endure mechanical factors from loading as well as electro chemical factors caused by seawater the reactions on metal surfaces are increased by the interactions of the above two factors which lead to rather a faster breakdown of the structural components variations on corrosion behavior of steels in marine environments resulting from stress have been studied on many researches gao et al 2010 xu and cheng 2012 yang et al 2016 the corrosion behavior of bainitic low carbon steel was investigated by gao in an environment contaminated with chlorine ions under various tensile loads gao et al 2010 the results revealed decreased resistance to chlorine ions on metal surface because of the applied elastic load leading to a rise in the corrosion rate a study by xu on corrosion behavior of x100 steel under elastic loading showed that there was no change in the corrosion potential with applying the load but the corrosion rate was increased due to applying of tensile load xu and cheng 2012 the effect of stress on the corrosion rate of q235 steel and its welding zone in 3 5 nacl solution were studied by shuo yang yang et al 2016 the results indicated that the corrosion rate increased as a result of stress so that 80 of tensile stress elevated the corrosion rate by 37 the corrosion fatigue of low strength steels has been studied previously wei et al 1998 ma et al 2010 though few studies have focused on the stress corrosion cracking of such steels in marine environments all stating that low strength steels undergo no scc in marine environments drodten and pircher 1996 dong et al 1998 hinton and procter 1983 zheng et al 1998 drodten showed that there were no scc occurrences for low strength steels of s500q and s355n in seawater drodten and pircher 1996 dong with ssrts tests reported no evidence of scc for steels with strength values below 700 mpa in simulated seawater ssw at open circuit potentials dong et al 1998 hinton s studies on low and normal strength steels pointed out that although sodium chloride solutions and seawater could promote general corrosion of these steels such environments normally cause neither stress corrosion nor hydrogen embrittlement hinton and procter 1983 instead of above using ssrt to investigate the probability of scc occurrence on low strength steels du pointed out that scc occurs on low strength steel of a537 in ssw du et al 2012 applying ssrt on e690 steel revealed that this steel and its welding zone have a high tendency to scc in ssw ma et al 2015a 2015b haoa haoa et al 2018 studied scc behavior of e690 steel in simulated marine offshore environments and reported that this steel showed a high tendency to scc in wet dry cyclic offshore environments wan applied ssrt and electrochemical tests together with sem observation and reported that x65 steel and its welded joint were somewhat susceptible to scc in the simulated deep sea environment also existing evidence suggests increased susceptibility of the scc and dropped corrosion potential resulting from hydrogen charging wan et al 2016 the scc behavior of e690 steel in so2 contaminated marine environment was studied using ssrt by ma ma et al 2018 who detected that this steel was susceptible to the scc a large body of the literature refers to parkin and liu s theory regarding the primary prediction of scc vulnerability of steels parkins 1980 liu et al 2012 as described by this theory the polarization curve with a slow sweep rate during potentiodynamic tests is related to the electrochemical property of the crack wall due to sufficient polarization of the surface in a non equilibrium electrochemical state however a fast sweep rate of polarization curves characterizes the electrochemical feature of the fresh crack tip the above theory states that the difference in the corrosion behavior of the steel at these two potential sweeping rates is the driving force for anodic dissolution ad at the crack tip and is an indication to scc susceptibility of the steel thus this potential limit is regarded to be the range of potential susceptibility to scc wide applications of astm a131 a and astm a131 ah32 steels are exploited in the construction of ships and offshore structures in marine environments considering the simultaneous impacts of stress and electrochemical effect of marine environment on these structures scc behavior and the effect of stress on the corrosion rate of these two steels were investigated in ssw by the present study for this purpose the research examined ssrt combined with fracture surface observation and tensile static load application in combination with eis and potentiodynamic polarization tests 2 experimental 2 1 materials and solution hot rolled astm a131 a and astm a131 ah32 steels specimens with yield strength σy of 275 mpa and 400 mpa respectively and chemical composition as shown in table 1 were used in this study fig 1 shows the test specimens which were cut from steels plates and machined to the smooth round shape samples according to nace tm 0198 standard nace tm0198 2004 prior to each test the related surface of the specimens was polished sequentially with 180 2500 grit emery papers then degreased in acetone rinsed in distilled water and dried by air all the tests were conducted in ssw prepared according to astm d1141 standard using distilled water and chemical compound purchased from merck company according to table 2 the ph of the electrolyte was 7 7 and dissolved oxygen content of it was 8 ppm astm d1141 2003 2 2 microscopic studies to determine the microscopic structure of the samples scanning electron microscopy of the vega tescan lmu model was used flat samples of a131 a and a131 ah32 steels were prepared and the surfaces of the samples were polished sequentially with 180 2500 grit emery papers before examining the samples surfaces by scanning electron microscopy they were etched by 5 nital solution including 5 nitric acid and 95 ethyl alcohol 2 3 electrochemical tests under static tensile stress to investigate the effect of static tensile stress on corrosion behavior of the steel grades a131 a and a131 ah32 potentiodynamic polarization test eis measurement and measurement of open circuit potential ocp changes with time was performed on statically loaded samples before carrying out each test the samples surfaces fig 1 were covered with beeswax so that only a round section of 1 cm2 was left bare on the middle of the samples then the samples were mounted and fixed into the loading device electrically connected and the bare surface 1 cm2 was subjected to the ssw in the corrosion cell of loading device fig 2 the statically applied loads were in four levels as a percentage of the steels yield strength including no load 27 of yield strength 53 of yield strength and 70 of yield strength in order to stabilize the environmental impact and attain a stable condition there was a conditioning period of immersion in ssw on each statically loaded specimen for 24 h before performing the electrochemical tests dong et al 2018 thereafter an autolab pgstat 302 n with fra module was employed to carry out electrochemical tests namely measurement of ocp changes with time potentiodynamic polarization tests and eis measurements in a cell with three standard electrodes the counter and reference electrodes used were platinum plate and an ag agcl electrode respectively measurements of potentiodynamic polarization curves were conducted through a potential sweep rate 0 5 mv s ranging from 250 mv to 350 mv in comparison with ocp the eis measurements were obtained at ocp in a frequency range of 0 01 hz 100 khz with an applied ac signal of 10 mv data analysis the equivalent circuit synthesis and experimental data fitting determination were carried out by the equivalent circuit simulation program zview2 the corrosion current density and the corrosion potential of the samples were determined with tafel extrapolation method for this purpose the linear sections of the anodic and cathodic curves were extrapolated and the ecorr and icorr values were directly determined from the cross over point in cathodic branch extrapolation was in the region where the charge transfer process is dominated above 0 9 mv the corrosion rate c r was determined from equation 1 roberge 2008 1 c r mm y 0 00327 a icorr n d in this equation a is the atomic weight in grams 55 8 g for steel n is the number of electrons participating in the reactions 2 for steel and d is the density g cm3 7 86 for steel the reported results are average values of three tests of identically same samples upon immersion of each loaded sample in ssw the ocp was measured and recorded for 1 5 h then after 24 h immersion it was measured and recorded again for 0 5 h all tests were carried out at temperature of 25 c 2 4 slow strain rate tests ssrts to identify the possible cracking environment ssrt technique has recently been employed with smooth machined cylindrical samples which within a corrosive setting were strained to failure the specimens undergone ssrt based on astm g129 at 10 6 s strain rates astm g129 00 2013 fig 3 shows the experimental device used to carry out the ssrt to conduct the tests the samples with a gauge length of 25 4 mm prepared as per nace tm0198 standard were used reference tests were performed in air under similar strain rate at the experiment completion fractured surfaces were effaced from the corrosion products evaluating different behaviors of the material mechanical properties including reduction in area ra time to failure tf elongation el and strain s in tests performed in a specified environment ssw in here versus those attained from tests carried out in a controlled environment air generally gives an assessment for the degree of susceptibility to scc the scc susceptibility iδ was calculated by equation 2 ma et al 2018 2 i δ 1 δ ssw δ air 100 in equation 2 iδ is the relative plasticity loss δssw and δair are elongation to failure measured in ssw and in the air respectively results are presented as mean values of three tests with similar samples the examination and analysis of fractured surfaces in the samples of ssrt tests were performed with sem 3 results and discussion 3 1 microscopic studies typical microstructures of steels a131 a and a131 ah32 taken from sem images are shown in fig 4 low carbon steels generally have a ferrite pearlite structure as can be seen steel grade a131 a contains needle like ferrite and pearlite phase structure fig 4a steel ah32 contains a mostly ferrite structure in which the pearlite phase is in strip form the size of pearlite grains in ah32 steel is larger than steel a131 a but its amount is less fig 4b the amount of carbon content in steel directly effects on percentage of pearlite phase sun et al 2014 the pearlite contains ferrite and cementite layers so that the increase of pearlite phase increases the corrosion rate in steel clover et al 2005 3 2 electrochemical tests under tensile stress as a typical the ocp diagrams of ah32 steel samples under 4 different static loads are shown in fig 5 once immersed the potentials declined and the potential change diminished with time after about 1 5 h until reaching a virtually steady potential the average potential of samples after 1 5 h immersion was 675 mvvs ag agcl the time dependent reduction of ocp can be attributed to the step wise disintegration of the slender layer of corrosion product developed on the surface by air within pre immersion stage song 1998 caceres et al 2007 the statically loaded specimens immersed for 24 h to achieve a steady corrosion state the ocp diagrams and potential values are represented in fig 5 and table 3 respectively as can be seen after 24 h immersion the ocp change with time is the completely steady state with an average value of 703 mvvs ag agcl for all specimens the same trend of ocp diagrams was found for a131 a steel specimens figs 6 and 7 respectively represent typical potentiodynamic polarization curves of a131 a and a131 ah32 steels under four different static tensile loads active corrosion behavior was observed in all samples with a continuous increase in the anodic current density with growing potential obviously this behavior implies that a passive film was not formed on the surfaces of samples the corrosion potential achieved from polarization curves shows a similar trend to the outcomes from measuring open circuit potential in the samples the values of corrosion current density icorr corrosion potential ecorr and corrosion rate c r obtained from the potentiodynamic polarization tests using tafel extrapolation method are presented in table 4 and table 5 for steel a131 a and a131 ah32 respectively it is observed that an increase in the tensile stress resulted in a greater corrosion rate according to the theory of parkin and liu parkins 1980 liu et al 2012 potentiodynamic polarization tests were carried out with two sweep rates 0 5 mv s and 50 mv s on steel samples of a131 a and a131 ah32 to determine the scc potential susceptibility range of the steels as shown in figs 8 and 9 an approximate corrosion potential of 850 mv was obtained for fast sweep rate polarization curves showing more negativity than that of roughly 680 mv for slow sweep rate curves this indicates a much higher electrochemical activity of crack tip than that of the crack wall the entire potential range is divided into five zones of 525mv 685 mv 850 mv and 910mv according to differences between the polarization curves with slow and fast sweep rates there is a low susceptibility to scc at a potential over 525mv zone i because the two curves present very little differences the nucleation and penetration of the scc cracks can be highly improved by the anodic dissolution ad of the crack tip at a potential range of 525 to 685 mv zone ii the reason is that the anodic dissolution current of the crack tip is higher than that of the crack wall possibly giving rise to scc with an ad mechanism the ad of crack tip and oxygen reduction reaction of crack wall happen concurrently at a potential between 685 and 850 mv zone iii and the synergistic effect of ad oxygen reduction and tensile stress leads to the occurrence of the scc a low scc susceptibility possibly happens at a potential between 850 and 910 mv zone iv as both crack tip and crack wall present significant oxygen reduction reaction a high susceptibility to scc may arise by a sizeable hydrogen evolution reaction for crack tip at a potential below 910 mv zone v thereby causing the incidence of he a number of preceding studies liu et al 2012 liuxiaogang et al 2009 javidi and bahalaou horeh 2014 for example liu liu et al 2012 have confirmed this point stating that the ad controls the scc process at a higher positive potential than the null current potential of the slow sweep curve which is governed by he at the more negative potential compared to the null current potential of the fast sweep curve and fixed controlled by the ad and he within the two null current potentials the nyquist and phase plots obtained from the eis tests on a131 a and a131 ah32 steels specimens under 4 different tensile static loads are shown in figs 10 13 it is clear that semicircles with different diameters comprise the nyquist diagrams of different loads implying that the charge transfer controls the corrosion simulation of the metal electrolyte interface and analysis of the nyquist diagrams were performed by the equivalent electric circuit fig 14 this circuit consists of rs as the solution resistance rct as the charge transfer resistance and cpe as a constant phase element cpe is an element often used in modeling the ac response of non homogeneous systems and has two parameters cpe t and cpe p cpe t becomes equal to capacitance when cpe p 1 similar to capacitor cpe keeps the phase constant at a variable frequency but the phase shift differs from 90 the true capacitance was measured from cpe values orazem and tribollet 2008 the values of the equivalent diagram parameters on different loading condition are shown in table 6 and table 7 for steels a131 a and a131 ah32 respectively the results obtained by potentiodynamic polarization tests and eis measurements are matched the specimen on no load condition has the highest charge transfer resistance 1283 ω for steel a131 a and 1603 for steel ah32 resulting in the highest corrosion resistance the corrosion resistance of both steels decreased with increasing of tensile loads the result of this investigation indicated that basically the ah32 steel has a higher corrosion resistance than steel grade a131 a and its reason can be attributed to the differences on the amount of steels alloying elements table 1 the literature indicates that the steel corrosion behavior changes with altering the amount of alloying elements among which carbon has a major contribution hou et al 2000 edmonds and cochrane 2005 guo et al 2009 pleshivtsev et al 2009 with increasing carbon in the range of 0 05 0 8 the corrosion rate increases due to the increase in the pearlite pleshivtsev et al 2009 the two phases of alpha and cementite adjoin one another in the pearlite structure in which the roles of the cathode and the anode are played by the cementite and the ferrite respectively consequently increasing the pearlite phase leads to the formation of more galvanic cells on the surface along with rising the corrosion rate sun et al 2014 in low alloy steel very small amounts of chromium and copper have a considerable contribution to the steel corrosion rate in salt water xu et al 2016 the presence of chromium copper nickel and calcium in steel corrosion products increases the protective role of the corrosion products and reduces their anodic dissolution xu et al 2016 choi et al 2005 manganese is another element which influences the corrosion rate of steels as demonstrated in previous studies resistance to corrosion improves when manganese is present in the steel kim and gu 2015 therefore the higher corrosion resistance of the ah32 steel can be referred to the differences in carbon content and presence of alloying elements such as copper chromium nickel and manganese further observations of this research indicated that the corrosion behavior of steels a131 a and a131 ah32 in ssw are significantly affected by the elastic stress the use of stresses on the elastic range increased the corrosion rate of both steels that is the tensile stress 70 raised the corrosion rates of the steels a131 a and a131 ah32 by 16 and 28 respectively as revealed by literature review the nature rate and distribution of corrosion reactions may be influenced by stresses either by external loads or of a residual nature in several ways a by causing an intrinsic increase in the rate of corrosion b by breaking protective surface films c by affecting polarization reactions d by altering the metallurgical features of the metal system in advancing phase transformations precipitation etc e by accelerating the rate of corrosion by purely mechanical effects etc localized corrosion phenomena e g stress corrosion are the most influential consequences of stress harwood 1950 the elastic loading condition elevates both anodic and cathodic reactions on the steel surface as a result it rises the corrosion current markedly and reduces the polarization resistance in particular the oxygen reduction rate rose significantly induced by the cathodic reduction reaction under the used elastic load kim 2017 as stated by evans 1960 the separation of an atom from the metal and the resultant increase in the corrosion rate can be facilitated by a disorder in the atomic arrangement caused by mechanical stress a further finding of this research is that the corrosion potential of a131 a and a131 ah32 steels in ssw was not influenced by the applied elastic stress which is in line with nazarova nazarova et al 2017 who reported a similar finding in sae 1008 steel under elastic stress 3 3 slow strain rate test figs 15 and 16 represent the stress strain curves of steels a131 a and a131 ah32 estimated in air and in ssw respectively at ocp potential as it is observed the solution ssw affects the strain and elongation of both steels the elastic and plastic zone of both curves for steel grade a131 a are nearly similar which were overlaid with the uppermost stress level of 438 mpa the fractured stress of 340 mpa in ssw 280 mpa in the air the values of apparent strain observed in the solution and in the air were 24 4 and 27 4 respectively an approximately overlapped elastic zone of both curves was detected for the steel grade ah32 the yield strength of which was slightly different whereas the plastic zone of both curves was significantly different the uppermost ultimate strength values of 510 mpa and 555 mpa were observed in the solution and the air showing apparent strain values of 25 5 and 30 respectively generally susceptibility to scc is evaluated via monitoring the different behaviors of the material mechanical properties in tests carried out in a particular environment ssw in this case versus those features attained from tests performed in a controlled environment air contreras et al 2017 the mechanical properties extracted from ssrt are summarized in table 8 to assess scc susceptibility on the basis of nace tm0198 and astm g129 change in reduction area ratio rar the time to failure ratio tfr elongation ratio elr and strain ratio sr as well as observation by sem were employed for each sample nace tm0198 2004 astm g129 00 2013 the results of tests decreased uts el ar tf and necking observed on the tested samples demonstrated scc susceptibility of the a131 a and ah32 steels in ssw and observation indicated that the ah32 steel has a more noticeable susceptibility to the scc than the steel grade a131 a the scanning electron micrographs of fractured surfaces of a131 a and a131 ah32 steels specimens are shown in figs 17 and 18 respectively the ductile mode of

22543,stress corrosion behavior of astm a131 a and a131 ah32 steels were investigated in simulated seawater ssw through slow strain rate test ssrt static load test in combination with fracture observation and also electrochemical assessments according to the results both steel showed susceptibility to stress corrosion cracking scc in ssw but the scc susceptibility was higher in steel grade a131 ah32 scanning electron microscopy sem observation of fractured surfaces exhibited scc occurrence on both steel the application of tensile stresses in the elastic range caused an increase in corrosion rate of the two steel in marine environments however the corrosion potential presented no changes in the tensile stress of 70 of yield stress the a131 ah32 steel demonstrated a higher increase in the corrosion rate than that of the grade a131 a steel it was found that the general corrosion rate of steel grade a131 a was higher than that of grade a131 ah32 steel in the marine environment and the reason was attributed to the differences on the steels alloying elements in particular on carbon content keywords low carbon steel stress corrosion ssrt simulated seawater 1 introduction low carbon steels are widely used in marine structures among which two hot rolled steel grades astm a131 a a and astm a131 ah32 ah32 have general uses in the construction of vessels hull and offshore structures as per marine classification societies standard dnv the steels are generally classified into three groups of normal strength high strength and extra high strength steels steels with a minimum yield strength of 235 mpa and a tensile strength of 400 529 mpa are defined as normal strength those with a yield strength of 265 400 mpa and a tensile strength of 400 660 mpa are defined as high strength based on the standard classification steel grades a131 a and a131 ah32 are classified as normal and high strength steels respectively v and 2011 rules for the 2011 structures subjected to the marine environment endure mechanical factors from loading as well as electro chemical factors caused by seawater the reactions on metal surfaces are increased by the interactions of the above two factors which lead to rather a faster breakdown of the structural components variations on corrosion behavior of steels in marine environments resulting from stress have been studied on many researches gao et al 2010 xu and cheng 2012 yang et al 2016 the corrosion behavior of bainitic low carbon steel was investigated by gao in an environment contaminated with chlorine ions under various tensile loads gao et al 2010 the results revealed decreased resistance to chlorine ions on metal surface because of the applied elastic load leading to a rise in the corrosion rate a study by xu on corrosion behavior of x100 steel under elastic loading showed that there was no change in the corrosion potential with applying the load but the corrosion rate was increased due to applying of tensile load xu and cheng 2012 the effect of stress on the corrosion rate of q235 steel and its welding zone in 3 5 nacl solution were studied by shuo yang yang et al 2016 the results indicated that the corrosion rate increased as a result of stress so that 80 of tensile stress elevated the corrosion rate by 37 the corrosion fatigue of low strength steels has been studied previously wei et al 1998 ma et al 2010 though few studies have focused on the stress corrosion cracking of such steels in marine environments all stating that low strength steels undergo no scc in marine environments drodten and pircher 1996 dong et al 1998 hinton and procter 1983 zheng et al 1998 drodten showed that there were no scc occurrences for low strength steels of s500q and s355n in seawater drodten and pircher 1996 dong with ssrts tests reported no evidence of scc for steels with strength values below 700 mpa in simulated seawater ssw at open circuit potentials dong et al 1998 hinton s studies on low and normal strength steels pointed out that although sodium chloride solutions and seawater could promote general corrosion of these steels such environments normally cause neither stress corrosion nor hydrogen embrittlement hinton and procter 1983 instead of above using ssrt to investigate the probability of scc occurrence on low strength steels du pointed out that scc occurs on low strength steel of a537 in ssw du et al 2012 applying ssrt on e690 steel revealed that this steel and its welding zone have a high tendency to scc in ssw ma et al 2015a 2015b haoa haoa et al 2018 studied scc behavior of e690 steel in simulated marine offshore environments and reported that this steel showed a high tendency to scc in wet dry cyclic offshore environments wan applied ssrt and electrochemical tests together with sem observation and reported that x65 steel and its welded joint were somewhat susceptible to scc in the simulated deep sea environment also existing evidence suggests increased susceptibility of the scc and dropped corrosion potential resulting from hydrogen charging wan et al 2016 the scc behavior of e690 steel in so2 contaminated marine environment was studied using ssrt by ma ma et al 2018 who detected that this steel was susceptible to the scc a large body of the literature refers to parkin and liu s theory regarding the primary prediction of scc vulnerability of steels parkins 1980 liu et al 2012 as described by this theory the polarization curve with a slow sweep rate during potentiodynamic tests is related to the electrochemical property of the crack wall due to sufficient polarization of the surface in a non equilibrium electrochemical state however a fast sweep rate of polarization curves characterizes the electrochemical feature of the fresh crack tip the above theory states that the difference in the corrosion behavior of the steel at these two potential sweeping rates is the driving force for anodic dissolution ad at the crack tip and is an indication to scc susceptibility of the steel thus this potential limit is regarded to be the range of potential susceptibility to scc wide applications of astm a131 a and astm a131 ah32 steels are exploited in the construction of ships and offshore structures in marine environments considering the simultaneous impacts of stress and electrochemical effect of marine environment on these structures scc behavior and the effect of stress on the corrosion rate of these two steels were investigated in ssw by the present study for this purpose the research examined ssrt combined with fracture surface observation and tensile static load application in combination with eis and potentiodynamic polarization tests 2 experimental 2 1 materials and solution hot rolled astm a131 a and astm a131 ah32 steels specimens with yield strength σy of 275 mpa and 400 mpa respectively and chemical composition as shown in table 1 were used in this study fig 1 shows the test specimens which were cut from steels plates and machined to the smooth round shape samples according to nace tm 0198 standard nace tm0198 2004 prior to each test the related surface of the specimens was polished sequentially with 180 2500 grit emery papers then degreased in acetone rinsed in distilled water and dried by air all the tests were conducted in ssw prepared according to astm d1141 standard using distilled water and chemical compound purchased from merck company according to table 2 the ph of the electrolyte was 7 7 and dissolved oxygen content of it was 8 ppm astm d1141 2003 2 2 microscopic studies to determine the microscopic structure of the samples scanning electron microscopy of the vega tescan lmu model was used flat samples of a131 a and a131 ah32 steels were prepared and the surfaces of the samples were polished sequentially with 180 2500 grit emery papers before examining the samples surfaces by scanning electron microscopy they were etched by 5 nital solution including 5 nitric acid and 95 ethyl alcohol 2 3 electrochemical tests under static tensile stress to investigate the effect of static tensile stress on corrosion behavior of the steel grades a131 a and a131 ah32 potentiodynamic polarization test eis measurement and measurement of open circuit potential ocp changes with time was performed on statically loaded samples before carrying out each test the samples surfaces fig 1 were covered with beeswax so that only a round section of 1 cm2 was left bare on the middle of the samples then the samples were mounted and fixed into the loading device electrically connected and the bare surface 1 cm2 was subjected to the ssw in the corrosion cell of loading device fig 2 the statically applied loads were in four levels as a percentage of the steels yield strength including no load 27 of yield strength 53 of yield strength and 70 of yield strength in order to stabilize the environmental impact and attain a stable condition there was a conditioning period of immersion in ssw on each statically loaded specimen for 24 h before performing the electrochemical tests dong et al 2018 thereafter an autolab pgstat 302 n with fra module was employed to carry out electrochemical tests namely measurement of ocp changes with time potentiodynamic polarization tests and eis measurements in a cell with three standard electrodes the counter and reference electrodes used were platinum plate and an ag agcl electrode respectively measurements of potentiodynamic polarization curves were conducted through a potential sweep rate 0 5 mv s ranging from 250 mv to 350 mv in comparison with ocp the eis measurements were obtained at ocp in a frequency range of 0 01 hz 100 khz with an applied ac signal of 10 mv data analysis the equivalent circuit synthesis and experimental data fitting determination were carried out by the equivalent circuit simulation program zview2 the corrosion current density and the corrosion potential of the samples were determined with tafel extrapolation method for this purpose the linear sections of the anodic and cathodic curves were extrapolated and the ecorr and icorr values were directly determined from the cross over point in cathodic branch extrapolation was in the region where the charge transfer process is dominated above 0 9 mv the corrosion rate c r was determined from equation 1 roberge 2008 1 c r mm y 0 00327 a icorr n d in this equation a is the atomic weight in grams 55 8 g for steel n is the number of electrons participating in the reactions 2 for steel and d is the density g cm3 7 86 for steel the reported results are average values of three tests of identically same samples upon immersion of each loaded sample in ssw the ocp was measured and recorded for 1 5 h then after 24 h immersion it was measured and recorded again for 0 5 h all tests were carried out at temperature of 25 c 2 4 slow strain rate tests ssrts to identify the possible cracking environment ssrt technique has recently been employed with smooth machined cylindrical samples which within a corrosive setting were strained to failure the specimens undergone ssrt based on astm g129 at 10 6 s strain rates astm g129 00 2013 fig 3 shows the experimental device used to carry out the ssrt to conduct the tests the samples with a gauge length of 25 4 mm prepared as per nace tm0198 standard were used reference tests were performed in air under similar strain rate at the experiment completion fractured surfaces were effaced from the corrosion products evaluating different behaviors of the material mechanical properties including reduction in area ra time to failure tf elongation el and strain s in tests performed in a specified environment ssw in here versus those attained from tests carried out in a controlled environment air generally gives an assessment for the degree of susceptibility to scc the scc susceptibility iδ was calculated by equation 2 ma et al 2018 2 i δ 1 δ ssw δ air 100 in equation 2 iδ is the relative plasticity loss δssw and δair are elongation to failure measured in ssw and in the air respectively results are presented as mean values of three tests with similar samples the examination and analysis of fractured surfaces in the samples of ssrt tests were performed with sem 3 results and discussion 3 1 microscopic studies typical microstructures of steels a131 a and a131 ah32 taken from sem images are shown in fig 4 low carbon steels generally have a ferrite pearlite structure as can be seen steel grade a131 a contains needle like ferrite and pearlite phase structure fig 4a steel ah32 contains a mostly ferrite structure in which the pearlite phase is in strip form the size of pearlite grains in ah32 steel is larger than steel a131 a but its amount is less fig 4b the amount of carbon content in steel directly effects on percentage of pearlite phase sun et al 2014 the pearlite contains ferrite and cementite layers so that the increase of pearlite phase increases the corrosion rate in steel clover et al 2005 3 2 electrochemical tests under tensile stress as a typical the ocp diagrams of ah32 steel samples under 4 different static loads are shown in fig 5 once immersed the potentials declined and the potential change diminished with time after about 1 5 h until reaching a virtually steady potential the average potential of samples after 1 5 h immersion was 675 mvvs ag agcl the time dependent reduction of ocp can be attributed to the step wise disintegration of the slender layer of corrosion product developed on the surface by air within pre immersion stage song 1998 caceres et al 2007 the statically loaded specimens immersed for 24 h to achieve a steady corrosion state the ocp diagrams and potential values are represented in fig 5 and table 3 respectively as can be seen after 24 h immersion the ocp change with time is the completely steady state with an average value of 703 mvvs ag agcl for all specimens the same trend of ocp diagrams was found for a131 a steel specimens figs 6 and 7 respectively represent typical potentiodynamic polarization curves of a131 a and a131 ah32 steels under four different static tensile loads active corrosion behavior was observed in all samples with a continuous increase in the anodic current density with growing potential obviously this behavior implies that a passive film was not formed on the surfaces of samples the corrosion potential achieved from polarization curves shows a similar trend to the outcomes from measuring open circuit potential in the samples the values of corrosion current density icorr corrosion potential ecorr and corrosion rate c r obtained from the potentiodynamic polarization tests using tafel extrapolation method are presented in table 4 and table 5 for steel a131 a and a131 ah32 respectively it is observed that an increase in the tensile stress resulted in a greater corrosion rate according to the theory of parkin and liu parkins 1980 liu et al 2012 potentiodynamic polarization tests were carried out with two sweep rates 0 5 mv s and 50 mv s on steel samples of a131 a and a131 ah32 to determine the scc potential susceptibility range of the steels as shown in figs 8 and 9 an approximate corrosion potential of 850 mv was obtained for fast sweep rate polarization curves showing more negativity than that of roughly 680 mv for slow sweep rate curves this indicates a much higher electrochemical activity of crack tip than that of the crack wall the entire potential range is divided into five zones of 525mv 685 mv 850 mv and 910mv according to differences between the polarization curves with slow and fast sweep rates there is a low susceptibility to scc at a potential over 525mv zone i because the two curves present very little differences the nucleation and penetration of the scc cracks can be highly improved by the anodic dissolution ad of the crack tip at a potential range of 525 to 685 mv zone ii the reason is that the anodic dissolution current of the crack tip is higher than that of the crack wall possibly giving rise to scc with an ad mechanism the ad of crack tip and oxygen reduction reaction of crack wall happen concurrently at a potential between 685 and 850 mv zone iii and the synergistic effect of ad oxygen reduction and tensile stress leads to the occurrence of the scc a low scc susceptibility possibly happens at a potential between 850 and 910 mv zone iv as both crack tip and crack wall present significant oxygen reduction reaction a high susceptibility to scc may arise by a sizeable hydrogen evolution reaction for crack tip at a potential below 910 mv zone v thereby causing the incidence of he a number of preceding studies liu et al 2012 liuxiaogang et al 2009 javidi and bahalaou horeh 2014 for example liu liu et al 2012 have confirmed this point stating that the ad controls the scc process at a higher positive potential than the null current potential of the slow sweep curve which is governed by he at the more negative potential compared to the null current potential of the fast sweep curve and fixed controlled by the ad and he within the two null current potentials the nyquist and phase plots obtained from the eis tests on a131 a and a131 ah32 steels specimens under 4 different tensile static loads are shown in figs 10 13 it is clear that semicircles with different diameters comprise the nyquist diagrams of different loads implying that the charge transfer controls the corrosion simulation of the metal electrolyte interface and analysis of the nyquist diagrams were performed by the equivalent electric circuit fig 14 this circuit consists of rs as the solution resistance rct as the charge transfer resistance and cpe as a constant phase element cpe is an element often used in modeling the ac response of non homogeneous systems and has two parameters cpe t and cpe p cpe t becomes equal to capacitance when cpe p 1 similar to capacitor cpe keeps the phase constant at a variable frequency but the phase shift differs from 90 the true capacitance was measured from cpe values orazem and tribollet 2008 the values of the equivalent diagram parameters on different loading condition are shown in table 6 and table 7 for steels a131 a and a131 ah32 respectively the results obtained by potentiodynamic polarization tests and eis measurements are matched the specimen on no load condition has the highest charge transfer resistance 1283 ω for steel a131 a and 1603 for steel ah32 resulting in the highest corrosion resistance the corrosion resistance of both steels decreased with increasing of tensile loads the result of this investigation indicated that basically the ah32 steel has a higher corrosion resistance than steel grade a131 a and its reason can be attributed to the differences on the amount of steels alloying elements table 1 the literature indicates that the steel corrosion behavior changes with altering the amount of alloying elements among which carbon has a major contribution hou et al 2000 edmonds and cochrane 2005 guo et al 2009 pleshivtsev et al 2009 with increasing carbon in the range of 0 05 0 8 the corrosion rate increases due to the increase in the pearlite pleshivtsev et al 2009 the two phases of alpha and cementite adjoin one another in the pearlite structure in which the roles of the cathode and the anode are played by the cementite and the ferrite respectively consequently increasing the pearlite phase leads to the formation of more galvanic cells on the surface along with rising the corrosion rate sun et al 2014 in low alloy steel very small amounts of chromium and copper have a considerable contribution to the steel corrosion rate in salt water xu et al 2016 the presence of chromium copper nickel and calcium in steel corrosion products increases the protective role of the corrosion products and reduces their anodic dissolution xu et al 2016 choi et al 2005 manganese is another element which influences the corrosion rate of steels as demonstrated in previous studies resistance to corrosion improves when manganese is present in the steel kim and gu 2015 therefore the higher corrosion resistance of the ah32 steel can be referred to the differences in carbon content and presence of alloying elements such as copper chromium nickel and manganese further observations of this research indicated that the corrosion behavior of steels a131 a and a131 ah32 in ssw are significantly affected by the elastic stress the use of stresses on the elastic range increased the corrosion rate of both steels that is the tensile stress 70 raised the corrosion rates of the steels a131 a and a131 ah32 by 16 and 28 respectively as revealed by literature review the nature rate and distribution of corrosion reactions may be influenced by stresses either by external loads or of a residual nature in several ways a by causing an intrinsic increase in the rate of corrosion b by breaking protective surface films c by affecting polarization reactions d by altering the metallurgical features of the metal system in advancing phase transformations precipitation etc e by accelerating the rate of corrosion by purely mechanical effects etc localized corrosion phenomena e g stress corrosion are the most influential consequences of stress harwood 1950 the elastic loading condition elevates both anodic and cathodic reactions on the steel surface as a result it rises the corrosion current markedly and reduces the polarization resistance in particular the oxygen reduction rate rose significantly induced by the cathodic reduction reaction under the used elastic load kim 2017 as stated by evans 1960 the separation of an atom from the metal and the resultant increase in the corrosion rate can be facilitated by a disorder in the atomic arrangement caused by mechanical stress a further finding of this research is that the corrosion potential of a131 a and a131 ah32 steels in ssw was not influenced by the applied elastic stress which is in line with nazarova nazarova et al 2017 who reported a similar finding in sae 1008 steel under elastic stress 3 3 slow strain rate test figs 15 and 16 represent the stress strain curves of steels a131 a and a131 ah32 estimated in air and in ssw respectively at ocp potential as it is observed the solution ssw affects the strain and elongation of both steels the elastic and plastic zone of both curves for steel grade a131 a are nearly similar which were overlaid with the uppermost stress level of 438 mpa the fractured stress of 340 mpa in ssw 280 mpa in the air the values of apparent strain observed in the solution and in the air were 24 4 and 27 4 respectively an approximately overlapped elastic zone of both curves was detected for the steel grade ah32 the yield strength of which was slightly different whereas the plastic zone of both curves was significantly different the uppermost ultimate strength values of 510 mpa and 555 mpa were observed in the solution and the air showing apparent strain values of 25 5 and 30 respectively generally susceptibility to scc is evaluated via monitoring the different behaviors of the material mechanical properties in tests carried out in a particular environment ssw in this case versus those features attained from tests performed in a controlled environment air contreras et al 2017 the mechanical properties extracted from ssrt are summarized in table 8 to assess scc susceptibility on the basis of nace tm0198 and astm g129 change in reduction area ratio rar the time to failure ratio tfr elongation ratio elr and strain ratio sr as well as observation by sem were employed for each sample nace tm0198 2004 astm g129 00 2013 the results of tests decreased uts el ar tf and necking observed on the tested samples demonstrated scc susceptibility of the a131 a and ah32 steels in ssw and observation indicated that the ah32 steel has a more noticeable susceptibility to the scc than the steel grade a131 a the scanning electron micrographs of fractured surfaces of a131 a and a131 ah32 steels specimens are shown in figs 17 and 18 respectively the ductile mode of failure of both steels is characterized by a visible necking fig 17 c d and fig 18 c d with a dimpled feature on the fracture surface fig 17 a b and fig 18 a b typical of ductile fracture saxena et al 2006 the dimples detected inside the grains were fine sized in both cases though the grain facets are seemingly larger in the samples of a131 a steel grade according to fig 17 b 18 b the fractured

fractured surface area of both ssw tested steels samples compared to those tested in the air fig 17 c d and 18 c d the overall observations demonstrate that both steels are somewhat susceptible to scc

22544,the ultimate crushing strength of a gaztransport and technigaz no96 type liquefied natural gas cargo containment system no96 ccs was investigated through experiments and numerical simulations as one of the possible failure modes as crushing failure is directly related to material failure along the through thickness direction of the horizontal members i e the bottom plate of the primary box and the top plate of the secondary box small scale experimental crushing test results were applied instead of using the test results directly static failure capacity estimates were obtained via nonlinear finite element analyses which accounted for the crushing of the horizontal members and hence also the bending that this introduced in the horizontal members the crushing failure capacities were determined by the calculated bending moment in the two horizontal members the calculated capacity will be used to select a design criterion using the vertical stress at the mid height of the bulkhead panel of the secondary box as an early design objective keywords lng carrier cargo containment system ccs finite element method failure mode crushing failure sloshing 1 introduction since the paris agreement on climate change the global liquefied natural gas lng market has grown by 4 6 annually according to a report from the international gas union igu the global lng market is growing steadily with an annual increase of 6 2 the asia pacific region accounts for 72 4 of the world s total imports and the largest importers of lng have shifted from japan and korea to china india and the southeast asian countries in particular the chinese government aims to increase its share of the global lng from 6 to 15 by 2030 moreover the development of the floating storage regasification unit fsru is expected to increase the import volumes of small lng importing countries and create new importers the fsru is considered to be easier and less expensive than lng land terminals igu 2017 it has lower initial investment cost than land terminals additionally land terminals involve complicated licensing procedures from site selection to construction with global market trends technological development and recovering international oil prices demand for lng is increasing leading to increased orders in shipbuilding such as lng carriers and fsrus digital times 2018 as lng is transported in the liquid state at a cryogenic temperature of 163 c a cargo hold is installed inside the lng carrier the lng cargo containment system ccs is generally classified as an independent type or membrane

the barriers and the primary and secondary barriers are fixed with an adhesive the no96 is a box type cargo hold with a box structure through the plywood and it uses perlite or glass wool gw for the interior there is invar steel between the barriers and each barrier is fixed to the hull with a binding device the no96 lo3 no96 lo3 mark iii flex and mark v have been modified to reduce the boil off gas gtt 2017 a major advantage of a membrane type lng ccs such as the gtt mark iii and no96 compared with an independent type ccs is the flexibility for increasing the size of the cargo tank however the risk of sloshing damage to the membranes is an important factor to consider when selecting a membrane type lng ccs particularly for offshore applications e g lng fpso and fsru to assess the risk of sloshing damage and determine the feasibility of a membrane type lng ccs several factors must be considered for instance adequate design capacities and parameters must be considered for each ccs

behavior of a no96 type ccs under sloshing impact via simulations however few studies have been performed on the no96 ccs particularly for early design purposes park and lee 2018 proposed design dynamic buckling strength capacities for the critical failure mode of a box type lng ccs such as the no96 ccs dnvgl 2016 identifies four design failure modes of the no96 ccs shear bending failures at the cover panel of the primary box buckling failure of the bulkhead panel of the primary and secondary boxes and crushing failure at the intersection of the primary and secondary box bulkheads however it applies a comparative approach to a 138000 m3 an lng carrier which is a proven design and target vessel in this study the failure modes of the no96 ccs are classified and criteria are developed for ultimate crushing failure via numerical simulations tuned through experiments based on risk the results will aid the initial design of lng cargo holds and improve currently used holds first the failure modes of the box type cargo hold as proposed by classification societies are compared and several failure modes are added to confirm the additions and the new list a load due to sloshing is selected for a static load test of an independent box type cargo hold a nonlinear finite element fe analysis is performed to validate the experimental results the experiments and fe analysis are also

greater load as shown in fig 3 and table 1 in this study the crushing strength was evaluated for ccs 2 3 and 4 the dnvgl 2016 and lloyd s register 2009 identify the following failure modes for the no96 ccs as shown in fig 4 1 bending shear including combined shear and bending failure of the cover plate of the primary box 2 buckling failure of the vertical bulkheads internal and external bulkheads 3 crushing failure a bulkhead intersections b resin rope 4 failure related to the box securing system a bulkheads of the corner border box cleats at the 90 transverse corner zone b bulkheads of the corner border box cleats at the 135 longitudinal corner zone 5 failure connected to the membrane tongue attachment in this study the design capacity of the crushing of plates at the bulkhead intersections was investigated numerically 3 experimental tests for crushing failure analysis of plywood components arswendy and moan 2015 performed experimental tests of the crushing and buckling failure modes of plywood which is the major strengthening part of a box type lng ccs fig 5 shows the test specimen configurations that they used for the crushing test where a b and c correspond to crushing tests of a plywood plate and plywood bulkhead of a plywood plate and steel bulkhead and of a steel plate and plywood bulkhead respectively as the major failure mode of crushing for a box type no96 ccs should be related to horizontal member failure and vertical bulkhead member failure the test configuration a of fig 5 was selected in this study fig 6 shows the relationship between the vertical load and displacement for the a configuration 4 fe simulations proper interpretation of the test results requires knowledge of the correlation between the loads applied to the no96 ccs and those applied to the test specimen under which the local stress at the intersection of the plates is similar thus it is necessary to determine whether there is any difference in the stress concentration between the test setup and the no96 ccs during crushing failure to investigate the nonlinear behavior related to crushing failure at the intersection of the vertical bulkheads of the primary and the secondary boxes a nonlinear static fe analysis was performed using previous experimental results arswendy and moan 2015 for cases a and b of fig 5 as the main focus of the present study was the crushing failure of the horizontal member for the fe simulations the commercial fe code abaqus was employed with the specifications presented in table 2 the material stiffness depends on the design temperature plywood grain direction orthotropic material properties and bending membrane characteristics as shown in table 3 dnvgl 2016 an elastic modulus of 205800 mpa and a poisson s ratio 0 3 were considered for steel part in case b of fig 5 the indentation of the vertical bulkhead plates into the horizontal plate was localized to small regions directly adjacent to the edges of the bulkhead plate an accurate fe representation of this localized damage required an extremely fine element mesh instead an elastoplastic material model for the thickness behavior of the horizontal plates was calibrated to provide an equivalent overall inelastic stiffness characteristic of the bulkhead intersections for the mesh density used in the model the crushable foam model available in abaqus was applied to allow for volumetric plastic compressibility of the material this was necessary to obtain reasonable inelastic deformation modes along the thickness direction of the horizontal plates the incompressible plastic behavior of the standard metal plasticity model resulted in the unphysical locking of the elements of the horizontal plates located above and beneath the vertical bulkhead plates consequently the inelastic deformation was forced to occur in the adjacent element because the crushable foam model is only applicable to isotropic materials in abaqus applications four node shell elements with orthotropic material properties were embedded into the solid element region as shown in fig 7 the parameters of this stiffness equivalent elastoplastic crushable foam model were determined via fe simulations of the experimental test arswendy and moan 2015 the through thickness elastic modulus material yield stress and plastic tangent modulus were tuned such that the simulated load displacement response fitted the test results as shown in table 4 a comparison of the test and simulation results is shown in fig 6 fig 8 shows a comparison of the test results of arswendy and moan 2015 with the numerical simulations in this study the nonlinear material properties for the through thickness direction which is for crushing failure on the horizontal member were calibrated according to case a plywood plywood and the same material properties were considered for case b the comparison between the experimental test of case b and the numerical simulation reveals somewhat conservative behavior in the simulation however this can be acceptable for design purposes because the crushable foam model is only applicable to isotropic materials in abaqus applications four node shell elements with orthotropic material properties were embedded into the solid element region as shown in fig 7 several fe analyses were performed to confirm whether the structural behavior of the embedded shell in the solid model was practically reasonable two fe models were employed orthotropic shell elements left figure of fig 9 and orthotropic shell elements with three dimensional 3d solid elements right figure of fig 9 the elastic buckling under in plane compressive loads was evaluated as shown in fig 10 the buckling strength in the right frame of fig 10 is 12 higher than that in the left frame which could be somewhat fig 11 shows the load vs deflection curves under out plane pressure for the two aforementioned fe models the outputs are identical as the fe model with the 3d solid elements and two dimensional 2d shell embedded was implemented for the horizontal member of the ccs 1 bottom plate of the primary box and 2 top plate of the secondary box the out plane behavior was more critical than the in plane behavior therefore it was found to be acceptable to apply these concepts to the fe model elastoplastic fe analyses of a flat no96 ccs were performed the analyses considered the thickness inelastic behavior of the primary box bottom plate and the secondary box top plate using the properties of the calibrated material refer to table 4 the quarter size fe models of the insulation boxes used in the analyses are shown in fig 12 for ccs 2 ccs 3 and ccs 4 with different numbers of combs at the secondary box the model was built using eight 3d node brick elements combined with four 2d node shell elements for the horizontal members i e the bottom plate of the primary box and the top plate of the secondary box the shell elements were constrained to the solid element mesh such that the composite mesh represented the total stiffness of the plates the boundary conditions of the fe model were imposed at the resin support locations as simple support fe analyses for five cases with different loads were conducted refer to fig 13 the main objective of this study was to develop strength criteria for the crushing behavior of the no96 ccs therefore the structural response was investigated for various loading conditions the vertical stresses in the bulkheads of the boxes were considered to be representative of the forces transferred from the primary box to the secondary box through the bulkhead intersections therefore the stress was chosen as a candidate for the acceptance criterion of the crushing failure fig 14 and table 5 show the stress check points which could have been representative strength criteria for the five cases of the load figs 15 29 show the stress behavior under the applied pressure at the five check points for ccs 2 ccs 3 and ccs 4 the stress responses show that the redistribution of forces away from the bulkhead intersections and toward the adjacent parts of the bulkhead edges occurred in the structure owing to the bending of the horizontal bottom plate of the primary box and the cover plate of the secondary box owing to the crushing deformation at the intersections of the primary and secondary bulkheads loads were redistributed from the bulkhead intersection to the remainder of their edges from the bending capacity of the bottom plate of the primary box and the cover plate of the secondary box both plates the bottom plate of the primary box and the cover plate of the secondary box were bent along their two in plane directions the strong and weak directions and the capacity and efficiency of the plates to redistribute loads was dependent on them maintaining their bending strength to define the ultimate bending capacities of the horizontal members the bottom plate of the primary box and the cover plate of the secondary box four additional stress responses were observed as shown in table 6 and fig 30 the strong weak directions of the bending stress contours of the bottom plate of the primary box and the cover plate of the secondary box for a full patch load are shown in figs 31 34 the criteria for the ultimate bending strength in table 7 depending on the plywood grain direction i e the strong or weak direction were applied the critical design pressures for each loading case on ccs 2 ccs 3 and ccs 4 were determined by table 7 1100 and 760 nmm mm for the strong and weak directions of the bending capacities for the bottom plate of the primary box respectively and 1850 and 1380 nmm mm for the strong and weak directions of the bending capacities for the top plate of the secondary box respectively as shown in figs 35 46 from figs 35 46 the following conclusions are drawn the structure had a limited capacity to transfer the applied force the most critical patch load configurations occurred in the case of a uniform load the stress responses of the bulkheads of the primary box the bulkheads of the secondary box and the hotspots near the horizontal plates exhibited similar behavior 5 acceptance criteria for crushing failure crushing strength should be measured in terms of the nominal stress in the vertical bulkhead of the no96 ccs as the basic designer conducts fe calculations using 2d shell element modeling crushing deformation between the primary and secondary boxes leads to the failure of the horizontal plates i e the bottom plate of the primary box and the cover plate of the secondary box loads applied on the cover plate of the primary box are redistributed from the intersection of the bulkheads to the remainder of their edges by the horizontal plates i e the bottom plate of the primary box and the cover plate of the secondary box both the horizontal plates were bent along their two in plane directions and the ability and efficiency of the plates to redistribute the loads were dependent on the bending and shear integrity of the horizontal plates plate failure effect analysis was performed as summarized in table 8 and table 9 to assess the conditions of the critical failure of the intersection of the bulkheads bending was a more critical failure mechanism than shear for the plates therefore the total capacity of the bulkhead intersections was evaluated via a bending capacity assessment the failure effect analysis in tables 8 and 9 indicates that 7 and 8 were critical effects they represent the worst case of the acceptable consequence the system was induced to significantly limit the redistribution of forces to the edge of the bulkhead therefore the acceptance criterion for the bulkhead intersections was determined by 7 and 8 each capacity of the bending mode for each of the two plates was estimated according to the pressure bending stress curves obtained via fe analysis the estimated capacities are presented in tables 10 12 for ccs 2 ccs 3 and ccs 4 the underlined data are the capacities of 7 and 8 obtained via the failure effect analysis of the horizontal plates i e the bottom plate of the primary box and the cover plate of the secondary box in the previous section the fe model using four 2d node shell elements could yield reasonable stress values in hotspots such as check points b c and e therefore a and d were the likely strength criteria for the crushing failure mode in this study point d was used to define the failure criteria for crushing figs 47 51 show reference stresses at each check point for ccs 2 under the critical failure crushing pressure determined by table 10 maximum crushing capacity by bending strength on the horizontal plates for ccs 2 figs 52 54 correspond to ccs 3 and figs 55 58 correspond to ccs 4 table 13 presents the design reference stresses at check point d for each ccs under the critical design pressure for crushing failure in this study 39 1 45 3 and 46 5 mpa were obtained as the design reference stresses at check point d for ccs 2 ccs 3 and ccs 4 respectively 6 conclusion the ultimate crushing failure strength of the no96 ccs was evaluated via nonlinear fe simulation to define the nonlinear material properties related to the thickness behavior the experimental results of a plywood crushing test were used they were calibrated to obtain the equivalent overall inelastic stiffness characteristics of the intersections of the bulkhead for the mesh density used in the fe model crushing deformation limited the redistribution of forces by the bending or shearing of the horizontal members i e the bottom plate of the primary box and the cover plate of the secondary box therefore the load capacity of the bulkhead intersections was evaluated via a bending capacity assessment the failure criteria were defined through failure effect analyses the design crushing failure reference stresses at the middle of the bulkhead of the secondary box were proposed as 39 1 45 3 and 46 5 mpa for ccs 2 ccs 3 and ccs 4 and the design values are applicable to the no96 ccs fe model using 2d shell elements to define the ultimate crushing strength with the following inequality σ a v σ c a v where σ a v nominal stress at mid height of bulkhead of secondary box σ c a v design crushing strength 39 1 mpa for ccs 2 45 3 mpa for ccs 3 and 46 5 mpa for ccs 4 design acceptance criteria for the crushing failure evaluation for three ccss were proposed future studies are needed to define the detailed ccs design investigation of the crushing failure at the lng operating temperature a dynamic assessment to consider the design sloshing impact loads is necessary 
22544,the ultimate crushing strength of a gaztransport and technigaz no96 type liquefied natural gas cargo containment system no96 ccs was investigated through experiments and numerical simulations as one of the possible failure modes as crushing failure is directly related to material failure along the through thickness direction of the horizontal members i e the bottom plate of the primary box and the top plate of the secondary box small scale experimental crushing test results were applied instead of using the test results directly static failure capacity estimates were obtained via nonlinear finite element analyses which accounted for the crushing of the horizontal members and hence also the bending that this introduced in the horizontal members the crushing failure capacities were determined by the calculated bending moment in the two horizontal members the calculated capacity will be used to select a design criterion using the vertical stress at the mid height of the bulkhead panel of the secondary box as an early design objective keywords lng carrier cargo containment system ccs finite element method failure mode crushing failure sloshing 1 introduction since the paris agreement on climate change the global liquefied natural gas lng market has grown by 4 6 annually according to a report from the international gas union igu the global lng market is growing steadily with an annual increase of 6 2 the asia pacific region accounts for 72 4 of the world s total imports and the largest importers of lng have shifted from japan and korea to china india and the southeast asian countries in particular the chinese government aims to increase its share of the global lng from 6 to 15 by 2030 moreover the development of the floating storage regasification unit fsru is expected to increase the import volumes of small lng importing countries and create new importers the fsru is considered to be easier and less expensive than lng land terminals igu 2017 it has lower initial investment cost than land terminals additionally land terminals involve complicated licensing procedures from site selection to construction with global market trends technological development and recovering international oil prices demand for lng is increasing leading to increased orders in shipbuilding such as lng carriers and fsrus digital times 2018 as lng is transported in the liquid state at a cryogenic temperature of 163 c a cargo hold is installed inside the lng carrier the lng cargo containment system ccs is generally classified as an independent type or membrane type cargo hold as shown in fig 1 the membrane type cargo hold is strong lng world shipping 2017 the gaztransport and technigaz gtt no96 and mark iii are representative membrane type lng ccss see fig 2 the mark iii is a puf type cargo hold with horizontal plywood on top of the primary barrier and at the bottom of the secondary barrier and the r puf has it in its interior there is a triplex between the barriers and the primary and secondary barriers are fixed with an adhesive the no96 is a box type cargo hold with a box structure through the plywood and it uses perlite or glass wool gw for the interior there is invar steel between the barriers and each barrier is fixed to the hull with a binding device the no96 lo3 no96 lo3 mark iii flex and mark v have been modified to reduce the boil off gas gtt 2017 a major advantage of a membrane type lng ccs such as the gtt mark iii and no96 compared with an independent type ccs is the flexibility for increasing the size of the cargo tank however the risk of sloshing damage to the membranes is an important factor to consider when selecting a membrane type lng ccs particularly for offshore applications e g lng fpso and fsru to assess the risk of sloshing damage and determine the feasibility of a membrane type lng ccs several factors must be considered for instance adequate design capacities and parameters must be considered for each ccs and each design choice applied daewoo shipbuilding marine engineering co ltd developed a two row tank arrangement for the no96 ccs for lng offshore applications to reduce the sloshing design load ryu et al 2016 various experimental and numerical studies have been performed on the gtt mark iii type ccs kim et al 2010 chun et al 2009 arswendy and moan 2015 conducted experimental and numerical

pillon et al 2009 yoo et al 2011 and wang et al 2012 performed structural evaluations under sloshing impact loads to define design sloshing pressure and or ultimate strength of a mark iii type lng ccs depending on several failure modes dobashi and usami 2012 proposed a design dynamic amplification factor for a no96 type ccs lee et al 2011 and wang et al 2009 investigated the general structural behavior of a no96 type ccs under sloshing impact via simulations however few studies have been performed on the no96 ccs particularly for early design purposes park and lee 2018 proposed design dynamic buckling strength capacities for the critical failure mode of a box type lng ccs such as the no96 ccs dnvgl 2016 identifies four design failure modes of the no96 ccs shear bending failures at the cover panel of the primary box buckling failure of the bulkhead panel of the primary and secondary boxes and crushing failure at the intersection of the primary and secondary box bulkheads however it applies a comparative approach to a 138000 m3 an lng carrier which is a proven design and target vessel in this study the failure modes of the no96 ccs are classified and criteria are developed for ultimate crushing failure via numerical simulations tuned through experiments based on risk the results will aid the initial design of lng cargo holds and improve currently used holds first the failure modes of the box type cargo hold as proposed by classification societies are compared and several failure modes are added to confirm the additions and the new list a load due to sloshing is selected for a static load test of an independent box type cargo hold a nonlinear finite element fe analysis is performed to validate the experimental results the experiments and fe analysis are also performed for additional failure modes and design criteria are presented 2 no96 ccs the gtt no96 is a box type membrane lng ccs containing plywood panels for strength gw or perlite for insulation and
