11645,the over exploitation of groundwater resources in the agriculture intensive middle gangetic plains is leading to the depletion of the water table and deterioration of its quality a total of 100 groundwater samples were collected from the mid gangetic plain specifically from the mirzapur and pratapgarh districts of uttar pradesh during two seasons pre monsoon pre m and post monsoon post m various indices and multivariate statistical analysis were employed to assess groundwater chemistry and suitability for different purposes including the water quality index wqi sodium adsorption ratio sar soluble sodium percentage ssp residual sodium carbonate rsc and permeability index pi the findings revealed that hco3 nh4 and po4 3 exceeded permissible limits while hardness so4 2 cl and so4 2 remained within acceptable ranges analysis of variance anova indicated significant variations p 0 05 in ph electrical conductivity total dissolved solids no3 ca2 dissolved silica nh4 hco3 no3 and po4 3 groundwater chemistry in the area is influenced by weathering and evaporation processes in terms of drinking water quality all analysed samples were found to be poor during the pre monsoon season with 68 of samples in pratapgarh and 56 in mirzapur showing poor quality during the post monsoon season sar ssp rsc and na values indicated water suitability for irrigation with magnesium hazard mh and permeability index pi values suggesting unsuitability for irrigation purposes industrial indices such as langelier saturation index lsi indicated slightly to non corrosive water while ryznar stability index rsi indicated light to heavy and intolerable corrosiveness of groundwater in both districts consequently the groundwater in the area was deemed unfit for drinking without treatment but suitable for irrigation while pratapgarh s groundwater could be used for industrial purposes groundwater quality in mirzapur would require treatment the findings of this study can aid local stakeholders government agencies and water resources managers in the sustainable management of groundwater resources in the study area graphical abstract image 1 keywords groundwater uttar pradesh

industrial and domestic about 20 of the groundwater on earth is contained in igneous and metamorphic rocks while the rest is in sedimentary rocks kumar et al 2020 it is the fundamental resource of the most rural population with 65 of agricultural land irrigated by groundwater globally madhav et al 2018 nearly 1500 million people around the globe rely upon groundwater for their needs either directly or indirectly it is interesting to note that around 80 of the rural population and 50 of the urban population in the country depend on groundwater while 56 of indians in rural areas receive drinking water via tube wells while open wells and supplied water system contributes 14 and 25 respectively kumar et al 2017 also it is essential to note that the population of india consists of 17 of the total global population but it has only 4 of the total freshwater resources world bank report escalating water demand has compelled both the public and government to develop a network of groundwater sources utilising handpumps and borewells to meet the increasing need for safe water for potable irrigation and other domestic uses kumar et al 2018 bhagat et al 2021 excessive exploitation of groundwater has resulted in the depletion of groundwater levels gwl and deterioration of groundwater quality rendering it vulnerable to contaminants that can cause various waterborne diseases and fatalities singh and singh 2018 bhagat et al 2021 the rise in urbanisation has also impacted groundwater quality through dense localities and their maltreatment of waste wakode et al 2018 ahmed et al 2021 the problem is further aggravated by the unplanned and unscientific development of groundwater resources leading to the decline and desaturation of aquifers saba et al 2018 the quality of groundwater in a particular location is determined by a range of physicochemical factors influenced by the area s geological characteristics and human activities and interventions the fundamental aspects directly affecting the groundwater quality of an area include spatial and temporal variations in hydrochemical parameters along with the rate of groundwater withdrawal precipitation rate geological properties of the aquifer or basin climatic conditions and rock water interaction processes such as oxidation reduction ion exchange desorption dissolution and precipitation khan and jhariya 2018 madhav et al 2021 apart from this the minerals and rocks surrounding the water bodies also significantly affect the hydrogeochemical properties and hence the aquifer s water quality for example carbonate and feldspar comprise the two most common minerals in the crust and therefore play a significant role in regulating groundwater chemistry raju and singh 2017 the indo gangetic plain accounts for 25 of global groundwater extraction and is one of earth s most important water systems kumar et al 2021 millions rely on the middle gangetic plain s rice wheat agricultural for their livelihood people use groundwater because of its fascinating characteristics like its huge storage volume the fact that it can be extracted based on need the fact that it poses a lower risk than surface water sources the fertile area of the middle gangetic plain is an agriculture intensive area with a dense population the extensive groundwater use in this region has deteriorated its quality through excessive fertilisers and pesticide usage in agriculture untreated sewage and the mixing of untreated municipal and industrial effluents therefore it is crucial to understand water s suitability for various purposes gautam et al 2021 the soil salinity and sodicity impact the water quality used for irrigation and domestic purposes the excess concentration of ions may hinder water movement in plants thereby affecting their metabolism therefore different indices like rsc residual sodium carbonate electrical conductivity ec sodium adsorption ratio sar and na sodium percentage are used to investigate the groundwater quality in the study area zakaria et al 2021 these help estimate fertility demands irrigation requirements and performance and crop yield shukla and saxena 2020 such anomalies in groundwater in the present scenario inspired this study to assess the mid gangetic plains groundwater chemistry and suitability analysis for drinking irrigational and industrial use this study would provide a comprehensive and wholesome study taking into account the suitability of groundwater for drinking irrigation as well as industrial purpose this might prove highly significant as it will give a complete picture of the groundwater quality in the agriculture intensive and densely populated mid gangetic plains which somehow lacks such comprehensive study in recent times the main objectives of the study include a seasonal shift in groundwater quality of two districts of mid gangetic plain pratapgarh and mirzapur b identification of factors governing the groundwater chemistry by using multivariate analysis and hydrogeochemical facies c determining the water suitability for irrigation and industrial purposes through several irrigational water quality indices including sodium adsorption ratio sar permeability index pi soluble sodium percentage ssp sodium percentage na residual sodium carbonate rsc and magnesium hazard mh along with industrial suitability indices such as lsi and rsi this study will help to fill the knowledge gaps in understanding the chemistry and status of groundwater in this region and the factors affecting it and could be helpful for policymakers local stakeholders and the government to formulate rules and regulations according to the present status of the groundwater in the study area this study also marks its significance as pratapgarh and mirzapur are located along the fertile banks of the sai and ganga rivers respectively and hence are heavily populated the increasing population and urbanisation demand for more exploitation of groundwater to fulfil the needs of the masses this exploitation has in turn severely affected the groundwater quality of the region which can be assessed by wqi and suitability indices and which has not been done recently in this region 2 material and method 2 1 study area the gangetic plains of uttar pradesh are made up of river sediments mainly from the himalayas and to a lesser extent from peninsular india the alluvial plains of ganga plain in uttar pradesh consist of the most productive soils and aquifers leading to the exploitative use of these resources for residential and irrigational needs the more recent alluvial soil is rich in calcium and nitrogen pre cambrian rocks including granite gneisses mica schist quartzite and their related rocks as well as cracks fissures and other weak structural planes predominantly restrict groundwater circulation in such aquifers the results of the exploratory drilling indicate good potential for groundwater development up to 100 m below the surface the sandy horizon of the semi unconfined aquifer gradually increases in the direction of the east kumar et al 2019 the aquifer in this region ranges from unconfined to semi confined and confined types ansari and umar 2019 the study region consists of two cities in uttar pradesh viz mirzapur and pratapgarh mirzapur has a population of 25 lakhs approximately and is divided into three zones the pleistocene the holocene and the holocene to recent active channels and floodplains the interfluve of older alluvium is found in most parts of the gangetic plains yellow brown sediments characterise the pleistocene surfaces while the holocene are generally grey to black coloured and rich in organic content shah 2015 the weather in mirzapur is primarily dry sub tropical to dry with minimal humidity and temperature extremes in both the summer and winter the highest summer temperatures can reach 48 c and the lowest winter temperatures in december and january can reach 4 c on average mirzapur receives 1059 mm of rain each year 90 of which falls during the southwest monsoon the majority 75 of the average annual rainfall falls between july and september however this distribution is very irregular and unpredictable occasionally leading to drought spells of various intensities and lengths srivastava et al 2020 pratapgarh with a population of 3 033 899 lies in a semi arid to arid climatic zone with cold winters and hot summers the average precipitation amounts to about 1000 mm with maximum rainfall from june to september the quaternary alluvium deposits cover the whole district mainly consisting of sand clay sand clay and kankar the older alluvium occupies most areas away from the floodplains whereas the floodplains along the course of rivers are covered with newer alluvium kumar et al 2020 2 2 sample collection and analysis tools use twenty five groundwater samples were taken from each district pratapgarh and mirzapur during the pre m and post m seasons the map showing the sampling sites is given in fig 1 the polyethene bottles 500 ml were washed 2 3 times with water before sampling to collect groundwater samples physicochemical parameters were analysed as per the apha standard protocols using ar grade reagents apha 2005 ph ec tds and temperature were analysed on site using a labtronics soil and water analysis kit hco3 was estimated with hcl using the potentiometric method whereas hardness was determined using edta complexometric titration the analysis of cl was done by argentometric titration while no3 so4 2 po4 3 h4sio4 and nh4 were analysed using spectrophotometric methods the specific methods include the argentometric method for cl the turbidimetric method for so4 2 the brucine method for no3 the stannous cl method for po4 3 the molybdosilicate method for h4sio4 and the phenate method for nh4 the cations like ca2 k and na were analysed using a flame photometer the statistical analyses such as one way anova and pearson s correlation were carried out using microsoft excel 2019 and factor analysis was performed using ibm spss software the geochemical plots such as gibbs piper durov and cross plots were plotted using grapher software the interpolation maps were made using arcmap 10 8 software the various suitability indices were calculated using the formulae given below 2 2 1 water quality index wqi the wqi uses mathematics to combine test data to produce a single value that is easily expressable and easily understood the index considers a range of physical chemical and biological parameters to determine the overall health of the water body wqis are often used in water management and conservation efforts to identify areas that require attention and to track changes in water quality over time chandra et al 2017 however the wqi value in this study is calculated based on the physicochemical parameters analysed and the effect of heavy metals and microbiological parameters on water quality was not considered 1 w q i σ w n q n σ w n where wn unit weight for nth parameter qn quality rating for nth parameter 2 2 2 sodium adsorption ratio sar it is a measurement that reflects the proportion of sodium ions to the total amount of calcium and magnesium ions in water and is calculated using the following formula brindha and elango 2011 2 s a r n a c a 2 m g 2 2 2 2 3 magnesium hazard mh given that high mg absorption by soils impacts their physical characteristics it is thought that one of the key qualitative factors in evaluating irrigation water is its mg content in relation to total divalent cations ca mg ratios that fall below 50 have a negative impact on soils mh is calculated by the formula given below soleimani et al 2018 3 m h m g 2 c a 2 m g 2 100 2 2 4 soluble sodium percentage ssp it measures the quality of irrigation water that is used to manage soils that have been impacted by sodium as measured by the concentrations of the main earth and alkaline cations present in the water it is an indicator of the water s suitability for use in agricultural irrigation soleimani et al 2018 4 s s p n a k c a 2 m g 2 n a k 100 2 2 5 residual sodium carbonate rsc the alkalinity risk for soil is determined by the residual sodium carbonate rsc index of irrigation water or soil water in clay soils with a high cation exchange capacity the rsc index is used to determine if the water is suitable for irrigation brindha and elango 2011 5 r s c h c o 3 c o 3 2 c a 2 m g 2 2 2 6 permeability index pi the permeability index is a qualitative system of evaluation based on the rates of vertical water movement from the ground surface through the unsaturated zone this water is thought to have the same qualities as rainwater which would naturally recharge the aquifer brindha and elango 2011 6 p i n a h c o 3 c a 2 m g 2 n a 100 2 2 7 sodium percentage na the percentage of sodium is a crucial factor in deciding whether water is suitable for irrigation when used as irrigation high sodium water can hinder plant growth and decrease soil permeability brindha and elango 2011 7 n a n a c a 2 m g 2 n a k 100 2 2 8 kelly s index ki kelly s ratio is calculated by comparing sodium against ca2 and mg2 a kelly s index of greater than 1 indicates that the waters contain more sodium than usual as a result groundwater with a kelly s index below 1 is appropriate for irrigation while groundwater with a ratio above 1 is not bouderbala 2017 8 k i n a c a m g 2 2 9 potential salinity ps the soluble salts are not necessary for water to be suitable for irrigation the concentration of highly soluble salts raises the salinity of the soil because low solubility salts precipitate and accumulate in the soil with frequent irrigation chaudhary and satheeshkumar 2018 9 p s c l 1 2 s o 4 2 2 2 10 langelier saturation index lsi the lsi is the most widely used parameter for the determination of scale production potential it is calculated as follows 10 l s i p h m e a s u r e d p h s p h s 9 3 a b c d the values of phs a b c and d are calculated using the method given by langelier 1936 2 2 11 ryznar stability index rsi the rsi 6 indicates scale formation rsi 7 indicates the corrosive nature of water and a value between 6 and 7 indicates less scale and corrosive issue it is calculated by using the formula given by shil et al 2019 11 r s i 2 p h s p h o b s e r v e d where phs denote the ph at saturation of calcium carbonate langelier 1936 3 result and discussion 3 1 genaral groundwater chemistry of the area the ph varies from 6 03 to 8 82 in the studied area however the average ph values of the areas pratpgarh and mirzapur districts falls within the permissible limits suggested by who i e 6 5 8 5 table 1 in both seasons tiwari and singh 2014 observed similar results while investigating the hydrogeochemical characteristics of groundwater in pratapgarh these values agree with the study of singh et al 2012 in ghaziabad where ph values were under the permissible limits however ec and tds exceeded the permissible limits given by bis indicating the deterioration of groundwater quality in the study area high tds levels indicated the existence of significant amounts of bicarbonates sulphates and ca mg and na and ultimately increases the ec as well the ec ranged from 670 to 2459 mg l 1 in pratapgarh and from 494 to 1280 mg l 1 in mirzapur water with a total hardness 80 mg l 1 is considered unsuitable for domestic use as it coagulates soap lather rajankar et al 2011 the high values of hardness indicate the limestone formations in the study area the value of hardness ranged from 74 to 3340 mg l 1 in pratapgarh and from 72 to 310 mg l 1 in mirzapur all the samples in this study exceed 80 mg l 1 in both the districts in the pre m and post m except one in pratapgarh sample 11 and one in mirzapur sample 22 in the post m season as shown in fig 1 these results were comparable with ahamad et al 2018 findings for a neighbouring district varanasi where the mean hardness was reported to be 345 mg l 1 the major source of cations in groundwater includes weathering and leaching of minerals reductive dissolution ion exchange processes along with anthropogenic activities in pratapgarh among cations na ranged between 23 mg l 1 to 98 mg l 1 in pratapgarh and from 14 to 58 mg l 1 in mirzapur as shown in table 1 along with having a detrimental effect on human health sodium content is crucial in determining the suitability of groundwater for irrigation increases in salt content lead to an increase in soil hardness which lowers the permeability of the soil it is likely that weathering of silicate rocks and ion exchange with clay are responsible for the significantly greater concentration of na in the groundwater of the study area potassium k ranged from 1 to 10 mg l 1 in pratapgarh and from 1 to 8 mg l 1 in mirzapur ca2 concentration varied from 16 to 220 mg l 1 in pratapgarh while it showed much lower concentration in mirzapur ranging from 13 to 53 mg l 1 table 1 the values of sodium and potassium were within the permissible limits of who while calcium exceeded the permissible limit indicating influence of geogenic activities mg2 was found in relatively higher concentrations in the pratapgarh varying from 8 to 83 mg l 1 while it was 7 63 mg l 1 in mirzapur table 1 the magnesium concentration also fell within the permissible limits of cpcb the highest seasonal variation in concentration was observed for ca2 averaging 71 mg l 1 in the pre m season and 36 mg l 1 in the post m season in pratapgarh table 1 such a high concentration of cations indicates the influence of rock water interaction with weathering and erosion that also affect the wqi of the study area the value of bicarbonate ranged from 226 to 628 mg l 1 in pratapgrah and from 145 to 497 41 mg l 1 the values of bicarbonate fell within the permissible limits in a freshwater body hco3 is the most abundant anion the atmospheric co2 when it dissolves in water to generate carbonic acid is a source of hco3 ions in groundwater carbonic acid reacts with limestone containing minerals such as albite and causes a partial or complete breakdown of organic materials causing the hco3 ion concentration in groundwater bodies to rise singh et al 2013 the range of chloride varied from 21 to 199 mg l 1 in pratapgarh and from 2 to 97 97 mg l 1 in mirzapur the range fell within permissible limits of who the range of sulphate varied from 8 2 to 214 mg l 1 in pratapgarh and from 6 16 to 55 64 mg l 1 in mirzapur all the samples were within the range of permissible limit the range of nitrate varied from 2 15 to 61 32 mg l 1 in pratapgarh and from 4 16 to 21 28 mg l 1 in mirzapur all the samples were within the range of permissible limit the range of phosphate varied from 1 08 to 3 61 mg l 1 in pratapgarh and from 0 18 to 2 79 mg l 1 in mirzapur anthropogenic factors that could contribute to the study area s excess chloride include domestic and industrial waste agricultural runoff and the leaching of saline residues in the water whereas the increased nitrate concentration in the study area may also be related to surface water pollution at some wells from inadequate well wall sealing sethy et al 2016 these readings agreed with those of chauhan et al 2009 who studied groundwater geochemistry in ballia uttar pradesh where nitrate and phosphate were found in higher concentrations due to the addition of fertilisers and the decomposition of organic matter 3 2 seasonal shift in groundwater quality the seasonal variation of various hydrochemical parameters in the pre m and post m seasons in the mirzapur and pratapgarh districts is shown in fig 2 a and b and 2 c and d the results of anova are presented in supplementary table 1 it can be observed that parameters like temperature ec tds th alkalinity na ca2 mg2 hco3 so4 2 no3 and po4 3 showed higher concentrations in the post m season fig 2 a and b the results of anova analysis of variance suggest that ph temperature ec tds na k ca2 mg2 h4sio4 nh4 hco3 no3 and po4 3 showed significant seasonal variation p 0 05 while alkalinity hardness so4 2 and cl did not show significant seasonal variation p 0 05 in the groundwater samples of mirzapur the analysis of groundwater samples of pratapgarh showed variation with temperature ec tds th alkalinity dissolved silica na ca and mg2 showing higher values in the post m season as compared with other parameters including ph nh4 k hco3 so4 2 cl no3 and po4 3 that were observed in higher concentrations in the pre m season fig 2 c and d the statistical analysis anova result indicated that ph temperature ec tds k ca2 h4sio4 nh4 hco3 so4 2 cl no3 and po4 3 showed significant seasonal variation p 0 05 whereas alkalinity hardness na and mg2 did not show significant seasonal variation p 0 05 in pratapgarh ph showed higher values in the pre m as compared to the post m season which may be due to the dilution of groundwater through the feeding nature of the river ganga in the area the low values in the post m season imply that h in groundwater may come from rainwater s acidity along with the release of absorbed h3o from clay layers and the dissociation of h2co3 the dissolution of co2 from the atmosphere may result in the formation of h2co3 in the groundwater zhou et al 2015 consuming water with a high ec can cause gastrointestinal problems therefore it is essential that the ec which depends on the interaction of the rock and water and therefore the residence duration of the water in the rock be within allowable limits anthropogenic activities predominant in this area explain a higher ec brindha et al 2014 the values of ec showed higher values in the pre m in both districts relative to the post m season which may be due to the dilution of soluble salts because of rainfall and subsequent recharge laluraj and gopinath 2006 the high values of ec during the pre m season indicate high salinity and tds concentration as observed by shukla and saxena 2020 while assessing groundwater quality and related health effects in raebareli district uttar pradesh the tds was observed in higher concentrations in the pre m in pratapgarh and the post m in mirzapur while alkalinity hardness and dissolved silica were higher in the post m season in both districts 28 of the samples in pratapgarh in the pre m season exceeded the bis limit for a total hardness of 300 mg l 1 such water results in the encrustation of water supply and distribution pipes in mirzapur all the cations viz na k ca2 and mg2 were in higher concentration in the post m than in the pre m season table 1 low ca2 versus na ratios in groundwater samples show the absence of easily soluble calcium minerals and sodium has replaced calcium in the samples groundwater due to a base exchange reaction thus the cations k and ca2 were observed in higher amounts in the pre m season in pratapgarh while na and mg2 were higher in the post m season significant changes in sulphate content occur throughout time due to groundwater recharge and rainfall infiltration whereas nitrate and phosphate are mainly contributed from domestic and agricultural sources singh et al 2012 among anions all the anions including hco3 so4 2 cl and no3 were at higher concentrations in the pre m season whereas po4 3 was found in higher concentrations in the post m season table 1 given the agricultural activities prevalent in the study area the most significant variation was observed in no3 concentration averaging 35 39 mg l 1 in the pre m and 14 28 mg l 1 in the post m season in pratapgarh table 1 this indicates that the samples of the pre m season are mainly affected by mineral dissolution or the ion exchange processes sharma et al 2017 the higher concentration of these anions indicates intensive agricultural practices inappropriate industrial discharge waste dumping and erosion and weathering of rocks bicarbonate was the predominant anion in both districts compared to other hydrochemical parameters the main source of hco3 in the groundwater is weathering of carbonate and or alumino silicate minerals with a secondary contribution coming from dissolving co2 gases the average concentration of bicarbonate decreased in the post m season in pratapgrah but increased in mirzapur due to the relatively high precipitation in pratapgarh that recharged the groundwater and diluted the concentration of bicarbonate tiwari and singh 2014 the significant variation in chloride concentration may be observed due to the local recharge and leaching of salt and saline residues in the soil as well as municipal domestic and animal wastes from the surrounding areas sulphate typically appears as calcium magnesium and sodium soluble salts in groundwater the hydrogeological characteristics of the region precipitation and cultural practices particularly fertilisation and irrigation all contribute to variations in the concentration of cations melo et al 2012 3 3 statistical analysis 3 3 1 correlation analysis the correlation coefficient measures the interdependence of two or more random variables by determining the closeness and degree of linear relation among dependent and independent variables the correlation was studied among 17 parameters and correlation matrix as shown in table 2 a d in the pratapgarh district ec was strongly correlated with tds alkalinity hardness ca2 hco3 so4 2 and cl for the pre m season samples a strong correlation of so4 2 was also observed with hco3 and cl indicating that a common geological or anthropogenic process influences the water source for example in some geological formations the dissolution of certain minerals such as gypsum or anhydrite can lead to the release of both sulphate and chloride ions in contrast the weathering of rocks rich in carbonate minerals can release bicarbonate ions in the context of human activities the use of certain types of fertilisers or industrial processes can also lead to elevated levels of so4 2 hco3 and cl in water sources in the post m season in pratapgarh tds was strongly correlated with ph and ec while hardness was correlated with so4 2 and hco3 was correlated with po4 3 the high correlation between tds and ec in both periods indicates that conductivity is dependent upon tds and that the main components of tds in water are these ionic species a similar relationship between tds and hardness and between ec and so4 2 was found by gajendran et al 2013 while correlating the parameters in the study of groundwater in tamil nadu a strong correlation was observed between ec and tds mg2 and hco3 in the mirzapur district for the pre m season alkalinity was correlated with hardness and mg2 indicating the role of weathering in affecting the groundwater chemistry of mirzapur in the post m season ec was strongly correlated with tds hardness mg2 and hco3 whereas hardness was strongly correlated with mg2 indicating the weathering process s dominance in the mirzapur groundwater 3 3 2 factor analysis r mode factor analysis performs to understand the factors affecting the groundwater chemistry of the study area the dendrogram for pre m and post m periods in mirzapur and pratapgarh districts is given in fig 3 a and b the dendrogram for pratapgarh in pre m showed two clusters fig 3 a with all the major cations and anions in the first cluster and tds and bicarbonate in the second cluster while in the post m season 3 clusters were observed with the major cations and anions in the first cluster bicarbonate and alkalinity in the second and ec and tds in the third cluster fig 3b in mirzapur both the pre m fig 3 c and post m fig 3 d seasons showed two clusters each with major cations and anions in the first cluster and bicarbonate and tds in the second cluster the results obtained by factor analysis of groundwater samples in pre and post m seasons are given in supplementary table 2 a for pratapgarh and table 2 b for mirzapur five factors were obtained in the pre m season explaining 82 96 of the variability in groundwater data in pratapgarh factor 1 accounted for 26 62 variance and showed positive loading for tds ec no3 so4 2 indicating addition from chemical weathering and organic matter production along with its mineralisation factor 2

h4sio4 signifying the weathering process factor 4 explains 9 46 variability with positive loading for po4 3 indicating contribution from various point and non point sources factor 5 explains 8 66 of the variation showing positive loading for ph and nh4 signifying the sewage mixing and municipal waste in the groundwater six factors were obtained in the post m season explaining 77 81 of the variability in the groundwater data in pratapgarh factor 1 explains 26 62 showing positive loading for ec and tds indicating the dominance of chemical weathering in influencing groundwater chemistry factor 2 explained a 17 28 variation with positive loading for hardness so4 2 and po4 3 that indicates leaching from surface soils factor 3 explains 12 20 variability showing positive loading for cl that suggests dissolution from minerals factor 4 explains 10 71 variability with positive loading for hco3 and no3 suggesting addition from natural and anthropogenic sources factor 5 explains 10 22 of the variation showing positive loading for alkalinity and ca2 indicating the role of rock weathering in influencing the chemistry of groundwater in pratapgarh factor 6 explains a 9 19 variation with positive loadings for ph and dissolved silica indicating rock dissolution six factors were obtained in mirzapur s pre m season explaining 82 64 of the variability factor 1 explains 31 47 in the pre m season showing positive loading for ec tds alkalinity hardness and hco3 indicating chemical weathering factor 2 explained a 14 06 variation with positive loading for dissolved silica nh4 and cl suggesting the contribution of municipal waste and the dissolution of aquifer rocks factor 4 and 5 showed 9 80 and 8 92 variation respectively with positive loadings for na ca2 and no3 with positive loadings for ph and temperature factor 6 explained 7 37 percent of the variation demonstrating the alkaline character of groundwater the post m season of mirzapur explained 84 74 of the variability with six factors factors 1 and 2 explain 25 87 and 17 73 of the variability with positive loadings for alkalinity hardness hco3 and nh4 and cl respectively indicating the mixing of domestic sewage and weathering process factors 3 and 4 explained 12 05 and 10 48 of the variability respectively and showed positive loading for so4 2 and na respectively indicating leaching from the surface factors 5 and 6 accounted for 9 73 and 8 88 of the variability and showed positive loadings for ca2 no3 and ph and temperature indicating the contribution from the dissolution of rocks and anthropogenic inputs 3 4 dominant mechanism and hydrochemical facies 3 4 1 gibbs diagram gibbs diagram represents the ratios of na k na k ca2 and cl cl hco3 with tds it is used to identify the process controlling the origins of dissolved chemical components such as precipitation rock weathering and evaporation crystallisation process gupta et al 2008 ahmad et al 2019 fig 4 a and b depicts the gibbs diagram for the pratapgarh and mirzapur districts fig 4 a illustrates that rock weathering through rock water interaction is the most dominant process controlling groundwater chemistry in pratapgarh with 88 of the samples showing rock dominance while 12 showing evaporation crystallisation dominance evaporation increases salinity as rising na and cl result in higher tds additionally supporting this is the positive correlation between tds na and cl values as shown in pearson s correlation matrices table 2 a d agricultural fertilisers and irrigation return flows which increase na and cl and hence tds are other anthropogenic activities that affect evaporation rock predominance suggests that the interaction between rock and subsurface percolation of water influences the composition of groundwater in the area in mirzapur all the samples were predominantly affected by rock weathering showing that the rock water interaction is the major factor influencing the chemistry of groundwater in the region fig 4 b the key processes controlling the rock water interactions depend on reactions with host rocks influenced by the flow path networks water contact time with various minerals and mixing with older waters at depth 3 4 2 piper diagram the piper diagram helps to understand the complexities linked to the geochemical development of groundwater this diagram comprises three separate fields a diamond shaped and two triangular fields magesh et al 2013 cations are represented as a single point on the left side as a percent of all cations in meq l 1 whereas anions are plotted on the right side as samples of similar quality tend to cluster together the trilinear diagram can indicate similarities and differences among groundwater samples logeshkumaran et al 2015 fig 5 a and b depicts the piper plot for the districts of pratapgarh and mirzapur both the districts dominate hco3 mg2 type of water indicating the rock water interaction through the local recharge via river feeding and precipitation is the dominant mechanism governing the hydrochemistry of the mid gangetic plain in the pratapgarg district hco3 co3 2 facies for anion and mg2 ca2 for cation dominate the piper plot at pratapgarh with the carbonate hardness of the majority of samples over 50 fig 5 a similarly the piper plot for mirzapur fig 5 b reveals that hco3 co3 2 facies are predominant with most samples exceeding 50 carbonate hardness however among the cations the pre m and post m seasons exhibited either a magnesium type dominance or no dominating type fig 5 b according to the findings alkaline earth ca2 mg2 and weak acids predominated over alkalis na k and strong acids cl so4 2 janardhana raju et al 2009 this may be due to the water interacting with aquifer rocks complex processes like natural and anthropogenic govern the groundwater hydrochemistry in the study area 3 4 3 durov plot the durov diagram is widely used to observe groundwater samples hydrochemical characteristics and

plots liu et al 2019 the durov diagram is presented in supplementary figure 1 the plot shows that the ca2 and mg2 were the most abundant cations and hco3 and so4 2 were dominant anions in pratapgarh and mirzapur however there may be high levels of calcium naturally sodium and magnesium ions predominate because of their dissolution from contaminated rocks and soils so4 2 in the study area is contributed by weathering of rocks like pyrite fes2 and gypsum caso4 2h2o which are the major source of sulphate in water the result indicates that the dissolution of carbonate minerals in the subsurface region and evaporation is the major controlling factors of groundwater chemistry important geochemical processes such as cation exchange reactions regulate groundwater ions abundance and distribution 3 4 4 bi variate plot the cross plots for pre m and post m periods in mirzapur and pratapgarh districts is given in fig 6 1 and 6 2 the interaction between na and cl ions can be used to determine the cation exchange process cation exchange reactions are evident by a high concentration of na relative to cl or a depletion of na relative to cl sethy et al 2016 the scatter plot of na vs cl showed that most samples in pratapgarh are near or above the 1 1 equiline on the cl versus na plot indicating that the region is characterised by a depletion of na relative to cl which concludes the predominance of ion exchange reactions fig 6 1 a however in mirzapur a clear distinction between pre and post m samples was evident with pre m samples above the 1 1 line and post m samples below the line fig 6 2 a na released during the silicate weathering process is indicated by the na cl vs ec plot showing a declining trend with increasing ec and a higher na cl ratio fig 6 1 b and 6 2 b this is also confirmed by higher hco3 levels in groundwater contributed by the reaction of feldspar minerals with carbonic acid which may be one of the causes of the increase in ec most post m samples exhibit lower na cl ratios than pre m samples suggesting that silicate weathering replaces halite dissolution as the primary mechanism during the post m season tamma rao et al 2013 the dominance of hco3 over cl so4 2 and the strong correlation of hco3 with ca and mg are indicative of the dissolution of carbonate minerals as the main source of ca2 mg2 and hco3 ions in the groundwater of the study area fig 6 1 c and 6 2 c giri et al 2021 the scatter plot between na and ca2 mg2 indicates ion exchange as the major process in the area along with a few samples undergoing reverse ion exchange fig 6 1 d and 6 2 d the scatter plot of the concentrations of ca2 mg2 and hco3 so4 2 is a measure of the origin of groundwater ionic concentration mineral dissolution such as that of calcite dolomite and gypsum is prevalent in groundwater samples that are close to the 1 1 line fig 6 1 e and 6 2 e because there is a significant excess of hco3 so4 2 samples that are plotted to the right of the 1 1 line indicate that ion exchange is the dominant process all of the study s samples are below the 1 1 line reiterating the importance of weathering and ion exchange processes sethy et al 2016 the high ca2 mg2 hco3 ratio suggested that more ca2 and mg2 were supplied to the groundwater compared to hco3 fig 6 1 f and 6 2 f all samples are above the 1 1 equiline in the scattering diagram of ca2 mg2 vs hco3 with excess ca2 and mg2 indicating that silicate weathering is more prevalent than carbonate weathering vasu et al 2017 3 4 5 chloro alkaline indices cai cai is widely used to interpret the process of ion exchange occurring between different interfaces the positive or negative cai i and cai ii values depend on the exchange of na and k present in water with mg2 and ca2 present in soil or rock or vice versa positive values represent the exchange of na and k present in water with mg2 and ca2 while a negative value indicates the exchange of mg2 and ca2 present in water with na and k present in rock or soil gaur et al 2022 this study shows cai i and cai ii values of both the districts to be negative in the pre m and post m seasons the average cai i of pratapgarh was 0 30 and 0 81 whereas the average cai ii value was 0 01 and 0 09 in the pre m and post m seasons respectively in mirzapur the average cai i value was 1 50 and 0 62 whereas the average cai ii value was 0 02 and 0 07 in the pre m and post m seasons respectively the negative values in both the seasons in both districts represent reverse ion exchange showing the exchange of mg2 and ca2 is taking place from water with na and k present in rock or soil 3 5 water quality index wqi the wqi was calculated by the formula given in equation 1 wqi of the groundwater samples at each site is given in supplementary tables in table 3 wqi indicates water quality status by undertaking various parameters that show the quality of the water however this study inculcates physicochemical parameters cations anions and nutrients for the analysis of wqi it can be observed that 25 out of 50 samples in pratapgarh fell in the category of poor quality 19 belonged to the class of very poor quality 4 were in unfit category while only 2 samples belonged to good water quality in mirzapur 25 out of 50 samples were in the poor category and 25 belonged to good water quality wqi ranged from a minimum of 86 334 in pratapgarh and from 67 to 169 in mirzapur in the pre m season the major parameters contributing to such high values of wqi include hardness bicarbonate and po4 3 which were found at concentrations exceeding the permissible limits at most sites the pre m season showed slightly better conditions while the conditions were much worse in the post m season in pratapgarh but no significant difference was observed in the samples of mirzapur this could be caused by effective ion leaching excessive groundwater use direct effluent discharge impact of agriculture and dissolution of rocks the main cause of the poor water quality in the study area includes rock water interaction domestic sewage septic tanks low rainfall and evaporation caused by arid weather as suggested by the high values of ec cl and na followed by ca2 different activities such as effluent produced from industries infiltration of wastewater fertilisers from agriculture and leakage from septic tanks also contribute to the overall poor groundwater quality ahmad et al 2019 wqi data obtained in this study were compared with other studies undertaken in the neighbouring districts to understand the water quality scenario in the gangetic plain a similar study by tiwari et al 2018 assessing the groundwater quality of the mirzapur district using wqi and gis techniques revealed that the wqi of the region varied from 52 to 345 with an average of 115 indicating poor quality of groundwater ahmad et al 2019 studied the groundwater quality of mathura and reported poor quality of groundwater in the region because of low rainfall and arid weather along with industrial agricultural and domestic effluents that lead to high concentrations of tds sodium and chloride ions thus the groundwater quality in the study area varied from good to unsuitable for drinking according to a study by chaurasia et al 2018 20 of groundwater samples in varanasi uttar pradesh were deemed unfit while the rest samples were in the good to moderate poor and extremely poor categories shukla and saxena 2016 reported poor water quality for more than 50 of the collected groundwater samples in raebareli district uttar pradesh based on wqi value 3 6 water suitability assessment using different indices 3 6 1 sodium adsorption ratio sar the sar was calculated by the formula given in equation 2 the summary of water suitability indices in the pratapgarh and mirzapur districts is given in table 3 sar represents the sodium irrigation suitability of water sodium rich groundwater is not suitable for irrigation because it reduces soil permeability and water infiltration sar values between 0 and 10 are considered optimal 10 to 18 as adequate and greater than 18 as undesirable singh et al 2020 all the samples had sar values in the 0 to 10 range i e the optimal range in this study the pratapgarh sar values were found between 0 06 and 2 12 in the pre m season and between 0 57 and 4 22 in the post m season in mirzapur the sar values ranged from 0 44 to 1 70 in the pre m season and from 0 51 to 1 11 in the post m season the sar values show that the groundwater in both regions is suitable for irrigation fig 7 depicts the richards diagram for the districts of pratapgarh and mirzapur all the samples in pratapgarh show low na alkaline and high salinity hazards except one with medium and very high salinity hazards in both the pre m and post m seasons in the mirzapur district all the samples showed low na alkaline hazard with high salinity hazard in both seasons except five samples with medium salinity hazard in the pre m season the low alkali hazard indicates low hazard for crops but higher sar values can cause permeability issues hindering crop growth similar optimal sar results were found by janardhana raju et al 2009 and singh et al 2012 while examining the groundwater quality in the uttar pradesh districts of ghazipur and varanasi respectively 3 6 2 magnesium hazard mh the mh was calculated by the formula given in equation 3 the high concentration of mg2 ion may reduce crop output by increasing soil ph and decreasing soil infiltration capacity when the mh value exceeds 50 the soil becomes alkaline which reduces agricultural output singh et al 2020 pre m mh values varied from 13 55 to 77 02 in pratapgarh and from 31 39 to 80 24 in mirzapur in the post m season in pratapgarh it ranged from 37 15 to 80 95 and in mirzapur it ranged from 32 40 to 74 24 it was observed that 36 of the groundwater samples in pratapgarh had mh values exceeding 50 in the pre m season while 92 of the samples exceeded 50 in the post m season in mirzapur 92 of the samples exceeded 50 in the pre m season and 96 of the samples exceeded 50 in the post m season indicating serious hazards due to mg2 thus it is obvious that there is a possibility of an mg2 hazard as the average values for both periods and districts exceed 50 rendering the groundwater unsuitable for irrigation purposes the groundwater unsuitable for irrigation purposes due to high mg levels over ca and na in the soil leading to degraded soil quality and poor agricultural returns in their study of groundwater quality and associated dangers in the raebareli district of uttar pradesh shukla and saxena 2020 also showed mg2 hazard for agriculture 3 6 3 soluble sodium percentage ssp the ssp is calculated by the formula given in equation 4 a key indicator of soil permeability is considered to be the ssp mg2 and ca2 ions are substituted for the na ions in the water this interaction impairs soil quality by causing poor drainage and soil hardening additionally high na concentrations hasten the reaction of na with carbonates and chlorides which raises the salinity and alkalinity of the soil ssp readings below 50 indicate high water quality while readings above 50 are deemed unsafe for irrigation kumar et al 2016 it was observed that all the samples of pratapgarh in the pre m season and 52 of samples in the post m season were safe for irrigation in mirzapur all the samples in the pre m season were safe but 32 of the samples in the post m season were unsafe for irrigation the ssp values range between 12 and 42 in pratapgarh with an average value of 25 while in mirzapur between 14 and 44 in the pre m season however in the post m season it ranged from 31 to 80 in pratapgarh and 34 to 65 in mirzapur thus it can be observed that the groundwater quality in the pre m season was good whereas that of the post m season was not suitable for irrigation ideally water used in agriculture should have a greater proportion of calcium and magnesium ions and a smaller amount of sodium ions the opposite is true for water used in households a considerable reduction in the permeability of agricultural soils receiving irrigation water may result from excessive concentrations of this ion the occurrence of cation exchange as the water percolates through clay rich strata is what causes the excessive levels of sodium ions in groundwater saleem et al 2016 assessed the quality of shallow aquifer water in the noida region in uttar pradesh and found that the ssp was well within the prescribed limit indicating that the water was appropriate for agricultural uses 3 6 4 residual sodium carbonate rsc the rsc was calculated by the formula given in equation 5 the suitability of groundwater is impacted by the concentration of carbonate and hco3 ions which are greater than those of ca2 and mg2 ions this excess of carbonate and hco3 is referred to as rsc higher rsc values suggest that most ca2 and some mg2 ions precipitate out of the solution increasing the amount of na in water and soil particles and subsequently the na hazard potential singh et al 2020 kumar et al 2016 it was observed that 32 of the groundwater samples in the pre m season in pratapgarh showed suitable water quality 44 showed marginal quality and 24 of the samples were of undesirable quality in the post m season in paratpgarh 56 of the groundwater samples in the pre m season in pratapgarh showed water 36 showed somewhat suitable quality while 8 of the samples were of undesirable quality in mirzapur 32 of the groundwater samples in the pre m season in pratapgarh showed suitable water quality 48 showed marginal quality and 24 were of undesirable quality in the pre m season in the post m season in paratpgarh 52 of the groundwater samples in the pre m season in pratapgarh showed suitable water 44 showed marginal quality and 4 of the samples were of undesirable quality the poor irrigation water quality contributes to the poor agricultural returns in the region in the pre m season this study found rsc values ranging from 3 93 to 3 43 meq l 1 in pratapgrah and from 0 59 to 4 40 meq l 1 in mirzapur similarly during the post m season it ranged from 0 47 to 4 17 meq l 1 in pratapgarh and from 1 01 to 2 93 meq l 1 in mirzapur singh et al 2015 obtained comparable results with marginally appropriate groundwater quality while researching the irrigational suitability of groundwater in the chandauli region of uttar pradesh 3 6 5 permeability index pi the pi was calculated by the formula given in equation 6 extensive and prolonged usage of irrigation water affects the soil s permeability it depends on various characteristics such as the water s contents of total soluble salts ca2 mg2 na and hco3 based on pi water quality can be scategorised into three categories classes i 75 and ii 25 75 imply good irrigation water quality and class iii water 25 is not suitable for irrigation singh et al 2020 all the samples in this study belonged to the class i category in the pre m season the average pi values for pratapgarh and mirzapur were 227 and 187 respectively in the post m season they were 237 and 215 suggesting good water quality similarly madhav et al 2018 found that most samples in the bhadohi district of uttar pradesh belonged to classes 1 and 2 and were suitable for irrigational use 3 6 6 sodium percentage na the na was calculated by the formula given in equation 7 the amount of salt is a crucial indicator of the sodium risk in water when the concentration of na in water is high it tends to replace the mg2 and ca2 ions in the soil the soil permeability is reduced due to this exchange process which ultimately hinders air and water flow therefore irrigation water with a high na may degrade the soil structure decrease its aeration and decrease its permeability negatively affecting crop growth chen et al 2019 ramesh and elango 2012 it was observed that 32 of the groundwater samples of pratapgarh in the pre m season showed excellent quality 64 showed good quality and 4 showed permissible quality in the post m season 16 showed excellent quality 72 showed good quality 8 showed permissible quality and 4 showed doubtful quality in mirzapur 12 of the groundwater samples in the pre m season showed excellent quality 68 good quality and 20 permissible quality in the post m season 4 showed excellent quality and 96 showed good quality this study shows the values of na between 10 63 to 41 15 and 13 89 to 69 14 respectively in the pre m and post m seasons of pratapgarh the na of mirzapur varied from 13 48 to 43 17 in the pre m and from 15 79 to 38 10 in the post m season it can be inferred from the results that the majority of the groundwater samples from both seasons belong to the excellent to the permissible category however one sample from pratapgarh in the post m season falls into the doubtful category fig 8 depicts the wilcox diagram for the present study of the districts of pratapgarh and mirzapur during both seasons most samples collected in pratapgarh fell within the range of good to acceptable one sample each in the post m fall in the excellent and permissible to doubtful categories in comparison one pre m sample falls into the doubtful to the unsuitable group in mirzapur most samples fall within the acceptable to good range while some fall in the excellent category 3 6 7 kelly s index the kelly s index was calculated by the formula given in equation 8 the na problem in irrigation water can be determined based on the values of kelly s index ki above 1 indicates excessive na hence the water is considered unsuitable for irrigation while that of 1 suggests that the water is suitable for irrigation bouderbala 2017 the ki values in this study ranged from 0 12 to 0 70 in the pre m season and from 0 16 to 2 27 in the post m season in pratapgarh in mirzapur it ranged from 1 29 to 6 37 in the pre m season and from 1 59 to 5 29 in the post m season all the samples of mirzapur were found unsuitable in contrast all the samples in pratapgarh except one in the post m season were suitable for irrigation purposes 3 6 8 potential salinity ps the ps was calculated by the formula given in equation 9 ps scategorises water as suitable or unsuitable for agricultural purposes based on the salinity as highly soluble salts directly affect the soil salinity chaudhary and satheeshkumar 2018 ps values of less than 3 indicate excellent to good water quality values of 3 5 indicate good to injurious quality and a value of more than 5 indicates injurious to the unsatisfactory condition of the water in this study ps values ranged from 0 89 to 7 84 in the pre m season and from 0 81 to 3 12 in the post m season in pratapgarh while in mirzapur it ranged from 0 17 to 2 78 in the pre m and from 0 92 to 3 33 in the post m season 21 out of 25 samples from pre m and 23 from the post m season in pratapgarh while all the samples in pre m and 24 in post m in mirzapur fell into the excellent to good water quality category 3 6 9 langelier saturation index lsi the lsi was calculated by the formula given in equation 10 lsi is widely used to indicate the corrosive and scale forming nature of water abbasnia et al 2019 in this study the lsi values were observed between 0 06 and 0 9 in pratapgarh in the pre m season while in the post m season it varied from 1 5 to 0 74 it was observed that 92 of the samples in pratapgarh were non corrosive while only 8 were corrosive in the pre m season in the post m season 52 of the samples were corrosive 36 were slightly corrosive 8 were non corrosive and 4 were seriously corrosive in mirzapur the lsi values ranged between 0 27 and 0 73 in the pre m season and 52 of samples were corrosive 40 were slightly corrosive and 8 were non corrosive whereas in the post m season it ranged from 1 to 0 14 where 725 samples were slightly corrosive 20 showed serious corrosion and 8 were corrosive 3 7 10 ryznar stability index rsi the rsi was calculated by the formula given in equation 11 the rsi indicates the suitability of water for industrial purposes the rsi range from 4 to 5 indicates the heavy scaling property 5 6 signifies light scaling 6 7 indicates little scaling or corrosion 7 7 5 indicates significant corrosion 7 5 9 indicates heavy corrosion and 9 indicates corrosion intolerance haritash et al 2016 the study showed rsi values between 5 4 and 8 in the pre m season of pratapgarh where 52 of samples were corrosive 24 showed significant corrosion 16 showed light scaling and 8 showed heavy corrosion in the post m season 76 showed heavy corrosion 16 showed significant corrosion 4 showed corrosion and 4 showed intolerable corrosion in the pre m season of mirzapur rsi values ranged from 7 1 to 8 6 where 88 of samples showed heavy corrosion and 12 showed significant corrosion in the post m season the values varied between 7 5 and 9 2 where 92 showed heavy corrosion 4 showed substantial corrosion and 4 showed intolerable corrosion 4 conclusion this study assessed the physicochemical parameters in the groundwater samples of the mid gangetic plain pratapgarh and mirzapur districts of uttar pradesh the physicochemical analysis shows that the ec tds nh4 and po4 3 exceeded the permissible limits indicating the groundwater quality deterioration in the study area the seasonal variation shows that ec tds th alkalinity na ca2 and mg2 showed higher concentrations in the post m season while others showed higher concentrations in the pre m season indicating the active local groundwater recharge processes in the aquifer system the hydrochemical analysis showed that hco3 and so4 2 are the major anions and ca2 and mg2 were the major cations observed in the study area the wqi results indicate the level of pollution suggested that the water quality was unsuitable in both the districts in pre m while during post m water quality improved but still ranged from poor to unsuitable category however the water was still suitable for irrigational purposes as most of the parameters were found suitable in the study the industrial suitability indices lsi and rsi also indicated that the samples showed significant heavy corrosion at most sites that can corrode metals thus making them unsuitable for industrial usage the dissolution of carbonate minerals through rock water interaction and the reverse ion exchange are the major processes that govern groundwater chemistry in the study area however little influence of anthropogenic activities is also observed the present comprehensive suggests that proper management and regulation of agricultural inputs domestic sewage and industrial waste is the need of the hour as proper treatment and disposal also there needs to be the implementation of more treatment facilities to meet the growing population s demand disposing of more waste ultimately contaminating the groundwater resources there is a need to study the river water groundwater interaction in the mid gangetic plain through the pilot scale study and modeling to predict the future scenario for better management of water resources in

11645,the over exploitation of groundwater resources in the agriculture intensive middle gangetic plains is leading to the depletion of the water table and deterioration of its quality a total of 100 groundwater samples were collected from the mid gangetic plain specifically from the mirzapur and pratapgarh districts of uttar pradesh during two seasons pre monsoon pre m and post monsoon post m various indices and multivariate statistical analysis were employed to assess groundwater chemistry and suitability for different purposes including the water quality index wqi sodium adsorption ratio sar soluble sodium percentage ssp residual sodium carbonate rsc and permeability index pi the findings revealed that hco3 nh4 and po4 3 exceeded permissible limits while hardness so4 2 cl and so4 2 remained within acceptable ranges analysis of variance anova indicated significant variations p 0 05 in ph electrical conductivity total dissolved solids no3 ca2 dissolved silica nh4 hco3 no3 and po4 3 groundwater chemistry in the area is influenced by weathering and evaporation processes in terms of drinking water quality all analysed samples were found to be poor during the pre monsoon season with 68 of samples in pratapgarh and 56 in mirzapur showing poor quality during the post monsoon season sar ssp rsc and na values indicated water suitability for irrigation with magnesium hazard mh and permeability index pi values suggesting unsuitability for irrigation purposes industrial indices such as langelier saturation index lsi indicated slightly to non corrosive water while ryznar stability index rsi indicated light to heavy and intolerable corrosiveness of groundwater in both districts consequently the groundwater in the area was deemed unfit for drinking without treatment but suitable for irrigation while pratapgarh s groundwater could be used for industrial purposes groundwater quality in mirzapur would require treatment the findings of this study can aid local stakeholders government agencies and water resources managers in the sustainable management of groundwater resources in the study area graphical abstract image 1 keywords groundwater uttar pradesh

industrial and domestic about 20 of the groundwater on earth is contained in igneous and metamorphic rocks while the rest is in sedimentary rocks kumar et al 2020 it is the fundamental resource of the most rural population with 65 of agricultural land irrigated by groundwater globally madhav et al 2018 nearly 1500 million people around the globe rely upon groundwater for their needs either directly or indirectly it is interesting to note that around 80 of the rural population and 50 of the urban population in the country depend on groundwater while 56 of indians in rural areas receive drinking water via tube wells while open wells and supplied water system contributes 14 and 25 respectively kumar et al 2017 also it is essential to note that the population of india consists of 17 of the total global population but it has only 4 of the total freshwater resources world bank report escalating water demand has compelled both the public and government to develop a network of groundwater sources utilising handpumps and borewells to meet the increasing need for safe water for potable irrigation and other domestic uses kumar et al 2018 bhagat et al 2021 excessive exploitation of groundwater has resulted in the depletion of groundwater levels gwl and deterioration of groundwater quality rendering it vulnerable to contaminants that can cause various waterborne diseases and fatalities singh and singh 2018 bhagat et al 2021 the rise in urbanisation has also impacted groundwater quality through dense localities and their maltreatment of waste wakode et al 2018 ahmed et al 2021 the problem is further aggravated by the unplanned and unscientific development of groundwater resources leading to the decline and desaturation of aquifers saba et al 2018 the quality of groundwater in a particular location is determined by a range of physicochemical factors influenced by the area s geological characteristics and human activities and interventions the fundamental aspects directly affecting the groundwater quality of an area include spatial and temporal variations in hydrochemical parameters along with the rate of groundwater withdrawal precipitation rate geological properties of the aquifer or basin climatic conditions and rock water interaction processes such as oxidation reduction ion exchange desorption dissolution and precipitation khan and jhariya 2018 madhav et al 2021 apart from this the minerals and rocks surrounding the water bodies also significantly affect the hydrogeochemical properties and hence the aquifer s water quality for example carbonate and feldspar comprise the two most common minerals in the crust and therefore play a significant role in regulating groundwater chemistry raju and singh 2017 the indo gangetic plain accounts for 25 of global groundwater extraction and is one of earth s most important water systems kumar et al 2021 millions rely on the middle gangetic plain s rice wheat agricultural for their livelihood people use groundwater because of its fascinating characteristics like its huge storage volume the fact that it can be extracted based on need the fact that it poses a lower risk than surface water sources the fertile area of the middle gangetic plain is an agriculture intensive area with a dense population the extensive groundwater use in this region has deteriorated its quality through excessive fertilisers and pesticide usage in agriculture untreated sewage and the mixing of untreated municipal and industrial effluents therefore it is crucial to understand water s suitability for various purposes gautam et al 2021 the soil salinity and sodicity impact the water quality used for irrigation and domestic purposes the excess concentration of ions may hinder water movement in plants thereby affecting their metabolism therefore different indices like rsc residual sodium carbonate electrical conductivity ec sodium adsorption ratio sar and na sodium percentage are used to investigate the groundwater quality in the study area zakaria et al 2021 these help estimate fertility demands irrigation requirements and performance and crop yield shukla and saxena 2020 such anomalies in groundwater in the present scenario inspired this study to assess the mid gangetic plains groundwater chemistry and suitability analysis for drinking irrigational and industrial use this study would provide a comprehensive and wholesome study taking into account the suitability of groundwater for drinking irrigation as well as industrial purpose this might prove highly significant as it will give a complete picture of the groundwater quality in the agriculture intensive and densely populated mid gangetic plains which somehow lacks such comprehensive study in recent times the main objectives of the study include a seasonal shift in groundwater quality of two districts of mid gangetic plain pratapgarh and mirzapur b identification of factors governing the groundwater chemistry by using multivariate analysis and hydrogeochemical facies c determining the water suitability for irrigation and industrial purposes through several irrigational water quality indices including sodium adsorption ratio sar permeability index pi soluble sodium percentage ssp sodium percentage na residual sodium carbonate rsc and magnesium hazard mh along with industrial suitability indices such as lsi and rsi this study will help to fill the knowledge gaps in understanding the chemistry and status of groundwater in this region and the factors affecting it and could be helpful for policymakers local stakeholders and the government to formulate rules and regulations according to the present status of the groundwater in the study area this study also marks its significance as pratapgarh and mirzapur are located along the fertile banks of the sai and ganga rivers respectively and hence are heavily populated the increasing population and urbanisation demand for more exploitation of groundwater to fulfil the needs of the masses this exploitation has in turn severely affected the groundwater quality of the region which can be assessed by wqi and suitability indices and which has not been done recently in this region 2 material and method 2 1 study area the gangetic plains of uttar pradesh are made up of river sediments mainly from the himalayas and to a lesser extent from peninsular india the alluvial plains of ganga plain in uttar pradesh consist of the most productive soils and aquifers leading to the exploitative use of these resources for residential and irrigational needs the more recent alluvial soil is rich in calcium and nitrogen pre cambrian rocks including granite gneisses mica schist quartzite and their related rocks as well as cracks fissures and other weak structural planes predominantly restrict groundwater circulation in such aquifers the results of the exploratory drilling indicate good potential for groundwater development up to 100 m below the surface the sandy horizon of the semi unconfined aquifer gradually increases in the direction of the east kumar et al 2019 the aquifer in this region ranges from unconfined to semi confined and confined types ansari and umar 2019 the study region consists of two cities in uttar pradesh viz mirzapur and pratapgarh mirzapur has a population of 25 lakhs approximately and is divided into three zones the pleistocene the holocene and the holocene to recent active channels and floodplains the interfluve of older alluvium is found in most parts of the gangetic plains yellow brown sediments characterise the pleistocene surfaces while the holocene are generally grey to black coloured and rich in organic content shah 2015 the weather in mirzapur is primarily dry sub tropical to dry with minimal humidity and temperature extremes in both the summer and winter the highest summer temperatures can reach 48 c and the lowest winter temperatures in december and january can reach 4 c on average mirzapur receives 1059 mm of rain each year 90 of which falls during the southwest monsoon the majority 75 of the average annual rainfall falls between july and september however this distribution is very irregular and unpredictable occasionally leading to drought spells of various intensities and lengths srivastava et al 2020 pratapgarh with a population of 3 033 899 lies in a semi arid to arid climatic zone with cold winters and hot summers the average precipitation amounts to about 1000 mm with maximum rainfall from june to september the quaternary alluvium deposits cover the whole district mainly consisting of sand clay sand clay and kankar the older alluvium occupies most areas away from the floodplains whereas the floodplains along the course of rivers are covered with newer alluvium kumar et al 2020 2 2 sample collection and analysis tools use twenty five groundwater samples were taken from each district pratapgarh and mirzapur during the pre m and post m seasons the map showing the sampling sites is given in fig 1 the polyethene bottles 500 ml were washed 2 3 times with water before sampling to collect groundwater samples physicochemical parameters were analysed as per the apha standard protocols using ar grade reagents apha 2005 ph ec tds and temperature were analysed on site using a labtronics soil and water analysis kit hco3 was estimated with hcl using the potentiometric method whereas hardness was determined using edta complexometric titration the analysis of cl was done by argentometric titration while no3 so4

plots were plotted using grapher software the interpolation maps were made using arcmap 10 8 software the various suitability indices were calculated using the formulae given below 2 2 1 water quality index wqi the wqi uses mathematics to combine test data to produce a single value that is easily expressable and easily understood the index considers a range of physical chemical and biological parameters to determine the overall health of the water body wqis are often used in water management and conservation efforts to identify areas that require attention and to track changes in water quality over time chandra et al 2017 however the wqi value in this study is calculated based on the physicochemical parameters analysed and the effect of heavy metals and microbiological parameters on water quality was not considered 1 w q i σ w n q n σ w n where wn unit weight for nth parameter qn quality rating for nth parameter 2 2 2 sodium adsorption ratio sar it is a measurement that reflects

irrigation the concentration of highly soluble salts raises the salinity of the soil because low solubility salts precipitate and accumulate in the soil with frequent irrigation chaudhary and

in the studied area however the average ph values of the areas pratpgarh and mirzapur districts falls within the permissible limits suggested by who i e 6 5 8 5 table 1 in both seasons tiwari and singh 2014 observed similar results while investigating the hydrogeochemical characteristics of groundwater in pratapgarh these values agree with the study of singh et al 2012 in ghaziabad where ph values were under the permissible limits however ec and tds exceeded the permissible limits given by bis indicating the deterioration of groundwater quality in the study area high tds levels indicated the existence of significant amounts of bicarbonates sulphates and ca mg and na and ultimately increases the ec as well the ec ranged from 670 to 2459 mg l 1 in pratapgarh and from 494 to 1280 mg l 1 in mirzapur water with a total hardness 80 mg l 1 is considered unsuitable for domestic use as it coagulates soap lather rajankar et al 2011 the high values of hardness indicate the limestone formations in the study area the value of hardness ranged from 74 to 3340 mg l 1 in pratapgarh and from 72 to 310 mg l 1 in mirzapur all the samples in this study exceed 80 mg l 1 in both the districts in the pre m and post m except one in pratapgarh sample 11 and one in mirzapur sample 22 in the post m season as shown in fig 1 these results were comparable with ahamad et al 2018 findings for a neighbouring district varanasi where the mean hardness was reported to be 345 mg l 1 the major source of cations in groundwater includes weathering and leaching of minerals reductive dissolution ion exchange processes along with anthropogenic activities in pratapgarh among cations na ranged between 23 mg l 1 to 98 mg l 1 in pratapgarh and from 14 to 58 mg l 1 in mirzapur as shown in table 1 along with having a detrimental effect on human health sodium content is crucial in determining the suitability of groundwater for irrigation increases in salt content lead to an increase in soil hardness which lowers the permeability of the soil it is likely that weathering of silicate rocks and ion exchange with clay are responsible for the significantly greater concentration of na in the groundwater of the study area potassium k ranged from 1 to 10 mg l 1 in pratapgarh and from 1 to 8 mg l 1 in mirzapur ca2 concentration varied from 16 to 220 mg l 1 in pratapgarh while it showed much lower concentration in mirzapur ranging from 13 to 53 mg l 1 table 1 the values of sodium and potassium were within the permissible limits of who while calcium exceeded the permissible limit indicating influence of geogenic activities mg2 was found in relatively higher concentrations in the pratapgarh varying from 8 to 83 mg l 1 while it was 7 63 mg l 1 in mirzapur table 1 the magnesium concentration also fell within the permissible limits of cpcb the highest seasonal variation in concentration was observed for ca2 averaging 71 mg l 1 in the pre m season and 36 mg l 1 in the post m season in pratapgarh table 1 such a high concentration of cations indicates the influence of rock water interaction with weathering and erosion that also affect the wqi of the study area the value of bicarbonate ranged from 226 to 628 mg l 1 in pratapgrah and from 145 to 497 41 mg l 1 the values of bicarbonate fell within the permissible limits in a freshwater body hco3 is the most abundant anion the atmospheric co2 when it dissolves in water to generate carbonic acid is a source of hco3 ions in groundwater carbonic acid reacts with limestone containing minerals such as albite and causes a partial or complete breakdown of organic materials causing the hco3 ion concentration in groundwater bodies to rise singh et al 2013 the range of chloride varied from 21 to 199 mg l 1 in pratapgarh and from 2 to 97 97 mg l 1 in mirzapur the range fell within permissible limits of who the range of sulphate varied from 8 2 to 214 mg l 1 in pratapgarh and from 6 16 to 55 64 mg l 1 in mirzapur all the samples were within the range of permissible limit the range of nitrate varied from 2 15 to 61 32 mg l 1 in pratapgarh and from 4 16 to 21 28 mg l 1 in mirzapur all the samples were within the range of permissible limit the range of phosphate varied from 1 08 to 3 61 mg l 1 in pratapgarh and from 0 18 to 2 79 mg l 1 in mirzapur anthropogenic factors that could contribute to the study area s excess chloride include domestic and industrial waste agricultural runoff and the leaching of saline residues in the water whereas the increased nitrate concentration in the study area may also be related to surface water pollution at some wells from inadequate well wall sealing sethy et al 2016 these readings agreed with those of chauhan et al 2009 who studied groundwater geochemistry in ballia uttar pradesh where nitrate and phosphate were found in higher concentrations due to the addition of fertilisers and the decomposition of organic matter 3 2 seasonal shift in groundwater quality the seasonal variation of various hydrochemical parameters in the pre m and post m seasons in the mirzapur and pratapgarh districts is shown in fig 2 a and b and 2 c and d the results of anova are presented in supplementary table 1 it can be observed that parameters like temperature ec tds th alkalinity na ca2 mg2 hco3 so4 2 no3 and po4 3 showed higher concentrations in the post m season fig 2 a and b the results of anova analysis of variance suggest that ph temperature ec tds na k ca2 mg2 h4sio4 nh4 hco3 no3 and po4 3 showed significant seasonal variation p 0 05 while alkalinity hardness so4 2 and cl did not show significant seasonal variation p 0 05 in the groundwater samples of mirzapur the analysis of groundwater samples of pratapgarh showed variation with temperature ec tds th alkalinity dissolved silica na ca and mg2 showing higher values in the post m season as compared with other parameters including ph nh4 k hco3 so4 2 cl no3 and po4 3 that were observed in higher concentrations in the pre m season fig 2 c and d the statistical analysis anova result indicated that ph temperature ec tds k ca2 h4sio4 nh4 hco3 so4 2 cl no3 and po4 3 showed significant seasonal variation p 0 05 whereas alkalinity hardness na and mg2 did not show significant seasonal variation p 0 05 in pratapgarh ph showed higher values in the pre m as compared to the post m season which may be due to the dilution of groundwater through the feeding nature of the river ganga in the area the low values in the post m season imply that h in groundwater may come from rainwater s acidity along with the release of absorbed h3o from clay layers and the dissociation of h2co3 the dissolution of co2 from the atmosphere may result in the formation of h2co3 in the groundwater zhou et al 2015 consuming water with a high ec can cause gastrointestinal problems therefore it is essential that the ec which depends on the interaction of the rock and water and therefore the residence duration of the water in the rock be within allowable limits anthropogenic activities predominant in this area explain a higher ec brindha et al 2014 the values of ec showed higher values in the pre m in both districts relative to the post m season which may be due to the dilution of soluble salts because of rainfall and subsequent recharge laluraj and gopinath 2006 the high values of ec during the pre m season indicate high salinity and tds concentration as observed by shukla and saxena 2020 while assessing groundwater quality and related health effects in raebareli district uttar pradesh the tds was observed in higher concentrations in the pre m in pratapgarh and the post m in mirzapur while alkalinity hardness and dissolved silica were higher in the post m season in both districts 28 of the samples in pratapgarh in the pre m season exceeded the bis limit for a total hardness of 300 mg l 1 such water results in the encrustation of water supply and distribution pipes in mirzapur all the cations viz na k ca2 and mg2 were in higher concentration in the post m than in the pre m season table 1 low ca2 versus na ratios in groundwater samples show the absence of easily soluble calcium minerals and sodium has replaced calcium in the samples groundwater due to a base exchange reaction thus the cations k and ca2 were observed in higher amounts in the pre m season in pratapgarh while na and mg2 were higher in the post m season significant changes in sulphate content occur throughout time due to groundwater recharge and rainfall infiltration whereas nitrate and phosphate are mainly contributed from domestic and agricultural sources singh et al 2012 among anions all the anions including hco3 so4 2 cl and no3 were at higher concentrations in the pre m season whereas po4 3 was found in higher concentrations in the post m season table 1 given the agricultural activities prevalent in the study area the most significant variation was observed in no3 concentration averaging 35 39 mg l 1 in the pre m and 14 28 mg l 1 in the post m season in pratapgarh table 1 this indicates that the samples of the pre m season are mainly affected by mineral dissolution or the ion exchange processes sharma et al 2017 the higher concentration of these anions indicates intensive agricultural practices inappropriate industrial discharge waste dumping and erosion and weathering of rocks bicarbonate was the predominant anion in both districts compared to other hydrochemical parameters the main source of hco3 in the groundwater is weathering of carbonate and or alumino silicate minerals with a secondary contribution coming from dissolving co2 gases the average concentration of bicarbonate decreased in the post m season in pratapgrah but increased in mirzapur due to the relatively high precipitation in pratapgarh that recharged the groundwater and diluted the concentration of bicarbonate tiwari and singh 2014 the significant variation in chloride concentration may be observed due to the local recharge and leaching of salt and saline residues in the soil as well as municipal domestic and animal wastes from the surrounding areas sulphate typically appears as calcium magnesium and sodium soluble salts in groundwater the hydrogeological characteristics of the region precipitation and cultural practices particularly fertilisation and irrigation all contribute to variations in the concentration of cations melo et al 2012 3 3 statistical analysis 3 3 1 correlation analysis the correlation coefficient measures the interdependence of two or more random variables by determining the closeness and degree of linear relation among dependent and independent variables the correlation was studied among 17 parameters and correlation matrix as shown in table 2 a d in the pratapgarh district ec was strongly correlated with tds alkalinity hardness ca2 hco3 so4 2 and cl for the pre m season samples a strong correlation of so4 2 was also observed with hco3 and cl indicating that a common geological or anthropogenic process influences the water source for example in some geological formations the dissolution of certain minerals such as gypsum or anhydrite can lead to the release of both sulphate and chloride ions in contrast the weathering of rocks rich in carbonate minerals can release bicarbonate ions in the context of human activities the use of certain types of fertilisers or industrial processes can also lead to elevated levels of so4 2 hco3 and cl in water sources in the post m season in pratapgarh tds was strongly correlated with ph and ec while hardness was correlated with so4 2 and hco3 was correlated with po4 3 the high correlation between tds and ec in both periods indicates that conductivity is dependent upon tds and that the main components of tds in water are these ionic species a similar relationship between tds and hardness and between ec and so4 2 was found by gajendran et al 2013 while correlating the parameters in the study of groundwater in tamil nadu a strong correlation was observed between ec and tds mg2 and hco3 in the mirzapur district for the pre m season alkalinity was correlated with hardness and mg2 indicating the role of weathering in affecting the groundwater chemistry of mirzapur in the post m season ec was strongly correlated with tds hardness mg2 and hco3 whereas hardness was strongly correlated with mg2 indicating the weathering process s dominance in the mirzapur groundwater 3 3 2 factor analysis r mode factor analysis performs to understand the factors affecting the groundwater chemistry of the study area the dendrogram for pre m and post m periods in mirzapur and pratapgarh districts is given in fig 3 a and b the dendrogram for pratapgarh in pre m showed two clusters fig 3 a with all the major cations and anions in the first cluster and tds and bicarbonate in the second cluster while in the post m season 3 clusters were observed with the major cations and anions in the first cluster bicarbonate and alkalinity in the second and ec and tds in the third cluster fig 3b in mirzapur both the pre m fig 3 c and post m fig 3 d seasons showed two clusters each with major cations and anions in the first cluster and bicarbonate and tds in the second cluster the results obtained by factor analysis of groundwater samples in pre and post m seasons are given in supplementary table 2 a for pratapgarh and table 2 b for mirzapur five factors were obtained in the pre m season explaining 82 96 of the variability in groundwater data in pratapgarh factor 1 accounted for 26 62 variance and showed positive loading for tds ec no3 so4 2 indicating addition from chemical weathering and organic matter production along with its mineralisation factor 2 explained a 22 39 variation with positive loading for alkalinity hardness and hco3 indicating the dissolution of rocks factor 3 accounted for 15 82 variability and showed positive loading for na k and h4sio4 signifying the weathering process factor 4 explains 9 46 variability with positive loading for po4 3 indicating contribution from various point and non point sources factor 5 explains 8 66 of the variation showing positive loading for ph and nh4 signifying the sewage mixing and municipal waste in the groundwater six factors were obtained in the post m season explaining 77 81 of the variability in the groundwater data in pratapgarh factor 1 explains 26 62 showing positive loading for ec and tds indicating the dominance of chemical weathering in influencing groundwater chemistry factor 2 explained a 17 28 variation with positive loading for hardness so4 2 and po4 3 that indicates leaching from surface soils factor 3 explains 12 20 variability showing positive loading for cl that suggests dissolution from minerals factor 4 explains 10 71 variability with positive loading for hco3 and no3 suggesting addition from natural and anthropogenic sources factor 5 explains 10 22 of the variation showing positive loading for alkalinity and ca2 indicating the role of rock weathering in influencing the chemistry of groundwater in pratapgarh factor 6 explains a 9 19 variation with positive loadings for ph and dissolved silica indicating rock dissolution six factors were obtained in mirzapur s pre m season explaining 82 64 of the variability factor 1 explains 31 47 in the pre m season showing positive loading for ec tds alkalinity hardness and hco3 indicating chemical weathering factor 2 explained a 14 06 variation with positive loading for dissolved silica nh4 and cl suggesting the contribution of municipal waste and the dissolution of aquifer rocks factor 4 and 5 showed 9 80 and 8 92 variation respectively with positive loadings for na ca2 and no3 with positive loadings for ph and temperature factor 6 explained 7 37 percent of the variation demonstrating the alkaline character of groundwater the post m season of mirzapur explained 84 74 of the variability with six factors factors 1 and 2 explain 25 87 and 17 73 of the variability with positive loadings for alkalinity hardness hco3 and nh4 and cl respectively indicating the mixing of domestic sewage and weathering process factors 3 and 4 explained 12 05 and 10 48 of the variability respectively and showed positive loading for so4 2 and na respectively indicating leaching from the surface factors 5 and 6 accounted for 9 73 and 8 88 of the variability and showed positive loadings for ca2 no3 and ph and temperature indicating the contribution from the dissolution of rocks and anthropogenic inputs 3 4 dominant mechanism and hydrochemical facies 3 4 1 gibbs diagram gibbs diagram represents the ratios of na k na k ca2 and cl cl hco3 with tds it is used to identify the process controlling the origins of dissolved chemical components such as precipitation rock weathering and evaporation crystallisation process gupta et al 2008 ahmad et al 2019 fig 4 a and b depicts the gibbs diagram for the pratapgarh and mirzapur districts fig 4 a illustrates that rock weathering through rock water interaction is the most dominant process controlling groundwater chemistry in pratapgarh with 88 of the samples showing rock dominance while 12 showing evaporation crystallisation dominance evaporation increases salinity as rising na and cl result in higher tds additionally supporting this is the positive correlation between tds na and cl values as shown in pearson s correlation matrices table 2 a d agricultural fertilisers and irrigation return flows which increase na and cl and hence tds are other anthropogenic activities that affect evaporation rock predominance suggests that the interaction between rock and subsurface percolation of water influences the composition of groundwater in the area in mirzapur all the samples were predominantly affected by rock weathering showing that the rock water interaction is the major factor influencing the chemistry of groundwater in the region fig 4 b the key processes controlling the rock water interactions depend on reactions with host rocks influenced by the flow path networks water contact time with various minerals and mixing with older waters at depth 3 4 2 piper diagram the piper diagram helps to understand the complexities linked to the geochemical development of groundwater this diagram comprises three separate fields a diamond shaped and two triangular fields magesh et al 2013 cations are represented as a single point on the left side as a percent of all cations in meq l 1 whereas anions are plotted on the right side as samples of similar quality tend to cluster together the trilinear diagram can indicate similarities and differences among groundwater samples logeshkumaran et al 2015 fig 5 a and b depicts the piper plot for the districts of pratapgarh and mirzapur both the districts dominate hco3 mg2 type of water indicating the rock water interaction through the local recharge via river feeding and precipitation is the dominant mechanism governing the hydrochemistry of the mid gangetic plain in the pratapgarg district hco3 co3 2 facies for anion and mg2 ca2 for cation dominate the piper plot at pratapgarh with the carbonate hardness of the majority of samples over 50 fig 5 a similarly the piper plot for mirzapur fig 5 b reveals that hco3 co3 2 facies are predominant with most samples exceeding 50 carbonate hardness however among the cations the pre m and post m seasons exhibited either a magnesium type dominance or no dominating type fig 5 b according to the findings alkaline earth ca2 mg2 and weak acids predominated over alkalis na k and strong acids cl so4 2 janardhana raju et al 2009 this may be due to the water interacting with aquifer rocks complex processes like natural and anthropogenic govern the groundwater hydrochemistry in the study area 3 4 3 durov plot the durov diagram is widely used to observe groundwater samples hydrochemical characteristics and types li et al 2016 the durov diagram depicts the relative concentrations of significant ions on two trilinear plots and a center square plot onto which the points are projected from the two trilinear plots liu et al 2019 the durov diagram is presented in supplementary figure 1 the plot shows that the ca2 and mg2 were the most abundant cations and hco3 and so4 2 were dominant anions in pratapgarh and mirzapur however there may be high levels of calcium naturally sodium and magnesium ions predominate because of their dissolution from contaminated rocks and soils so4 2 in the study area is contributed by weathering of rocks like pyrite fes2 and gypsum caso4 2h2o which are the major source of sulphate in water the result indicates that the dissolution of carbonate minerals in the subsurface region and evaporation is the major controlling factors of groundwater chemistry important geochemical processes such as cation exchange reactions regulate groundwater ions abundance and distribution 3 4 4 bi variate plot the cross plots for pre m and post m periods in mirzapur and pratapgarh districts is given in fig 6 1 and 6 2 the interaction between na and cl ions can be used to determine the cation exchange process cation exchange reactions are evident by a high concentration of na relative to cl or a depletion of na relative to cl sethy et al 2016 the scatter plot of na vs cl showed that most samples in pratapgarh are near or above the 1 1 equiline on the cl versus na plot indicating that the region is characterised by a depletion of na relative to cl which concludes the predominance of ion exchange reactions fig 6 1 a however in mirzapur a clear distinction between pre and post m samples was evident with pre m samples above the 1 1 line and post m samples below the line fig 6 2 a na released during the silicate weathering process is indicated by the na cl vs ec plot showing a declining trend with increasing ec and a higher na cl ratio fig 6 1 b and 6 2 b this is also confirmed by higher hco3 levels in groundwater contributed by the reaction of feldspar minerals with carbonic acid which may be one of the causes of the increase in ec most post m samples exhibit lower na cl ratios than pre m samples suggesting that silicate weathering replaces halite dissolution as the primary mechanism during the post m season tamma rao et al 2013 the dominance of hco3 over cl so4 2 and the strong correlation of hco3 with ca and mg are indicative of the dissolution of carbonate minerals as the main source of ca2 mg2 and hco3 ions in the groundwater of the study area fig 6 1 c and 6 2 c giri et al 2021 the scatter plot between na and ca2 mg2 indicates ion exchange as the major process in the area along with a few samples undergoing reverse ion exchange fig 6 1 d and 6 2 d the scatter plot of the concentrations of ca2 mg2 and hco3 so4 2 is a measure of the origin of groundwater ionic concentration mineral dissolution such as that of calcite dolomite and gypsum is prevalent in groundwater samples that are close to the 1 1 line fig 6 1 e and 6 2 e because there is a significant excess of hco3 so4 2 samples that are plotted to the right of the 1 1 line indicate that ion exchange is the dominant process all of the study s samples are below the 1 1 line reiterating the importance of weathering and ion exchange processes sethy et al 2016 the high ca2 mg2 hco3 ratio suggested that more ca2 and mg2 were supplied to the groundwater compared to hco3 fig 6 1 f and 6 2 f all samples are above the 1 1 equiline in the scattering diagram of ca2 mg2 vs hco3 with excess ca2 and mg2 indicating that silicate weathering is more prevalent than carbonate weathering vasu et al 2017 3 4 5 chloro alkaline indices cai cai is widely used to interpret the process of ion exchange occurring between different interfaces the positive or negative cai i and cai ii values depend on the exchange of na and k present in water with mg2 and ca2 present in soil or rock or vice versa positive values represent the exchange of na and k present in water with mg2 and ca2 while a negative value indicates the exchange of mg2 and ca2 present in water with na and k present in rock or soil gaur et al 2022 this study shows cai i and cai ii values of both the districts to be negative in the pre m and post m seasons the average cai i of pratapgarh was 0 30 and 0 81 whereas the average cai ii value was 0 01 and 0 09 in the pre m and post m seasons respectively in mirzapur the average cai i value was 1 50 and 0 62 whereas the average cai ii value was 0 02 and 0 07 in the pre m and post m seasons respectively the negative values in both the seasons in both districts represent reverse ion exchange showing the exchange of mg2 and ca2 is taking place from water with na and k present in rock or soil 3 5 water quality index wqi the wqi was calculated by the formula given in equation 1 wqi of the groundwater samples at each site is given in supplementary tables in table 3 wqi indicates water quality status by undertaking various parameters that show the quality of the water however this study inculcates physicochemical parameters cations anions and nutrients for the analysis of wqi it can be observed that 25 out of 50 samples in pratapgarh fell in the category of poor quality 19 belonged to the class of very poor quality 4 were in unfit category while only 2 samples belonged to good water quality in mirzapur 25 out of 50 samples were in the poor category and 25 belonged to good water quality wqi ranged from a minimum of 86 334 in pratapgarh and from 67 to 169 in mirzapur in the pre m season the major parameters contributing to such high values of wqi include hardness bicarbonate and po4 3 which were found at concentrations exceeding the permissible limits at most sites the pre m season showed slightly better conditions while the conditions were much worse in the post m season in pratapgarh but no significant difference was observed in the samples of mirzapur this could be caused by effective ion leaching excessive groundwater use direct effluent discharge impact of agriculture and dissolution of rocks the main cause of the poor water quality in the study area includes rock water interaction domestic sewage septic tanks low rainfall and evaporation caused by arid weather as suggested by the high values of ec cl and na followed by ca2 different activities such as effluent produced from industries infiltration of wastewater fertilisers from agriculture and leakage from septic tanks also contribute to the overall poor groundwater quality ahmad et al 2019 wqi data obtained in this study were compared with other studies undertaken in the neighbouring districts to understand the water quality scenario in the gangetic plain a similar study by tiwari et al 2018 assessing the groundwater quality of the mirzapur district using wqi and gis techniques revealed that the wqi of the region varied from 52 to 345 with an average of 115 indicating poor quality of groundwater ahmad et al 2019 studied the groundwater quality of mathura and reported poor quality of groundwater in the region because of low rainfall and arid weather along with industrial agricultural and domestic effluents that lead to high concentrations of tds sodium and chloride ions thus the groundwater quality in the study area varied from good to unsuitable for drinking according to a study by chaurasia et al 2018 20 of groundwater samples in varanasi uttar pradesh were deemed unfit while the rest samples were in the good to moderate poor and extremely poor categories shukla and saxena 2016 reported poor water quality for more than 50 of the collected groundwater samples in raebareli district uttar pradesh based on wqi value 3 6 water suitability assessment using different indices 3 6 1 sodium adsorption ratio sar the sar was calculated by the formula given in equation 2 the summary of water suitability indices in the pratapgarh and mirzapur districts is given in table 3 sar represents the sodium irrigation suitability of water sodium rich groundwater is not suitable for irrigation because it reduces soil permeability and water infiltration sar values between 0 and 10 are considered optimal 10 to 18 as adequate and greater than 18 as undesirable singh et al 2020 all the samples had sar values in the 0 to 10 range i e the optimal range in this study the pratapgarh sar values were found between 0 06 and 2 12 in the pre m season and between 0 57 and 4 22 in the post m season in mirzapur the sar values ranged from 0 44 to 1 70 in the pre m season and from 0 51 to 1 11 in the post m season the sar values show that the groundwater in both regions is suitable for irrigation fig 7 depicts the richards diagram for the districts of pratapgarh and mirzapur all the samples in pratapgarh show low na alkaline and high salinity hazards except one with medium and very high salinity hazards in both the pre m and post m seasons in the mirzapur district all the samples showed low na alkaline hazard with high salinity hazard in both seasons except five samples with medium salinity hazard in the pre m season the low alkali hazard indicates low hazard for crops but higher sar values can cause permeability issues hindering crop growth similar optimal sar results were found by janardhana raju et al 2009 and singh et al 2012 while examining the groundwater quality in the uttar pradesh districts of ghazipur and varanasi respectively 3 6 2 magnesium hazard mh the mh was calculated by the formula given in equation 3 the high concentration of mg2 ion may reduce crop output by increasing soil ph and decreasing soil infiltration capacity when the mh value exceeds 50 the soil becomes alkaline which reduces agricultural output singh et al 2020 pre m mh values varied from 13 55 to 77 02 in pratapgarh and from 31 39 to 80 24 in mirzapur in the post m season in pratapgarh it ranged from 37 15 to 80 95 and in mirzapur it ranged from 32 40 to 74 24 it was observed that 36 of the groundwater samples in pratapgarh had mh values exceeding 50 in the pre m season while 92 of the samples exceeded 50 in the post m season in mirzapur 92 of the samples exceeded 50 in the pre m season and 96 of the samples exceeded 50 in the post m season indicating serious hazards due to mg2 thus it is obvious that there is a possibility of an mg2 hazard as the average values for both periods and districts exceed 50 rendering the groundwater unsuitable for irrigation purposes the groundwater unsuitable for irrigation purposes due to high mg levels over ca and na in the soil leading to degraded soil quality and poor agricultural returns in their study of groundwater quality and associated dangers in the raebareli district of uttar pradesh shukla and saxena 2020 also showed mg2 hazard for agriculture 3 6 3 soluble sodium percentage ssp the ssp is calculated by the formula given in equation 4 a key indicator of soil permeability is considered to be the ssp mg2 and ca2 ions are substituted for the na ions in the water this interaction impairs soil quality by causing poor drainage and soil hardening additionally high na concentrations hasten the reaction of na with carbonates and chlorides which raises the salinity and alkalinity of the soil ssp readings below 50 indicate high water quality while readings above 50 are deemed unsafe for irrigation kumar et al 2016 it was observed that all the samples of pratapgarh in the pre m season and 52 of samples in the post m season were safe for irrigation in mirzapur all the samples in the pre m season were safe but 32 of the samples in the post m season were unsafe for irrigation the ssp values range between 12 and 42 in pratapgarh with an average value of 25 while in mirzapur between 14 and 44 in the pre m season however in the post m season it ranged from 31 to 80 in pratapgarh and 34 to 65 in mirzapur thus it can be observed that the groundwater quality in the pre m season was good whereas that of the post m season was not suitable for irrigation ideally water used in agriculture should have a greater proportion of calcium and magnesium ions and a smaller amount of sodium ions the opposite is true for water used in households a considerable reduction in the permeability of agricultural soils receiving irrigation water may result from excessive concentrations of this ion the occurrence of cation exchange as the water percolates through clay rich strata is what causes the excessive levels of sodium ions in groundwater saleem et al 2016 assessed the quality of shallow aquifer water in the noida region in uttar pradesh and found that the ssp was well within the prescribed limit indicating that the water was appropriate for agricultural uses 3 6 4 residual sodium carbonate rsc the rsc was calculated by the formula given in equation 5 the suitability of groundwater is impacted by the concentration of carbonate and hco3 ions which are greater than those of ca2 and mg2 ions this excess of carbonate and hco3 is referred to as rsc higher rsc values suggest that most ca2 and some mg2 ions precipitate out of the solution increasing the amount of na in water and soil particles and subsequently the na hazard potential singh et al 2020 kumar et al 2016 it was observed that 32 of the groundwater samples in the pre m season in pratapgarh showed suitable water quality 44 showed marginal quality and 24 of the samples were of undesirable quality in the post m season in paratpgarh 56 of the groundwater samples in the pre m season in pratapgarh showed water 36 showed somewhat suitable quality while 8 of the samples were of undesirable quality in mirzapur 32 of the groundwater samples in the pre m season in pratapgarh showed suitable water quality 48 showed marginal quality and 24 were of undesirable quality in the pre m season in the post m season in paratpgarh 52 of the groundwater samples in the pre m season in pratapgarh showed suitable water 44 showed marginal quality and 4 of the samples were of undesirable quality the poor irrigation water quality contributes to the poor agricultural returns in the region in the pre m season this study found rsc values ranging from 3 93 to 3 43 meq l 1 in pratapgrah and from 0 59 to 4 40 meq l 1 in mirzapur similarly during the post m season it ranged from 0 47 to 4 17 meq l 1 in pratapgarh and from 1 01 to 2 93 meq l 1 in mirzapur singh et al 2015 obtained comparable results with marginally appropriate groundwater quality while researching the irrigational suitability of groundwater in the chandauli region of uttar pradesh 3 6 5 permeability index pi the pi was calculated by the formula given in equation 6 extensive and prolonged usage of irrigation water affects the soil s permeability it depends on various characteristics such as the water s contents of total soluble salts ca2 mg2 na and hco3 based on pi water quality can be scategorised into three categories classes i 75 and ii 25 75 imply good irrigation water quality and class iii water 25 is not suitable for irrigation singh et al 2020 all the samples in this study belonged to the class i category in the pre m season the average pi values for pratapgarh and mirzapur were 227 and 187 respectively in the post m season they were 237 and 215 suggesting good water quality similarly madhav et al 2018 found that most samples in the bhadohi district of uttar pradesh belonged to classes 1 and 2 and were suitable for irrigational use 3 6 6 sodium percentage na the na was calculated by the formula given in equation 7 the amount of salt is a crucial indicator of the sodium risk in water when the concentration of na in water is high it tends to replace the mg2 and ca2 ions in the soil the soil permeability is reduced due to this exchange process which ultimately hinders air and water flow therefore irrigation water with a high na may degrade the soil structure decrease its aeration and decrease its permeability negatively affecting crop growth chen et al 2019 ramesh and elango 2012 it was observed that 32 of the groundwater samples of pratapgarh in the pre m season showed excellent quality 64 showed good quality and 4 showed permissible quality in the post m season 16 showed excellent quality 72 showed good quality 8 showed permissible quality and 4 showed doubtful quality in mirzapur 12 of the groundwater samples in the pre m season showed excellent quality 68 good quality and 20 permissible quality in the post m season 4 showed excellent quality and 96 showed good quality this study shows the values of na between 10 63 to 41 15 and 13 89 to 69 14 respectively in the pre m and post m seasons of pratapgarh the na of mirzapur varied from 13 48 to 43 17 in the pre m and from 15 79 to 38 10 in the post m season it can be inferred from the results that the majority of the groundwater samples from both seasons belong to the excellent to the permissible category however one sample from pratapgarh in the post m season falls into the doubtful category fig 8 depicts the wilcox diagram for the present study of the districts of pratapgarh and mirzapur during both seasons most samples collected in pratapgarh fell within the range of good to acceptable one sample each in the post m fall in the excellent and permissible to doubtful categories in comparison one pre m sample falls into the doubtful to the unsuitable group in mirzapur most samples fall within the acceptable to good range while some fall in the excellent category 3 6 7 kelly s index the kelly s index was calculated by the formula given in equation 8 the na problem in irrigation water can be determined based on the values of kelly s index ki above 1 indicates excessive na hence the water is considered unsuitable for irrigation while that of 1 suggests that the water is suitable for irrigation bouderbala 2017 the ki values in this study ranged from 0 12 to 0 70 in the pre m season and from 0 16 to 2 27 in the post m season in pratapgarh in mirzapur it ranged from 1 29 to 6 37 in the pre m season and from 1 59 to 5 29 in the post m season all the samples of mirzapur were found unsuitable in contrast all the samples in pratapgarh except one in the post m season were suitable for irrigation purposes 3 6 8 potential salinity ps the ps was calculated by the formula given in equation 9 ps scategorises water as suitable or unsuitable for agricultural purposes based on the salinity as highly soluble salts directly affect the soil salinity chaudhary and satheeshkumar 2018 ps values of less than 3 indicate excellent to good water quality values of 3 5 indicate good to injurious quality and a value of more than 5 indicates injurious to the unsatisfactory condition of the water in this study ps values ranged from 0 89 to 7 84 in the pre m season and from 0 81 to 3 12 in the post m season in pratapgarh while in mirzapur it ranged from 0 17 to 2 78 in the pre m and from 0 92 to 3 33 in the post m season 21 out of 25 samples from pre m and 23 from the post m season in pratapgarh while all the samples in pre m and 24 in post m in mirzapur fell into the excellent to good water quality category 3 6 9 langelier saturation index lsi the lsi was calculated by the formula given in equation 10 lsi is widely used to indicate the corrosive and scale forming nature of water abbasnia et al 2019 in this study the lsi values were observed between 0 06 and 0 9 in pratapgarh in the pre m season while in the post m season it varied from 1 5 to 0 74 it was observed that 92 of the samples in pratapgarh were non corrosive while only 8 were corrosive in the pre m season in the post m season 52 of the samples were corrosive 36 were slightly corrosive 8 were non corrosive and 4 were seriously corrosive in mirzapur the lsi values ranged between 0 27 and 0 73 in the pre m season and 52 of samples were corrosive 40 were slightly corrosive and 8 were non corrosive whereas in the post m season it ranged from 1 to 0 14 where 725 samples were slightly corrosive 20 showed serious corrosion and 8 were corrosive 3 7 10 ryznar stability index rsi the rsi was calculated by the formula given in equation 11 the rsi indicates the suitability of water for industrial purposes the rsi range from 4 to 5 indicates the heavy scaling property 5 6 signifies light scaling 6 7 indicates little scaling or corrosion 7 7 5 indicates significant corrosion 7 5 9 indicates heavy corrosion and 9 indicates corrosion intolerance haritash et al 2016 the study showed rsi values between 5 4 and 8 in the pre m season of pratapgarh where 52 of samples were corrosive 24 showed significant corrosion 16 showed light scaling and 8 showed heavy corrosion in the post m season 76 showed heavy corrosion 16 showed significant corrosion 4 showed corrosion and 4 showed intolerable corrosion in the pre m season of mirzapur rsi values ranged from 7 1 to 8 6 where 88 of samples showed heavy corrosion and 12 showed significant corrosion in the post m season the values varied between 7 5 and 9 2 where 92 showed heavy corrosion 4 showed substantial corrosion and 4 showed intolerable corrosion 4 conclusion this study assessed the physicochemical parameters in the groundwater samples of the mid gangetic plain pratapgarh and mirzapur districts of uttar pradesh the physicochemical analysis shows that the ec tds nh4 and po4 3 exceeded the permissible limits indicating the groundwater quality deterioration in the study area the seasonal variation shows that ec tds th alkalinity na ca2 and mg2 showed higher concentrations in the post m season while others showed higher concentrations in the pre m season indicating the active local groundwater recharge processes in the aquifer system the hydrochemical analysis showed that hco3 and so4 2 are the major anions and ca2 and mg2 were the major cations observed in the study area the wqi results indicate the level of pollution suggested that the water quality was unsuitable in both the districts in pre m while during post m water quality improved but still ranged from poor to unsuitable category however the water was still suitable for irrigational purposes as most of the parameters were found suitable in the study the industrial suitability indices lsi and rsi also indicated that the samples showed significant heavy corrosion at most sites that can corrode metals thus making them unsuitable for industrial usage the dissolution of carbonate minerals through rock water interaction and the reverse ion exchange are the major processes that govern groundwater chemistry in the study area however little influence of anthropogenic activities is also observed the present comprehensive suggests that proper management and regulation of agricultural inputs domestic sewage and industrial waste is the need of the hour as proper treatment and disposal also there needs to be the implementation of more treatment facilities to meet the growing population s demand disposing of more waste ultimately contaminating the groundwater resources there is a need to study the river water groundwater interaction in the mid gangetic plain through the pilot scale study and modeling to predict the future scenario for better management of water resources in

11646,1 2 3 tricholoropropane tcp is an impurity common in nematicides applied to agricultural soils from the 1940s to the 1980s evidence from animal studies indicates that tcp is a probable human carcinogen tcp leaches through the soil into groundwater where it persists and contaminates thousands of wells in asia europe and north america in california tcp contaminates drinking water wells with the highest levels of tcp beneath agricultural land used to grow grapevines this study performs a mass balance and evaluates the ability of three types of tree based machine learning models to predict tcp concentration in california s central valley aquifer system classification and regression trees cart random forest rf and boosted regression trees brt to construct the models multiple spatial explanatory variables were used including historical agricultural land use data irrigation levels precipitation soil type groundwater age redox state and the presence of the co contaminant nitrate to estimate the amount of tcp applied to farmland in california state historical pesticide and land use documents were used in the mass balance between 110 000 and 4 300 000 kg of tcp are estimated to have accumulated in the subsurface machine learning models indicate that the most important explanatory variables to predict tcp contamination of groundwater are precipitation redox state and the presence of the co contaminant nitrate additionally a 1000 m buffer area offers a slightly higher predictive performance as compared to 500 m and 1500 m buffers furthermore the rf model outperforms cart and brt for predictive performance finally modeling using decision trees can predict tcp contamination levels in areas where monitoring is lacking help target future tcp monitoring efforts and aid in identifying areas to avoid when drilling new drinking water wells graphical abstract image 1 keywords tcp mass balance random forest gis decision trees disadvantaged communities data availability data used to train and test the models and r code are available publicly and can be found at https github com hopehauptman tcp machinelearningmodel 1 introduction for nearly forty years 1 2 3 trichloropropane tcp was applied in agricultural regions in california in other areas in the us and in other parts of the world hauptman and naughton 2021a tcp is a probable human carcinogen usntp 1993 even though california banned tcp decades ago tcp is still found in groundwater because of its persistent qualities especially in rural parts of the central valley this study describes an effort to approximate the amount of tcp persisting in california s groundwater using mass balance and multiple tree based machine learning models while other studies have applied machine learning to predict a variety of contaminants at regional national and global scales this is the first study to use such methods for a volatile contaminant like tcp ibrahim et al 2022 ling et al 2022 mosavi et al 2021 ransom et al 2017b 2022 by predicting the amount of tcp contamination and the likeliest locations where it may be found this study contributes to a greater understanding of how to address one of environmental engineering s grand challenges in the 21st century providing a safe and sustainable water supply for a growing global population while also addressing the united nations sustainable development goals 3 and 6 nasem 2019 unsdg 2015 since more than a third of the world s freshwater resources are underground and demand for that water is growing in urban and peri urban communities the un considers groundwater extraction the only way to provide basic water needs to much of the world s rural population un 2022 the challenge of supplying potable well water is exacerbated not only by its scarcity but also by the widespread presence of anthropogenic non point source pollutants from livestock waste soil amendments and pesticides harter 2003 un 2022 in the united states geological survey usgs 2013 2018 national water quality assessment nawqa 128 pesticides and degradants were detected in wells sampled nationwide bexfield et al 2020 tcp was an impurity present in at least two popular fumigant pesticides telone and d d that targeted soil nematodes burow et al 2019 and has been detected in groundwater in asia europe and north america hauptman and naughton 2021a in 13 u s states and in puerto rico it is known that hundreds of drinking water wells are contaminated but because tcp is difficult and costly to monitor little is known about how other parts of the world are affected hauptman and naughton 2021b in rural agrarian areas in the central valley of california where public and domestic water is drawn primarily from underground sources there are public health concerns over contaminated wells fernandez bou et al 2021 tcp is a highly toxic agricultural pollutant of prime concern and it has been the focus of numerous studies hauptman and naughton 2021a since tcp persists in groundwater and is recalcitrant most of those studies explore ways of removing tcp from water the studies have had varying degrees of success and various stages of implementation the most represented technologies in those studies included biodegradation zerovalent transition metals and granular activated carbon gac and are either fully deployed by water systems or being tested in the field hauptman and naughton 2021a in a 2019 study burow et al identified land use soil and aquifer material well type redox state and relative groundwater age as characteristics significantly associated with elevated tcp levels in california s groundwater burow et al 2019 however these studies do not use these explanatory variables to locate the sites where tcp might be found to fill this knowledge gap we apply hybrid machine learning and a gis mapping approach the other major body of tcp studies focuses on its toxicology since synthetic chemicals like tcp are among the world s most toxic pollutants regulators often set maximum contaminant levels mcls low kearns 2012 a 1996 study showed that tcp delivered orally to mice and rats causes tumors to develop in multiple organs including the liver stomach and kidneys la et al 1996 since numerous studies suggest that tcp is a powerful human carcinogen and may damage fertility irwin et al 1995 kielhorn et al 2003 usepa 2009 california set the mcl for tcp at its lowest analytical limit 0 005 μg l swrcb 2022 because of tcp s toxicity it is imperative that communities know where tcp contaminated groundwater is located however since tcp has not been in use for more than forty years locating tcp contamination sites can be especially difficult the difficulties in locating tcp sites are compounded by a lack of area specific historical land use records and massive changes to the central valley landscape cdfa 1970 1983 although previous studies have focused on treatment technologies and the toxicity of tcp none have looked at quantifying the amount of tcp in groundwater nor methods to predict tcp contamination levels both of which are critical to addressing this problem in unmonitored areas of the world a previous mass balance for nitrate in california considered multiple historic nitrate stocks and flows rosenstock et al 2014 although the state of california has monitored tcp levels in groundwater for decades gama 2021 estimates of how much tcp was applied to and remains in the environment from non point agricultural use are absent from the literature therefore this is the first study that uses mass balance to estimate the amount of tcp in california groundwater and train decision tree machine learning models to spatially predict tcp concentrations in groundwater widespread tcp application occurred between the 1940s and the 1980s burow et al 2019 but statewide pesticide use reports pur and county by county records began in 1970 this study uses the existing years 1970 1984 to calculate a mass balance that approximates tcp s accumulation in groundwater per acre of treated cropland and provides high and low estimates given the range of tcp impurity levels in the literature to address the lack of worldwide monitoring data for tcp contamination we use hybrid gis and machine learning models built from spatial predictor variables spatial explanatory layers were used to construct a predictive model using three different types of decision trees to predict tcp contamination in groundwater although high in computational costs decision trees can handle complex data sets and many predictor variables the goal of this study is to use mass balance and hybrid gis machine learning models to predict tcp concentration levels in groundwater our research question asks if the superiority of boosted regression trees brt at predicting groundwater nitrate levels will hold against other machine learning models for predicting tcp nolan et al 2015 ransom et al 2017a specifically this research tests if brt will outperform random forest rf and single classification and regression tree cart models for predicting tcp concentration in groundwater to provide context for the accumulation of tcp in the study site we use historical data and mass balance to estimate the extent of the tcp problem in the central valley of california our research objectives are 1 to use a mass balance approach to estimate quantities of tcp that have leached beyond the root zone in california s soils to cause groundwater contamination 2 to apply machine learning to predict tcp concentration from explanatory variables from previous research using training and testing data for validation 3 to rank explanatory variables in order of predictive importance 4 to compare the prediction performance of multiple regression models and buffer zones using error metrics 5 to determine which crop types may be more highly associated with median tcp well concentration and 6 to compare tcp prediction maps with disadvantaged community dac delineations to determine if areas with high modeled tcp contamination are more likely to occur in dacs ultimately this research approach could be used to approximate tcp levels in rural unmonitored groundwater wells beneath existing or former croplands that may have been treated with fumigants containing tcp the methodology used in our research could be modified for application in other areas of the united states and globally 2 methods 2 1 study area the study area is the central valley aquifer region cvar of california in the united states an area of approximately 53 000 km2 fig 1 the central valley is comprised of two adjacent valleys the sacramento valley to the north and the larger san joaquin valley to the south the central valley is surrounded by four mountain ranges the coast range to the west the sierra nevada range to the east the cascade mountains to the north and the tehachapi mountains to the south an alluvial trough the valley is primarily drained through the sacramento san joaquin delta with a semi arid to arid climate with higher average annual precipitation in the north than in the south the cvar is one of the most heavily pumped aquifers in the nation only the ogallala aquifer in the high plains region meets a heavier demand lovelace et al 2020 producing approximately one quarter of the nation s food the central valley is the most productive agricultural area in the united states and one of the most important agricultural production areas globally faunt et al 2016 usgs 2023 the region relies on groundwater withdrawals for irrigation industry and household use ghasemizade et al 2019 groundwater pumping in the cvar surpasses natural recharge from rain and streamflow by 2 billion cubic meters per year and in dry years overdraft rates are even higher due to less recharge and an increase in withdrawals to supplement the smaller volume of available surface water faunt et al 2016 medellín azuara et al 2015 2 2 mass balance estimate for tcp accumulation in the study area this study approximates tcp loading into california groundwater to provide context to the machine learning model and evaluate the scope of the problem in the study area three factors were used to estimate groundwater tcp loading from non point agricultural sources 1 the estimated total acreage of cropland treated over a 30 year application period 2 estimates for tcp loading from fumigant application based on historical records in which a high 7 by mass and low 0 17 by mass tcp approximation were used and 3 a mass balance for applied tcp transport out of the root zone based on tcp s physicochemical properties and transport behavior in soil this mass balance model fig 2 focuses on tcp s application and diffusive transport out of the root zone fumigants rapidly volatilize at ambient temperatures and pressures and as vapor phase solutes they diffuse through soil gas space while partitioning between the water and solid phases inputs flux a in fig 2 used to estimate the yearly tcp flux or loading ṁ mass per year per acre of cropland are derived from the california department of food and agriculture historical pesticide use reports pur cdfa 1970 1984 the pur for 1970 1983 indicates that farmers annually applied a mean of 3 447 629 pounds of fumigants containing tcp both telone and d d mix to a mean of 50 807 acres of cropland mass balance outputs include upward diffusion of gaseous tcp to the atmosphere flux b and downward diffusion toward groundwater flux c tcp losses due to plant uptake surface runoff and aqueous leaching were assumed negligible the following equations were used to estimate the accumulation of annual tcp in the subsurface and then applied over a 30 year

fumigants were applied is unknown and historical application records are not available prior to 1970 but the literature suggests the late 1940s to early 1980s as a timeframe hauptman and naughton 2021a using pur data we can estimate the average mass flux ṁ in grams year and area a in meters2 for thirty years cdfa 1970 1984 the tcp concentration is estimated from the pur records of the approximate amount of telone and d d applied in pounds and the area of land supplementary material sm table s1 the combined application for d d mixture and telone for the year 1975 was used as a representative sample for the yearly application amount from equation 1 above da m2 year is the estimated diffusion coefficient for tcp in air using the hayduk and laudie method at 20 c usepa 2021 we assume that the fumigant containing tcp volatilized after application followed by partitioning into different phases based on physicochemical properties sm table s2 c is the tcp concentration in air

collection and preprocessing 2 data partitioning and tuning 3 data evaluation and prediction and 4 visualizing predictions on a gridded map surface fig 3 arcgis pro v 2 8 2 a geographic information system was used to spatially link explanatory variable map layers to the target variable and to visualize the final model prediction r computing software v 4 2 2 was used for modeling and statistical analysis specifically the r package caret v 6 0 93 was used to partition data tune hyperparameters train models and create statistical comparisons kuhn et al 2018 built and named for classification and regression training caret has built in functions for data preparation tuning training and evaluating multiple types of machine learning algorithms three of these off the shelf caret learning algorithms were compared in this study rpart2 a cart model rf an rf model and gbm a brt model the raster package v 3 6 20 was used to apply the models to raster stacks of the study area to predict tcp levels throughout the central valley hijmans and van etten 2012 2 4 tcp data selection and pre processing we collected tcp well data from the groundwater ambient monitoring and assessment gama program in 2000 the state water resources control board swrcb gama database made groundwater quality data available to the public the swrcb gama groundwater information system geotracker aggregates water quality data from various sources including the department of pesticide regulation the department of water resources the usgs priority basin project and the national water information system swrcb 2023 groundwater is analyzed for tcp concentration using purge and trap capillary gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry u s epa method 524 2 california law dictates that public water systems monitor for tcp in their water supplies four times per year since the state adopted a maximum contaminant level of 0 005 μg l swrcb 2022 this study used data from all available well categories from 1990 to 2021 tcp levels fluctuate with groundwater depth and season but since tcp has a half life on the order of hundreds of years the mean value of all available measures for an individual well was used for this study pagan et al 1998 additionally this analysis uses all available well point data for the cvar the region includes 13 797 wells with a range of tcp concentrations from 0 to 16 000 μg l measurements at or exceeding three standard deviations from the mean were removed as outliers reducing the data set to 13 314 wells with a maximum concentration of 60 μg l tcp since the detection limit dl for tcp is 0 005 μg l entries of zero in the gama data set were changed to half of the detection limit value dl 2 0 0025 μg l to avoid the unwarranted treatment of non detects as zero helsel 1990 finally the tcp concentration was log10 transformed to achieve a more normal distribution before modeling when assigning explanatory variables to well points we considered multiple buffer sizes a 2009 usgs study indicated that a 500 m circle is adequate for assigning land use and calculating the statistical correlation between urban land use and the occurrence of volatile organic compounds in wells johnson and belitz 2009 a 500 m buffer was also used as the optimal buffer size to relate nitrate concentrations and agricultural land use categorization surrounding a well for the us national water quality assessment program koterba 1998 however since a 2019 machine learning study showed that a 1000 m buffer had the highest predictive performance for nitrate in groundwater knoll et al 2019 larger buffer zones were also considered for the present study three different circular buffer areas were evaluated with radii of 500 1000 and 1500 m for the attribution of spatial explanatory variables to well sites and the predictive performance of these three buffer zones was compared sm fig s3 2 5 spatial explanatory variables the current study builds on the results of a 2019 usgs study identifying factors associated with tcp contamination in groundwater we also consider a set of land use source data from the years 1945 1960 1975 1990 2005 that delineates specific agricultural land use classifications harter et al 2017 mass balance estimates are not used as an explanatory variable in the models because the initial concentration of applied tcp is not based on crop or area specific inputs but rather considers averages of all crop inputs statewide the data used in the current study is all open source table 1 to understand the predictive power of these publicly available datasets the shapefile and raster layers were projected using an equal area albers projection with a north american datum nad of 1983 2 5 1 nitrate and dissolved oxygen concentration raster data nitrate concentration and tcp concentration are significantly related burow et al 2019 spatial data for nitrate concentration was obtained from the usgs data release for predicting nitrate in the central valley aquifer region nitrate values were predicted using a boosted regression trees brt model at two different depths one related to private wells 180 feet or 54 9 m and another related to public drinking water wells 400 feet or 123 m the nitrate point data on which the brt model was constructed come from the university of california at davis uc davis and the u s geological survey usgs ransom et al 2017a since california groundwater wells with the highest tcp concentration tend to be in oxic wells this study uses dissolved oxygen do concentration as an explanatory layer burow et al 2019 do raster grids were constructed by the usgs where raster values are expressed as probabilities that groundwater in a particular area has do concentrations less than certain threshold values 2 mg l and 0 5 mg l the higher the probabilities the more likely that a well is anoxic rosecrans et al 2018 depths for domestic and public supply wells used for this study are at 30 m and 100 m respectively 2 5 2 land use irrigation and precipitation raster data the agricultural land use surrounding each well was calculated using california augmented multisource landcover caml maps which categorize agricultural land use for the following years 1945 1960 1975 1990 and 2005 harter et al 2017 the twelve specific land uses categorized by the caml maps include 1 urban 2 native vegetation 3 pasture 4 citrus and subtropical 5 deciduous fruit and nuts 6 field crops 7 corn sorghum and sudangrass 8 grain 9 alfalfa 10 truck nursery and berry 11 rice and 12 vineyards sm table s6 caml maps were created and used to analyze nitrate loading in groundwater as presented in a 2017 technical report for the fertilizer research education program harter et al 2017 as tcp was applied from the 1940s to the 1980s these older maps offer a more accurate description of land use patterns during fumigant application and therefore may show a stronger correlation than current land use maps to tcp contamination in groundwater caml maps modeling the nitrogen levels in irrigation water were also used for 1945 1960 1975 1990 and 2005 since these raster layers were originally created for a nitrate study the map units are in kg nitrate hectare year kg n ha yr and account for pumped groundwater application contributing to nitrate loading nitrate loading from irrigation serves as a proxy for historical irrigation estimates which would have influenced tcp migration in the subsurface parameter elevation regressions on independent slopes model prism was developed in 1991 to estimate precipitation prism uses point data from multiple monitoring networks and climactically aided interpolation cai to model precipitation prism climate group 2021 this study uses mean annual precipitation mm year for 1945 1960 1975 1990 and 2005 the raster grid has a resolution of 4 km 2 5 3 soils raster data since infiltration and loading of tcp into groundwater may be affected by the hydrologic and drainage class of soil burow et al 2019 data from the usda soil survey geographic database ssurgo is included in this analysis usda 2021 these 30 m resolution raster layers were produced by the u s department of agriculture natural resources conservation service nrcs hydrologic soil groups hsg fall into one of eight categories based on runoff versus infiltration potential sm table s7 mockus 1964 usda 2019 the drainage class of soils or their relative ability to retain or drain water is also considered an explanatory factor ssurgo divides drainage into eight different classes excessively drained 0 somewhat excessively drained 1 well drained 2 moderately well drained 3 somewhat poorly drained 4 poorly drained 5 very poorly drained 6 and subaqueous soils 7 usda 2017 sm table s8 2 5 4 groundwater age raster data groundwater age data is from gama gathered through a program conducted by the lawrence livermore national laboratory visser et al 2014 the classification of groundwater age is based on the relative concentration of radioactive tritium 3h to helium 3 3he modern age groundwater recharged in 1953 or later has previously been associated with higher concentrations of tcp in groundwater wells burow et al 2019 2 5 5 disadvantaged communities data as other agricultural groundwater contaminations like nitrates are found disproportionately in disadvantaged communities dacs tariqi and naughton 2021 we used the california office of environmental health hazard assessment oehha and california environmental protection agency calepa calenviroscreen 4 0 geodatabase to determine if areas with high modeled tcp contamination are also more likely to occur in underserved regions oehha 2021 the calepa tool delineates dac locations and boundaries based on socioeconomics public health and combined environmental pressures communities that rank in the top 25 of combined evaluation categories are considered disadvantaged 2 5 6 shapefile boundary layers for california and the central valley aquifer the boundary of the central valley aquifer was obtained by converting the land use raster data to a shapefile and then dissolving all internal boundaries the explanatory layers and tcp target variable point data layer described in the previous sections were compiled in arcgis pro and clipped by the boundary this boundary was selected to maximize available land use data california state and county boundary layers were obtained from the california department of technology open data portal cdt 2019 2 6 spatial machine learning models a variety of modeling approaches have been used to predict nitrate and arsenic groundwater concentration including multiple linear regression mlr and artificial neural networks ann nolan et al 2015 however not all methods can accommodate both categorical and continuous measurement scales as easily as decision trees can georganos et al 2021 three different types of regression decision trees were used to predict tcp groundwater concentration in california s central valley classification and regression trees cart random forest rf and boosted regression trees brt single decision tree models like cart can overfit the training dataset however ensemble methods rf and brt average results from hundreds of differently structured trees and therefore generally show higher predictive accuracies and lower variances breiman 2001 two common ensemble methods are bagging for rf models and boosting for brt models breiman 2001 the bagging method trains multiple decision trees in parallel with each tree trained on a different subset of the data on the other hand the boosting method is sequential each tree learns from the preceding tree 2 6 1 classification and regression trees classification and regression trees cart are commonly used decision tree algorithms developed by leo breiman belgiu and drăguţ 2016 breiman 2001 cart models are used for categorical and regressive predictive modeling cart is based on a decision tree structure that begins with the entire set of training data at the root node each split of the tree creates non terminal daughter nodes until terminating at leaf nodes which are a unique prediction of the target variable breiman 2001 knoll et al 2019 the cart algorithm determines the variables used for splitting where split points are located and the shape of the tree hastie et al 2017 single large decision trees have a tendency to overfit the data the cart algorithm is advantageous over more basic decision tree models because it prunes large trees to create a smaller tree with a lower error rate hastie et al 2017 because the cart model prediction outcome is based on the results from a single pruned tree its predictive performance is sometimes lower than ensemble methods which are based on the outcome of hundreds of trees the cart approach lays the foundation for ensemble methods such as rf and brt and is therefore evaluated in the present study as a basic model for comparison 2 6 2 random forest random forest rf is a machine learning algorithm based on multiple decision trees which are considered collectively and as a result the technique is sometimes referred to as an ensemble learning method breiman 2001 trees are built from random selection variables using training data the approach can be used to predict categorical or continuous data from many predictor variables since rf relies on averaging the results from multiple randomly constructed carts to make a prediction it generally shows greater accuracy and less overfitting than models based on single cart trees naghibi et al 2016 in the process of rf regression a set number b of regression trees tb are grown and the outputs are then averaged the regression prediction for a new data point x is defined by the following equation hastie et al 2017 f ˆ b r f x 1 b b 1 b t b x each tree is trained on a random subset of 75 of the training data then the excluded one quarter of the data known as out of bag data is run back through the tree out of bag errors indicate how well each tree can predict the excluded features 2 6 3 boosted regression trees brt like rf a brt model uses the results from hundreds of multiple decision trees unlike rf brt is a sequentially constructed model that considers the residuals of the previous trees when constructing a new tree if input data is successfully modeled in a tree that data then has a higher chance of being included in the subsequent tree thereby boosting the model hastie et al 2017 brt also deviates from the rf model in which inputs have an equal and random probability of being included in any one tree and are not dependent on the outcomes of previously constructed trees brt hyperparameters include the tree complexity to determine the number of splits in a tree the learning rate which sets how much the outcome of one tree can influence how a future tree is assembled and the minimum number of observations at the leaves or terminal nodes of the trees elith et al 2008 mosavi et al 2020 2 7 model construction testing and evaluation after joining buffered well point data with explanatory variables into a data frame the data was split into a training set 80 n 10 652 and a testing set 20 n 2 662 using a data partitioning function from the caret package kuhn et al 2018 the set seed function in r was used to make sure that the same random split of data was used to train each of the different models r core team 2020 to reduce overfitting and bias we used the caret package traincontrol function to conduct a three times repeated 10 fold cross validation on the training dataset using all twenty input variables table 1 kuhn et al 2018 to create the cross validation folds the training data was repeatedly and randomly split into 10 smaller sets with 25 of the training data held out as a validation test set fig 3 the final hyperparameters that we selected were based on the lowest rmse value from the cross validated training runs the range of tuning parameters used to adjust the models during the tuning phase and the final hyperparameters used to construct the models are in table 2 since tree based models are known to underpredict high concentrations and overpredict low concentrations we applied empirical distribution matching edm bias correction edm couples values from the cumulative distribution functions of both the observed and predicted tcp values to correct systemic bias belitz and stackelberg 2021 and has been previously used in tree based decision models to predict groundwater nitrate levels ransom et al 2022 finally the three models with and without bias correction were evaluated against one another for overall predictive performance using caret functions for common metrics to compare machine learning algorithms mean absolute error mae root mean squared error rmse and the coefficient of determination r2 kuhn et al 2018 knoll et al 2019 nolan et al 2015 for the model with the lowest mae and rmse values and highest r2 value a variable importance plot was constructed to show how important each variable is in predicting tcp levels fig 5 additionally partial dependence plots helped us to understand the relationship between a single variable and tcp predictions sm fig s4 3 results and discussion california s central valley has some of the highest numbers of drinking water violations from a variety of contaminants in the state balazs 2010 the proportion of central valley wells that test above the mcl for tcp is over 10 higher than the california average love 2019 tcp was a trace impurity in 1 2 dcp fumigant formulations and as the actual concentration of tcp may have been as high as 7 and as low as 0 17 a high and low estimate is provided in the mass balance model see table 3 and sm fig s2 oki and giambelluca 1987 zebarth et al 1998 the estimated mass of tcp accumulated over 30 years accounting for diffusive loss to surroundings is 110 000 4 300 000 kg of tcp this balance focuses on diffusive loss as tcp s koc is low 2 2 5 as such sorption to soil organic matter is relatively low and unlikely to substantially hinder tcp transport to groundwater mital 2014 moreover the machine learning model we use shows that hydrologic soil type and drainage characteristics are relatively unimportant predictors of tcp in groundwater fig 5 finally although fumigant residues have been detected in plants since fumigants are generally applied before crops are planted plant uptake is considered negligible and not considered by this model 3 1 decision tree models 3 1 1 summary statistics for tcp well data used for model training the tcp concentration for the well point data n 13 314 used to train the models ranged from 0 0025 to 60 μg l with a median concentration of 0 0025 μg l and a mean concentration of 0 24 μg l of the different well categories municipal were the most abundant 47 followed by monitoring 43 other water supply 8 and domestic 2 monitoring wells had the highest mean concentration of tcp at 0 44 μg l followed by domestic 0 097 μg l municipal 0 090 μg l and other water supply 0 011 μg l well depths ranged from 8 2 to 2100 feet with a median and mean depth of 90 feet and 180 feet respectively sm table s4 3 1 2 buffer zone comparison each of the tested decision tree models is based on a set of explanatory variables surrounding groundwater well points for each model three different buffer zones 500 m 1000 m and 1500 m were tested around those well points and evaluated for predictive performance for the testing data using mae rmse and r2 metrics initial modeling results found little difference in model performance between buffer sizes slightly higher r2 values and lower rmse and mae values occurred in a 1000 m buffer zone sm fig s3 using a 500 m buffer zone produces the lowest r2 value except for the single tree cart model in which the 1500 m buffer yields the poorest performance 3 1 3 predicted performance the models predictive performance results are presented in sm table s8 for both training and testing data of the models tested the rf model produces the best predictions with the highest mean r2 value of 0 44 and the lowest mae 0 43 and rmse 0 72 values as expected the single tree cart model is the least accurate with an r2 of 0 020 and higher mae and rmse values than either of the rf models although the brt models have performed better than the rf model for nitrate prediction in the central valley ransom et al 2017b for tcp the brt r2 value 0 41 is slightly lower than that of the rf model 0 44 sm table s8 the observed tcp concentration versus the predicted tcp concentration for the training and hold out testing data for all models is plotted in fig 4 ideally the plotted points should be close to the regression line and equally scattered above and below it however actual results are dispersed for the testing data sets while not surprising considering the range of tcp concentration values 0 0025 60 μg l increasing variance with larger concentration limits the model s ability to make accurate predictions and future models may consider a narrower range of tcp concentrations to train the model the r2 random forest model performance result for the training data is similar to the results from studies using similar decision tree methods to predict concentrations of other agricultural contaminants such as nitrate knoll et al 2019 ling et al 2022 ransom et al 2017a the predictive performance values for the training data set show significantly better results than for the test data for all three models but the largest difference between training and testing predictive performance is the brt model indicating an overfit to training data slightly more than the other tested models 3 1 4 variable importance tables and partial dependence plots the performance of explanatory variables fig 5 shows how well each variable performs in splitting the decision trees to predict tcp concentration for the rf model which had a higher predictive performance than the cart or brt models the most influential predictors categories are annual precipitation amount from 2005 1990 1960 and 1975 two groundwater redox variables indicating the probability of dissolved oxygen levels being below 2 mg l and 0 5 mg l and nitrate as estimated from concentration at 180 feet depth the finding agrees with an earlier study that found precipitation and redox state to be the factors most associated with detecting volatile organic compounds in domestic wells rowe et al 2007 partial dependence plots for predictor variables allowed us to explore the individual relationships between a variable and its influence on the model sm fig s4 the importance of precipitation the most influential category shows that the highest concentrations of tcp are associated with the lowest rainfall levels for all years the two top predictors precipitation during 2005 and 1990 are for years after tcp would have ceased to be applied so it may follow that higher rainfall could have diluted wells already contaminated with tcp with higher tcp levels in wells with lower recharge rates additionally the highest modeled tcp concentrations are in the southern area of the central valley where precipitation rates are relatively low but with large swaths of land use developed for orchards and row crops precipitation during 1960 and 1975 shows a different trend with an unsymmetric v shaped curve for these years although the highest tcp levels are still associated with the lowest levels of rainfall tcp levels dip and then show an upward trend with rising precipitation amounts tcp was still being actively applied during 1960 1975 and therefore the connection between high precipitation levels and high tcp concentration may be because high levels of precipitation may have led to an increased chance that tcp leached from soil fractions into the water table and may have been the case during years when tcp was actively applied and when the concentration of tcp in the soil would have been the highest lewan et al 2009 mcgrath et al 2010 ney 1990 this tendency may have been especially true in well drained soils with high infiltration rates bailey et al 1974 the upward trend may also be related to observed training points with very high 20 μg l tcp levels in urban areas near stockton and sacramento california contamination in these wells may be due to the past industrial use of tcp or because they are in the northern sections of the central valley where precipitation rates are higher the multi faceted relationship between tcp levels and precipitation may also be confounded by the presence of undissolved tcp in the unsaturated zone where water tables rise during precipitation events and groundwater may become periodically recharged with tcp partial dependence plots for the second highest importance category redox state show a u shaped trend with high tcp levels in groundwater with a high probability of being oxic and anoxic with the lowest tcp concentrations at mid level probabilities that dissolved oxygen levels are below a 2 mg l or a 0 5 mg l threshold this finding partially agrees with previous research which has shown that tcp is found at higher concentrations in oxic groundwater due to the prevention of the chemical transformation of tcp which may occur in anoxic conditions burow et al 2019 higher concentrations of tcp in anoxic groundwater may be the result of the lateral migration of tcp towards the central valley central axis trough region which is more associated with anoxic groundwater ransom et al 2017a rosecrans et al 2018 the third most influential prediction category nitrate levels underscores that the principal source of tcp in cvar groundwater is related to the agricultural use of fumigants as opposed to tcp s use as an industrial solvent burow et al 2019 partial dependence plots show that higher tcp levels are positively associated with higher levels of the co contaminant nitrate the plots also show a spike in concentration at very low levels which may be the result of industrial uses of tcp as a lubricant and degreaser burow et al 2019 less influential factors include irrigation groundwater age and land use classes irrigation may have had less of an influence as application instructions for the fumigant in which tcp was contained advised growers to leave treated soil undisturbed for at least 7 14 days specifically noting that wet soil disturbs the diffusion process usepa 1973 land use may be less influential than expected because agricultural land use layers used were for discrete years with a 15 year gap between years 1945 1960 1974 1990 2005 and therefore may not reflect the actual crop types in a particular area during the years when tcp would have been applied furthermore the decision to use fumigants that would have contained tcp would have been influenced by the affordability and availability of the fumigants and the differences in tcp concentration from batch to batch 3 1 5 median tcp concentration by agricultural land use although the relative importance of specific agricultural land designation by crop type is low we compared specific crop types directly to tcp levels in surrounding wells the land use in a 1000 m buffer zone around well points was used to calculate the median tcp concentration in μg l in groundwater under particular crop types sm table s8 and fig s2 we found that in the central valley regardless of year the highest median tcp concentration 0 03 μg l occurs in groundwater below vineyards compared to other land use designations the second highest concentrations are in field crops followed by alfalfa deciduous fruit and nut grain corn sorghum sudangrass and native vegetation the groundwater beneath citrus and subtropical rice truck nursery and berry and urban areas have zero median tcp concentration for all years 3 1 6 spatial prediction of tcp groundwater concentrations our models were largely underpredicting tcp concentrations especially at the lower end of the spectrum applying the edm bias correction resulted in adjustments that increased underpredicted low values reduced overpredicted high values and increased r2 values for the hold out testing data fig 6 sm table s8 the spatial distribution of edm bias corrected tcp predictions for central valley groundwater was mapped to a 50 50 m raster grid for all models fig 7 the rf prediction map which showed the highest performance in comparison to cart and brt indicates that the 0 1 0 2 μg l tcp contamination range makes up the largest total percentage 56 of the central valley aquifer study region groundwater the highest tcp concentration range 0 4 0 86 μg l as predicted by the rf model occurs at the lowest total area of only 1 or 586 km2 sm table s9 and occurs predominately in the southern san joaquin valley region of the cvar approximately 48 of the cvar includes disadvantaged communities dacs as defined by the oehha oehha 2021 the highest modeled tcp groundwater concentration range occurs predominantly in dacs 73 sm table s10 4 conclusions a mass balance using data from historical pur documents indicates that during the approximately 30 years that tcp was applied to agricultural lands 110 000 4 300 000 kg of tcp may have accumulated in the subsurface and leached into california groundwater this tcp groundwater loading estimate is based on two contributing pesticides telone and d d mix however since tcp was an impurity retained after 1 2 dcp was manufactured other fumigants may have also contained tcp and their exclusion may have led to an underestimate of tcp loading additionally future efforts may include irrigation schedules and multiple fumigant application methods such as tarping with plastic following fumigant application this study provides the first ever machine learning model for a volatile contaminant in groundwater it is an important initial analysis and suggests a model for predicting amounts of tcp in the subsurface that can be applied to agricultural regions globally future studies may take advantage of several refinements the models in the present study are trained with wells monitored for tcp using 1000 m circular buffers however future tcp spatial modeling may improve outcomes by using different buffer shapes and by integrating groundwater flow models to capture horizontal migration of tcp in the subsurface while this study includes dissolved oxygen as an indicator of the redox state of groundwater by including a full series of redox indicators such as manganese and iron a clearer picture of the importance of the redox state in predicting tcp in affected wells may result a comparison of crop type and median tcp concentration in 1000 m buffer zones surrounding monitored wells using five historical agricultural land use maps between 1945 and 2005 shows that vineyards have the highest median tcp concentration for all years in the study region however crop type was the least important explanatory predictor for tcp concentration with the rf model future models may therefore consider using land use maps with fewer agricultural categories with the added benefit of reducing the computational cost of training the models the gis based machine learning approach used in this study allows for the prediction of tcp concentration from spatially mapped environmental explanatory variables according to r2 values the three models were ordered in terms of predictive performance as rf brt cart bagged tree models constructed in parallel slightly outperform boosted tree models constructed sequentially the single tree cart model has a substantially lower performance than either boosted or bagged multitree models the edm bias corrected rf model has an r2 value of 0 43 using the testing data set 20 of the full data set using the rf model the most important predictors for the spatial occurrence of tcp in groundwater are precipitation dissolved oxygen levels and nitrate concentration the type of prediction maps produced by this analysis could be used by water districts and domestic well owners in areas not monitored for tcp with water insecurity increasing in many areas of the world well managed and monitored groundwater supplies are of growing importance this research supports un sdg goals 3 and 6 reducing illness from pollution and access to safe and affordable drinking water unsdg 2015 models have shown that tcp is an animal carcinogen and it is a suspected human carcinogen the central valley of california contains numerous rural communities with private wells small water systems and limited budgets many of these communities are classified as disadvantaged communities and since tcp treatment and monitoring are expensive predictive models may alleviate some of the expense by helping to target limited resources toward drinking water sources most likely to be contaminated acknowledgments the

11646,1 2 3 tricholoropropane tcp is an impurity common in nematicides applied to agricultural soils from the 1940s to the 1980s evidence from animal studies indicates that tcp is a probable human carcinogen tcp leaches through the soil into groundwater where it persists and contaminates thousands of wells in asia europe and north america in california tcp contaminates drinking water wells with the highest levels of tcp beneath agricultural land used to grow grapevines this study performs a mass balance and evaluates the ability of three types of tree based machine learning models to predict tcp concentration in california s central valley aquifer system classification and regression trees cart random forest rf and boosted regression trees brt to construct the models multiple spatial explanatory variables were used including historical agricultural land use data irrigation levels precipitation soil type groundwater age redox state and the presence of the co contaminant nitrate to estimate the amount of tcp applied to farmland in california state historical pesticide and land use documents were used in the mass balance between 110 000 and 4 300 000 kg of tcp are estimated to have accumulated in the subsurface machine learning models indicate that the most important explanatory variables to predict tcp contamination of groundwater are precipitation redox state and the presence of the co contaminant nitrate additionally a 1000 m buffer area offers a slightly higher predictive performance as compared to 500 m and 1500 m buffers furthermore the rf model outperforms cart and brt for predictive performance finally modeling using decision trees can predict tcp contamination levels in areas where monitoring is lacking help target future tcp monitoring efforts and aid in identifying areas to avoid when drilling new drinking water wells graphical abstract image 1 keywords tcp mass balance random forest gis decision trees disadvantaged communities data

2 3 trichloropropane tcp was applied in agricultural regions in california in other areas in the us and in other parts of the world hauptman and naughton 2021a tcp is a probable human carcinogen usntp 1993 even though california banned tcp decades ago tcp is still found in groundwater because of its persistent qualities especially in rural parts of the central valley this study describes an effort to approximate the amount of tcp persisting in california s groundwater using mass balance and multiple tree based machine learning models while other studies have applied machine learning to predict a variety of contaminants at regional national and global scales this is the first study to use such methods for a volatile contaminant like tcp ibrahim et al 2022 ling et al 2022 mosavi et al 2021 ransom et al 2017b 2022 by predicting the amount of tcp contamination and the likeliest locations where it may be found this study contributes to a greater understanding of how to address one of environmental engineering s grand challenges in the 21st century providing a safe and sustainable water supply for a growing global population while also addressing the united nations sustainable development goals 3 and 6 nasem 2019 unsdg 2015 since more than a third of the world s freshwater resources are underground and demand for that water is growing in urban and peri urban communities the un considers groundwater extraction the only way to provide basic water needs to much of the world s rural population un 2022 the challenge of supplying potable well water is exacerbated not only by its scarcity but also by the widespread presence of anthropogenic non point source pollutants from livestock waste soil amendments and pesticides harter 2003 un 2022 in the united states geological survey usgs 2013 2018 national water quality assessment nawqa 128 pesticides and degradants were detected in wells sampled nationwide bexfield et al 2020 tcp was an impurity present in at least two popular fumigant pesticides telone and d d that targeted soil nematodes burow et al 2019 and has been detected in groundwater in asia europe and north america hauptman and naughton 2021a in 13 u s states and in puerto rico it is known that hundreds of drinking water wells are contaminated but because tcp is difficult and costly to monitor little is known about how other parts of the world are affected hauptman and naughton 2021b in rural agrarian areas in the central valley of california where public and domestic water is drawn primarily from underground sources there are public health concerns over contaminated wells fernandez bou et al 2021 tcp is a highly toxic agricultural pollutant of prime concern and it has been the focus of numerous studies hauptman and naughton 2021a since tcp persists in groundwater and is recalcitrant most of those studies explore ways of removing tcp from water the studies have had varying degrees of success and various stages of implementation the most represented technologies in those studies included biodegradation zerovalent transition metals and granular activated carbon gac and are either fully deployed by water systems or being tested in the field hauptman and naughton 2021a in a 2019 study burow et al identified land use soil and aquifer material well type redox state and relative groundwater age as characteristics significantly associated with elevated tcp levels in california s groundwater burow et al 2019 however these studies do not use these explanatory variables to locate the sites where tcp might be found to fill this knowledge gap we apply hybrid machine learning and a gis mapping approach the other major body of tcp studies focuses on its toxicology since synthetic chemicals like tcp are among the world s most toxic pollutants regulators often set maximum contaminant levels mcls low kearns 2012 a 1996 study showed that tcp delivered orally to mice and rats causes tumors to develop in multiple organs including the liver stomach and kidneys la et al 1996 since numerous studies suggest that tcp is a powerful human carcinogen and may damage fertility irwin et al 1995 kielhorn et al 2003 usepa 2009 california set the mcl for tcp at its lowest analytical limit 0 005 μg l swrcb 2022 because of tcp s toxicity it is imperative that communities know where tcp contaminated groundwater is located however since tcp has not been in use for more than forty years locating tcp contamination sites can be especially difficult the difficulties in locating tcp sites are compounded by a lack of area specific historical land use records and massive changes to the central valley landscape cdfa 1970 1983 although previous studies have focused on treatment technologies and the toxicity of tcp none have looked at quantifying the amount of tcp in groundwater nor methods to predict tcp contamination levels both of which are critical to addressing this problem in unmonitored areas of the world a previous mass balance for nitrate in california considered multiple historic nitrate stocks and flows rosenstock et al 2014 although the state of california has monitored tcp levels in groundwater for decades gama 2021 estimates of how much tcp was applied to and remains in the environment from non point agricultural use are absent from the literature therefore this is the first study that uses mass balance to estimate the amount of tcp in california groundwater and train decision tree machine learning models to spatially predict tcp concentrations in groundwater widespread tcp application occurred between the 1940s and the 1980s burow et al 2019 but statewide pesticide use reports pur and county by county records began in 1970 this study uses the existing years 1970 1984 to calculate a mass balance that approximates tcp s accumulation in groundwater per acre of treated cropland and provides high and low estimates given the range of tcp impurity levels in the literature to address the lack of worldwide monitoring data for tcp contamination we use hybrid gis and machine learning models built from spatial predictor variables spatial explanatory layers were used to construct a predictive model using three different types of decision trees to predict tcp contamination in groundwater although high in computational costs decision trees can handle complex data sets and many predictor variables the goal of this study is to use mass balance and hybrid gis machine learning models to predict tcp concentration levels in groundwater our research question asks if the superiority of boosted regression trees brt at predicting groundwater nitrate levels will hold against other machine learning models for predicting tcp nolan et al 2015 ransom et al 2017a specifically this research tests if brt will outperform random forest rf and single classification and regression tree cart models for predicting tcp concentration in groundwater to provide context for the accumulation of tcp in the study site we use historical data and mass balance to estimate the extent of the tcp problem in the central valley of california our research objectives are 1 to use a mass balance approach to estimate quantities of tcp that have leached beyond the root zone in california s soils to cause groundwater contamination 2 to apply machine learning to predict tcp concentration from explanatory variables from previous research using training and testing data for validation 3 to rank explanatory variables in order of predictive importance 4 to compare the prediction performance of multiple regression models and buffer zones using error metrics 5 to determine which crop types may be more highly associated with median tcp well concentration and 6 to compare tcp prediction maps with disadvantaged community dac delineations to determine if areas with high modeled tcp contamination are more likely to occur in dacs ultimately this research approach could be used to approximate tcp levels in rural unmonitored groundwater wells beneath existing or former croplands that may have been treated with fumigants containing tcp the methodology used in our research could be modified for application in other areas of the united states and globally 2 methods 2 1 study area the study area is the central valley aquifer region cvar of california in the united states an area of approximately 53 000 km2 fig 1 the central valley is comprised of two adjacent valleys the sacramento valley to the north and the larger san joaquin valley to the south the central valley is surrounded by four mountain ranges the coast range to the west the sierra nevada range to the east the cascade mountains to the north and the tehachapi mountains to the south an alluvial trough the valley is primarily drained through the sacramento san joaquin delta with a semi arid to arid climate with higher average annual precipitation in the north than in the south the cvar is one of the most heavily pumped aquifers in the nation only the ogallala aquifer in the high plains region meets a heavier demand lovelace et al 2020 producing approximately one quarter of the nation s food the central valley is the most productive agricultural area in the united states and one of the most important agricultural production areas globally faunt et al 2016 usgs 2023 the region relies on groundwater withdrawals for irrigation industry and household use ghasemizade et al 2019 groundwater pumping in the cvar surpasses natural recharge from rain and streamflow by 2 billion cubic meters per year and in dry years overdraft rates are even higher due to less recharge and an increase in withdrawals to supplement the smaller volume of available surface water faunt et al 2016 medellín azuara et al 2015 2 2 mass balance estimate for tcp accumulation in the study area this study approximates tcp loading into california groundwater to provide context to the machine learning model and evaluate the scope of the problem in the study area three factors were used to estimate groundwater tcp loading from non point agricultural sources 1 the estimated total acreage of cropland treated over a 30 year application period 2 estimates for tcp loading from fumigant application based on historical records in which a high 7 by mass and low 0 17 by mass tcp approximation were used and 3 a mass balance for applied tcp transport out of the root zone based on tcp s physicochemical properties and transport behavior in soil this mass balance model fig 2 focuses on tcp s application and diffusive transport out of the root zone fumigants rapidly volatilize at ambient temperatures and pressures and as vapor phase solutes they diffuse through soil gas space while partitioning between the water and solid phases inputs flux a in fig 2 used to estimate the yearly tcp flux or loading ṁ mass per year per acre of cropland are derived from the california department of food and agriculture historical pesticide use reports pur cdfa 1970 1984 the pur for 1970 1983 indicates that farmers annually applied a mean of 3 447 629 pounds of fumigants containing tcp both telone and d d mix to a mean of 50 807 acres of cropland mass balance outputs include upward diffusion of gaseous tcp to the atmosphere flux b and downward diffusion toward groundwater flux c tcp losses due to plant uptake surface runoff and aqueous leaching were assumed negligible the following equations were used to estimate the accumulation of annual tcp in the subsurface and then applied over a 30 year

2021a using pur data we can estimate the average mass flux ṁ in grams year and area a in meters2 for thirty years cdfa 1970 1984 the tcp concentration is estimated from the pur records of the approximate amount of telone and d d applied in pounds and the area of land supplementary material sm table s1 the combined application for d d mixture and telone for the year 1975 was used as a representative sample for the yearly application amount from equation 1 above da m2 year is the estimated diffusion coefficient for tcp in air using the hayduk and laudie method at 20 c usepa 2021 we

collection and preprocessing 2 data partitioning and tuning 3 data evaluation and prediction and 4 visualizing predictions on a gridded map surface fig 3 arcgis pro v 2 8 2 a geographic information system was used to spatially link explanatory variable map layers to the target variable and to visualize the final model prediction r computing software v 4 2 2 was used for modeling and statistical analysis specifically the r package caret v 6 0 93 was used to partition data tune hyperparameters train models and create statistical comparisons kuhn et al 2018 built and named for classification and regression training caret has built in functions for data preparation tuning training and evaluating multiple types of machine learning algorithms three of these off the shelf caret learning algorithms were compared in this study rpart2 a cart model rf an rf model and gbm a brt model the raster package v 3 6 20 was used to apply the models to raster stacks of the study area to predict tcp levels throughout the central valley hijmans and van etten 2012 2 4 tcp data selection and pre processing we collected tcp well data from the groundwater ambient monitoring and assessment gama program in 2000 the state water resources control board swrcb gama database made groundwater quality data available to the public the swrcb gama groundwater information system geotracker aggregates water quality data from various sources including the department of pesticide regulation the department of water resources the usgs priority basin project and the national water information system swrcb 2023 groundwater is analyzed for tcp concentration using purge and trap capillary gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry u s epa method 524 2 california law dictates that public water systems monitor for tcp in their water supplies four times per year since the state adopted a maximum contaminant level of 0 005 μg l swrcb 2022 this study used data from all available well categories from 1990 to 2021 tcp levels fluctuate with groundwater depth and season but since tcp has a half life on the order of hundreds of years the mean value of all available measures for an individual well was used for this study pagan et al 1998 additionally this analysis uses all available well point data for the cvar the region includes 13 797 wells with a range of tcp concentrations from 0 to 16 000 μg l measurements at or exceeding three standard deviations from the mean were removed as outliers reducing the data set to 13 314 wells with a maximum concentration of 60 μg l tcp since the detection limit dl for tcp is 0 005 μg l entries of zero in the gama data set were changed to half of the detection limit value dl 2 0 0025 μg l to avoid the unwarranted treatment of non detects as zero helsel 1990 finally the tcp concentration was log10 transformed to achieve a more normal distribution before modeling when assigning explanatory variables to well points we considered multiple buffer sizes a 2009 usgs study indicated that a 500 m circle is adequate for assigning land use and calculating the statistical correlation between urban land use and the occurrence of volatile organic compounds in wells johnson and belitz 2009 a 500 m buffer was also used as the optimal buffer size to relate nitrate concentrations and agricultural land use categorization surrounding a well for the us national water quality assessment program koterba 1998 however since a 2019 machine learning study showed that a 1000 m buffer had the highest predictive performance for nitrate in groundwater knoll et al 2019 larger buffer zones were also considered for the present study three different circular buffer areas were evaluated with radii of 500 1000 and 1500 m for the attribution of spatial explanatory variables to well sites and the predictive performance of these three buffer zones was compared sm fig s3 2 5 spatial explanatory variables the current study builds on the results of a 2019 usgs study identifying factors associated with tcp contamination in groundwater we also consider a set of land use source data from the years 1945 1960 1975 1990 2005 that delineates specific agricultural land use classifications harter et al 2017 mass balance estimates are not used as an explanatory variable in the models because the initial concentration of applied tcp is not based on crop or area specific inputs but rather considers averages of all crop inputs statewide the data used in the current study is all open source table 1 to understand the predictive power of these publicly available datasets the shapefile and raster layers were projected using an equal area albers projection with a north american datum nad of 1983 2 5 1 nitrate and dissolved oxygen concentration raster data nitrate concentration and tcp concentration are significantly related burow et al 2019 spatial data for nitrate concentration was obtained from the usgs data release for predicting nitrate in the central valley aquifer region nitrate values were predicted using a boosted regression trees brt model at two different depths one related to private wells 180 feet or 54 9 m and another related to public drinking water wells 400 feet or 123 m the nitrate point data on which the brt model was constructed come from the university of california at davis uc davis and the u s geological survey usgs ransom et al 2017a since california groundwater wells with the highest tcp concentration tend to be in oxic wells this study uses dissolved oxygen do concentration as an explanatory layer burow et al 2019 do raster grids were constructed by the usgs where raster values are expressed as probabilities that groundwater in a particular area has do concentrations less than certain threshold values 2 mg l and 0 5 mg l the higher the probabilities the more likely that a well is anoxic rosecrans et al 2018 depths for domestic and public supply wells used for this study are at 30 m and 100 m respectively 2 5 2 land use irrigation and precipitation raster data the agricultural land use surrounding each well was calculated using california augmented multisource landcover caml maps which categorize agricultural land use for the following years 1945 1960 1975 1990 and 2005 harter et al 2017 the twelve specific land uses categorized by the caml maps include 1 urban 2 native vegetation 3 pasture 4 citrus and subtropical 5 deciduous fruit and nuts 6 field crops 7 corn sorghum and sudangrass 8 grain 9 alfalfa 10 truck nursery and berry 11 rice and 12 vineyards sm table s6 caml maps were created and used to analyze nitrate loading in groundwater as presented in a 2017 technical report for the fertilizer research education program harter et al 2017 as tcp was applied from the 1940s to the 1980s these older maps offer a more accurate description of land use patterns during fumigant application and therefore may show a stronger correlation than current land use maps to tcp contamination in groundwater caml maps modeling the nitrogen levels in irrigation water were also used for 1945 1960 1975 1990 and 2005 since these raster layers were originally created for a nitrate study the map units are in kg nitrate hectare year kg n ha yr and account for pumped groundwater application contributing to nitrate loading nitrate loading from irrigation serves as a proxy for historical irrigation estimates which would have influenced tcp migration in the subsurface parameter elevation regressions on independent slopes model prism was developed in 1991 to estimate precipitation prism uses point data from multiple monitoring networks and climactically aided interpolation cai to model precipitation prism climate group 2021 this study uses mean annual precipitation mm year for 1945 1960 1975 1990 and 2005 the raster grid has a resolution of 4 km 2 5 3 soils raster data since infiltration and loading of tcp into groundwater may be affected by the hydrologic and drainage class of soil burow et al 2019 data from the usda soil survey geographic database ssurgo is included in this analysis usda 2021 these 30 m resolution raster layers were produced by the u s department of agriculture natural resources conservation service nrcs hydrologic soil groups hsg fall into one of eight categories based on runoff versus infiltration potential sm table s7 mockus 1964 usda 2019 the drainage class of soils or their relative ability to retain or drain water is also considered an explanatory factor ssurgo divides drainage into eight different classes excessively drained 0 somewhat excessively drained 1 well drained 2 moderately well drained 3 somewhat poorly drained 4 poorly drained 5 very poorly drained 6 and subaqueous soils 7 usda 2017 sm table s8 2 5 4 groundwater age raster data groundwater age data is from gama gathered through a program conducted by the lawrence livermore national laboratory visser et al 2014 the classification of groundwater age is based on the relative concentration of radioactive tritium 3h to helium 3 3he modern age groundwater recharged in 1953 or later has previously been associated with higher concentrations of tcp in groundwater wells burow et al 2019 2 5 5 disadvantaged communities data as other agricultural groundwater contaminations like nitrates are found disproportionately in disadvantaged communities dacs tariqi and naughton 2021 we used the california office of environmental health hazard assessment oehha and california environmental protection agency calepa calenviroscreen 4 0 geodatabase to determine if areas with high modeled tcp contamination are also more likely to occur in underserved regions oehha 2021 the calepa tool delineates dac locations and boundaries based on socioeconomics public health and combined environmental pressures communities that rank in the top 25 of combined evaluation categories are considered disadvantaged 2 5 6 shapefile boundary layers for california and the central valley aquifer the boundary of the central valley aquifer was obtained by converting the land use raster data to a shapefile and then dissolving all internal boundaries the explanatory layers and tcp target variable point data layer described in the previous sections were compiled in arcgis pro and clipped by the boundary this boundary was selected to maximize available land use data california state and county boundary layers were obtained from the california department of technology open data portal cdt 2019 2 6 spatial machine learning models a variety of modeling approaches have been used to predict nitrate and arsenic groundwater concentration including multiple linear regression mlr and artificial neural networks ann nolan et al 2015 however not all methods can accommodate both categorical and continuous measurement scales as easily as decision trees can georganos et al 2021 three different types of regression decision trees were used to predict tcp groundwater concentration in california s central valley classification and regression trees cart random forest rf and boosted regression trees brt single decision tree models like cart can overfit the training dataset however ensemble methods rf and brt average results from hundreds of differently structured trees and therefore generally show higher predictive accuracies and lower variances breiman 2001 two common ensemble methods are bagging for rf models and boosting for brt models breiman 2001 the bagging method trains multiple decision trees in parallel with each tree trained on a different subset of the data on the other hand the boosting method is sequential each tree learns from the preceding tree 2 6 1 classification and regression trees classification and regression trees cart are commonly used decision tree algorithms developed by leo breiman belgiu and drăguţ 2016 breiman 2001 cart models are used for categorical and regressive predictive modeling cart is based on a decision tree structure that begins with the entire set of training data at the root node each split of the tree creates non terminal daughter nodes until terminating at leaf nodes which are a unique prediction of the target variable breiman 2001 knoll et al 2019 the cart algorithm determines the variables used for splitting where split points are located and the shape of the tree hastie et al 2017 single large decision trees have a tendency to overfit the data the cart algorithm is advantageous over more basic decision tree models because it prunes large trees to create a smaller tree with a lower error rate hastie et al 2017 because the cart model prediction outcome is based on the results from a single pruned tree its predictive performance is sometimes lower than ensemble methods which are based on the outcome of hundreds of trees the cart approach lays the foundation for ensemble methods such as rf and brt and is therefore evaluated in the present study as a basic model for comparison 2 6 2 random forest random forest rf is a machine learning algorithm based on multiple decision trees which are considered collectively and as a result the technique is sometimes referred to as an ensemble learning method breiman 2001 trees are built from random selection variables using training data the approach can be used to predict categorical or continuous data from many predictor variables since rf relies on averaging the results from multiple randomly constructed carts to make a prediction it generally shows greater accuracy and less overfitting than models based on single cart trees naghibi et al 2016 in the process of rf regression a set number b of regression trees tb are grown and the outputs are then averaged the regression prediction for a new data point x is defined by the following equation hastie et al 2017 f ˆ b r f x 1 b b 1 b t b x each tree is trained on a random subset of 75 of the training data then the excluded one quarter of the data known as out of bag data is run back through the tree out of bag errors indicate how well each tree can predict the excluded features 2 6 3 boosted regression trees brt like rf a brt model uses the results from hundreds of multiple decision trees unlike rf brt is a sequentially constructed model that considers the residuals of the previous trees when constructing a new tree if input data is successfully modeled in a tree that data then has a higher chance of being included in the subsequent tree thereby boosting the model hastie et al 2017 brt also deviates from the rf model in which inputs have an equal and random probability of being included in any one tree and are not dependent on the outcomes of previously constructed trees brt hyperparameters include the tree complexity to determine the number of splits in a tree the learning rate which sets how much the outcome of one tree can influence how a future tree is assembled and the minimum number of observations at the leaves or terminal nodes of the trees elith et al 2008 mosavi et al 2020 2 7 model construction testing and evaluation after joining buffered well point data with explanatory variables into a data frame the data was split into a training set 80 n 10 652 and a testing set 20 n 2 662 using a data partitioning function from the caret package kuhn et al 2018 the set seed function in r was used to make sure that the same random split of data was used to train each of the different models r core team 2020 to reduce overfitting and bias we used the caret package traincontrol function to conduct a three times repeated 10 fold cross validation on the training dataset using all twenty input variables table 1 kuhn et al 2018 to create the cross validation folds the training data was repeatedly and randomly split into 10 smaller sets with 25 of the training data held out as a validation test set fig 3 the final hyperparameters that we selected were based on the lowest rmse value from the cross validated training runs the range of tuning parameters used to adjust the models during the tuning phase and the final hyperparameters used to construct the models are in table 2 since tree based models are known to underpredict high concentrations and overpredict low concentrations we applied empirical distribution matching edm bias correction edm couples values from the cumulative distribution functions of both the observed and predicted tcp values to correct systemic bias belitz and stackelberg 2021 and has been previously used in tree based decision models to predict groundwater nitrate levels ransom et al 2022 finally the three models with and without bias correction were evaluated against one another for overall predictive performance using caret functions for common metrics to compare machine learning algorithms mean absolute error mae root mean squared error rmse and the coefficient of determination r2 kuhn et al 2018 knoll et al 2019 nolan et al 2015 for the model with the lowest mae and rmse values and highest r2 value a variable importance plot was constructed to show how important each variable is in predicting tcp levels fig 5 additionally partial dependence plots helped us to understand the relationship between a single variable and tcp predictions sm fig s4 3 results and discussion california s central valley has some of the highest numbers of drinking water violations from a variety of contaminants in the state balazs 2010 the proportion of central valley wells that test above the mcl for tcp is over 10 higher than the california average love 2019 tcp was a trace impurity in 1 2 dcp fumigant formulations and as the actual concentration of tcp may have been as high as 7 and as low as 0 17 a high and low estimate is provided in the mass balance model see table 3 and sm fig s2 oki and giambelluca 1987 zebarth et al 1998 the estimated mass of tcp accumulated over 30 years accounting for diffusive loss to surroundings is 110 000 4 300 000 kg of tcp this balance focuses on diffusive loss as tcp s koc is low 2 2 5 as such sorption to soil organic matter is relatively low and unlikely to substantially hinder tcp transport to groundwater mital 2014 moreover the machine learning model we use shows that hydrologic soil type and drainage characteristics are relatively unimportant predictors of tcp in groundwater fig 5 finally although fumigant residues have been detected in plants since fumigants are generally applied before crops are planted plant uptake is considered negligible and not considered by this model 3 1 decision tree models 3 1 1 summary statistics for tcp well data used for model training the tcp concentration for the well point data n 13 314 used to train the models ranged from 0 0025 to 60 μg l with a median concentration of 0 0025 μg l and a mean concentration of 0 24 μg l of the different well categories municipal were the most abundant 47 followed by monitoring 43 other water supply 8 and domestic 2 monitoring wells had the highest mean concentration of tcp at 0 44 μg l followed by domestic 0 097 μg l municipal 0 090 μg l and other water supply 0 011 μg l well depths ranged from 8 2 to 2100 feet with a median and mean depth of 90 feet and 180 feet respectively sm table s4 3 1 2 buffer zone comparison each of the tested decision tree models is based on a set of explanatory variables surrounding groundwater well points for each model three different buffer zones 500 m 1000 m and 1500 m were tested around those well points and evaluated for predictive performance for the testing data using mae rmse and r2 metrics initial modeling results found little difference in model performance between buffer sizes slightly higher r2 values and lower rmse and mae values occurred in a 1000 m buffer zone sm fig s3 using a 500 m buffer zone produces the lowest r2 value except for the single tree cart model in which the 1500 m buffer yields the poorest performance 3 1 3 predicted performance the models predictive performance results are presented in sm table s8 for both training and testing data of the models tested the rf model produces the best predictions with the highest mean r2 value of 0 44 and the lowest mae 0 43 and rmse 0 72 values as expected the single tree cart model is the least accurate with an r2 of 0 020 and higher mae and rmse values than either of the rf models although the brt models have performed better than the rf model for nitrate prediction in the central valley ransom et al 2017b for tcp the brt r2 value 0 41 is slightly lower than that of the rf model 0 44 sm table s8 the observed tcp concentration versus the predicted tcp concentration for the training and hold out testing data for all models is plotted in fig 4 ideally the plotted points should be close to the regression line and equally scattered above and below it however actual results are dispersed for the testing data sets while not surprising considering the range of tcp concentration values 0 0025 60 μg l increasing variance with larger concentration limits the model s ability to make accurate predictions and future models may consider a narrower range of tcp concentrations to train the model the r2 random forest model performance result for the training data is similar to the results from studies using similar decision tree methods to predict concentrations of other agricultural contaminants such as nitrate knoll et al 2019 ling et al 2022 ransom et al 2017a the predictive performance values for the training data set show significantly better results than for the test data for all three models but the largest difference between training and testing predictive performance is the brt model indicating an overfit to training data slightly more than the other tested models 3 1 4 variable importance tables and partial dependence plots the performance of explanatory variables fig 5 shows how well each variable performs in splitting the decision trees to predict tcp concentration for the rf model which had a higher predictive performance than the cart or brt models the most influential predictors categories are annual precipitation amount from 2005 1990 1960 and 1975 two groundwater redox variables indicating the probability of dissolved oxygen levels being below 2 mg l and 0 5 mg l and nitrate as estimated from concentration at 180 feet depth the finding agrees with an earlier study that found precipitation and redox state to be the factors most associated with detecting volatile organic compounds in domestic wells rowe et al 2007 partial dependence plots for predictor variables allowed us to explore the individual relationships between a variable and its influence on the model sm fig s4 the importance of precipitation the most influential category shows that the highest concentrations of tcp are associated with the lowest rainfall levels for all years the two top predictors precipitation during 2005 and 1990 are for years after tcp would have ceased to be applied so it may follow that higher rainfall could have diluted wells already contaminated with tcp with higher tcp levels in wells with lower recharge rates additionally the highest modeled tcp concentrations are in the southern area of the central valley where precipitation rates are relatively low but with large swaths of land use developed for orchards and row crops precipitation during 1960 and 1975 shows a different trend with an unsymmetric v shaped curve for these years although the highest tcp levels are still associated with the lowest levels of rainfall tcp levels dip and then show an upward trend with rising precipitation amounts tcp was still being actively applied during 1960 1975 and therefore the connection between high precipitation levels and high tcp concentration may be because high levels of precipitation may have led to an increased chance that tcp leached from soil fractions into the water table and may have been the case during years when tcp was actively applied and when the concentration of tcp in the soil would have been the highest lewan et al 2009 mcgrath et al 2010 ney 1990 this tendency may have been especially true in well drained soils with high infiltration rates bailey et al 1974 the upward trend may also be related to observed training points with very high 20 μg l tcp levels in urban areas near stockton and sacramento california contamination in these wells may be due to the past industrial use of tcp or because they are in the northern sections of the central valley where precipitation rates are higher the multi faceted relationship between tcp levels and precipitation may also be confounded by the presence of undissolved tcp in the unsaturated zone where water tables rise during precipitation events and groundwater may become periodically recharged with tcp partial dependence plots for the second highest importance category redox state show a u shaped trend with high tcp levels in groundwater with a high probability of being oxic and anoxic with the lowest tcp concentrations at mid level probabilities that dissolved oxygen levels are below a 2 mg l or a 0 5 mg l threshold this finding partially agrees with previous research which has shown that tcp is found at higher concentrations in oxic groundwater due to the prevention of the chemical transformation of tcp which may occur in anoxic conditions burow et al 2019 higher concentrations of tcp in anoxic groundwater may be the result of the lateral migration of tcp towards the central valley central axis trough region which is more associated with anoxic groundwater ransom et al 2017a rosecrans et al 2018 the third most influential prediction category nitrate levels underscores that the principal source of tcp in cvar groundwater is related to the agricultural use of fumigants as opposed to tcp s use as an industrial solvent burow et al 2019 partial dependence plots show that higher tcp levels are positively associated with higher levels of the co contaminant nitrate the plots also show a spike in concentration at very low levels which may be the result of industrial uses of tcp as a lubricant and degreaser burow et al 2019 less influential factors include irrigation groundwater age and land use classes irrigation may have had less of an influence as application instructions for the fumigant in which tcp was contained advised growers to leave treated soil undisturbed for at least 7 14 days specifically noting that wet soil disturbs the diffusion process usepa 1973 land use may be less influential than expected because agricultural land use layers used were for discrete years with a 15 year gap between years 1945 1960 1974 1990 2005 and therefore may not reflect the actual crop types in a particular area during the years when tcp would have been applied furthermore the decision to use fumigants that would have contained tcp would have been influenced by the affordability and availability of the fumigants and the differences in tcp concentration from batch to batch 3 1 5 median tcp concentration by agricultural land use although the relative importance of specific agricultural land designation by crop type is low we compared specific crop types directly to tcp levels in surrounding wells the land use in a 1000 m buffer zone around well points was used to calculate the median tcp concentration in μg l in groundwater under particular crop types sm table s8 and fig s2 we found that in the central valley regardless of year the highest median tcp concentration 0 03 μg l occurs in groundwater below vineyards compared to other land use designations the second highest concentrations are in field crops followed by alfalfa deciduous fruit and nut grain corn sorghum sudangrass and native vegetation the groundwater beneath citrus and subtropical rice truck nursery and berry and urban areas have zero median tcp concentration for all years 3 1 6 spatial prediction of tcp groundwater concentrations our models were largely underpredicting tcp concentrations especially at the lower end of the spectrum applying the edm bias correction resulted in adjustments that increased underpredicted low values reduced overpredicted high values and increased r2 values for the hold out testing data fig 6 sm table s8 the spatial distribution of edm bias corrected tcp predictions for central valley groundwater was mapped to a 50 50 m raster grid for all models fig 7 the rf prediction map which showed the highest performance in comparison to cart and brt indicates that the 0 1 0 2 μg l tcp contamination range makes up the largest total percentage 56 of the central valley aquifer study region groundwater the highest tcp concentration range 0 4 0 86 μg l as predicted by the rf model occurs at the lowest total area of only 1 or 586 km2 sm table s9 and occurs predominately in the southern san joaquin valley region of the cvar approximately 48 of the cvar includes disadvantaged communities dacs as defined by the oehha oehha 2021 the highest modeled tcp groundwater concentration range occurs predominantly in dacs 73 sm table s10 4 conclusions a mass balance using data from historical pur documents indicates that during the approximately 30 years that tcp was applied to agricultural lands 110 000 4 300 000 kg of tcp may have accumulated in the subsurface and leached into california groundwater this tcp groundwater loading estimate is based on two contributing pesticides telone and d d mix however since tcp was an impurity retained after 1 2 dcp was manufactured other fumigants may have also contained tcp and their exclusion may have led to an underestimate of tcp loading additionally future efforts may include irrigation schedules and multiple fumigant application methods such as tarping with plastic following fumigant application this study provides the first ever machine learning model for a volatile contaminant in groundwater it is an important initial analysis and suggests a model for predicting amounts of tcp in the subsurface that can be applied to agricultural regions globally future studies may take advantage of several refinements the models in the present study are trained with wells monitored for tcp using 1000 m circular buffers however future tcp spatial modeling may improve outcomes by using different buffer shapes and by integrating groundwater flow models to capture horizontal migration of tcp in the subsurface while this study includes dissolved oxygen as an indicator of the redox state of groundwater by including a full series of redox indicators such as manganese and iron a clearer picture of the importance of the redox state in predicting tcp in affected wells may result a comparison of crop type and median tcp concentration in 1000 m buffer zones surrounding monitored wells using five historical agricultural land use maps between 1945 and 2005 shows that vineyards have the highest median tcp concentration for all years in the study region however crop type was the least important explanatory predictor for tcp concentration with the rf model future models may therefore consider using land use maps with fewer agricultural categories with the added benefit of reducing the computational cost of training the models the gis based machine learning approach used in this study allows for the prediction of tcp concentration from spatially mapped environmental explanatory variables according to r2 values the three models were ordered in terms of predictive performance as rf brt cart bagged tree models constructed in

introduction groundwater is a vital resource that is used for drinking water irrigation and industrial purposes however it is vulnerable to contamination from various sources including agricultural and industrial activities as well as natural disasters such as floods and droughts groundwater vulnerability refers to the susceptibility of groundwater resources to contamination from various sources such as point sources e g landfills gas stations wastewater treatment plants and non point sources e g agricultural activities atmospheric deposition taghavi et al 2022 several factors can influence the vulnerability of groundwater resources to contamination including the geological characteristics of the aquifer the depth and thickness of the overlying soil the hydrologic properties of the aquifer the types and intensity of land use activities in the area and the presence of potential contaminant sources nearby xiong et al 2022 for example groundwater in a karstic aquifer with fractures and fissures may be more vulnerable to contamination from surface sources compared to a groundwater system with low permeability soils and thick overlying layers similarly an aquifer located in an area with intensive agriculture activities such as fertilizer and pesticide applications may be more vulnerable to contamination from agricultural runoff and leaching aslam et al 2018 moreover groundwater vulnerability can vary over time due to factors such as changes in land use climate and hydrologic conditions for instance drought conditions may cause the water table to drop leading to increased vulnerability to contamination from deeper sources while heavy rainfall events may increase the vulnerability of groundwater to contamination from surface sources nistor et al 2021 table 1 provides a general overview of some common sources of groundwater contamination and their potential effects on groundwater actual contamination levels and effects may vary depending on site specific factors and other variables groundwater vulnerability assessment and risk mitigation strategies are critical to ensure the sustainability of this resource this assessment helps to identify areas that are most susceptible to groundwater contamination from various sources such as industrial agricultural or residential activities bose et al 2023 machiwal et al 2018 groundwater vulnerability assessment is essential to ensure the sustainability of groundwater resources because groundwater is a finite resource and contamination can have serious impacts on the quality and quantity of available water risk mitigation strategies are measures that aim to reduce the likelihood of groundwater contamination and or minimize its potential impacts these strategies may include land use planning pollution prevention measures and remediation technologies land use planning can help to avoid the development of high risk activities in areas with vulnerable groundwater resources pollution prevention measures can include the use of best management practices in agriculture industry and residential areas to reduce the potential for contamination pratik and patel 2023 remediation technologies such as pump and treat in situ bioremediation and phytoremediation can be used to remove or mitigate contamination from groundwater groundwater vulnerability assessment and risk mitigation strategies are critical to ensure the sustainability of groundwater resources because groundwater provides drinking water for millions of people and is essential for irrigation and other uses boulton et al 2023 contamination of groundwater can have adverse health effects and lead to economic losses due to the cost of remediation and the loss of useable water resources by identifying vulnerable areas and implementing risk mitigation strategies we can reduce the potential for contamination and ensure that groundwater resources remain sustainable for future generations haggerty et al 2023 abu kader et al applied drastic method to assess the vulnerability of the amman zarqa basin to contamination abu khader et al 2018 the vulnerability maps showed that the eastern part of the basin is highly vulnerable due to the presence of a shallow water table and high recharge rates in contrast the western part of the basin is less vulnerable due to deeper water tables and lower recharge rates the application of gis based models in the assessment of groundwater vulnerability in the oum er rbia basin in morocco involved the use of several gis tools and techniques to generate a groundwater vulnerability map of the basin jazouli et al 2019 the results of the study can be used to inform land use planning and groundwater management strategies in the oum er rbia basin and other similar regions barakat et al 2016 statistical methods have also been used in the assessment of groundwater vulnerability particularly in the lower mekong basin in southeast asia dang et al 2022 these methods can capture complex relationships between variables and can be used to predict the probability of contamination which can be useful in identifying areas that require further investigation and management wohl and knox 2022 in situ bioremediation was successfully applied in the remediation of a gasoline contaminated site in san diego california usa the site was contaminated with petroleum hydrocarbons including benzene toluene ethylbenzene and xylene btex and total petroleum hydrocarbons tph in the soil and groundwater odermatt 1994 after several months of treatment significant reductions in btex and tph concentrations were observed in the groundwater and soil the in situ bioremediation process was able to achieve cleanup goals for the site and the regulatory agency approved closure of the site talley et al 2022 in guelph ontario canada phytoremediation was used to clean up a site contaminated with trichloroethylene tce a common industrial solvent dehghani et al 2021 these case studies and examples highlight the successful implementation of various vulnerability assessment techniques and risk mitigation strategies in different regions and settings they also demonstrate the importance of site specific considerations in the selection and implementation of these techniques and strategies benisrael et al 2020 this paper provides a comprehensive review of the techniques and applications used for groundwater vulnerability assessment and risk mitigation it aims to provide a thorough understanding of the concept of vulnerability and risk and to review various approaches to groundwater vulnerability assessment including index based methods statistical methods and models based on geographic information systems gis it also discusses different risk mitigation strategies such as land use planning pollution prevention and remediation technologies finally the future directions in groundwater vulnerability assessment and risk mitigation research are highlighted 2 literature search methodology the literature search methodology employed in this review aimed to comprehensively identify relevant articles on groundwater vulnerability assessment and

understanding of the current state of knowledge in groundwater vulnerability assessment and risk mitigation 3 concept of groundwater vulnerability and risk vulnerability refers to the susceptibility of a system to damage or harm from a given stressor or threat maleki et al 2023 in the context of groundwater vulnerability can be defined as the degree to which the groundwater system is susceptible to contamination from various sources such as industrial activities agricultural practices and natural disasters risk on the other hand is the likelihood that a system will experience harm or damage due to a particular stressor or threat zhao et al 2022 in the context of groundwater risk can be defined as the probability of contamination occurring in the groundwater system groundwater is a vital resource that provides drinking water irrigation and industrial water supplies however groundwater is vulnerable to contamination from various sources which can pose a threat to public health the environment and the economy understanding the vulnerability and risk associated with groundwater is essential for effective management and protection of this resource serra et al 2021 vulnerability assessment helps to identify the areas that are most susceptible to contamination while risk assessment helps to prioritize the areas that require immediate action furthermore vulnerability and risk assessment can aid in the development of effective risk mitigation strategies to prevent or reduce contamination by identifying the sources and pathways of contamination effective measures can be implemented to protect groundwater and ensure its sustainability khorrami and malekmohammadi 2021 groundwater is vulnerable to contamination from various sources such as agriculture industry transportation and residential activities fig 2 shows the relative contribution of each source of contamination to the total contamination levels over the years contamination can occur through different pathways such as direct discharge of pollutants into the groundwater infiltration of contaminated surface water or leaching of pollutants from soil and waste materials to protect groundwater and ensure its sustainability it is essential to identify the sources and pathways of contamination lu et al 2019 this can be achieved through various methods such as groundwater vulnerability assessment monitoring programs and modeling groundwater vulnerability assessment evaluates the potential risk of contamination based on the characteristics of the aquifer and the land use in the surrounding area monitoring programs involve regular testing of groundwater quality to detect changes and identify potential sources of contamination modeling uses computer simulations to predict the movement of contaminants in the groundwater system once the sources and pathways of contamination are identified effective measures can be implemented to prevent contamination or minimize its impacts hasan et al 2019 for example land use planning can ensure that high risk activities such as waste disposal or industrial activities are located away from vulnerable areas pollution prevention measures such as the use of best management practices can reduce the amount of pollutants that enter the groundwater system remediation technologies can be used to clean up contaminated groundwater such as in situ bioremediation or pump and treat methods overall by identifying the sources and pathways of contamination effective measures can be implemented to protect groundwater and ensure its sustainability this requires a collaborative effort among scientists policy makers and stakeholders to develop and implement strategies that prevent contamination and protect this valuable resource aydi 2018 nofal et al 2018 4 approaches to groundwater vulnerability assessment 4 1 index based methods index based methods are based on a set of parameters that are combined to produce an index or score that represents the vulnerability of the groundwater system table 2 goyal et al 2021 these methods are based on the principle that vulnerability is influenced by multiple factors such as geology hydrogeology soil properties land use and human activities vu et al 2021 index based methods are often easy to use cost effective and require minimal data inputs making them a popular choice for groundwater vulnerability assessment in many regions torkashvand et al 2021 it is important to complement index based methods with other approaches such as statistical methods and gis based models for a more comprehensive assessment of groundwater vulnerability muhammad et al 2015 drastic method uses a scoring system to assign weights to each parameter and combines the scores to generate an overall vulnerability index each of these parameters is assigned a weightage based on its relative importance in the vulnerability assessment process the weights assigned to each parameter can vary depending on the local hydrogeological conditions rahman et al 2021 the method assigns a rating value to each parameter based on the characteristics of the parameter in the area being assessed the rating values range from 1 to 10 with 1 being the least vulnerable and 10 being the most vulnerable bera et al 2022 the final vulnerability index is calculated by multiplying the rating value of each parameter by its corresponding weightage and then adding the products of all parameters the resulting value ranges from 0 to 100 with higher values indicating higher vulnerability koon et al 2023 nair et al 2022 the god method uses three factors groundwater occurrence overall impact of the vadose zone and depth to water fannakh and farsang 2022 groundwater occurrence refers to the likelihood of groundwater being present in the area this is determined by evaluating factors such as geological conditions soil properties and topography kirlas et al 2022 this is determined by evaluating factors such as land use soil type and depth to groundwater akinlalu et al 2021 the god method is a useful tool for groundwater vulnerability assessment due to its simplicity and ease of use it provides a quick and reliable estimate of the vulnerability of an area to groundwater contamination which can be used to prioritize management and protection efforts sukmawati rukmana bargawa and cahyadi 2020 the sintacs method was developed in spain and uses six parameters soil infiltration depth to groundwater unsaturated zone attenuation capacity hydraulic conductivity and recharge rate each parameter is assigned a score based on its relative importance and the scores are combined to generate an overall vulnerability index busico et al 2017 the sintacs method has been widely used in many parts of the world including europe south america and asia and has been found to be an effective tool for assessing groundwater vulnerability to contamination al aboodi et al 2021 matzeu et al 2017 see table 3 4 2 statistical methods logistic regression is a statistical method used for modeling the relationship between a binary response variable e g contaminated or not contaminated and one or more predictor variables mair and el kadi 2013 in the context of groundwater vulnerability assessment the response variable is typically the occurrence of groundwater contamination and the predictor variables can include various factors such as land use soil characteristics hydrogeological properties and pollutant sources table 4 shows a comparison drawn for statistical models commonly used for groundwater contamination assessment fuzzy logic is a mathematical tool used for modeling systems that involve uncertainty or imprecision nobre et al 2007 in groundwater vulnerability assessment fuzzy logic is used to represent the uncertainty associated with the variables used to evaluate vulnerability in the fuzzy logic method each variable is assigned a fuzzy set that represents its degree of membership in a particular category for example the depth to groundwater variable might be assigned a fuzzy set that ranges from very shallow to very deep with intermediate categories such as shallow and moderately deep once the fuzzy sets for each variable have been defined they are combined using a set of rules that describe how the variables interact to produce an overall vulnerability score pathak and bhandary 2020 in addition the fuzzy logic method can incorporate expert knowledge into the analysis allowing for a more accurate assessment of groundwater vulnerability mallik et al 2021 this is because the method allows experts to provide input on the importance of different factors and their relationships which can improve the accuracy of the vulnerability map produced by the method neural networks are a type of machine learning technique that can be used for groundwater vulnerability assessment in this method an artificial neural network is trained using historical data on groundwater contamination and associated variables such as land use geology hydrology and other factors the ann then uses these data to learn the relationship between the input variables and the output variable alabdulkreem et al 2023 the neural network learns the complex relationships between these variables and uses this knowledge to predict the probability of contamination in new locations panahi et al 2020 the advantage of neural networks is that they can model non linear relationships between variables and can capture complex interactions between them they are also adaptable to changing conditions and can learn from new data azimi et al 2019 4 3 gis based models in the context of groundwater vulnerability assessment using gis based models overlay analysis is a technique used to combine multiple layers of spatial data each representing a different variable or parameter affecting groundwater vulnerability as shown in table 4 duttagupta et al 2020 each layer is assigned a weight or importance based on its relevance to groundwater vulnerability and the layers are combined using a weighted linear combination method to generate an overall vulnerability map the weight assigned to each layer is typically determined through expert judgment or statistical analysis for example a vulnerability map could be generated by overlaying layers representing soil permeability depth to water table land use and proximity to potential sources of contamination such as industrial sites or landfills the layer representing soil permeability may be assigned a higher weight than the layer representing land use as soil permeability has a greater influence on groundwater vulnerability vu et al 2021 the resulting map would show areas with a higher overall vulnerability to groundwater contamination however it may be limited by the availability and quality of data for each layer as well as the subjectivity involved in assigning weights to each layer the analytical hierarchy process ahp involves breaking down a complex decision problem into a hierarchy of criteria and sub criteria and then evaluating the relative importance of each criterion through pairwise comparisons yadav et al 2023 pairwise comparisons involve comparing two criteria or sub criteria at a time and assigning a score to each based on their relative importance the scores are then used to calculate weights for each criterion or sub criterion which reflect their importance in the decision making process the weights are normalized to sum to one ensuring that the criteria are appropriately weighted ashwini et al 2023 the ahp method can be applied to groundwater vulnerability assessment by using it to evaluate the relative importance of different factors that contribute to vulnerability such as soil type land use and depth to groundwater this allows for a systematic and transparent evaluation of the different factors and can help to prioritize which factors should be given more attention in the assessment process however it is important to note that the ahp method relies heavily on the input of the decision maker and the results can be influenced by subjective factors such as personal biases or values masroor et al 2021 additionally the ahp method can be time consuming and complex and may require a significant amount of data and resources to implement effectively multi criteria decision analysis mcda methods can be applied to groundwater vulnerability assessment by first identifying the factors that may contribute to the vulnerability of groundwater aydi 2018 these factors can include land use geology hydrogeology soil characteristics and human activities next weights are assigned to each factor based on their relative importance in contributing to the vulnerability of the groundwater this can be done through a variety of methods such as expert opinions stakeholder surveys or statistical analyses once the factors and weights are determined a vulnerability index is calculated for each location based on the values of the factors at that location and their corresponding weights this vulnerability index can be used to create a vulnerability map which can help identify areas where groundwater is more vulnerable to contamination mcda methods have several advantages in groundwater vulnerability assessment fildes et al 2022 they allow for the incorporation of multiple factors and their weights which can provide a more comprehensive understanding of groundwater vulnerability mcda methods have several advantages over other vulnerability assessment methods such as their ability to incorporate stakeholder preferences and to handle uncertainty and variability in the data however mcda methods can also be complex and time consuming requiring extensive data collection and analysis and may involve subjective judgments and trade offs between conflicting criteria ankana and dhanaraj 2021 5 risk mitigation strategies land use planning is a critical component of risk mitigation strategies for groundwater contamination one approach to land use planning for risk mitigation is to identify and map areas with high vulnerability to contamination such as areas with shallow groundwater highly permeable soils or high levels of pollutant sources easwer et al 2022 another approach is to regulate the type and intensity of land use in areas with high vulnerability to contamination effective land use planning for risk mitigation requires collaboration and coordination among various stakeholders including local and regional government agencies industry community groups and environmental organizations etuk et al 2022 it also requires a thorough understanding of the local hydrogeology soil characteristics and pollutant sources to identify the areas with the highest risk and to develop appropriate risk reduction strategies fig 3 shows the number of contamination incidents before and after implementing land use planning under risk mitigation strategies over a period of ten years surinaidu 2022 pollution prevention another risk mitigation strategy that aims to reduce or eliminate the release of pollutants into the environment it involves identifying potential sources of pollution and implementing measures to prevent or minimize their release mahlknecht and mora 2022 one of the advantages of pollution prevention is that it can be cost effective in the long run as it can help prevent costly cleanup and remediation efforts that may be required in the event of a pollution incident chamanehpour et al 2020 furthermore the success of pollution prevention measures depends on the cooperation and participation of stakeholders including industry agriculture and the public in implementing and following best management practices shrestha et al 2016 fig 4 shows the effectiveness of pollution prevention strategies from various sectors in reducing the risk of groundwater contamination these results suggest that pollution prevention strategies in the agriculture sector have the greatest potential to reduce the risk of groundwater contamination followed by the industry sector on the other hand the household sector has the least potential in reducing the risk of groundwater contamination indicating that more emphasis should be placed on developing pollution prevention strategies for this sector remediation technologies on the other hand are used to remove or reduce contamination in the groundwater system physical remediation techniques involve the removal of contaminated soil or water from the site either through excavation or pumping pradhan et al 2023 chemical techniques use various chemicals to treat the contaminated water or soil such as injecting oxidants or reductants into the subsurface to break down the contaminants biological techniques involve the use of microorganisms to degrade the contaminants such as using bacteria to break down organic compounds the selection of a remediation technology depends on the site specific conditions and the type and extent of contamination present lawrinenko et al 2023 the effectiveness of the technology also depends on factors such as the type and concentration of the contaminants the depth of the groundwater and the hydrogeological conditions of the site pump and treat is a common remediation technology used to remove or reduce contamination in the groundwater system siarkos et al 2021 the method involves the use of wells to pump the contaminated groundwater to the surface where it is treated and then discharged back into the aquifer or to a surface water body this process is repeated until the concentration of contaminants in the groundwater meets the regulatory requirements or the cleanup goals the success of pump and treat depends on several factors including the hydrogeology of the site the type and concentration of contaminants the efficiency of the treatment technology and the regulatory requirements siarkos et al 2021 in situ bioremediation is a remediation technology that involves the use of microorganisms to degrade and remove contaminants from the groundwater system and is based on the natural process of biodegradation where microorganisms break down organic compounds into harmless substances pathania et al 2023 in some cases the rate of biodegradation may be slow and the method may not be suitable for contaminants that are highly toxic or persistent in the environment van stempvoort and biggar 2008 in addition the effectiveness of in situ bioremediation may be limited by the availability of nutrients and other substances needed to support the growth of microorganisms tufail et al 2022 plants can absorb degrade or metabolize pollutants in the soil and groundwater through a variety of mechanisms including phytoextraction phytodegradation and rhizofiltration timalsina et al 2022 this process can be enhanced by adding nutrients or microorganisms to the soil to promote plant growth and microbial activity o connor et al 2019 table 5 provides a comparison of the advantages and limitations of three common remediation methods used for groundwater contamination overall the choice of remediation method depends on site specific conditions and the type and extent of contamination kafle et al 2022 6 advantages and limitations of different approaches vulnerability assessment is an important tool for understanding the susceptibility of groundwater resources to contamination table 6 index based methods are one such approach used for vulnerability assessment aslam et al 2018 these methods involve assigning weights or values to different parameters such as geology land use and soil characteristics to create an overall vulnerability index for a given area bose et al 2023 while index based methods have their advantages it is important to consider their limitations and supplement them with additional methods and data to improve the accuracy and reliability of groundwater vulnerability assessments boulton et al 2023 statistical methods involve analyzing the relationship between various variables that affect groundwater contamination such as land use soil characteristics hydrogeological parameters and human activities haggerty et al 2023 advantages of statistical methods include their ability to capture complex relationships between variables incorporate uncertainty and variability and predict the probability of contamination however statistical methods also have some limitations they require large amounts of data to be effective which can be costly and time consuming to collect machiwal et al 2018 gis based models can also be used for large scale assessments and can integrate multiple sources of data including hydrogeological geological and land use information nistor et al 2021 however gis based models have some limitations they require high quality spatial data which can be challenging to obtain in some areas table 6 compares the advantages and limitations of three commonly used groundwater vulnerability assessment methods index based methods statistical methods and gis based models pratik and patel 2023 risk mitigation refers to the strategies and actions taken to reduce or prevent potential risks to human health and the environment from groundwater contamination table 7 the advantages of land use planning include the prevention of contamination cost effectiveness in the long term and promotion of sustainable land use practices gomes et al 2023 however land use planning may face limitations such as difficulties in implementation due to political and economic factors requiring significant changes to existing land use patterns and may not be effective in areas with pre existing contamination pollution prevention approach involves implementing practices that reduce or eliminate the use of hazardous substances or activities that can lead to contamination pollution prevention strategies can include changes in industrial and agricultural practices such as reducing the use of pesticides or adopting cleaner production methods roy et al 2022 remediation technologies include their effectiveness in removing or reducing contamination the ability to tailor them to specific contaminants and site conditions and the potential to use them in combination with other mitigation strategies ambade et al 2021 however these technologies can also have limitations such as being expensive and time consuming not being effective for all contaminants or site conditions and requiring ongoing maintenance and monitoring rani et al 2021 7 future directions the integration of different approaches such as land use planning pollution prevention and remediation technologies can provide a more comprehensive and effective strategy for protecting groundwater by combining these approaches it is possible to prevent contamination in the first place reduce existing contamination and minimize the risks to human health and the environment groundwater vulnerability and contamination are often influenced by socio economic and cultural factors therefore it is important to consider these factors when developing groundwater protection strategies for example land use planning measures should take into account the needs and interests of local communities while pollution prevention measures should be tailored to the specific practices and industries in the area emerging trends in groundwater protection include the increasing use of innovative technologies such as nanotechnology and electrokinetic remediation as well as the adoption of sustainable practices in agriculture and industry however there are also significant challenges such as the impacts of climate change on groundwater resources and the growing demand for water in many regions of the world addressing these challenges will require a collaborative and interdisciplinary approach as well as the engagement of local communities and stakeholders future research should also focus on the increasing awareness of the potential impacts of emerging contaminants such as pharmaceuticals and personal care products on groundwater resources as new contaminants are introduced into the environment it is crucial to understand their fate and transport in groundwater systems and their potential impacts on human health and the environment this requires continued development and refinement of analytical methods for detecting and measuring emerging contaminants in groundwater as well as a better understanding of their behavior in complex hydrogeologic systems moreover identifying effective strategies for mitigating the impacts of emerging contaminants on groundwater resources is essential for ensuring the sustainability of this critical resource future directions in groundwater management should emphasize the increasing importance of stakeholder engagement and community involvement in decision making processes particularly in regions experiencing water scarcity and the impacts of climate change this approach acknowledges the critical role of local communities in safeguarding their groundwater resources and encourages participatory governance models that foster collaboration among stakeholders furthermore future research should focus on the potential impacts of emerging contaminants such as pharmaceuticals and personal care products on groundwater resources as these contaminants continue to enter our water sources there is a growing need for more advanced detection and treatment methods to ensure the safety of our groundwater supplies incorporating these considerations into future groundwater management strategies will be essential for maintaining the sustainability and resilience of our groundwater resources 8 conclusion groundwater vulnerability and risk assessment is essential for effective groundwater management and protection there are multiple approaches to vulnerability assessment and risk mitigation each with their advantages and limitations successful implementation of these approaches requires careful consideration of site specific factors and community involvement future work should focus on integrating different vulnerability assessment approaches incorporating social and cultural factors and addressing emerging challenges such as emerging contaminants the findings of this review have implications for groundwater management policies and practices highlighting the need for integrated approaches and community involvement researchers and policymakers should continue to explore emerging trends and challenges in groundwater management such as the impact of emerging contaminants and the effects of climate change future research should focus on developing and refining vulnerability assessment approaches that incorporate social and cultural factors further work is needed to develop and implement effective mitigation strategies for emerging contaminants there is a need for greater collaboration between researchers policymakers and communities to ensure effective and sustainable groundwater management declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper

groundwater vulnerability map of the basin jazouli et al 2019 the results of the study can be used to inform land use planning and groundwater management strategies in the oum er rbia basin and other similar regions barakat et al 2016 statistical methods have also been used in the assessment of groundwater vulnerability particularly in the lower mekong basin in southeast asia dang et al 2022 these methods can capture complex relationships between variables and can be used to predict the probability of contamination which can be useful in identifying areas that require further investigation and management wohl and knox 2022 in situ bioremediation was successfully applied in the remediation of a gasoline contaminated site in san diego california usa the site was contaminated with petroleum

understanding of the current state of knowledge in groundwater vulnerability assessment and risk mitigation 3 concept of groundwater vulnerability and risk vulnerability refers to the susceptibility of a system to damage or harm from a given stressor or threat maleki et al 2023 in the context of groundwater vulnerability can be defined as the degree to which the groundwater system is susceptible to contamination from various sources such as industrial activities agricultural practices and natural disasters risk on the other hand is the likelihood that a system will experience harm or damage due to a particular stressor or threat zhao et al 2022 in the context of groundwater risk can be defined as the probability of contamination occurring in the groundwater system groundwater is a vital resource that provides drinking water irrigation and industrial water supplies however groundwater is vulnerable to contamination from various sources which can pose a threat to public health the environment and the economy understanding the vulnerability and risk associated with groundwater is essential for effective management and protection of this resource serra et al 2021 vulnerability assessment helps to identify the areas that are most susceptible to contamination while risk assessment helps to prioritize the areas that require immediate action furthermore vulnerability and risk assessment can aid in the development of effective risk mitigation strategies to prevent or reduce contamination by identifying the sources and pathways of contamination effective measures can be implemented to protect groundwater and ensure its sustainability khorrami and malekmohammadi 2021 groundwater is vulnerable to contamination from various sources such as agriculture industry transportation and residential activities fig 2 shows the relative contribution of each source of contamination to the total contamination levels over the years contamination can occur through different pathways such as direct discharge of pollutants into the groundwater infiltration of contaminated surface water or leaching of pollutants from soil and waste materials to protect groundwater and ensure its sustainability it is essential to identify the sources and pathways of contamination lu et al 2019 this can be achieved through various methods such as groundwater vulnerability assessment monitoring programs and modeling groundwater vulnerability assessment evaluates the potential risk of contamination based on the characteristics of the aquifer and the land use in the surrounding area monitoring programs involve regular testing of groundwater quality to detect changes and identify potential sources of contamination modeling uses computer simulations to predict the movement of contaminants in the groundwater system once the sources and pathways of contamination are identified effective measures can be implemented to prevent contamination or minimize its impacts hasan et al 2019 for example land use planning can ensure that high risk activities such as waste disposal or industrial activities are located away from vulnerable areas pollution prevention measures such as the use of best management practices can reduce the amount of pollutants that enter the groundwater system remediation technologies can be used to clean up contaminated groundwater such as in situ bioremediation or pump and treat methods overall by identifying the sources and pathways of contamination effective measures can be implemented to protect groundwater and ensure its sustainability this requires a collaborative effort among scientists policy makers and stakeholders to develop and implement strategies that prevent contamination and protect this valuable resource aydi 2018 nofal et al 2018 4 approaches to groundwater vulnerability assessment 4 1 index based methods index based methods are based on a set of parameters that are combined to produce an index or score that represents the vulnerability of the groundwater system table 2 goyal et al 2021 these methods are based on the principle that vulnerability is influenced by multiple factors such as geology hydrogeology soil properties land use and human activities vu et al 2021 index based methods are often easy to use cost effective and require minimal data inputs making them a popular choice for groundwater vulnerability assessment in many regions torkashvand et al 2021 it is important to complement index based methods with other approaches such as statistical methods and gis based models for a more comprehensive assessment of groundwater vulnerability muhammad et al 2015 drastic method uses a scoring system to assign weights to each parameter and combines the scores to generate an overall vulnerability index each of these parameters is assigned a weightage based on its relative importance in the vulnerability assessment process the weights assigned to each parameter can vary depending on the local hydrogeological conditions rahman et al 2021 the method assigns a rating value to each parameter based on the characteristics of the parameter in the area being assessed the rating values range from 1 to 10 with 1 being the least vulnerable and 10 being the most vulnerable bera et al 2022 the final vulnerability index is calculated by multiplying the rating value of each parameter by its corresponding weightage and then adding the products of all parameters the resulting value ranges from 0 to 100 with higher values indicating higher vulnerability koon et al 2023 nair et al 2022 the god method uses three factors groundwater occurrence overall impact of the vadose zone and depth to water fannakh and farsang 2022 groundwater occurrence refers to the likelihood of groundwater being present in the area this is determined by evaluating factors such as geological conditions soil properties and topography kirlas et al 2022 this is determined by evaluating factors such as land use soil type and depth to groundwater akinlalu et al 2021 the god method is a useful tool for groundwater vulnerability assessment due to its simplicity and ease of use it provides a quick and reliable estimate of the vulnerability of an area to groundwater contamination which can be used to prioritize management and protection efforts sukmawati rukmana bargawa and cahyadi 2020 the sintacs method was developed in spain and uses six parameters soil infiltration depth to groundwater unsaturated zone attenuation capacity hydraulic conductivity and recharge rate each parameter is assigned a score based on its relative importance and the scores are combined to generate an overall vulnerability index busico et al 2017 the sintacs method has been widely used in many parts of the world including europe south america and asia and has been found to be an effective tool for assessing groundwater vulnerability to contamination al aboodi et al 2021 matzeu et al 2017 see table 3 4 2 statistical methods logistic regression is a statistical method used for modeling the relationship between a binary response variable e g contaminated or not contaminated and one or more predictor variables mair and el kadi 2013 in the context of groundwater vulnerability assessment the response variable is typically the occurrence of groundwater contamination and the predictor variables can include various factors such as land use soil characteristics hydrogeological properties and pollutant sources table 4 shows a comparison drawn for statistical models commonly used for groundwater contamination assessment fuzzy logic is a mathematical tool used for modeling systems that involve uncertainty or imprecision nobre et al 2007 in groundwater vulnerability assessment fuzzy logic is used to represent the uncertainty associated with the variables used to evaluate vulnerability in the fuzzy logic method each variable is assigned a fuzzy set that represents its degree of membership in a particular category for example the depth to groundwater variable might be assigned a fuzzy set that ranges from very shallow to very deep with intermediate categories such as shallow and moderately deep once the fuzzy sets for each variable have been defined they are combined using a set of rules that describe how the variables interact to produce an overall vulnerability score pathak and bhandary 2020 in addition the fuzzy logic method can incorporate expert knowledge into the analysis allowing for a more accurate assessment of groundwater vulnerability mallik et al 2021 this is because the method allows experts to provide input on the importance of different factors and their relationships which can improve the accuracy of the vulnerability map produced by the method neural networks are a type of machine learning technique that can be used for groundwater vulnerability assessment in this method an artificial neural network is trained using historical data on groundwater contamination and associated variables such as land use geology hydrology and other factors the ann then uses these data to learn the relationship between the input variables and the output variable alabdulkreem et al 2023 the neural network learns the complex relationships between these variables and uses this knowledge to predict the probability of contamination in new locations panahi et al 2020 the advantage of neural networks is that they can model non linear relationships between variables and can capture complex interactions between them they are also adaptable to changing conditions and can learn from new data azimi et al 2019 4 3 gis based models in the context of groundwater vulnerability assessment using gis based models overlay analysis is a technique used to combine multiple layers of spatial data each representing a different variable or parameter affecting groundwater vulnerability as shown in table 4 duttagupta et al 2020 each layer is assigned a weight or importance based on its relevance to groundwater vulnerability and the layers are combined using a weighted linear combination method to generate an overall vulnerability map the weight assigned to each layer is typically determined through expert judgment or statistical analysis for example a vulnerability map could be generated by overlaying layers representing soil permeability depth to water table land use and proximity to potential sources of contamination such as industrial sites or landfills the layer representing soil permeability may be assigned a higher weight than the layer representing land use as soil permeability has a greater influence on groundwater vulnerability vu et al 2021 the resulting map would show areas with a higher overall vulnerability to groundwater contamination however it may be limited by the availability and quality of data for each layer as well as the subjectivity involved in assigning weights to each layer the analytical hierarchy process ahp involves breaking down a complex decision problem into a hierarchy of criteria and sub criteria and then evaluating the relative importance of each criterion through pairwise comparisons yadav et al 2023 pairwise comparisons involve comparing two criteria or sub criteria at a time and assigning a score to each based on their relative importance the scores are then used to calculate weights for each criterion or sub criterion which reflect their importance in the decision making process the weights are normalized to sum to one ensuring that the criteria are appropriately weighted ashwini et al 2023 the ahp method can be applied to groundwater vulnerability assessment by using it to evaluate the relative importance of different factors that contribute to vulnerability such as soil type land use and depth to groundwater this allows for a systematic and transparent evaluation of the different factors and can help to prioritize which factors should be given more attention in the assessment process however it is important to note that the ahp method relies heavily on the input of the decision maker and the results can be influenced by subjective factors such as personal biases or values masroor et al 2021 additionally the ahp method can be time consuming and complex and may require a significant amount of data and resources to implement effectively multi criteria decision analysis mcda methods can be applied to groundwater vulnerability assessment by first identifying the factors that may contribute to the vulnerability of groundwater aydi 2018 these factors can include land use geology hydrogeology soil characteristics and human activities next weights are assigned to each factor based on their relative importance in contributing to the vulnerability of the groundwater this can be done through a variety of methods such as expert opinions stakeholder surveys or statistical analyses once the factors and weights are determined a vulnerability index is calculated for each location based on the values of the factors at that location and their corresponding weights this vulnerability index can be used to create a vulnerability map which can help identify areas where groundwater is more vulnerable to contamination mcda methods have several advantages in groundwater vulnerability assessment fildes et al 2022 they allow for the incorporation of multiple factors and their weights which can provide a more comprehensive understanding of groundwater vulnerability mcda methods have several advantages over other vulnerability assessment methods such as their ability to incorporate stakeholder preferences and to handle uncertainty and variability in the data however mcda methods can also be complex and time consuming requiring extensive data collection and analysis and may involve subjective judgments and trade offs between conflicting criteria ankana and dhanaraj 2021 5 risk mitigation strategies land use planning is a critical component of risk mitigation strategies for groundwater contamination one approach to land use planning for risk mitigation is to identify and map areas with high vulnerability to contamination such as areas with shallow groundwater highly permeable soils or high levels of pollutant sources easwer et al 2022 another approach is to regulate the type and intensity of land use in areas with high vulnerability to contamination effective land use planning for risk mitigation requires collaboration and coordination among various stakeholders including local and regional government agencies industry community groups and environmental organizations etuk et al 2022 it also requires a thorough understanding of the local hydrogeology soil characteristics and pollutant sources to identify the areas with the highest risk and to develop appropriate risk reduction strategies fig 3 shows the number of contamination incidents before and after implementing land use planning under risk mitigation strategies over a period of ten years surinaidu 2022 pollution prevention another risk mitigation strategy that aims to reduce or eliminate the release of pollutants into the environment it involves identifying potential sources of pollution and implementing measures to prevent or minimize their release mahlknecht and mora 2022 one of the advantages of pollution prevention is that it can be cost effective in the long run as it can help prevent costly cleanup and remediation efforts that may be required in the event of a pollution incident chamanehpour et al 2020 furthermore the success of pollution prevention measures depends on the cooperation and participation of stakeholders including industry agriculture and the public in implementing and following best management practices shrestha et al 2016 fig 4 shows the effectiveness of pollution prevention strategies from various sectors in reducing the risk of groundwater contamination these results suggest that pollution prevention strategies in the agriculture sector have the greatest potential to reduce the risk of groundwater contamination followed by the industry sector on the other hand the household sector has the least potential in reducing the risk of groundwater contamination indicating that more emphasis should be placed on developing pollution prevention strategies for this sector remediation technologies on the other hand are used to remove or reduce contamination in the groundwater system physical remediation techniques involve the removal of contaminated soil or water from the site either through excavation or pumping pradhan et al 2023 chemical techniques use various chemicals to treat the contaminated water or soil such as injecting oxidants or reductants into the subsurface to break down the contaminants biological techniques involve the use of microorganisms to degrade the contaminants such as using bacteria to break down organic compounds the selection of a remediation technology depends on the site specific conditions and the type and extent of contamination present lawrinenko et al 2023 the effectiveness of the technology also depends on factors such as the type and concentration of the contaminants the depth of the groundwater and the hydrogeological conditions of the site pump and treat is a common remediation technology used to remove or reduce contamination in the groundwater system siarkos et al 2021 the method involves the use of wells to pump the contaminated groundwater to the surface where it is treated and then discharged back into the aquifer or to a surface water body this process is repeated until the concentration of contaminants in the groundwater meets the regulatory requirements or the cleanup goals the success of pump and treat depends on several factors including the hydrogeology of the site the type and concentration of contaminants the efficiency of the treatment technology and the regulatory requirements siarkos et al 2021 in situ bioremediation is a remediation technology that involves the use of microorganisms to degrade and remove contaminants from the groundwater system and is based on the natural process of biodegradation where microorganisms break down organic compounds into harmless substances pathania et al 2023 in some cases the rate of biodegradation may be slow and the method may not be suitable for contaminants that are highly toxic or persistent in the environment van stempvoort and biggar 2008 in addition the effectiveness of in situ bioremediation may be limited by the availability of nutrients and other substances needed to support the growth of microorganisms tufail et al 2022 plants can absorb degrade or metabolize pollutants in the soil and groundwater through a variety of mechanisms including phytoextraction phytodegradation and rhizofiltration timalsina et al 2022 this process can be enhanced by adding nutrients or microorganisms to the soil to promote plant growth and microbial activity o connor et al 2019 table 5 provides a comparison of the advantages and limitations of three common remediation methods used for groundwater contamination overall the choice of remediation method depends on site specific conditions and the type and extent of contamination kafle et al 2022 6 advantages and limitations of different approaches vulnerability assessment is an important tool for understanding the susceptibility of groundwater resources to contamination table 6 index based methods are one such approach used for vulnerability assessment aslam et al 2018 these methods involve assigning weights or values to different parameters such as geology land use and soil characteristics to create an overall vulnerability index for a given area bose et al 2023 while index based methods have their advantages it is important to consider their limitations and supplement them with additional methods and data to improve the accuracy and reliability of groundwater vulnerability assessments boulton et al 2023 statistical methods involve analyzing the relationship between various variables that affect groundwater contamination such as land use soil characteristics hydrogeological parameters and human activities haggerty et al 2023 advantages of statistical methods include their ability to capture complex relationships between variables incorporate uncertainty and variability and predict the probability of contamination however statistical methods also have some limitations they require large amounts of data to be effective which can be costly and time consuming to collect machiwal et al 2018 gis based models can also be used for large scale assessments and can integrate multiple sources of data including hydrogeological geological and land use information nistor et al 2021 however gis based models have some limitations they require high quality spatial data which can be challenging to obtain in some areas table 6 compares the advantages and limitations of three commonly used groundwater vulnerability assessment methods index based methods statistical methods and gis based models pratik and patel 2023 risk mitigation refers to the strategies and actions taken to reduce or prevent potential risks to human health and the environment from groundwater contamination table 7 the advantages of land use planning include the prevention of contamination cost effectiveness in the long term and promotion of sustainable land use practices gomes et al 2023 however land use planning may face limitations such as difficulties in implementation due to political and economic factors requiring significant changes to existing land use patterns and may not be effective in areas with pre existing contamination pollution prevention approach involves implementing practices that reduce or eliminate the use of hazardous substances or activities that can lead to contamination pollution prevention strategies can include changes in industrial and agricultural practices such as reducing the use of pesticides or adopting cleaner production methods roy et al 2022 remediation technologies include their effectiveness in removing or reducing contamination the ability to tailor them to specific contaminants and site conditions and the potential to use them in combination with other mitigation strategies ambade et al 2021 however these technologies can also have limitations such as being expensive and time consuming not being effective for all contaminants or site conditions and requiring ongoing maintenance and monitoring rani et al 2021 7 future directions the integration of different approaches such as land use planning pollution prevention and remediation technologies can provide a more comprehensive and effective strategy for protecting groundwater by combining these approaches it is possible to prevent contamination in the first place reduce existing contamination and minimize the risks to human health and the environment groundwater vulnerability and contamination are often influenced by socio economic and cultural factors therefore it is important to consider these factors when developing groundwater protection strategies for example land use planning measures should take into account the needs and interests of local communities while pollution prevention measures should be tailored to the specific practices and industries in the area emerging trends in groundwater protection include the increasing use of innovative technologies such as nanotechnology and electrokinetic remediation as well as the adoption of sustainable practices in agriculture and industry however there are also significant challenges such as the impacts of climate change on groundwater resources and the growing demand for water in many regions of the world addressing these challenges will require a collaborative and interdisciplinary approach as well as the engagement of local communities and stakeholders future research should also focus on the increasing awareness of the potential impacts of emerging contaminants such as pharmaceuticals and personal care products on groundwater resources as new contaminants are introduced into the environment it is crucial to understand their fate and transport in groundwater systems and their potential impacts on human health and the environment this requires continued development and refinement of analytical methods for detecting and measuring emerging contaminants in groundwater as well as a better understanding of their behavior in complex hydrogeologic systems moreover identifying effective strategies for mitigating the impacts of emerging contaminants on groundwater resources is essential for ensuring the sustainability of this critical resource future directions in groundwater management should emphasize the increasing importance of stakeholder engagement and community involvement in decision making processes particularly in regions experiencing water scarcity and the impacts of climate change this approach acknowledges the critical role of local communities in safeguarding their groundwater resources and encourages participatory governance models that foster collaboration among stakeholders furthermore future research should focus on the potential impacts of emerging contaminants such as pharmaceuticals and personal care products on groundwater resources as these contaminants continue to enter our water sources there is a growing need for more advanced detection and treatment methods to ensure the safety of our groundwater supplies incorporating these considerations into future groundwater management strategies will be essential for maintaining the sustainability and resilience of our groundwater resources 8 conclusion groundwater vulnerability and risk assessment is essential for effective groundwater management and protection there are multiple approaches to vulnerability assessment and risk mitigation each with their advantages and limitations successful implementation of these approaches requires careful consideration of site specific factors and community involvement future work should focus on integrating different vulnerability assessment approaches incorporating social and cultural factors and addressing emerging challenges such as emerging contaminants the findings of this review have implications for groundwater management policies and practices highlighting the need for integrated approaches and community involvement researchers and policymakers should continue to explore emerging trends and challenges in groundwater management such as the impact of emerging contaminants and the effects of climate change future research should focus on developing and refining vulnerability assessment approaches that incorporate social and cultural factors further work is needed to develop and implement effective mitigation strategies for emerging contaminants there is a need for greater collaboration between researchers policymakers and communities to ensure effective and sustainable groundwater management declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper 
11648,spring ecosystems provide vital services to humans and wildlife in northern arizona management of springs presents unique challenges due to the diversity of stakeholders and the multiple uses of springs we employ two methods of data collection to understand the perceptions of springs ecosystem management interviews and focus groups with stakeholders of springs in coconino national forest cnf and kaibab national forest knf and a national survey aimed towards public perceptions we analyze the human perceptions of springs to understand variations between stakeholders and how perceptions of stakeholders and the public vary our results indicate differences between human perceptions and current management practices the main competing interests of springs management are cattle grazing recreation and indigenous nations cultural significance the survey respondents representative of public perceptions indicate springs management for indigenous nations cultural significance is important we see positive correlation between concern for threats to springs from grazing and management to prioritize cultural significance indicating respondents prefer springs to be managed for cultural significance cattle grazing and other high impact human uses are viewed less favorably than other management scenarios stakeholders perceptions varied and non indigenous stakeholders suggested management should be based on multiple uses and management focused on specific attributes of springs valuable to humans our results of the survey respondents perceptions for management of indigenous culture and some support from stakeholders show a joint management concept might be beneficial for springs management in the cnf and knf using the information we collected on the perceptions of spring ecosystems management we discuss mechanisms for springs management to increase the ability for springs to provide cultural significance values to indigenous nations by potentially limiting high impact and degrading uses of springs we provide results and examples of how all stakeholders can have the ability to benefit from the resources springs provide graphical

impoverished regions and indigenous peoples around the world cantonati et al 2020 khadka and pathak 2021 kumar 2022 gowing et al 2020 a reduction in springs discharge due to human causes has been observed in the communities that heavily rely on the fresh water springs provide jeelani et al 2021 current literature on springs and other sources of groundwater on a global scale primarily examines indicators of water quality to be used in management laskar et al 2022 taloor et al 2020 ansari et al 2015 chandrajith et al 2020 management of spring ecosystems as essential water sources is important as springs provide a reliable flow of water in the face of climate change margeta 2022 however analyses into the human dimensions of springs can provide further context to better manage these systems understanding threats and documenting the human perspectives of springs management can lead to capacity development scheihing et al 2022 enhancing the sustainability of these groundwater systems by connecting it to human interactions the united nations un outlines 17 goals for sustainable development united nations 2023 the sixth goal is clean water and sanitation which directly relates to research we present specifically target 6 6 is to protect and restore water related ecosystems including mountains forests wetlands rivers aquifers and lakes united nations 2023 our research contributes unique interdisciplinary research directly related to protecting groundwater dependent ecosystems the global sustainability goals which the un has deemed important places our research in a global context and our methods can be a framework for future research around the world to ensure the protection of groundwater dependent ecosystems incorporating human perceptions into environmental management is crucial for effective and equitable policy making on public land bremer et al 2015 the us forest service usfs manages 781 043 square kilometers of land across the united states for various uses and purposes usda 2013 caring for the land and serving the people is the usfs s motto while protecting the natural resources of the land and promoting research on forest resource utilization usda 2019 the main competing interests that springs can be managed for in the coconino and kaibab national forests are indigenous nations cultural significance recreation and ranching our objective is to understand the human perceptions of those interests to inform policy decision making on these public lands our goal is for our results to provide context and contribute to the current gap in the literature related to the human dimensions of springs ecosystem management we analyze human perceptions for springs management in the coconino national forest cnf and kaibab national forest knf located in northern arizona usa to answer the research questions 1 what are the human perceptions of spring ecosystem management in the cnf and knf 2 how do human perceptions vary between stakeholders 3 how do perceived threats and human perceptions of management vary between survey responses from the public and stakeholders our research contributes to the literature by examining diverse perspectives on the driving forces behind springs management cattle grazing recreation and indigenous nations cultural significance by comparing stakeholder and survey respondent perspectives we highlight differing attitudes towards springs ecosystem management specifically we examine the divergence between management for cattle grazing recreation and cultural significance we engage broad community representation in targeted discussions on the perceptions of springs ecosystem services in addition we developed and disseminated a survey examining human perceptions of springs ecosystem management in the cnf and knf we create a framework that includes a wide variety of data from different demographics and levels of interest in springs ecosystem management information gathered from diverse stakeholders provides an ethical perspective enhances inclusive decision making promotes equity and builds social capital mathur et al 2008 our methods can be adopted to other management challenges across the globe to promote the sustainable development of groundwater resources 1 1 human perceptions and ecosystem services ecosystems can be managed for the services they provide to humans however human uses can compete felipe lucia et al 2018 spangenberg et al 2014 adequately integrating humans into the management of ecosystems instead of treating them as external factors is important for effective land management waltner toews et al 2003 gaining people s perspectives can lead to better management by considering humans and the environment together camberlain et al 2021 bowonder 1987 humans use can negatively impact ecosystems and limit the many benefits they provide therefore merging the social and natural sciences creates a framework for understanding human dominated ecosystems alberti et al 2003 we create a base of knowledge on the human perceptions of spring ecosystems to integrate with the existing literature on the ecological functions and management

et al 2009 berigan et al 2012 developing research through stakeholder engagement is a crucial component for increasing equitable access to natural resources for human uses our research in the cnf and knf provides context to the larger global issue of equitable access to groundwater resources mitigating human caused impacts on ecosystems is more important than ever as degradation from humans increases with landscape simplification and climate change riechers et al 2020 understanding human perceptions of threats reactions to the policies aimed at mitigating them and knowing if constituents are willing to change their own behavior to prevent further ecosystem damage is important information for policymakers leiserowitz 2006 we examine human s perceived threats to springs and gain an understanding on a willingness to restrict their activity using human perceptions promotes equity in management of ecosystems khan et al 2019 bertram and rehdanz 2015 kooiman and bavinck 2005 and mowrer 1996 we examine human perceptions to aid in policy making and equitable governing of spring ecosystems through a mixed method approach implementing and linking people s perceptions and their choices to develop policies is an essential component when managing resources based on human values litina et al 2016 one way to link perceptions to choices is through economic non market valuation mueller et al 2017 currently non market valuation methods used for springs primarily focus on understanding human values through choice experiments mueller et al 2017 while choice experiments are a useful tool to estimate societal benefits the methods may derive incomplete estimates by not taking cultural values and human perceptions into consideration thorsby 2001 and estimates can be reason blind schutter et al 2021 o neill 2013 meaning there is no explanation as to why those perceptions are held our combination of qualitative and quantitative data allows for an in depth approach and can provide reasons for why certain perceptions of springs management are held in this article we provide context for people s attitudes and perceptions toward springs in the coconino national forest cnf and kaibab national forest knf complementing the existing non market valuation literature and offering suggestions on how spring ecosystem management can be improved our results provide valuable information regarding diverse perceptions for spring ecosystem management which can be translated to other environmental management challenges across forests nationwide our research furthers the understanding of human perceptions for springs ecosystem management through analysis of qualitative data from focus groups and interviews with stakeholders of spring ecosystems in the cnf and knf and quantitative analysis of attitudinal questions from a survey nationally distributed and representative of the u s population 1 2 study area located in northern arizona us the coconino national forest

an animal unit includes either a bull steer heifer or cow with a calf usda 2022a 2022b out of the 1 2 million cattle usda 2020 grazing on usfs rangeland around the country and the nearly 9 2 million usda 2022a 2022b total cattle grazing in the united states there are 111 487 authorized animal units of cattle in arizona grazing on usfs land between 367 permittees usda 2020 because of the unique four season climate of cnf and knf compared to the rest of the state recreation is also very prevalent in these national forests both areas are tourist destinations for the southwestern u s and highly trafficked popular recreational activities in the forests and therefore around springs include hiking mountain biking swimming fishing camping birding and boating to indigenous peoples these forests and springs are sites of significance for traditional and spiritual practices including the collection of herbs and medicines origin stories as well as teachings the cnf and knf are home to nearly 700 springs many of which are directly threatened due to human actions paffett et al 2018 extensive data documents the important ecological and hydrologic functions of springs and threats to them stevens et al 2020 2021 springer and stevens 2009 paffett et al 2018 for example human caused degradation of springs includes overgrazing of cattle overuse and trampling by recreationists stream channel disturbances causing increased erosion and decreased water quality spring habitat destruction from human caused wildfires and decreased flow due to climate change and groundwater pumping cartwright et al 2020 donovan et al 2022 perla and stevens 2008 to date little research has focused on the human perceptions for springs in the cnf and knf and the threats that raise the highest level of concern from stakeholders and the public some of the threats include groundwater pumping high impact recreation cattle grazing increased development and drought these issues are similar to issues effecting groundwater systems around the globe ensuring sustainable groundwater development in tandem with social and economically sound human development is an essential component of our research which takes into consideration the value humans receive from spring ecosystems 1 3 spring management in the coconino and kaibab national forest today springs in the cnf and knf are negatively affected by poor management of livestock as well as recreational activities paffett et al 2018 however changes in management and reduction in recreation and cattle grazing can lead to better health of the spring ecosystems paffett 2014 overgrazing has a been a long standing issue in the western u s to prevent further overgrazing and better manage grazeland western ranchers requested grazing districts which led to congress passing the taylor grazing act of 1934 the taylor grazing act of 1934 regulated and restricted grazing on public land stout 1970 today 111 487 cattle animal units are grazing in arizona usda 2020 recreation is also prevalent with 15 244 000 visits in the southwestern region of us national forests alone usda 2021 our data collection and analysis provide evidence for the reasons for support or lack of support for springs management from both the survey respondents representative of the u s population and stakeholders of springs in northern arizona 1 4 indigenous cultural significance and environmental management incorporating the perspectives of indigenous nations continues to present unique challenges to western researchers indigenous nations perceptions are diverse and do not easily fit into dominant western economic valuation estimates because natural resources are seen as living entities and their value rooted in relationships poelina et al 2019 adamowicz 2004 as such indigenous and western approaches and world views are often at odds with one another existence values which are non use values motivated by the morality of knowing the values exists for others benefits davidson 2013 are not purchasable with money or time farber et al 2002 their significance is derived from culture and spirituality creating a non tangible challenge to western research management approaches culture in the framework of environmental management is defined as spiritual enrichment aesthetic experience maintenance of social relations and other non material benefits derived from the ecosystem satterfield et al 2013 lee and diop 2009 environmental challenges including a reduction in springs habitat quality cause very tangible cultural losses to indigenous nations diverging from western methods of economic and natural resource valuation and ensuring adequate participation of indigenous nations significantly prevents problems of inadequate valuation and cultural insensitivity gregory and trousdale 2009 we pursue a coproduction of knowledge by inviting and incorporating indigenous stakeholders views of spring ecosystems and address conflicts of western actors dominating the environmental management decision making process distinctly different from indigenous management practices kauffman and arico 2014 king et al 2015 lewis and sheppard 2006 slaton et al 2019 and charnley et al 2007 management methods considerate of expression of cultural perceptions or experiences can lead to a culturally appropriate and inclusive option for environmental management satterfield et al 2013 there are significant ontological differences in how indigenous stewards of the land approach nature the environment and natural resources as compared to dominant market based approaches commonly pursued in economics and resource management deep engagement and respect for indigenous nations is necessary for understanding and adopting more wholistic and sustainable practices of land management robinson et al 2021 through our deliberate engagement with individuals from various indigenous nations around the cnf and knf we document knowledge values beliefs and management practices which can be used to create more equitable decisions and policymaking related to springs management 1 5 the importance of springs springs in cnf and knf are particularly important because they recharge aquifers which provide resilience against drought and aridification of the drought ridden southwestern us vaux 2010 the recharge of aquifers is related to the hydrogeology of the area and not directly correlated to precipitation alone giving springs resilience for when extremely low precipitation years lead to water shortages vaux 2010 the discharge of springs can vary significantly due to the distance between drainage and recharge areas the hydrology of the area the climate and landcover and land management of the region staśko and buczyński 2018 wyatt et al 2015 while snowmelt and precipitation events can increase discharge that increase can be delayed by years due to sediment and depth of the aquifer making some springs more resilient to extreme drought periods staśko and buczyński 2018 the delayed flow response of springs may obfuscate the impacts climate change has on springs as the impacts of droughts would be delayed as well examining stakeholder management and survey respondents perceptions provides an opportunity to diversify springs management based on human needs and ecosystem functionality making management of springs more inclusive and dynamic 2 materials and methods we implement two types of qualitative data collection focus groups and interviews and one type of quantitative analysis a national survey focus groups and interviews were conducted with stakeholders who work live and rely on springs in the cnf and knf all focus group and interview participants spoke on behalf of their respective organizations or indigenous nation the goal of the interviews was to reach stakeholders who fit under the categories of environmental advocacy groups eag ranchers federal agencies municipal water suppliers and indigenous nations the goal of the survey was to reach survey respondents who were representative of the broader u s population the northern arizona university nau institutional review board irb deemed the national survey focus groups and interviews exempt 1 1 irb number 1804157 5 analyzing qualitative interviews and quantitative national survey results together allows us to understand some of the reasons why certain preferences are held similarly in other fields of study qualitative and quantitative results have been used in combination to answer the same research question this method is often referred to as triangulation morse 1991 one common model for integrating qualitative and quantitative results is to formulate hypothesizes with qualitative methods and test hypothesizes using quantitative methods kelle and erzberger 2004 our methodology is similar the qualitative and quantitative results complement each other in the following ways 1 we use the results from the focus groups to determine the attributes springs can be managed for and subsequently formulate the national survey based on those results 2 we formulate hypothesis tests based on the interviews with stakeholders and use the results from the national survey to test our hypotheses 3 we use the textual evidence from the interviews with stakeholders to provide further explanation of the likert scale results we received from the national survey 2 1 stakeholder analysis it is essential to understand the perceptions of stakeholders for effective multiuse land management seppelt et al 2011 we define stakeholders as separate from the public and those who rely on springs for economic incentives have the authority to manage springs contribute to springs restoration have cultural ties to springs or advocate for different uses of springs stakeholders contribute critical and distinctive insights because of their utilization of and reliance on springs for example ranchers graze at springs on usfs allotments because of the availability of water and grasses which are less abundant in other parts of the forest policymaking is complex and often happens in rapidly changing contexts stakeholder analysis is a beneficial tool brugha and varvasovszky 2000 to include marginalized groups and can complement other approaches for policy making current methods of stakeholder analysis and participation are often deficient in their ability to reach marginalized groups because of lack of information regarding who those stakeholders are and how to effectively involve them in the research process leading to missing substantial and important contributions to the literature and policymaking johnson et al 2004 our study offers unique and inclusive approaches to current studies on springs through implementing targeted sampling outreach and building off existing relationships to deliberately seek out and include marginalized groups ensuring equitable representation our policy recommendations in cnf and knf springs ecosystem management are based on diverse stakeholders perceptions considerable diversity exists within indigenous nations in northern arizona however for this analysis our goal to understand how indigenous perceptions for springs management varies between other stakeholders and the pubic not how indigenous nations perceptions vary between each other in our stakeholder interviews we found no evidence of competing views on springs management between different indigenous nations and therefore discuss the perceptions of indigenous nations together 2 2 focus groups we recruited focus group participants through local network recruiting meaning we reached out to contacts and people from previous working relationships to identify possible participants local networking is effective when some connections already exist casey and krueger 1994 previous years of field work research and relationship building among team members facilitated connections these connections can be reproduced by engaging stakeholders through community events and contracting with various advocacy groups to connect with stakeholders we held two focus groups with four participants each stakeholders included ranchers government agencies environmental advocacy groups and indigenous peoples appendix a generally projects valuing ecosystem services tend to begin with identifying the most important natural elements of the system de groot et al 2002 in our study our main goal for focus groups was to determine the attributes of spring ecosystems most important to the participating stakeholders the focus groups consisted of various stakeholder representatives who were asked three types of questions engagement exploration and exit questions thomas jefferson university 2017 first the engagement questions were used to pique the interest of the group and introduce them to the topic second exploration questions asked who the participants thought constituents of springs were what attributes of springs are important how to level or measure those attributes and a clear and concise definition of those attributes third exit questions gave participants the opportunity to make last comments and ask questions focus groups took place in a conference room on the northern arizona university campus lasted 60 min and consisted of six open ended questions the minutes or notes collected by the moderators were taken individually and shared on a projector for the participants to see we used the results from the focus groups to develop the national survey 2 3 semi structured interviews we use local networking and snowball sampling methods for interview participant recruitment the snowball method is especially useful for reaching vulnerable and marginalized groups who may be less willing to participate in research studies without a personal connection to the interviewers sadler et al 2010 the snowball method is considered culturally sensitive and fosters a trusting environment based on a common connection such as a shared contact between the participant and the interviewee sadler et al 2010 all interview participants were offered lunch as an incentive however some participants preferred a video conference in person office meeting or coffee instead the fourteen semi structured interviews lasted 60 min the questions for the interviews were the same as for the focus groups appendix b during each of the interviews we recorded the stakeholder s affiliation date of the interview and a description of the setting appendix a the setting of the interview could potentially influence the respondents answers however all interviews took place in an informal setting and of the choosing of the interview participant the interview data were collected by written notation when a respondent was not answering a question directly their response was still recorded to ensure all possible data was collected we did not audio record as respondents feel more comfortable and are more open and honest with their responses when they are not being audio recorded byron 1993 harvey 2011 our approach fostered a more trusting and casual environment indigenous culture is not singular and is different among various indigenous nations however for the purpose of the study we examine the differences between perceptions of springs ecosystem management of indigenous nations other stakeholder groups and the american public indigenous nations in our study have cultural significance toward springs although the various traditions and culture surrounding springs varies our methods deliberately engage broad community representation including indigenous nations to understand the various perceptions for springs management in the cnf and knf the data we collect on the human perceptions is used to make policy recommendations that promote equity in the decision making process incorporating indigenous knowledge and integrating indigenous people in this process has proven to be successful and promote equity winter et al 2023 simpson 2017 we present and examine data which supports policy recommendations that have been shown to work in other sustainable development challenges spirituality is very important to indigenous nations value or perceptions of the environment turner et al 2000 through specifically asking questions on how springs can be measured we were able to understand how the spirituality of certain medical plants and ceremonies can be indicators for springs cultural significance we do not intend to speak on indigenous spirituality as outsiders as we do not have the knowledge nor have the right to share it if we did our methods and results attempt to document the significance of spirituality that has been stated by the indigenous interview participants 2 4 national survey we disseminated a national survey designed to analyze the attitudes of the general public towards springs ecosystems in the cnf and knf to complement the interview data of the perspectives of stakeholders familiar with the region measure the perceived threats to springs and the importance of springs we used marketing systems group msg to recruit survey participants that are representative of the u s population through probability and non probability panels disogra et al 2011 survey panels are a cost effective way to obtain a large quantity of complete responses from diverse groups or respondents hays et al 2005 analyzing data from both interviews and surveys together is most effective when the survey questions are focused on the respondents attitudes klausch et al 2013 to this end we designed the national survey to encompass previously recorded attitudes from the focus groups and interviews 3 calculations 3 1 qualitative analysis following the interviews we performed three types of textual analysis on the interview data using nvivo a qualitative data analysis software by qsr international thematic content analysis tca word frequency and sentiment tca automatically identifies common themes in textual data collected from the interviews anderson 2007 tca allows for categorization of textual evidence presenting trends relationships structures and discourse mayring 2000 before performing tca we hand coded what the respondent indicated was most important and the most commonly used phrases and ideas each of the interviewees stated next we ran the automated tca to identify common themes and concepts through tca we report the actual phrases and ideas of the participant anderson 2007 the phrases were kept intact to preserve their meaning tca data were separated into different files organized by stakeholders our approach allowed us to extract the main differences between each of the stakeholders perceptions and sentiments next we used word frequency analysis to document and report the most stated words by each of the stakeholders frequency analysis results justified the themes from the tca the results provided context for the most important attributes of springs given the repeated use of a word and phrase and provided indicators for 1 defensive word use and 2 different uses for springs important to stakeholders the nvivo word frequency tool was used for each stakeholder s recorded responses to obtain the most accurate and relevant results from the word frequency tool we set the parameter of the tool to output the 15 most used words this allowed for a number great enough to display a meaningful range of results while not having too many words convoluting the results lastly automated sentiment analysis in nvivo was used to detect positive negative or neutral phrases in the responses dhakal 2022 a sentiment is an attitude or opinion toward something e g an opinion on the management for recreation at springs mejova 2009 those sentiments can be interpreted as the opinion of the stakeholders saura et al 2018 in our analysis they represented feeling towards management of springs for recreation ranching and indigenous nations cultural significance furthermore we used nodes a term used in nvivo which indicate that a certain passage belongs to a specific topic wong 2008 for sentiment analysis we created a node in each stakeholders file for each of the following topics recreation ranching and indigenous nations cultural significance the automated sentiment tool outputs a chart showing shared sentiments for each of the stakeholders by topic 3 2 quantitative analysis we tested relationships between variables from our survey responses using pearson s chi squared test a commonly used method when comparing categorical variables peck et al 2015 the chi squared distribution is determined by the degrees of freedom and differs for various degrees of freedom turney 2022 the chi squared distribution describes the sum of squared random variables and the distribution starts at zero turney 2022 the chi squared test compares expected frequency no association between variables with the actual frequency to determine a relationship the null hypothesis for a chi squared test is no significant relationship between the variables sharpe 2015 the alternative hypothesis is a relationship between variables the chi squared coefficient is a sum of all the differences between the actual data and the expected data if there is no difference sharpe 2015 the chi squared equation is x 2 o i e i e i where x 2 chi sqaured o i observed value e i expected value the chi squared test is two tailed and does not explicitly state the direction of the relationship tallarida and murray 1987 the chi square test in combination with frequency counts from cross tabulation tables determines a positive or inverse relationship in other words we can look to see if the relationship is with the yes variables or no variables by examining which two of the four numbers in the cross tabulations table have the relationship for example we look at the frequency for the two yes variables and determine that their frequencies are proportional determining the relationship the chi squared test detected we also use cramer s v equation to understand the strength of association between the categorical variables cramer s v statistical measure provides further evidence to support the results achieved through the chi squared test cramer s v is calculated by taking the chi square value and then dividing that number by the sample size and taking the square root of that value field 2013 the numeric value of cramer s v allows us to qualitatively explain the relationship between the variables in the following way field 2013 0 25 very strong 0 15 strong 0 10 moderate 0 05 weak 0 no or very weak using the chi squared test for significance and cramer s v measure of association we test the following relationships concern with threats from grazing and prioritizing management for cultural significance concern with human caused threats to springs ecosystem and willingness to restrict recreation to preserve cultural significance concern with threats from recreation and a willingness to restrict recreation for the protection of spring ecosystems 4 results 4 1 qualitative the results from the national survey were used to compare survey respondents perceptions with stakeholder s perceptions from the interviews results from the interviews show the relationship contrasting opinions and differences in management perceptions from the different stakeholders the following results are from the stakeholder interviews conducted after the focus groups and in tandem with the national survey 4 1 1 rancher stakeholders ranchers consistently defend their ability to access springs and their need to use it for example one of their most frequently used words from the interviews is without 9 often in reference to how impossible or prohibitively costly ranching would be without spring water access how their ranch would not be located where it is without a spring on it and how different the city of flagstaff would be without ranching ranching was one of the early industries of the euroamerican settlement of flagstaff circa 1881 ranches expressed it was a founding industry and integral to the local economy the way in which other stakeholders perceive ranching as a degrading to the ecosystems appears to lead ranchers to be more outspoken ranchers defend their commitment to the environment to the public land they use the wildlife protection of forest health including springs and ranching s ability to enhance other stakeholders activities such as recreation one rancher stated cattlemen are not the enemy of springs to say that is offensive and foolish interviewee 4 to justify their position and defend their ability to ranch on public lands and springs ranchers often mentioned the immense benefits ranching has on the community such as providing food for families land conservation through setting up non governmental organizations ngo and bringing in tax revenue to the city and state from the cattle industry textual evidence from the interviews shows ranchers goals of sustainability are constantly being called into question by other stakeholders while economic incentives and means of supporting their livelihood are reasons behind ranchers perceptions of management of springs we also see a persistent preference to protect ranching lifestyle or as interviewee 11 described it cowboy culture ranchers solidified their stance on environmental sustainability by outlining land stewardship goals emphasizing a choice to run less cattle below usfs limits to ensure they are not overgrazing thus taking forest management into their own hands one rancher stated a good cattleman is exactly an environmentalist interviewee 4 table 1 shows the themes from the stakeholders interviews based on automated sentiment analysis ranchers had mixed 10 sentiments regarding ranching at springs fig 3 ranchers highlighted a noticeable difference in ranching on usfs land versus land they are deeded to for instance one rancher stated other ranchers often show less stewardship on usfs land compared to land they own even though ranchers show less stewardship on the usfs land there are a lot of benefits associated with having these grazing allotments by grazing on usfs allotments during the summer ranchers are able to produce more cattle than they otherwise would be able to leading to positive 54 sentiment results the ranchers responses indicate a strong perception that prioritization of ranching at springs is important interviewee 7 stated that 65 of their water for cattle comes from springs grazing rotations are based around spring meadows and spring fed cattle tanks are essential as no one can make a living constantly running transporting water to cattle interviewee 7 interviewee 7 stated springs provide resilience to the ranch having to drill a well for water could cost upwards of 200 000 be costly to maintain and put a significant financial strain on the ranch our analysis highlights that ranchers value from the springs is potentially significantly greater than the cost of the technological inputs necessary to replace the water flow attribute function of the spring additionally valuing springs in terms of replacement value is an underestimate because of the intrinsic value springs bring to ranchers ways of life culture and the stewardship ranchers strive for the springs they graze at ranchers were persistent in emphasizing the importance for springs on public lands to be managed for ranching the word frequency analysis showed the words need 17 and produce 20 as the most frequently stated words which expressed a need for spring water access to produce cattle interestingly the way ranchers expressed their views of spring water use and resulting threats triggered from other stakeholder s mismanagement of springs automated false negative sentiments the errors needed to be corrected because some ranchers expressed concern and had negative sentiments relating to other stakeholder s management of springs not necessarily relevant to the topic of springs themselves for example ranchers stated forest thinning projects degrade the springs more than ranching which looking at the context would incorrectly output a negative sentiment examples of poorly managed and executed forest thinning operations exist in the cnf and knf in the cnf timber access roads built near or through springs and spring meadows negatively impact springs condition and ability to function as an ecosystem paffett et al 2018 to ranchers poorly executed management strategies are the perceived threats to springs ranchers perceived other stakeholders should also have the right to use springs including wildlife and municipal water suppliers most interviewed ranchers perceived recreationists as constituents who should have access to springs even though ranchers perceive recreationists as causing more degradation at springs than ranchers do for example the trampling of plants litter left behind and overuse by recreationists is a perceived threat of ranchers 4 1 2 environmental advocacy group stakeholders through the tca we identified themes from environmental advocacy groups eag perceiving the importance of springs management for wildlife and that wildlife should be managed for human benefits i e creating opportunities for wildlife viewing hunting and fishing eag is a broad category and can include stakeholders with differing goals for example eags include organizations advocating for wildlife hunting rights and volunteer organizations whose goals align with the usfs eags perceived ranching as a threat to springs eags perceive say ranching as a tradition in the area and economically important to the local economy however ranchers need to pay sufficient prices for their grazing permits to account for the degradation grazing causes in our word frequency analysis cultural 8 showed up as one of the most frequently used words by eags interviewee 8 stated that cultural significance values are often invisible when looking through a standard management lens which makes them harder to manage therefore interviewee 8 supported prioritizing cultural significance in management eag s sentiment analysis supports the themes derived from most of the stakeholders eags show positive 60 sentiments toward management for cultural significance negative 5 and positive 60 sentiments for management for recreation and positive 20 and negative 40 sentiments for ranching figs 2 3 and 4 one explanation for both positive and negative sentiments for ranching and recreation is because the stakeholders categorized under eag are very diverse 4 1 3 municipal water providers and federal agency stakeholders municipal stakeholders and government agencies show similar themes both stakeholders state the economic gains springs provide and recognize springs as essential components that contribute to the health of the watersheds and forests table 1 both stakeholders have responsibility to manage springs and show similar perceptions the sentiment analysis of government stakeholders shows mostly negative 46 and neutral 46 sentiments on ranching and only 6 positive sentiments fig 3 the textual evidence from the interview notes highlights that while the usfs receives revenue from ranchers buying permits the revenue does not totally compensate for the degradation they perceive government agencies perceived concern about some of the poorly managed livestock operations government stakeholders stated springs can negatively affect stream morphology and lead to more erosion problems in addition overgrazing is also leading to more remediation work the government agencies must do 4 1 4 indigenous stakeholders sentiment analysis from interviewees from indigenous nations showed positive 80 and neutral 20 sentiments for cultural significance fig 4 recreation and ranching at springs leads to not only degradation at the springs but also less availability for use by indigenous peoples for ceremonies and other culturally significant practices therefore we see negative sentiments relating to both recreation and ranching from indigenous respondents in addition to the negative 25 sentiments there are some positive 16 sentiments regarding management for ranching at springs some indigenous farmers maintain small herds of cattle and rely on springs to support their livestock furthermore some indigenous nations also lease out grazing rights on usfs land to ranchers responses from interviewees from indigenous nations differed from the other stakeholders in that they perceived livestock watering and management for wildlife as areas of interest and perceived concern shown by the overlapping word frequency results table 2 shows the normalized frequency count divided by number of stakeholders interviewed counts of each of 15 most stated words for indigenous and non indigenous stakeholders red indicates a difference in the top stated words while green highlighted words that are underlined indicate the same 15 most stated word however major differences arise in perceptions of springs management for economic benefits such as large scale cattle production dependent on low cost water supply indigenous nations rely on spring water for subsistence agriculture and the water flow 2 is an important cultural resource compared to other stakeholder s view of spring water as a free water supply focused on economic value 5 4 the discrepancies highlight a stark difference in the perceptions for spring ecosystem management between stakeholders interviewees from indigenous nations preferred springs management that does not separate management for wildlife water flow and culture most other non indigenous stakeholders viewed spring management more like an equation which controlled for each attribute and prioritized human economic values the indigenous interviewees perceived a holistic method for spring management considering the entire ecosystem together as one unit as most important the holistic outlook differs from the perceptions of non indigenous respondents who expressed tradeoffs between attributes differences in perceptions can be summarized with one quote spring water is life this phrase was stated by nearly all indigenous interviewees and emphasizes that spring water and spring ecosystems in themselves are more important than the specific attributes that they can be managed for the phrase itself is deeply rooted in indigenous peoples interactions with settler society and colonialism connecting other aspects of life and is a fundamental part of indigenous culture robison et al 2018 spring water is an essential and integral part of all spring attributes and to life itself so choosing one or some of the attributes for preferred management plan is not synchronous with traditional cultural knowledge another major difference between the indigenous and non indigenous stakeholders was the concept of culture while non indigenous stakeholders mentioned indigenous cultural significance they also consistently mentioned cowboy culture or culture which encompasses cattle grazing hunting recreation and the overall western lifestyle that the forests and the springs within them afford from a settler colonial perspective components of culture have strong economic ties such as the springs importance for the cattle industry and the timber industry founding euroamerican industries of the area perceptions of non indigenous stakeholders for cowboy culture in comparison to indigenous culture significance values again show disconnect between stakeholders about perceptions of springs management table 1 differences between indigenous and non indigenous stakeholders mainly stem from cultural value and perceived importance of what spring ecosystems provide undertraining perceptions from all stakeholders is extremely important to categorize because the relationships they have with springs are derived from different means such as necessity economic benefit culture and enjoyment 4 2 quantitative 4 2 1 survey data we are interested in understanding the public s perceptions of springs ecosystem management to incorporate quantitative analysis of survey data into our mixed methods approach we disseminated a quantitative survey to a total of 1038 individuals through marketing systems group msg we received 751 completed responses from a non probability panel and 287 completed surveys from a probability panel out of those 1038 observations 58 were female 40 were male 5 were residents of arizona and 64 identified as white the median time it took the respondents to complete the survey was 11 5 min 4 2 2 respondent attitudes all survey respondents rated their level of concern for threats to springs on a scale from 1 to 5 1 not at all concerned 2 slightly concerned 3 moderately concerned 4 very concerned or 5 extremely concerned over 80 of survey respondents indicated they were moderately very or extremely concerned with the threats to springs from grazing in addition 62 of survey respondents indicated they were not at all to moderately concerned with a reduction in grazing our results indicate survey respondents generally perceived grazing at springs to be degrading to the ecosystem and were not concerned with the reduced use of springs for cattle grazing when survey respondents were asked are you willing to restrict your own recreation on national forests to reduce environmental degradation of springs from recreation over 84 indicated yes we also asked respondents to select the recreational activities they are willing to restrict to reduce the environmental degradation at springs the top five selected answers were to restrict off road vehicle orv riding 52 hunting 47 boating 37 fishing 37 and camping 36 the responses highlight a willingness to reduce high impact recreational activity to benefit spring ecosystem health we asked respondents are you willing to restrict your own recreation on national forests to preserve springs with cultural significance for indigenous peoples over 83 of the respondents said yes indicating the survey respondents are willing to change their own behavior to support management of springs for indigenous nations 4 2 3 hypothesis tests results from the survey responses show perceptions of springs management supported by a willingness of respondents to adjust behaviors we test three relationships about grazing cultural significance and recreation to further understand complexity of survey respondents and provide evidence for reasons certain attributes of springs management are preferred table 3 to test the public s perceptions of spring s management for cultural significance in relation to perceiving threats to springs we asked survey respondents to indicate their level of concern on a scale of 1 5 where 1 is not at all concerned and 5 is extremely concerned for the following statement prioritizing management to protect springs with cultural significance to indigenous peoples 52 indicated they were very concerned or extremely concerned we also asked respondents to indicate their level of concern for threats to springs from grazing 50 of respondents indicated they were very concerned or extremely concerned for threats to springs from grazing we code the level of concern variable 1 if very concerned or extremely concerned and 0 otherwise we use a chi squared test at a 5 level of significance to determine if a relationship exists between the nominal variables and examine the nature of the relationship using the crosstabulation table table 3 we find a statistically significant relationship between concern with threats from grazing and concern with prioritizing management for the preservation of cultural significance χ2 178 728 df 1 p 0 001 the cramer s v value was 0 415 indicating a very strong association between variables the positive correlation indicates respondents who are concerned about grazing as a threat are also more likely to be concerned about prioritizing management to protect springs with cultural significance to indigenous peoples we are also interested in whether respondents concern for threats to springs is related to potential behavioral responses to support springs management on a scale of 1 5 survey respondents indicated they were very concerned or extremely concerned with the following threats pollution 71 increased development 64 and groundwater pumping 53 we also ask respondents are you willing to restrict your own recreation on national forests to preserve springs with cultural significance for indigenous peoples 84 responded yes we code the level of concern variable 1 if very concerned or extremely concerned and 0 otherwise yes variables are indicated by a 1 and no variables are indicated by 0 we use a chi squared test with a 5 level of significance and calculated cramer s v with the yes or no question individually for each of the threats pollution χ2 88 132 df 1 p 0 001 increased development χ2 55 274 df 1 p 0 001 and groundwater pumping χ2 44 164 df 1 p 0 001 results from the chi squared tests show a relationship and the cramer s v statistical measure shows a strong or very strong association table 3 the survey respondents perceive threats to springs from human caused activities and there is a relationship between perceiving those threats and being willing to restrict their activity for preservation of indigenous culture again highlighting the perception that springs management for cultural significance is important especially when human caused threats to springs are perceived we find a positive correlation between willingness to restrict recreation to preserve springs with cultural significance for indigenous peoples and perceived threats to springs therefore our results show respondents who are more concerned with threats to springs may be more likely to change their behavior to support management changes to test the perceived concerns from recreation to springs and how that relates to the survey respondents willingness to restrict recreation we asked survey respondents the following question are you willing to restrict your own recreation on national forests to reduce environmental degradation of springs from recreation 84 responded yes indicated by a 1 and 16 responded no indicated by a 0 we also asked respondents to indicate their level of concern from threats to springs from recreation 45 of the respondents indicated they were very concerned or extremely concerned again we recode the level of concern variable 1 if very concerned or extremely concerned and 0 otherwise we compared the two variables using the chi squared test and cramer s v to understand if the survey respondents perceptions of threats from recreation made them more willing to reduce their own recreation results show a significant relationship between perceiving threats to springs from recreation and a willingness to reduce own recreation for springs protection χ2 23 952 df 1 p 0 001 the cramer s v value of 0 153 indicates a strong association table 3 results show survey respondents perceiving threats to springs from recreation may be more willing to restrict their own recreation 5 discussion our study examines the human perceptions of spring ecosystems in the cnf and knf we collected compiled and analyzed data from stakeholder interviews focus groups and a broadly disseminated national study to further understand how perceptions vary between stakeholders and analyze differences between the survey respondents and stakeholders results from focus groups indicate three competing interests for springs management in the cnf and knf are cultural significance recreation and cattle grazing we incorporated results from focus groups into a national survey to understand public perceptions of springs management analyzing the results from both interviews with stakeholders and the national survey of the public we see perceptions do vary between stakeholders and the public the variation and differences in perceptions shed light on what different stakeholders and the public perceive as important our results provide insight on the structure of springs ecosystem management and can be used by usfs land managers to use to align human perceptions with springs management while meeting the mission of health diversity and productivity for present and future generations usda 2019 5 1 ranching the survey respondents and ranching stakeholders had different perceptions of grazing ranching on public land has been shown to provide rural communities with economic stability and sustainability pearce et al 1999 which ranchers adamantly stated during the interviews similar to results from other studies whittlesey et al 1993 other stakeholders and the public showed perceived concern about grazing on public land the many competing interests that public land can be managed for create conflict when activities such as grazing and recreation overlap lewin et al 2019 public perception of threats from cattle grazing has led to a decline in grazing permit allocation pearce et al 1999 lewin et al 2019 past examples show ranchers have perceived high levels of concern from overgrazing western ranchers requested regulations and restrictions for grazing on public land which eventually led to the taylor grazing act of 1935 stout 1970 other studies we found support evidence for only one of the following 1 the market value of grazing lewin et al 2019 torell and doll 1991 or 2 the concern for environmental degradation caused by grazing on public land manley et al 1995 hess and holechek 1995 our study contributes perceptions incorporating evidence from both sides of the competing interests of multiuse public land management in a single study the inclusion of the competing interests around grazing provides crucial evidence for policymaking because it incorporates diverse perspectives for the multiple interests and uses the springs can be managed for our results show concern for the threats to springs and potential support for management of springs to preserve cultural significance to indigenous peoples management solutions to limit the number of grazing units include buyout options or conservation permits available on usfs grazing allotments steinbach and thomas 2007 one example of successful grazing limitations on public land is big brow bench ranch on the colorado plateau the grand canyon trust an environmental organization purchased big brown bench ranch in 2005 after acquiring the ranch grand canyon trust destroyed a pipeline from a spring that used to feed the ranch s livestock operation the grand canyon trust does not permit nor graze on the allotment allotments must be grazed at least every six out of ten years cbs news 2005 and haun 2020 regulations allowing other environmental organizations to purchase grazing rights and let them go unused could be a possible market based solution to springs management our finding supports prior studies showing the public perceives grazing not reflecting the full cost of the externalities associated with it which is one of the reasons for lack of public support for grazing permits on public land whittlesey et al 1993 raising the price of grazing permits to account for externalities could increase positive public sentiment without specifically limiting the allowed number of animal units in a particular allotment 5 2 cultural significance most stakeholders and survey respondents perceived springs management for cultural significance as important however one of the major differences is that while survey respondents perceive springs management for cultural significance as important they also demonstrate a willingness to restrict their own use of springs to preserve indigenous cultural significance while stakeholders indicate cultural significance as an important attribute in our focus groups and interviews we found little evidence of willingness from stakeholders to reduce their access or use of springs for indigenous nations however in contrast indigenous stakeholders perceptions for springs management aligned with the public s perception of the importance of springs management for cultural significance stakeholders perceive springs management for cultural significance as important in combination with the strong support from the survey respondents joint management occurs when relevant stakeholders such as government agencies and indigenous nations collectively manage an area with shared rights interests and obligations smyth 2001 joint management in the cnf and knf would provide indigenous nations the ability to manage for attributes of springs aligned with indigenous traditional knowledge and tradition poelina et al 2019 adamowicz 2004 the usfs has successfully implemented joint management in other areas for example the usfs and karuk tribe have collaborate agreements giving the indigenous nation increased access to their ancestorial territory diver 2016 in six rivers national forest in northern california joint management of preserved land is also successful in australia where aboriginal owned protected areas are managed in cooperation with governments to promote social justice community development and the preservation of cultural identity lawrence 1996 castle springs in the knf is an example of collaborated management between the usfs and indigenous nations in northern arizona members of the usfs hopi tribe the north kaibab piute band grand canyon trust and the spring stewardship institute rehabilitated castle springs knf to preserve indigenous culture and increase the biological habitat quality of the spring stakeholders of the spring worked together to accomplish goals to cooperatively plan springs restoration directly implement a plan with collaborators and provide education and outreach about spring restoration to develop closer working relationships between different stakeholders stevens et al 2016 monitoring of joint management frameworks has shown to be successful allowing for traditional ecological knowledge to be implemented in management and supporting indigenous culture identity while meeting conservation goals stacey and izurieta 2010 implementing joint management between indigenous nations and the usfs is a possible solution to address the perceived importance that we found for management of springs for indigenous nation s cultural significance our results of the survey respondents perceptions for management of indigenous culture and some support from stakeholders show a joint management concept might be beneficial for springs management in the cnf and knf an example of prioritizing management of sites with conflicting interests for indigenous cultural significance is devils tower national monument wyoming a site of cultural significance to the surrounding indigenous tribes and habitat for many important plant and animal species linge 1999 to the arapahoe cheyenne crow kiowa lakota shoshone tribes bear tipi bear house bears lodge bears peak is part of oral history and considered a sacred ceremonial place freedman 2007 in 1995 the national monument voluntarily implemented a management plan to restrict climbing of the tower for the month of june the most sacred month for ceremonies by indigenous nations similar management plans can be implemented by the cnf and knf in coordination with the surrounding indigenous nations to prioritize springs sites harboring high cultural significance our analysis of the survey respondents and stakeholder s perceptions provides evidence indicating strong support for springs to be managed for cultural significance implementing similar management strategies could be a possible solution to management for indigenous nation s cultural significance 5 3 recreation recreation on usfs land is significant in 2020 alone the usfs s managed lands received 168 million visits us forest service s national visitor use monitoring program recreation is an important attribute of public land ensuring recreational activities are available while protecting the ecosystems within them such as springs is crucial for not only the ecosystems health but also for continued recreational activities stakeholders rely on springs and can be tasked with management making them stewards of springs using survey respondent perceptions to reduce certain types of high impact recreation can be used in policy decision making to promote less degrading recreational activities without severely limiting the uses and benefits the public and stakeholders perceive stakeholders and survey respondents both recognize the need for access to recreation on public land and demonstrate concern for the degradation that recreation causes the survey respondents representative of the public indicated a willingness to restrict what they perceive as highly degrading types of recreation at springs such as orv riding 52 hunting 47 and boating 37 for springs protection human perceptions are a valuable resource to use when making policy decisions around recreation for instance zion national park in utah allows for public comment on pilot programs which would require visitors to have permits for certain hikes such as angels landing and lava point campground nps 2021 springs can be managed the same way where stakeholders and the public can be given opportunities to indicate their level of concern on specific springs in the cnf and knf being closed off for recreation responses could be used to build off the data we present to further protect spring ecosystem based off human perceptions problems with management of recreation include issues of scale such as the number of visitors size of area and incongruent boundaries morse et al 2009 similar problems can be seen in the cnf and knf where recreation activity is very high and cities neighborhoods and other high trafficked areas are scattered around the forests springs tend to be in some cases in more remote areas compared to popular hiking trails or other activities studies have shown evidence of public support for reduced recreation for ecosystem protection and for higher quality recreation activities schneller et al 2021 over 449 201 square kilometers of land is designated wilderness across 803 induvial areas established with the wilderness act of 1964 the goal of the wilderness act of 1964 is to preserve and protect the natural conditions of specific areas against the threats of increased settlement and increasing populations by limiting or restricting activities similarly the usfs manages for protected sites by creating protected activity centers pac for california spotted owl habitat nest sites roost location and foraging areas are used as indicators for pacs to be implemented berigan et al 2012 one potential management option is to create a cultural significance indicator into pacs for springs national heritage areas designated by congress protect cultural resources on public land and form cohesive management for areas with cultural natural historic and recreational importance laven et al 2010 similar management strategies can promote joint management of cultural resources in the cnf and knf 6 conclusion stakeholders are intimately involved in management and have a strong reliance on springs indigenous perspectives are not equally represented in the management of springs however survey respondents perceived cultural significance as being of importance we saw support from survey respondents for management of springs for cultural significance as well as a marked perception of threats to springs from cattle grazing and recreation spring ecosystem health is essential for the three uses of springs we tested across recreation ranching and indigenous nations cultural significance management focused on preserving the ecosystem health and subsequently allocating the management of springs can reduce threats and ensure equal opportunities for spring users our research aligns the perceptions of stakeholders and the public which can be used to create or formulate management solutions to protect the health of ecosystems without significantly limiting the use of springs as aridification continues across the western united states mankin et al 2021 protection and equitable management of springs becomes even more imperative anthropogenic externalities from groundwater pumping high impact recreation pollution climate change and cattle grazing significantly and negatively impact springs ecosystems which have immense social and ecological benefits our comparison of the perceptions between stakeholders and survey respondents on springs in the 13 759 square kilometers of land between the cnf and knf provide valuable insight for forest management across the 781 043 square kilometers of usfs land around the county our results provide land managers information on land management policies that may be well received by the public our stakeholder results provide understanding regarding which stakeholders may not support policies our results include the valuable and less often incorporated perspectives of indigenous nations including diverse perspectives in policy decision making promotes equity hill et al 2012 ensuring management is rooted in human dimension stakeholders possess the ability to translate the work they have done in other areas of the forests and integrate it into springs management babbitt ranches located in northern arizona established the environmental monitoring and assessment foundation a framework for organizations landowners government agencies to collect data on important environmental features of the landscape and improve issues relating to soil science babbitt ranches donated the foundation along with a 30 acre parcel land to northern arizona university nau frederick 2002 babbitt ranches also demonstrates a commitment to conservation and donated one of the largest conservation easements in the country 161 km2 to the nature conservancy williams news 2021 babbitt ranches arizona game and fish department and the arizona state land department created the sp crater golden eagle conservation complex which protects areas around the nesting sites of eagles williams news 2021 the diablo trust also partnered with researchers from northern arizona university to research the effects that cattle grazing has on grasslands to better manage and protect grassland ecosystems loeser et al 2001 similar programs can be adopted and used to monitor and protect springs on grazing allotments throughout the forests such initiatives can increase the positive perceptions of grazing on public land by diversifying use of springs ecosystem which provide immense benefits to multiple users all while protecting the use of springs for recreationists ranchers and indigenous nations programs similar to the castle springs example mentioned earlier shows the possibility of cooperative efforts between indigenous nations and other stakeholders our research provides insight on the unique differences between stakeholder perceptions the dominance structures that guide management and a complex analysis of the public s perceptions of different attributes that affect springs understanding relationships and differences can help better manage springs and other ecosystem types across the county we contribute comprehensive mixed methods results that can be applicable to other publicly managed lands with multiple stakeholders to ensure indigenous nations have the ability to play a role in policy making on public land capacity building frameworks may need to be developed and applied van der voorn 2008 van der voorn et al 2017 when capacity building frameworks are adopted indigenous voices can be represented stronger and have a seat at the table which promotes equity our research aims to contribute significant human perception data from a wide variety of perspectives for increased equity in policy decision making on public lands however there are challenges to mixed methods approaches a limitation to mixed methods research is that it can often be complex requiring an interdisciplinary team to adequately collect and interpret the results in addition mixed methods research can be more costly due to the extra resources required significance tests such as the chi squared method can be sensitive to sample size while collecting data from all stakeholders is possible reaching all individual stakeholders in the coconino and kaibab national forests would be prohibitively difficult a notable contribution of this study is the purposeful incorporation of indigenous perspectives which have been historically overlooked and marginalized by academia and in research this particular aspect might also be somewhat challenging to replicate however our outreach to indigenous communities will likely allow future researchers to create comparable representation of marginalized groups such as indigenous voices the authors acknowledge there is significant cultural diversity amongst humans van der voorn 2008 including indigenous nations however our analysis examines the stark differences of indigenous nations views on springs management versus other stakeholder groups and the public views from indigenous nations are challenging to incorporate through a western lens our research team leveraged considerable connections experience and community knowledge to recruit focus group participants while we tried to mitigate any misinterpretations from indigenous interviewees it is difficult to capture the essence of indigenous views through methods of western academia and the english language more research on the perceptions of stakeholders and the public together is needed to ensure equitable management of springs in the cnf and knf another limitation to the study is cultural bias the authors of this research are all european american and european and are cultural outsiders to indigenous nations we do not intend to infer or describe any cultural practices not our own for the purpose of this study we examine the differences between indigenous nations as a whole other stakeholder groups and the american public however indigenous cultures are diverse and vary between nations which we are unable to account for in the scope of this study further research and analyses on the differences in the perceptions of indigenous nations would be beneficial and ideally conducted by indigenous researchers such varied approaches would complement our research while differences in perceptions of management particularly management for indigenous nations cultural significance vary between stakeholders and the survey respondents we outline mechanisms for management solutions our results present a variety of stakeholder perceptions and our methods demonstrate how data collection on human perception can be replicated we provide examples of successful diversified management which can be applied to springs in the cnf and knf stakeholders in the cnf and knf demonstrate an ability to adapt and implement unique solutions our results of the human perceptions are a tool stakeholders can use to manage springs while ensuring

11648,spring ecosystems provide vital services to humans and wildlife in northern arizona management of springs presents unique challenges due to the diversity of stakeholders and the multiple uses of springs we employ two methods of data collection to understand the perceptions of springs ecosystem management interviews and focus groups with stakeholders of springs in coconino national forest cnf and kaibab national forest knf and a national survey aimed towards public perceptions we analyze the human perceptions of springs to understand variations between stakeholders and how perceptions of stakeholders and the public vary our results indicate differences between human perceptions and current management practices the main competing interests of springs management are cattle grazing recreation and indigenous nations cultural significance the survey respondents representative of public perceptions indicate springs management for indigenous nations cultural significance is important we see positive correlation between concern for threats to springs from grazing and management to prioritize cultural significance indicating respondents prefer springs to be managed for cultural significance cattle grazing and other high impact human uses are viewed less favorably than other management scenarios stakeholders perceptions varied and non indigenous stakeholders suggested management should be based on multiple uses and management focused on specific attributes of springs valuable to humans our results of the survey respondents perceptions for management of indigenous culture and some support from stakeholders show a joint management concept might be beneficial for springs management in the cnf and knf using the information we collected on the perceptions of spring ecosystems management we discuss mechanisms for springs management to increase the ability for springs to provide cultural significance values to indigenous nations by potentially limiting high impact and degrading uses of springs we provide results and examples of how all stakeholders can have the ability to benefit from the resources springs provide graphical abstract image 1 keywords human perceptions cultural significance springs ecosystems data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction springs are essential sources of water for impoverished regions and indigenous peoples around the world cantonati et al 2020 khadka and pathak 2021 kumar 2022 gowing et al 2020 a reduction in springs discharge due to human causes has been observed in the communities that heavily rely on the fresh water springs provide jeelani et al 2021 current literature on springs and other sources of groundwater on a global scale primarily examines indicators of water quality to be used in management laskar et al 2022 taloor et al 2020 ansari et al 2015 chandrajith et al 2020 management of spring ecosystems as essential water sources is important as springs provide a reliable flow of water in the face of climate change margeta 2022 however analyses into the human dimensions of springs can provide further context to better manage these systems understanding threats and documenting the human perspectives of springs management can lead to capacity development scheihing et al 2022 enhancing the sustainability of these groundwater systems by connecting it to human interactions the united nations un outlines 17 goals for sustainable development united nations 2023 the sixth goal is clean water and sanitation which directly relates to research we present specifically target 6 6 is to protect and restore water related ecosystems including mountains forests wetlands rivers aquifers and lakes united nations 2023 our research contributes unique interdisciplinary research directly related to protecting groundwater dependent ecosystems the global sustainability goals which the un has deemed important places our research in a global context and our methods can be a framework for future research around the world to ensure the protection of groundwater dependent ecosystems incorporating human perceptions into environmental management is crucial for effective and equitable policy making on public land bremer et al 2015 the us forest service usfs manages 781 043 square kilometers of land across the united states for various uses and purposes usda 2013 caring for the land and serving the people is the usfs s motto while protecting the natural resources of the land and promoting research on forest resource utilization usda 2019 the main competing interests that springs can be managed for in the coconino and kaibab national forests are indigenous nations cultural significance recreation and ranching our objective is to understand the human perceptions of those interests to inform policy decision making on these public lands our goal is for our results to provide context and contribute to the current gap in the literature related to the human dimensions of springs ecosystem management we analyze human perceptions for springs management in the coconino national forest cnf and kaibab national forest knf located in northern arizona usa to answer the research questions 1 what are the human perceptions of spring ecosystem management in the cnf and knf 2 how do human perceptions vary between stakeholders 3 how do perceived threats and human perceptions of management vary between survey responses from the public and stakeholders our research contributes to the literature by examining diverse perspectives on the driving forces behind springs management cattle grazing recreation and indigenous nations cultural significance by comparing stakeholder and survey respondent perspectives we highlight differing attitudes towards springs ecosystem management specifically we examine the divergence between management for cattle grazing recreation and cultural significance we engage broad community representation in targeted discussions on the perceptions of springs ecosystem services in addition we developed and disseminated a survey examining human perceptions of springs ecosystem management in the cnf and knf we create a framework that includes a wide variety of data from different demographics and levels of interest in springs ecosystem management information gathered from diverse stakeholders provides an ethical perspective enhances inclusive decision making promotes equity and builds social capital mathur et al 2008 our methods can be adopted to other management challenges across the globe to promote the sustainable development of groundwater resources 1 1 human perceptions and ecosystem services ecosystems can be managed for the services they provide to humans however human uses can compete felipe lucia et al 2018 spangenberg et al 2014 adequately integrating humans into the management of ecosystems instead of treating them as external factors is important for effective land management waltner toews et al 2003 gaining people s perspectives can lead to better management by considering humans and the environment together camberlain et al 2021 bowonder 1987 humans use can negatively impact ecosystems and limit the many benefits they provide therefore merging the social and natural sciences creates a framework for understanding human dominated ecosystems alberti et al 2003 we create a base of knowledge on the human perceptions of spring ecosystems to integrate with the existing literature on the ecological functions and management of springs stevens et al 2020 2021 cartwright et al 2020 freed et al 2019 paffett et al 2018 springer and stevens 2009 perla and stevens 2008 engaging stakeholders is one way to equitably manage an ecosystem for the economic cultural human wellbeing and biophysical values that ecosystems provide martinez harms et al 2015 increasing the synergy between ecosystem uses and stakeholders can be beneficial when managing a system with competing interests howe et al 2014 we present management strategies aimed at limiting use and promoting joint management that can be beneficial for protection of spring ecosystems biological habitat quality and indigenous nations cultural significance cbs news 2005 haun 2020 diver 2016 lawrence 1996 stevens et al 2016 linge 1999 freedman 2007 nps 2021 morse et al 2009 berigan et al 2012 developing research through stakeholder engagement is a crucial component for increasing equitable access to natural resources for human uses our research in the cnf and knf provides context to the larger global issue of equitable access to groundwater resources mitigating human caused impacts on ecosystems is more important than ever as degradation from humans increases with landscape simplification and climate change riechers et al 2020 understanding human perceptions of threats reactions to the policies aimed at mitigating them and knowing if constituents are willing to change their own behavior to prevent further ecosystem damage is important information for policymakers leiserowitz 2006 we examine human s perceived threats to springs and gain an understanding on a willingness to restrict their activity using human perceptions promotes equity in management of ecosystems khan et al 2019 bertram and rehdanz 2015 kooiman and bavinck 2005 and mowrer 1996 we examine human perceptions to aid in policy making and equitable governing of spring ecosystems through a mixed method approach implementing and linking people s perceptions and their choices to develop policies is an essential component when managing resources based on human values litina et al 2016 one way to link perceptions to choices is through economic non market valuation mueller et al 2017 currently non market valuation methods used for springs primarily focus on understanding human values through choice experiments mueller et al 2017 while choice experiments are a useful tool to estimate societal benefits the methods may derive incomplete estimates by not taking cultural values and human perceptions into consideration thorsby 2001 and estimates can be reason blind schutter et al 2021 o neill 2013 meaning there is no explanation as to why those perceptions are held our combination of qualitative and quantitative data allows for an in depth approach and can provide reasons for why certain perceptions of springs management are held in this article we provide context for people s attitudes and perceptions toward springs in the coconino national forest cnf and kaibab national forest knf complementing the existing non market valuation literature and offering suggestions on how spring ecosystem management can be improved our results provide valuable information regarding diverse perceptions for spring ecosystem management which can be translated to other environmental management challenges across forests nationwide our research furthers the understanding of human perceptions for springs ecosystem management through analysis of qualitative data from focus groups and interviews with stakeholders of spring ecosystems in the cnf and knf and quantitative analysis of attitudinal questions from a survey nationally distributed and representative of the u s population 1 2 study area located in northern arizona us the coconino national forest and kaibab national forest comprise approximately 13 759 square kilometers usda 2013 the cnf and knf consist of ponderosa pine mixed conifer red rocks and alpine tundra the knf borders the north and south rims of grand canyon national park while the cnf stretches across flagstaff and sedona southeast to camp verde az fig 1 several federally recognized indigenous nations have heritage connected to and live around the cnf and knf including the navajo hopi zuni pueblo hualapai kaibab band of paiute indians havasupai yavapai apache and white mountain apache inter tribal council of arizona the usfs oversees 37 cattle grazing allotments in the knf across three different districts usda range management 2023 the cnf has 29 allotments across three districts usda grazing allotment documents livestock grazing is permitted on 299 467 square kilometers of the 781 043 square kilometers of usfs land within the us usda 2020 the fees associated with grazing on usfs land are 1 35 per animal unit per month an animal unit includes either a bull steer heifer or cow with a calf usda 2022a 2022b out of the 1 2 million cattle usda 2020 grazing on usfs rangeland around the country and the nearly 9 2 million usda 2022a 2022b total cattle grazing in the united states there are 111 487 authorized animal units of cattle in arizona grazing on usfs land between 367 permittees usda 2020 because of the unique four season climate of cnf and knf compared to the rest of the state recreation is also very prevalent in these national forests both areas are tourist destinations for the southwestern u s and highly trafficked popular recreational activities in the forests and therefore around springs include hiking mountain biking swimming fishing camping birding and boating to indigenous peoples these forests and springs are sites of significance for traditional and spiritual practices including the collection of herbs and medicines origin stories as well as teachings the cnf and knf are home to nearly 700 springs many of which are directly threatened due to human actions paffett et al 2018 extensive data documents the important ecological and hydrologic functions of springs and threats to them stevens et al 2020 2021 springer and stevens 2009 paffett et al 2018 for example human caused degradation of springs includes overgrazing of cattle overuse and trampling by recreationists stream channel disturbances causing increased erosion and decreased water quality spring habitat destruction from human caused wildfires and decreased flow due to climate change and groundwater pumping cartwright et al 2020 donovan et al 2022 perla and stevens 2008 to date little research has focused on the human perceptions for springs in the cnf and knf and the threats that raise the highest level of concern from stakeholders and the public some of the threats include groundwater pumping high impact recreation cattle grazing increased development and drought these issues are similar to issues effecting groundwater systems around the globe ensuring sustainable groundwater development in tandem with social and economically sound human development is an essential component of our research which takes into consideration the value humans receive from spring ecosystems 1 3 spring management in the coconino and kaibab national forest today springs in the cnf and knf are negatively affected by poor management of livestock as well as recreational activities paffett et al 2018 however changes in management and reduction in recreation and cattle grazing can lead to better health of the spring ecosystems paffett 2014 overgrazing has a been a long standing issue in the western u s to prevent further overgrazing and better manage grazeland western ranchers requested grazing districts which led to congress passing the taylor grazing act of 1934 the taylor grazing act of 1934 regulated and restricted grazing on public land stout 1970 today 111 487 cattle animal units are grazing in arizona usda 2020 recreation is also prevalent with 15 244 000 visits in the southwestern region of us national forests alone usda 2021 our data collection and analysis provide evidence for the reasons for support or lack of support for springs management from both the survey respondents representative of the u s population and stakeholders of springs in northern arizona 1 4 indigenous cultural significance and environmental management incorporating the perspectives of indigenous nations continues to present unique challenges to western researchers indigenous nations perceptions are diverse and do not easily fit into dominant western economic valuation estimates because natural resources are seen as living entities and their value rooted in relationships poelina et al 2019 adamowicz 2004 as such indigenous and western approaches and world views are often at odds with one another existence values which are non use values motivated by the morality of knowing the values exists for others benefits davidson 2013 are not purchasable with money or time farber et al 2002 their significance is derived from culture and spirituality creating a non tangible challenge to western research management approaches culture in the framework of environmental management is defined as spiritual enrichment aesthetic experience maintenance of social relations and other non material benefits derived from the ecosystem satterfield et al 2013 lee and diop 2009 environmental challenges including a reduction in springs habitat quality cause very tangible cultural losses to indigenous nations diverging from western methods of economic and natural resource valuation and ensuring adequate participation of indigenous nations significantly prevents problems of inadequate valuation and cultural insensitivity gregory and trousdale 2009 we pursue a coproduction of knowledge by inviting and incorporating indigenous stakeholders views of spring ecosystems and address conflicts of western actors dominating the environmental management decision making process distinctly different from indigenous management practices kauffman and arico 2014 king et al 2015 lewis and sheppard 2006 slaton et al 2019 and charnley et al 2007 management methods considerate of expression of cultural perceptions or experiences can lead to a culturally appropriate and inclusive option for environmental management satterfield et al 2013 there are significant ontological differences in how indigenous stewards of the land approach nature the environment and natural resources as compared to dominant market based approaches commonly pursued in economics and resource management deep engagement and respect for indigenous nations is necessary for understanding and adopting more wholistic and sustainable practices of land management robinson et al 2021 through our deliberate engagement with individuals from various indigenous nations around the cnf and knf we document knowledge values beliefs and management practices which can be used to create more equitable decisions and policymaking related to springs management 1 5 the importance of springs springs in cnf and knf are particularly important because they recharge aquifers which provide resilience against drought and aridification of the drought ridden southwestern us vaux 2010 the recharge of aquifers is related to the hydrogeology of the area and not directly correlated to precipitation alone giving springs resilience for when extremely low precipitation years lead to water shortages vaux 2010 the discharge of springs can vary significantly due to the distance between drainage and recharge areas the hydrology of the area the climate and landcover and land management of the region staśko and buczyński 2018 wyatt et al 2015 while snowmelt and precipitation events can increase discharge that increase can be delayed by years due to sediment and depth of the aquifer making some springs more resilient to extreme drought periods staśko and buczyński 2018 the delayed flow response of springs may obfuscate the impacts climate change has on springs as the impacts of droughts would be delayed as well examining stakeholder management and survey respondents perceptions provides an opportunity to diversify springs management based on human needs and ecosystem functionality making management of springs more inclusive and dynamic 2 materials and methods we implement two types of qualitative data collection focus groups and interviews and one type of quantitative analysis a national survey focus groups and interviews were conducted with stakeholders who work live and rely on springs in the cnf and knf all focus group and interview participants spoke on behalf of their respective organizations or indigenous nation the goal of the interviews was to reach stakeholders who fit under the categories of environmental advocacy groups eag ranchers federal agencies municipal water suppliers and indigenous nations the goal of the survey was to reach survey respondents who were representative of the broader u s population the northern arizona university nau institutional review board irb deemed the national survey focus groups and interviews exempt 1 1 irb number 1804157 5 analyzing qualitative interviews and quantitative national survey results together allows us to understand some of the reasons why certain preferences are held similarly in other fields of study qualitative and quantitative results have been used in combination to answer the same research question this method is often referred to as triangulation morse 1991 one common model for integrating qualitative and quantitative results is to formulate hypothesizes with qualitative methods and test hypothesizes using quantitative methods kelle and erzberger 2004 our methodology is similar the qualitative and quantitative results complement each other in the following ways 1 we use the results from the focus groups to determine the attributes springs can be managed for and subsequently formulate the national survey based on those results 2 we formulate hypothesis tests based on the interviews with stakeholders and use the results from the national survey to test our hypotheses 3 we use the textual evidence from the interviews with stakeholders to provide further explanation of the likert scale results we received from the national survey 2 1 stakeholder analysis it is essential to understand the perceptions of stakeholders for effective multiuse land management seppelt et al 2011 we define stakeholders as separate from the public and those who rely on springs for economic incentives have the authority to manage springs contribute to springs restoration have cultural ties to springs or advocate for different uses of springs stakeholders contribute critical and distinctive insights because of their utilization of and reliance on springs for example ranchers graze at springs on usfs allotments because of the availability of water and grasses which are less abundant in other parts of the forest policymaking is complex and often happens in rapidly changing contexts stakeholder analysis is a beneficial tool brugha and varvasovszky 2000 to include marginalized groups and can complement other approaches for policy making current methods of stakeholder analysis and participation are often deficient in their ability to reach marginalized groups because of lack of information regarding who those stakeholders are and how to effectively involve them in the research process leading to missing substantial and important contributions to the literature and policymaking johnson et al 2004 our study offers unique and inclusive approaches to current studies on springs through implementing targeted sampling outreach and building off existing relationships to deliberately seek out and include marginalized groups ensuring equitable representation our policy recommendations in cnf and knf springs ecosystem management are based on diverse stakeholders perceptions considerable diversity exists within indigenous nations in northern arizona however for this analysis our goal to understand how indigenous perceptions for springs management varies between other stakeholders and the pubic not how indigenous nations perceptions vary between each other in our stakeholder interviews we found no evidence of competing views on springs management between different indigenous nations and therefore discuss the perceptions of indigenous nations together 2 2 focus groups we recruited focus group participants through local network recruiting meaning we reached out to contacts and people from previous working relationships to identify possible participants local networking is effective when some connections already exist casey and krueger 1994 previous years of field work research and relationship building among team members facilitated connections these connections can be reproduced by engaging stakeholders through community events and contracting with various advocacy groups to connect with stakeholders we held two focus groups with four participants each stakeholders included ranchers government agencies environmental advocacy groups and indigenous peoples appendix a generally projects valuing ecosystem services tend to begin with identifying the most important natural elements of the system de groot et al 2002 in our study our main goal for focus groups was to determine the attributes of spring ecosystems most important to the participating stakeholders the focus groups consisted of various stakeholder representatives who were asked three types of questions engagement exploration and exit questions thomas jefferson university 2017 first the engagement questions were used to pique the interest of the group and introduce them to the topic second exploration questions asked who the participants thought constituents of springs were what attributes of springs are important how to level or measure those attributes and a clear and concise definition of those attributes third exit questions gave participants the opportunity to make last comments and ask questions focus groups took place in a conference room on the northern arizona university campus lasted 60 min and consisted of six open ended questions the minutes or notes collected by the moderators were taken individually and shared on a projector for the participants to see we used the results from the focus groups to develop the national survey 2 3 semi structured interviews we use local networking and snowball sampling methods for interview participant recruitment the snowball method is especially useful for reaching vulnerable and marginalized groups who may be less willing to participate in research studies without a personal connection to the interviewers sadler et al 2010 the snowball method is considered culturally sensitive and fosters a trusting environment based on a common connection such as a shared contact between the participant and the interviewee sadler et al 2010 all interview participants were offered lunch as an incentive however some participants preferred a video conference in person office meeting or coffee instead the fourteen semi structured interviews lasted 60 min the questions for the interviews were the same as for the focus groups appendix b during each of the interviews we recorded the stakeholder s affiliation date of the interview and a description of the setting appendix a the setting of the interview could potentially influence the respondents answers however all interviews took place in an informal setting and of the choosing of the interview participant the interview data were collected by written notation when a respondent was not answering a question directly their response was still recorded to ensure all possible data was collected we did not audio record as respondents feel more comfortable and are more open and honest with their responses when they are not being audio recorded byron 1993 harvey 2011 our approach fostered a more trusting and casual environment indigenous culture is not singular and is different among various indigenous nations however for the purpose of the study we examine the differences between perceptions of springs ecosystem management of indigenous nations other stakeholder groups and the american public indigenous nations in our study have cultural significance toward springs although the various traditions and culture surrounding springs varies our methods deliberately engage broad community representation including indigenous nations to understand the various perceptions for springs management in the cnf and knf the data we collect on the human perceptions is used to make policy recommendations that promote equity in the decision making process incorporating indigenous knowledge and integrating indigenous people in this process has proven to be successful and promote equity winter et al 2023 simpson 2017 we present and examine data which supports policy recommendations that have been shown to work in other sustainable development challenges spirituality is very important to indigenous nations value or perceptions of the environment turner et al 2000 through specifically asking questions on how springs can be measured we were able to understand how the spirituality of certain medical plants and ceremonies can be indicators for springs cultural significance we do not intend to speak on indigenous spirituality as outsiders as we do not have the knowledge nor have the right to share it if we did our methods and results attempt to document the significance of spirituality that has been stated by the indigenous interview participants 2 4 national survey we disseminated a national survey designed to analyze the attitudes of the general public towards springs ecosystems in the cnf and knf to complement the interview data of the perspectives of stakeholders familiar with the region measure the perceived threats to springs and the importance of springs we used marketing systems group msg to recruit survey participants that are representative of the u s population through probability and non probability panels disogra et al 2011 survey panels are a cost effective way to obtain a large quantity of complete responses from diverse groups or respondents hays et al 2005 analyzing data from both interviews and surveys together is most effective when the survey questions are focused on the respondents attitudes klausch et al 2013 to this end we designed the national survey to encompass previously recorded attitudes from the focus groups and interviews 3 calculations 3 1 qualitative analysis following the interviews we performed three types of textual analysis on the interview data using nvivo a qualitative data analysis software by qsr international thematic content analysis tca word frequency and sentiment tca automatically identifies common themes in textual data collected from the interviews anderson 2007 tca allows for categorization of textual evidence presenting trends relationships structures and discourse mayring 2000 before performing tca we hand coded what the respondent indicated was most important and the most commonly used phrases and ideas each of the interviewees stated next we ran the automated tca to identify common themes and concepts through tca we report the actual phrases and ideas of the participant anderson 2007 the phrases were kept intact to preserve their meaning tca data were separated into different files organized by stakeholders our approach allowed us to extract the main differences between each of the stakeholders perceptions and sentiments next we used word frequency analysis to document and report the most stated words by each of the stakeholders frequency analysis results justified the themes from the tca the results provided context for the most important attributes of springs given the repeated use of a word and phrase and provided indicators for 1 defensive word use and 2 different uses for springs important to stakeholders the nvivo word frequency tool was used for each stakeholder s recorded responses to obtain the most accurate and relevant results from the word frequency tool we set the parameter of the tool to output the 15 most used words this allowed for a number great enough to display a meaningful range of results while not having too many words convoluting the results lastly automated sentiment analysis in nvivo was used to detect positive negative or neutral phrases in the responses dhakal 2022 a sentiment is an attitude or opinion toward something e g an opinion on the management for recreation at springs mejova 2009 those sentiments can be interpreted as the opinion of the stakeholders saura et al 2018 in our analysis they represented feeling towards management of springs for recreation ranching and indigenous nations cultural significance furthermore we used nodes a term used in nvivo which indicate that a certain passage belongs to a specific topic wong 2008 for sentiment analysis we created a node in each stakeholders file for each of the following topics recreation ranching and indigenous nations cultural significance the automated sentiment tool outputs a chart showing shared sentiments for each of the stakeholders by topic 3 2 quantitative analysis we tested relationships between variables from our survey responses using pearson s chi squared test a commonly used method when comparing categorical variables peck et al 2015 the chi squared distribution is determined by the degrees of freedom and differs for various degrees of freedom turney 2022 the chi squared distribution describes the sum of squared random variables and the distribution starts at zero turney 2022 the chi squared test compares expected frequency no association between variables with the actual frequency to determine a relationship the null hypothesis for a chi squared test is no significant relationship between the variables sharpe 2015 the alternative hypothesis is a relationship between variables the chi squared coefficient is a sum of all the differences between the actual data and the expected data if there is no difference sharpe 2015 the chi squared equation is x 2 o i e i e i where x 2 chi sqaured o i observed value e i expected value the chi squared test is two tailed and does not explicitly state the direction of the relationship tallarida and murray 1987 the chi square test in combination with frequency counts from cross tabulation tables determines a positive or inverse relationship in other words we can look to see if the relationship is with the yes variables or no variables by examining which two of the four numbers in the cross tabulations table have the relationship for example we look at the frequency for the two yes variables and determine that their frequencies are proportional determining the relationship the chi squared test detected we also use cramer s v equation to understand the strength of association between the categorical variables cramer s v statistical measure provides further evidence to support the results achieved through the chi squared test cramer s v is calculated by taking the chi square value and then dividing that number by the sample size and taking the square root of that value field 2013 the numeric value of cramer s v allows us to qualitatively explain the relationship between the variables in the following way field 2013 0 25 very strong 0 15 strong 0 10 moderate 0 05 weak 0 no or very weak using the chi squared test for significance and cramer s v measure of association we test the following relationships concern with threats from grazing and prioritizing management for cultural significance concern with human caused threats to springs ecosystem and willingness to restrict recreation to preserve cultural significance concern with threats from recreation and a willingness to restrict recreation for the protection of spring ecosystems 4 results 4 1 qualitative the results from the national survey were used to compare survey respondents perceptions with stakeholder s perceptions from the interviews results from the interviews show the relationship contrasting opinions and differences in management perceptions from the different stakeholders the following results are from the stakeholder interviews conducted after the focus groups and in tandem with the national survey 4 1 1 rancher stakeholders ranchers consistently defend their ability to access springs and their need to use it for example one of their most frequently used words from the interviews is without 9 often in reference to how impossible or prohibitively costly ranching would be without spring water access how their ranch would not be located where it is without a spring on it and how different the city of flagstaff would be without ranching ranching was one of the early industries of the euroamerican settlement of flagstaff circa 1881 ranches expressed it was a founding industry and integral to the local economy the way in which other stakeholders perceive ranching as a degrading to the ecosystems appears to lead ranchers to be more outspoken ranchers defend their commitment to the environment to the public land they use the wildlife protection of forest health including springs and ranching s ability to enhance other stakeholders activities such as recreation one rancher stated cattlemen are not the enemy of springs to say that is offensive and foolish interviewee 4 to justify their position and defend their ability to ranch on public lands and springs ranchers often mentioned the immense benefits ranching has on the community such as providing food for families land conservation through setting up non governmental organizations ngo and bringing in tax revenue to the city and state from the cattle industry textual evidence from the interviews shows ranchers goals of sustainability are constantly being called into question by other stakeholders while economic incentives and means of supporting their livelihood are reasons behind ranchers perceptions of management of springs we also see a persistent preference to protect ranching lifestyle or as interviewee 11 described it cowboy culture ranchers solidified their stance on environmental sustainability by outlining land stewardship goals emphasizing a choice to run less cattle below usfs limits to ensure they are not overgrazing thus taking forest management into their own hands one rancher stated a good cattleman is exactly an environmentalist interviewee 4 table 1 shows the themes from the stakeholders interviews based on automated sentiment analysis ranchers had mixed 10 sentiments regarding ranching at springs fig 3 ranchers highlighted a noticeable difference in ranching on usfs land versus land they are deeded to for instance one rancher stated other ranchers often show less stewardship on usfs land compared to land they own even though ranchers show less stewardship on the usfs land there are a lot of benefits associated with having these grazing allotments by grazing on usfs allotments during the summer ranchers are able to produce more cattle than they otherwise would be able to leading to positive 54 sentiment results the ranchers responses indicate a strong perception that prioritization of ranching at springs is important interviewee 7 stated that 65 of their water for cattle comes from springs grazing rotations are based around spring meadows and spring fed cattle tanks are essential as no one can make a living constantly running transporting water to cattle interviewee 7 interviewee 7 stated springs provide resilience to the ranch having to drill a well for water could cost upwards of 200 000 be costly to maintain and put a significant financial strain on the ranch our analysis highlights that ranchers value from the springs is potentially significantly greater than the cost of the technological inputs necessary to replace the water flow attribute function of the spring additionally valuing springs in terms of replacement value is an underestimate because of the intrinsic value springs bring to ranchers ways of life culture and the stewardship ranchers strive for the springs they graze at ranchers were persistent in emphasizing the importance for springs on public lands to be managed for ranching the word frequency analysis showed the words need 17 and produce 20 as the most frequently stated words which expressed a need for spring water access to produce cattle interestingly the way ranchers expressed their views of spring water use and resulting threats triggered from other stakeholder s mismanagement of springs automated false negative sentiments the errors needed to be corrected because some ranchers expressed concern and had negative sentiments relating to other stakeholder s management of springs not necessarily relevant to the topic of springs themselves for example ranchers stated forest thinning projects degrade the springs more than ranching which looking at the context would incorrectly output a negative sentiment examples of poorly managed and executed forest thinning operations exist in the cnf and knf in the cnf timber access roads built near or through springs and spring meadows negatively impact springs condition and ability to function as an ecosystem paffett et al 2018 to ranchers poorly executed management strategies are the perceived threats to springs ranchers perceived other stakeholders should also have the right to use springs including wildlife and municipal water suppliers most interviewed ranchers perceived recreationists as constituents who should have access to springs even though ranchers perceive recreationists as causing more degradation at springs than ranchers do for example the trampling of plants litter left behind and overuse by recreationists is a perceived threat of ranchers 4 1 2 environmental advocacy group stakeholders through the tca we identified themes from environmental advocacy groups eag perceiving the importance of springs management for wildlife and that wildlife should be managed for human benefits i e creating opportunities for wildlife viewing hunting and fishing eag is a broad category and can include stakeholders with differing goals for example eags include organizations advocating for wildlife hunting rights and volunteer organizations whose goals align with the usfs eags perceived ranching as a threat to springs eags perceive say ranching as a tradition in the area and economically important to the local economy however ranchers need to pay sufficient prices for their grazing permits to account for the degradation grazing causes in our word frequency analysis cultural 8 showed up as one of the most frequently used words by eags interviewee 8 stated that cultural significance values are often invisible when looking through a standard management lens which makes them harder to manage therefore interviewee 8 supported prioritizing cultural significance in management eag s sentiment analysis supports the themes derived from most of the stakeholders eags show positive 60 sentiments toward management for cultural significance negative 5 and positive 60 sentiments for management for recreation and positive 20 and negative 40 sentiments for ranching figs 2 3 and 4 one explanation for both positive and negative sentiments for ranching and recreation is because the stakeholders categorized under eag are very diverse 4 1 3 municipal water providers and federal agency stakeholders municipal stakeholders and government agencies show similar themes both stakeholders state the economic gains springs provide and recognize springs as essential components that contribute to the health of the watersheds and forests table 1 both stakeholders have responsibility to manage springs and show similar perceptions the sentiment analysis of government stakeholders shows mostly negative 46 and neutral 46 sentiments on ranching and only 6 positive sentiments fig 3 the textual evidence from the interview notes highlights that while the usfs receives revenue from ranchers buying permits the revenue does not totally compensate for the degradation they perceive government agencies perceived concern about some of the poorly managed livestock operations government stakeholders stated springs can negatively affect stream morphology and lead to more erosion problems in addition overgrazing is also leading to more remediation work the government agencies must do 4 1 4 indigenous stakeholders sentiment analysis from interviewees from indigenous nations showed positive 80 and neutral 20 sentiments for cultural significance fig 4 recreation and ranching at springs leads to not only degradation at the springs but also less availability for use by indigenous peoples for ceremonies and other culturally significant practices therefore we see negative sentiments relating to both recreation and ranching from indigenous respondents in addition to the negative 25 sentiments there are some positive 16 sentiments regarding management for ranching at springs some indigenous farmers maintain small herds of cattle and rely on springs to support their livestock furthermore some indigenous nations also lease out grazing rights on usfs land to ranchers responses from interviewees from indigenous nations differed from the other stakeholders in that they perceived livestock watering and management for wildlife as areas of interest and perceived concern shown by the overlapping word frequency results table 2 shows the normalized frequency count divided by number of stakeholders interviewed counts of each of 15 most stated words for indigenous and non indigenous stakeholders red indicates a difference in the top stated words while green highlighted words that are underlined indicate the same 15 most stated word however major differences arise in perceptions of springs management for economic benefits such as large scale cattle production dependent on low cost water supply indigenous nations rely on spring water for subsistence agriculture and the water flow 2 is an important cultural resource compared to other stakeholder s view of spring water as a free water supply focused on economic value 5 4 the discrepancies highlight a stark difference in the perceptions for spring ecosystem management between stakeholders interviewees from indigenous nations preferred springs management that does not separate management for wildlife water flow and culture most other non indigenous stakeholders viewed spring management more like an equation which controlled for each attribute and prioritized human economic values the indigenous interviewees perceived a holistic method for spring management considering the entire ecosystem together as one unit as most important the holistic outlook differs from the perceptions of non indigenous respondents who expressed tradeoffs between attributes differences in perceptions can be summarized with one quote spring water is life this phrase was stated by nearly all indigenous interviewees and emphasizes that spring water and spring ecosystems in themselves are more important than the specific attributes that they can be managed for the phrase itself is deeply rooted in indigenous peoples interactions with settler society and colonialism connecting other aspects of life and is a fundamental part of indigenous culture robison et al 2018 spring water is an essential and integral part of all spring attributes and to life itself so choosing one or some of the attributes for preferred management plan is not synchronous with traditional cultural knowledge another major difference between the indigenous and non indigenous stakeholders was the concept of culture while non indigenous stakeholders mentioned indigenous cultural significance they also consistently mentioned cowboy culture or culture which encompasses cattle grazing hunting recreation and the overall western lifestyle that the forests and the springs within them afford from a settler colonial perspective components of culture have strong economic ties such as the springs importance for the cattle industry and the timber industry founding euroamerican industries of the area perceptions of non indigenous stakeholders for cowboy culture in comparison to indigenous culture significance values again show disconnect between stakeholders about perceptions of springs management table 1 differences between indigenous and non indigenous stakeholders mainly stem from cultural value and perceived importance of what spring ecosystems provide undertraining perceptions from all stakeholders is extremely important to categorize because the relationships they have with springs are derived from different means such as necessity economic benefit culture and enjoyment 4 2 quantitative 4 2 1 survey data we are interested in understanding the public s perceptions of springs ecosystem management to incorporate quantitative analysis of survey data into our mixed methods approach we disseminated a quantitative survey to a total of 1038 individuals through marketing systems group msg we received 751 completed responses from a non probability panel and 287 completed surveys from a probability panel out of those 1038 observations 58 were female 40 were male 5 were residents of arizona and 64 identified as white the median time it took the respondents to complete the survey was 11 5 min 4 2 2 respondent attitudes all survey respondents rated their level of concern for threats to springs on a scale from 1 to 5 1 not at all concerned 2 slightly concerned 3 moderately concerned 4 very concerned or 5 extremely concerned over 80 of survey respondents indicated they were moderately very or extremely concerned with the threats to springs from grazing in addition 62 of survey respondents indicated they were not at all to moderately concerned with a reduction in grazing our results indicate survey respondents generally perceived grazing at springs to be degrading to the ecosystem and were not concerned with the reduced use of springs for cattle grazing when survey respondents were asked are you willing to restrict your own recreation on national forests to reduce environmental degradation of springs from recreation over 84 indicated yes we also asked respondents to select the recreational activities they are willing to restrict to reduce the environmental degradation at springs the top five selected answers were to restrict off road vehicle orv riding 52 hunting 47 boating 37 fishing 37 and camping 36 the responses highlight a willingness to reduce high impact recreational activity to benefit spring ecosystem health we asked respondents are you willing to restrict your own recreation on national forests to preserve springs with cultural significance for indigenous peoples over 83 of the respondents said yes indicating the survey respondents are willing to change their own behavior to support management of springs for indigenous nations 4 2 3 hypothesis tests results from the survey responses show perceptions of springs management supported by a willingness of respondents to adjust behaviors we test three relationships about grazing cultural significance and recreation to further understand complexity of survey respondents and provide evidence for reasons certain attributes of springs management are preferred table 3 to test the public s perceptions of spring s management for cultural significance in relation to perceiving threats to springs we asked survey respondents to indicate their level of concern on a scale of 1 5 where 1 is not at all concerned and 5 is extremely concerned for the following statement prioritizing management to protect springs with cultural significance to indigenous peoples 52 indicated they were very concerned or extremely concerned we also asked respondents to indicate their level of concern for threats to springs from grazing 50 of respondents indicated they were very concerned or extremely concerned for threats to springs from grazing we code the level of concern variable 1 if very concerned or extremely concerned and 0 otherwise we use a chi squared test at a 5 level of significance to determine if a relationship exists between the nominal variables and examine the nature of the relationship using the crosstabulation table table 3 we find a statistically significant relationship between concern with threats from grazing and concern with prioritizing management for the preservation of cultural significance χ2 178 728 df 1 p 0 001 the cramer s v value was 0 415 indicating a very strong association between variables the positive correlation indicates respondents who are concerned about grazing as a threat are also more likely to be concerned about prioritizing management to protect springs with cultural significance to indigenous peoples we are also interested in whether respondents concern for threats to springs is related to potential behavioral responses to support springs management on a scale of 1 5 survey respondents indicated they were very concerned or extremely concerned with the following threats pollution 71 increased development 64 and groundwater pumping 53 we also ask respondents are you willing to restrict your own recreation on national forests to preserve springs with cultural significance for indigenous peoples 84 responded yes we code the level of concern variable 1 if very concerned or extremely concerned and 0 otherwise yes variables are indicated by a 1 and no variables are indicated by 0 we use a chi squared test with a 5 level of significance and calculated cramer s v with the yes or no question individually for each of the threats pollution χ2 88 132 df 1 p 0 001 increased development χ2 55 274 df 1 p 0 001 and groundwater pumping χ2 44 164 df 1 p 0 001 results from the chi squared tests show a relationship and the cramer s v statistical measure shows a strong or very strong association table 3 the survey respondents perceive threats to springs from human caused activities and there is a relationship between perceiving those threats and being willing to restrict their activity for preservation of indigenous culture again highlighting the perception that springs management for cultural significance is important especially when human caused threats to springs are perceived we find a positive correlation between willingness to restrict recreation to preserve springs with cultural significance for indigenous peoples and perceived threats to springs therefore our results show respondents who are more concerned with threats to springs may be more likely to change their behavior to support management changes to test the perceived concerns from recreation to springs and how that relates to the survey respondents willingness to restrict recreation we asked survey respondents the following question are you willing to restrict your own recreation on national forests to reduce environmental degradation of springs from recreation 84 responded yes indicated by a 1 and 16 responded no indicated by a 0 we also asked respondents to indicate their level of concern from threats to springs from recreation 45 of the respondents indicated they were very concerned or extremely concerned again we recode the level of concern variable 1 if very concerned or extremely concerned and 0 otherwise we compared the two variables using the chi squared test and cramer s v to understand if the survey respondents perceptions of threats from recreation made them more willing to reduce their own recreation results show a significant relationship between perceiving threats to springs from recreation and a willingness to reduce own recreation for springs protection χ2 23 952 df 1 p 0 001 the cramer s v value of 0 153 indicates a strong association table 3 results show survey respondents perceiving threats to springs from recreation may be more willing to restrict their own recreation 5 discussion our study examines the human perceptions of spring ecosystems in the cnf and knf we collected compiled and analyzed data from stakeholder interviews focus groups and a broadly disseminated national study to further understand how perceptions vary between stakeholders and analyze differences between the survey respondents and stakeholders results from focus groups indicate three competing interests for springs management in the cnf and knf are cultural significance recreation and cattle grazing we incorporated results from focus groups into a national survey to understand public perceptions of springs management analyzing the results from both interviews with stakeholders and the national survey of the public we see perceptions do vary between stakeholders and the public the variation and differences in perceptions shed light on what different stakeholders and the public perceive as important our results provide insight on the structure of springs ecosystem management and can be used by usfs land managers to use to align human perceptions with springs management while meeting the mission of health diversity and productivity for present and future generations usda 2019 5 1 ranching the survey respondents and ranching stakeholders had different perceptions of grazing ranching on public land has been shown to provide rural communities with economic stability and sustainability pearce et al 1999 which ranchers adamantly stated during the interviews similar to results from other studies whittlesey et al 1993 other stakeholders and the public showed perceived concern about grazing on public land the many competing interests that public land can be managed for create conflict when activities such as grazing and recreation overlap lewin et al 2019 public perception of threats from cattle grazing has led to a decline in grazing permit allocation pearce et al 1999 lewin et al 2019 past examples show ranchers have perceived high levels of concern from overgrazing western ranchers requested regulations and restrictions for grazing on public land which eventually led to the taylor grazing act of 1935 stout 1970 other studies we found support evidence for only one of the following 1 the market value of grazing lewin et al 2019 torell and doll 1991 or 2 the concern for environmental degradation caused by grazing on public land manley et al 1995 hess and holechek 1995 our study contributes perceptions incorporating evidence from both sides of the competing interests of multiuse public land management in a single study the inclusion of the competing interests around grazing provides crucial evidence for policymaking because it incorporates diverse perspectives for the multiple interests and uses the springs can be managed for our results show concern for the threats to springs and potential support for management of springs to preserve cultural significance to indigenous peoples management solutions to limit the number of grazing units include buyout options or conservation permits available on usfs grazing allotments steinbach and thomas 2007 one example of successful grazing limitations on public land is big brow bench ranch on the colorado plateau the grand canyon trust an environmental organization purchased big brown bench ranch in 2005 after acquiring the ranch grand canyon trust destroyed a pipeline from a spring that used to feed the ranch s livestock operation the grand canyon trust does not permit nor graze on the allotment allotments must be grazed at least every six out of ten years cbs news 2005 and haun 2020 regulations allowing other environmental organizations to purchase grazing rights and let them go unused could be a possible market based solution to springs management our finding supports prior studies showing the public perceives grazing not reflecting the full cost of the externalities associated with it which is one of the reasons for lack of public support for grazing permits on public land whittlesey et al 1993 raising the price of grazing permits to account for externalities could increase positive public sentiment without specifically limiting the allowed number of animal units in a particular allotment 5 2 cultural significance most stakeholders and survey respondents perceived springs management for cultural significance as important however one of the major differences is that while survey respondents perceive springs management for cultural significance as important they also demonstrate a willingness to restrict their own use of springs to preserve indigenous cultural significance while stakeholders indicate cultural significance as an important attribute in our focus groups and interviews we found little evidence of willingness from stakeholders to reduce their access or use of springs for indigenous nations however in contrast indigenous stakeholders perceptions for springs management aligned with the public s perception of the importance of springs management for cultural significance stakeholders perceive springs management for cultural significance as important in combination with the strong support from the survey respondents joint management occurs when relevant stakeholders such as government agencies and indigenous nations collectively manage an area with shared rights interests and obligations smyth 2001 joint management in the cnf and knf would provide indigenous nations the ability to manage for attributes of springs aligned with indigenous traditional knowledge and tradition poelina et al 2019 adamowicz 2004 the usfs has successfully implemented joint management in other areas for example the usfs and karuk tribe have collaborate agreements giving the indigenous nation increased access to their ancestorial territory diver 2016 in six rivers national forest in northern california joint management of preserved land is also successful in australia where aboriginal owned protected areas are managed in cooperation with governments to promote social justice community development and the preservation of cultural identity lawrence 1996 castle springs in the knf is an example of collaborated management between the usfs and indigenous nations in northern arizona members of the usfs hopi tribe the north kaibab piute band grand canyon trust and the spring stewardship institute rehabilitated castle springs knf to preserve indigenous culture and increase the biological habitat quality of the spring stakeholders of the spring worked together to accomplish goals to cooperatively plan springs restoration directly implement a plan with collaborators and provide education and outreach about spring restoration to develop closer working relationships between different stakeholders stevens et al 2016 monitoring of joint management frameworks has shown to be successful allowing for traditional ecological knowledge to be implemented in management and supporting indigenous culture identity while meeting conservation goals stacey and izurieta 2010 implementing joint management between indigenous nations and the usfs is a possible solution to address the perceived importance that we found for management of springs for indigenous nation s cultural significance our results of the survey respondents perceptions for management of indigenous culture and some support from stakeholders show a joint management concept might be beneficial for springs management in the cnf and knf an example of prioritizing management of sites with conflicting interests for indigenous cultural significance is devils tower national monument wyoming a site of cultural significance to the surrounding indigenous tribes and habitat for many important plant and animal species linge 1999 to the arapahoe cheyenne crow kiowa lakota shoshone tribes bear tipi bear house bears lodge bears peak is part of oral history and considered a sacred ceremonial place freedman 2007 in 1995 the national monument voluntarily implemented a management plan to restrict climbing of the tower for the month of june the most sacred month for ceremonies by indigenous nations similar management plans can be implemented by the cnf and knf in coordination with the surrounding indigenous nations to prioritize springs sites harboring high cultural significance our analysis of the survey respondents and stakeholder s perceptions provides evidence indicating strong support for springs to be managed for cultural significance implementing similar management strategies could be a possible solution to management for indigenous nation s cultural significance 5 3 recreation recreation on usfs land is significant in 2020 alone the usfs s managed lands received 168 million visits us forest service s national visitor use monitoring program recreation is an important attribute of public land ensuring recreational activities are available while protecting the ecosystems within them such as springs is crucial for not only the ecosystems health but also for continued recreational activities stakeholders rely on springs and can be tasked with management making them stewards of springs using survey respondent perceptions to reduce certain types of high impact recreation can be used in policy decision making to promote less degrading recreational activities without severely limiting the uses and benefits the public and stakeholders perceive stakeholders and survey respondents both recognize the need for access to recreation on public land and demonstrate concern for the degradation that recreation causes the survey respondents representative of the public indicated a willingness to restrict what they perceive as highly degrading types of recreation at springs such as orv riding 52 hunting 47 and boating 37 for springs protection human perceptions are a valuable resource to use when making policy decisions around recreation for instance zion national park in utah allows for public comment on pilot programs which would require visitors to have permits for certain hikes such as angels landing and lava point campground nps 2021 springs can be managed the same way where stakeholders and the public can be given opportunities to indicate their level of concern on specific springs in the cnf and knf being closed off for recreation responses could be used to build off the data we present to further protect spring ecosystem based off human perceptions problems with management of recreation include issues of scale such as the number of visitors size of area and incongruent boundaries morse et al 2009 similar problems can be seen in the cnf and knf where recreation activity is very high and cities neighborhoods and other high trafficked areas are scattered around the forests springs tend to be in some cases in more remote areas compared to popular hiking trails or other activities studies have shown evidence of public support for reduced recreation for ecosystem protection and for higher quality recreation activities schneller et al 2021 over 449 201 square kilometers of land is designated wilderness across 803 induvial areas established with the wilderness act of 1964 the goal of the wilderness act of 1964 is to preserve and protect the natural conditions of specific areas against the threats of increased settlement and increasing populations by limiting or restricting activities similarly the usfs manages for protected sites by creating protected activity centers pac for california spotted owl habitat nest sites roost location and foraging areas are used as indicators for pacs to be implemented berigan et al 2012 one potential management option is to create a cultural significance indicator into pacs for springs national heritage areas designated by congress protect cultural resources on public land and form cohesive management for areas with cultural natural historic and recreational importance laven et al 2010 similar management strategies can promote joint management of cultural resources in the cnf and knf 6 conclusion stakeholders are intimately involved in management and have a strong reliance on springs indigenous perspectives are not equally represented in the management of springs however survey respondents perceived cultural significance as being of importance we saw support from survey respondents for management of springs for cultural significance as well as a marked perception of threats to springs from cattle grazing and recreation spring ecosystem health is essential for the three uses of springs we tested across recreation ranching and indigenous nations cultural significance management focused on preserving the ecosystem health and subsequently allocating the management of springs can reduce threats and ensure equal opportunities for spring users our research aligns the perceptions of stakeholders and the public which can be used to create or formulate management solutions to protect the health of ecosystems without significantly limiting the use of springs as aridification continues across the western united states mankin et al 2021 protection and equitable management of springs becomes even more imperative anthropogenic externalities from groundwater pumping high impact recreation pollution climate change and cattle grazing significantly and negatively impact springs ecosystems which have immense social and ecological benefits our comparison of the perceptions between stakeholders and survey respondents on springs in the 13 759 square kilometers of land between the cnf and knf provide valuable insight for forest management across the 781 043 square kilometers of usfs land around the county our results provide land managers information on land management policies that may be well received by the public our stakeholder results provide understanding regarding which stakeholders may not support policies our results include the valuable and less often incorporated perspectives of indigenous nations including diverse perspectives in policy decision making promotes equity hill et al 2012 ensuring management is rooted in human dimension stakeholders possess the ability to translate the work they have done in other areas of the forests and integrate it into springs management babbitt ranches located in northern arizona established the environmental monitoring and assessment foundation a framework for organizations landowners government agencies to collect data on important environmental features of the landscape and improve issues relating to soil science babbitt ranches donated the foundation along with a 30 acre parcel land to northern arizona university nau frederick 2002 babbitt ranches also demonstrates a commitment to conservation and donated one of the largest conservation easements in the country 161 km2 to the nature conservancy williams news 2021 babbitt ranches arizona game and fish department and the arizona state land department created the sp crater golden eagle conservation complex which protects areas around the nesting sites of eagles williams news 2021 the diablo trust also partnered with researchers from northern arizona university to research the effects that cattle grazing has on grasslands to better manage and protect grassland ecosystems loeser et al 2001 similar programs can be adopted and used to monitor and protect springs on grazing allotments throughout the forests such initiatives can increase the positive perceptions of grazing on public land by diversifying use of springs ecosystem which provide immense benefits to multiple users all while protecting the use of springs for recreationists ranchers and indigenous nations programs similar to the castle springs example mentioned earlier shows the possibility of cooperative efforts between indigenous nations and other stakeholders our research provides insight on the unique differences between stakeholder perceptions the dominance structures that guide management and a complex analysis of the public s perceptions of different attributes that affect springs understanding relationships and differences can help better manage springs and other ecosystem types across the county we contribute comprehensive mixed methods results that can be applicable to other publicly managed lands with multiple stakeholders to ensure indigenous nations have the ability to play a role in policy making on public land capacity building frameworks may need to be developed and applied van der voorn 2008 van der voorn et al 2017 when capacity building frameworks are adopted indigenous voices can be represented stronger and have a seat at the table which promotes equity our research aims to contribute significant human perception data from a wide variety of perspectives for increased equity in policy decision making on public lands however there are challenges to mixed methods approaches a limitation to mixed methods research is that it can often be complex requiring an interdisciplinary team to adequately collect and interpret the results in addition mixed methods research can be more costly due to the extra resources required significance tests such as the chi squared method can be sensitive to sample size while collecting data from all stakeholders is possible reaching all individual stakeholders in the coconino and kaibab national forests would be prohibitively difficult a notable contribution of this study is the purposeful incorporation of indigenous perspectives which have been historically overlooked and marginalized by academia and in research this particular aspect might also be somewhat challenging to replicate however our outreach to indigenous communities will likely allow future researchers to create comparable representation of marginalized groups such as indigenous voices the authors acknowledge there is significant cultural diversity amongst humans van der voorn 2008 including indigenous nations however our analysis examines the stark differences of indigenous nations views on springs management versus other stakeholder groups and the public views from indigenous nations are challenging to incorporate through a western lens our research team leveraged considerable connections experience and community knowledge to recruit focus group participants while we tried to mitigate any misinterpretations from indigenous interviewees it is difficult to capture the essence of indigenous views through methods of western academia and the english language more research on the perceptions of stakeholders and the public together is needed to ensure equitable management of springs in the cnf and knf another limitation to the study is cultural bias the authors of this research are all european american and european and are cultural outsiders to indigenous nations we do not intend to infer or describe any cultural practices not our own for the purpose of this study we examine the differences between indigenous nations as a whole other stakeholder groups and the american public however indigenous cultures are diverse and vary between nations which we are unable to account for in the scope of this study further research and analyses on the differences in the perceptions of indigenous nations would be beneficial and ideally conducted by indigenous researchers such varied approaches would complement our research while differences in perceptions of management particularly management for indigenous nations cultural significance vary between stakeholders and the survey respondents we outline mechanisms for management solutions our results present a variety of stakeholder perceptions and our methods demonstrate how data collection on human perception can be replicated we provide examples of successful diversified management which can be applied to springs in the cnf and knf stakeholders in the cnf and knf demonstrate an ability to adapt and implement unique solutions our results of the human perceptions are a tool stakeholders can use to manage springs while ensuring

11649,declining groundwater resources are a big concern for irrigated agriculture worldwide this study investigated the causes of declining groundwater and how future climate and management measures impact the groundwater resource in bangladesh a conceptual hydrological model nam was used to quantify catchment runoff groundwater recharge and evapotranspiration loss and a hydraulic model mike11 was used to quantify changes in river flow the models were calibrated using observed water level discharge groundwater level gwl and actual evapotranspiration et the modelling encompassed five contrasting climate scenarios of rainfall and potential evapotranspiration pet and a management scenario of additional surface water irrigation the results show that gwl is declining across 16 administrative districts in the northwest region of bangladesh on average the annual decline varies from 20 to 30 mm except for two southern districts where the annual decline was more than 80 mm declining rainfall and increasing use of groundwater for irrigation were the principal causes of declining gwl across the region under the climate change scenarios modelled groundwater conditions improve due to increased rainfall the increase in river water extraction for irrigation also produced positive outcomes for gwl i e lessening the declining rate graphical abstract image 1 keywords

scanlon et al 2012 as in many other countries groundwater is the main freshwater source for irrigation and domestic use in bangladesh michael and voss 2009 mojid et al 2019 often groundwater is replenished through recharge from rainfall and flooding during the wet season may to october however in many places depletion during the dry season november to april is higher than the replenishment during the wet season hossain et al 2021 mojid et al 2021a consequently gwls are decreasing at many places across bangladesh hodgson et al 2022 hossain et al 2021 janardhanan et al 2021 over the last few decades bangladesh has over exploited groundwater for irrigated agriculture especially for boro rice cultivation during the dry period while the country has achieved self sufficiency in rice production bbs 2019 excessive groundwater use has created a concern for sustainability of this resource in many places mainuddin et al 2021a mojid et al 2021b priya et al 2022 irrigated agriculture is a major economic driver for the northwest nw region of bangladesh mainuddin et al 2021a peña arancibia et al 2020 currently a major proportion of agriculture water demand up to 97 is sourced from groundwater and this excessive extraction is considered as a major factor contributing to the declining gwl in the nw region mainuddin et al 2021b mojid et al 2021b tulip et al 2022 in some places groundwater extraction is higher than the recharge so the sustainability of its use in long term is questionable hodgson et al 2022 mojid et al 2021b the current trend of declining gwl has led to a

previous studies reported declining gwl across the nw districts hasanuzzaman et al 2017 janardhanan et al 2021 mainuddin et al 2021b mojid et al 2021a tulip et al 2022 however none of the studies reported causes of declining gwl and it is not evident whether the depletion is due to less recharge over exploitation of groundwater for irrigation or a combination of hydrologic and land management factors e g changes in land use low flows in the rivers to address this issue we have investigated various components of water balance rainfall evapotranspiration groundwater extraction recharge and identified possible causes of declining groundwater we also investigated how climate change and irrigation management impact current trends in gwl we explored five climate scenarios two for high and low rainfall two for high and low pet and the fifth for average rainfall and pet in addition our investigations include an additional management scenario of increased surface water contribution for irrigation the manuscript is organized as follows in section 2 we briefly describe the climate and hydrology of study area section 3 describes the methods and data used for model configuration and calibration section 4 presents the results and these are discussed in section 5 finally major conclusions of the study are presented in section 6 2 study area the study includes 16 nw administrative districts of bangladesh with an approximate area of 34 540 km2 fig 1 the area includes an uplifted block of terraced land commonly known as the barind tract the elevation of the barind tract is generally higher than adjoining lands and the area is free from seasonal floods hasan et al 2016 runoff from local rainfall and inflows through the teesta and jamuna rivers are the two primary sources of river water in the nw region the northern districts dinajpur kurigram lalmonirhat nilphamari panchagarh and thakurgaon districts consist of sloping land and highly permeable soil the middle districts gaibandha joypurhat and rangpur consist of flat land and less permeable soil the southern districts bogra naogaon natore nawabganj rajshahi pabna and sirajganj consist of low lying lands and permeable soil rainfall in the nw region of bangladesh varies spatially and temporally historical data from 1985 to 2015 indicate a decreasing rainfall trend in most of the nw districts karim et al 2020 mainuddin et al 2022 across the 16 nw districts average rainfall is 1890 mm annually with the maximum in kurigram 2540 mm and minimum in rajshahi 1430 mm karim et al 2020 mainuddin et al 2022 most of the rainfall 93 in the region occurs during may to october and there is a considerable variation between months from 6 mm in december to 395 mm in july the rainfall is least in december and january less than 1 compared to rainfall the spatial and temporal variability of pet is minimal at an annual scale pet varies from 1219 mm minimum 1106 maximum 1319 in the dinajpur district to 1362 mm minimum 1184 maximum 1614 in pabna across the region monthly variation of pet is also relatively small karim et al 2021 mainuddin et al 2022 3 material and methods 3 1 data sources climate data temperature rainfall and radiation were obtained from the bangladesh meteorological department bmd there are 6 weather stations that record temperature rainfall radiation humidity and wind speed and 11 stations to record rainfall table 1 see fig 1 for location daily data for these 17 stations were collected and processed from 1985 to 2015 pets for the 6 weather stations were estimated using the penman monteith equation monteith 1981 for the pets for the other districts we used the average of adjacent weather stations we note that the average size of a district is approximately 2160 km2 and the variation in climate data between districts is gradual karim et al 2020 mainuddin et al 2022 future rainfall and pet were derived using simulations from 28 different global climate models gcms there were 18 downscaled gcm grids in the nw region however we used data from six gcm grids closest to bmd s weather stations actual et data were obtained from a companion study by peña arancibia et al 2020 this data set is based on modis imagery mod09ga product and is commonly known as cmrset data river flow data water level and discharge for 42 river gauges in the study area were obtained from the bangladesh water development board bwdb table 1 depending on location data were available from 1972 however most of the gauges lacked continuous records and contained erroneous data the primary sources of errors arise from datum change or gauge shifting and sometimes from recording errors water level wl data were validated through consistency checking by visual inspection and plotting longitudinal water surface profiles for different periods discharge data were validated by plotting the stage discharge relationship and by identifying the outliers missing wl data during floods or due to faulty instruments were in filled by correlating downstream and upstream gauges on the same river we have used monthly time series of average gwl in each district derived from bwdb s weekly groundwater depth data bwdb operates 437 monitoring wells in the nw region and records weekly groundwater depth manually hodgson et al 2022 while bwdb s database has records from the mid 1960s we have used data from 1985 to 2015 based on the quality of record and completeness of the database some of these data were processed during an earlier csiro project kirby et al 2015 and we have extended the database to 2015 as a part of this study we produced a monthly district level time series by taking arithmetic mean of all data in a month phase difference between wells were adjusted during aggregation to produce district averaged time series 3 2 model configuration the focus of the study on conjunctive management and climate change impacts warranted the simulation of surface water processes and propagation of its effects to predict changes in gwl across the region hence we chose a combination of hydrological and hydrodynamic models that can simulate these effects similar approach was used by sridhar et al 2018 to investigate climate change impacts on gwl in the snake river basin in united states two models were configured one for simulating runoff and gwl catchment model and the other for simulating surface water availability across the river network river model the catchment model was configured using the nam nedbor afstromnings model hydrological model a physically based lumped water balance model dhi 2008 rainfall and pet were primary inputs to this model the model simulates catchment runoff by satisfying the moisture content in three interconnected storages surface zone root zone and groundwater agrawal and desmukh 2016 the model is based on 13 parameters including 5 parameters to estimate the changes in groundwater storage appendix 1 the river model was configured using the mike 11 a one dimensional hydrodynamic model based on shallow water saint venant equations of continuity and momentum dhi 2017 havno et al 1995 river flows from upstream catchments were incorporated into the model using several inflow boundaries and runoffs from local rainfall i e nam output were added to the river model using either distributed or point sources across the river network for the catchment modelling the study area was divided into 37 subcatchments based on topography administrative boundaries roads and rivers and grouped them into three subregions fig 2 a the northern subregion includes 18 subcatchments and consists of mostly porous soil and sloping land the middle region includes 8 subcatchments and consists of flat and less permeable soil the southern region includes 11 subcatchments and consists of depressions and flood cells the river model was configured by reproducing interconnecting rivers in the nw region fig 2b all rivers except mahananda drain to the jamuna river therefore flow through these rivers is significantly influenced by the wl in the jamuna there are several small rivers across the region but many of them carry no water during the dry season nov apr the karatoya and jamuneswari river systems carry a major proportion of catchment runoff to the jamuna river the river model consists of 21 boundaries including 10 cross boundary discharge 8 internal discharge and 3 wl boundaries daily discharge data were specified for inflow boundaries and wls were specified for outflow boundaries discharge data at gauging sites were generated using observed wl and the specific rating curves at each site i e discharge versus wl relationships at the zero flow boundaries a minimal flow usually 0 1 m3 s was specified to avoid drying up of rivers during the simulation havno et al 1995 3 3 parameter sensitivity and calibration understanding physical significance of model parameters and selecting an appropriate value for each parameter are an essential part of nam model calibration devak and dhanya 2017 santos et al 2022 as part of model calibration we investigated the sensitivity of all 13 nam parameters k0 and sy were the most significant parameters for gwl in our study fig a1 the model was used for the period of 1985 2015 however results from the 2001 2015 were used to calibrate the model because of lower confidence in the observed data before 2000 as the gwl is the focus of the study we calibrated the catchment model parameters against observed gwl and actual evapotranspiration model parameters were adjusted until a satisfactory agreement was achieved between modelled gwl and et and their corresponding observed values results were evaluated graphically as well as using the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse r correlation coefficient and pbias percent bias during the calibration emphasis was given to groundwater parameters such gwlbf0 ck1 2 ckbf lmax and sy table a1 calibration was carried out in two steps initial calibration was executed using a global parameter set i e single value for all 37 subcatchments results were evaluated against observed data and parameters were adjusted for individual subcatchment as necessary to achieve better match with observed data kumarasamy and belmont 2018 model simulated et were evaluated against cmrset data fig 3 depicts the observed and modelled groundwater depth for the selected subcatchments in the northwest region modelled groundwater depth captured well against 15 years of observed groundwater data for the most districts except for the nawabganj modelled gwls and timing of monthly fluctuations resembled well with observed gwls however there are some differences for the high and low gwls nawabganj and thakurgaon among the 16 subcatchments nse varied between 0 42 and 0 85 with an average of 0 72 in terms of nse and pbias model produced the best result for the pabna district and the worst results for nawabganj district in addition to gwl modelled monthly et across the nw region were evaluated against satellite based actual et data modelled et was found in good agreement with cmrset data however there were discrepancies for the peak et for some subcatchments across the region the model simulated monthly et varied from 80 to 101 mm between 37 subcatchments with an average of 89 3 mm the cnrset estimated average monthly et was 93 6 mm the nse varied from 0 51 to 0 84 with an average of 0 72 at an annual scale modelled et varied from 1039 to 1169 mm compared to 1087 to 1161 average of 1119 mm in cmrset data for the 18 subcatchments in the northern subregion similar results were obtained for the subcatchments in the middle and southern subregions for the 19 subcatchments in the middle and southern subregions modelled et varied from 1060 to 1185 mm average of 1105 mm compared to 1032 to 1170 average of 1108 mm by cmrset for all three regions the bias is small 2 across the region correlation coefficients varied from 0 78 to 0 93 with an average of 0 88 noting that the catchment model was run at subcatchment scale while cmrset data were at district scale section 2 1 which is 2 3 times bigger some differences in nam and cmrset estimates could be due to the differences in the spatial resolution results from the river model were evaluated against the observed wl and discharge at gauging sites model parameter surface roughness coefficient manning s n was calibrated using an iterative process and results were evaluated against observed wl and discharge for each set of parameter value during the calibration river cross sections were manually adjusted to ensure a continuous flow path simulated wls compared well with the observed data with nse of between 0 55 and 0 72 fig 4 a although the model slightly underpredicted peaks badarganj and kurigram the differences are not large it is important to note that we could not make a thorough comparison for discharge because of limited observed data in general modelled discharge matched reasonably well with observed data where available fig 4b modelled discharge also resembled with timing of observed wl peaks and lows calibrated n varied from 0 034 to 0 042 for rivers and 0 045 to 0 055 for floodplains 3 4 scenario modelling an assessment of changes in gwl for future climate and water management options was conducted using the calibrated catchment and river models scenario results were evaluated with respect to the current climate and development scenario also called baseline for the baseline scenario irrigated crop and other vegetation were estimated based on 2015 land cover data we investigated five contrasting climate scenarios encompassing uncertainties in projected rainfall and pet these include two scenarios for extreme rainfall low high two for extreme pet low high and one for average rainfall and average pet for each scenario the best gcm was selected using an algorithm described by karim et al 2020 future rainfall and pet for the 2060s were estimated using gcms results for selected models we have used scaling factors and historical data to generate time series data as described in zheng et al 2018 five climate scenarios are designated as avpetlor avpethir avpetavr lopetavr hipetavr where av stands for average lo for low hi for high and r for rainfall in addition to the five climate scenarios we ran a scenario on irrigation water management this scenario considered 20 surface water supply an increase from current 5 and 80 groundwater supply to meet irrigation demand 4 results 4 1 changes in rainfall most future climate scenarios show an increase in rainfall across the nw bangladesh fig 5 for an average future climate scenario avpetavr rainfall in 16 nw district varies from 1598 to 2844 mm compared to historical rainfall of 1430 2540 mm in the period of 1985 2015 approximately an 11 9 increase for the low rainfall scenario avpetlor changes in rainfall are minimal 2 however for the high rainfall scenario avpethir up to a 21 9 increase in rainfall is projected 4 2 changes in evapotranspiration the evapotranspiration loss is projected to increase under future climates fig 6 a four scenarios out of five produce higher et than the historical climate and one scenario lopetavr delivered a slightly lower et on an annual scale et varied from 1097 mm in nawabganj to 1215 mm in bogra for an average future climate avpetavr compared to changes in rainfall see section 4 1 et varies less between districts in the five climate scenarios the mean annual et across the region varies from 1026 mm in nawabganj for the low pet scenario lopetavr to 1237 mm in bogra for the high pet scenario hipetavr for the avpetavr scenario the projected et is about 5 6 more than the current et of 1161 mm the increase in et for avpetlor and avpethir scenarios are 2 9 and 7 0 respectively fig 6b 4 3 impacts on groundwater level the projected rate of gwl decline reduces for three of the climate scenarios avpetavr avpethir lopetavr and for the increased river water use scenario however for the high pet and low rainfall scenarios the gwl decline increases fig 7 a across the region gwl decreases by 8 mm at bogra and 202 mm at nawabganj annually for the baseline scenario for the avpetavr these rates are 7 6 mm and 177 mm for the bogra and nawabganj respectively the current rate of gwl decline is greatest at nawabganj 202 mm and 2nd largest at rajshahi 75 mm while some improvements are expected under future climates the rates of decline will still be high for these two districts 177 and 70 mm respectively for the avpetavr scenario the current rate of gwl decline is in the range of 30 35 at dinajpur lalmonirhat naogaon and pabna and less than 20 mm in the remaining districts in terms of percentage changes the high rainfall scenario avpethir produces the most improvement for declining gwl ranging from 10 to 42 between 16 districts fig 7b the impacts of avpetavr scenario are positive for all 16 districts 1 21 however the gwl can decline further if the low rainfall or high pet scenario is realised amongst the 16 districts the rate of gwl decline could increase by 1 20 for the avpetlor scenarios and 1 4 14 for the hipetavr scenario 4 4 impacts on river flow climate change is projected to have a significant influence on river flow however the impacts are not uniform between rivers and locations fig 8 as expected the high rainfall scenario produces more river flow while the low rainfall scenario produces less river flow generally rivers with less flow are more sensitive to climate change e g atrai bangali jamuneswari and the rivers with high flows are less sensitive e g dharla mahananda the climate change impact varies between months primarily because of high catchment runoff during wetter months june to october for an average rainfall and pet scenario river flow increases from 1 5 at kurigram to 38 at joypurhat as much as 65 increase in river flow is projected at joypurhat for the high rainfall scenario for all scenarios the maximum increase occurred at joypurhat station on the little jamuna river fig 9 5 discussion the historical data show that rainfall in the nw region of bangladesh varies spatially and temporally and that most districts have a decreasing rainfall trend dey et al 2017 fahad et al 2018 mainuddin et al 2022 mojid et al 2019 however most studies on future climate project a rainfall increase for bangladesh including in the nw region e g hasan et al 2018 kamruzzaman and cho 2019 karim et al 2020 this may have a significant influence on the gwl across the country especially in the nw region where groundwater recharge primarily depends on rainfall mojid et al 2021a this study found an increase in projected rainfall under future climates scenarios except for the low rainfall scenario avpetlor although rainfall increase is projected for the entire nw at an annual scale deceases in rainfall is projected for some months karim et al 2020 across the 16 nw districts actual et varies spatially and temporally this variation arises because the cropping intensity varies between districts and the climate varies between years like rainfall an increase in et is projected for all 16 districts under future climate primarily due to increases in pet for the average climate scenario approximately 6 more et is projected for the region this indicates an additional water requirement to sustain the current level of irrigated crops et estimates in this study are very similar to average et increase reported in mainuddin et al 2021a availability of more water under a future climate also contributes to increase in et however the scenario of more river water use for irrigation produced little increase in et 1 because water availability for et is not changed only the source is changed present and predicted future gwls are consistent with earlier studies on declining groundwater trend across the nw region e g hodgson et al 2022 mojid et al 2019 the study assessed declining gwl across nw region but with different declining rates in most cases declining gwl varies from 20 to 30 mm annually however declining rate in the two southern districts nawabganj and rajshahi are very high which is alarming for future sustainable groundwater resources while there are many factors in the decline of gwl the two main reasons are the decreasing rainfall and increasing groundwater use for irrigation the high rates of decrease in gwl simulated for nawabganj and rajshahi compare well with the corresponding average values of 250 mm and 119 mm simulated by janardhanan et al 2021 using different groundwater models trends in observed gwl also agree with these high rates of declining gwl hodgson et al 2021 generally high declining rates of gwl were found for the joypurhat naogaon nawabganj and rajshahi around the barind tract assessment of recharge dynamics identified that rejected recharge is the least in the southern districts indicating that potential maximum recharge may have been achieved for these areas mojid et al 2021a on the other hand the northern districts still have higher proportions of rejected recharge indicating groundwater development may induce further recharge in these districts thus the smaller levels of gwl decline could be reflective of the declining rainfall in the northern districts high rates of decline could also lead to permanent lowering of gwl below the suction limit approximately 7 m from the ground level in many places this may cause loss of access to groundwater for the majority of the population as they rely on hand tubewells to access groundwater for drinking this will also affect the irrigation by shallow tubewells which covers about 70 of the irrigated area hodgson et al 2021 results from climate change scenarios show that gwl could get better in the future rainfall was identified as the key element for gwl in the nw region as expected high rainfall increases groundwater recharge and contributes to more groundwater storage during the monsoonal months importantly if the rainfall increases as projected gwls in the nawabganj and rajshahi districts could be significantly improved however irrigation demand will increase if pet increases overall there is a possibility of reduction in current declining trend across the nw regions the results also confirmed that if additional surface water can be sourced for irrigation there is a strong possibility of reduction in current declining trend of gwl the greatest improvement is projected for the rajshahi and nawabganj districts where current rates of gwl decline are very high 75 and 202 mm respectively this indicates that increasing surface water irrigation is an option for sustainable groundwater management in the region this management option can be implemented by creating storages e g ponds weirs deepening local canals and capturing water from rainfall and river flow to sustain groundwater irrigation in the future several water saving measures such as conservation agriculture and alternate wetting and drying are being promoted by the bangladesh government however hydrological impacts of these water saving measures are yet to be tested diversification of crops and using more surface water irrigation are other recommended measures to reduce pressure on groundwater the government policies are based on the understanding that the gwls are falling in all 16 districts and that the sustainability of groundwater is in question results of this study show that declining groundwater trend is concerning for southern districts nawabganj and rajshahi but there is no problem of groundwater irrigation in the northern part of the region in fact there is rejection of recharge in the northern part of the region which indicates that further increase in groundwater irrigation though further increase may not be possible as there are no land to irrigate may not cause any permanent decline mojid et al 2021a the results of this study provide compelling evidence that i the sustainability of groundwater irrigation is not as dire as it is sometimes perceived ii gwl decline is not a problem in the whole region iii there are other factors e g declining rainfall in addition to net overuse in the southern barind region and iv in the future the gwl decline is not projected to be worse under most climate change scenarios rather the overall impact is positive the current government policy of increase in surface water usage through creating water storages and excavating canals will reduce pressure on groundwater and increase recharge thus likely to sustain groundwater irrigation as shown in this study findings of this study are invaluable to develop new policies and plans for sustaining groundwater irrigation not only for the nw region but for the entire country as mentioned earlier nw region is a small downstream part of the ganges brahmaputra basin the upstream areas of which are going through much change and development as reported in surinaidu et al 2020 and wahid et al 2021 furthermore most rivers in the nw bangladesh are transboundary and it is reasonable to expect that changes in himalayan climate will impact the flow regimes of these transboundary rivers however this study did not incorporate upstream basin development and climate change therefore our results should be interpreted cautiously because basin development and future climate may alter river flow in some places moreover lateral inflow outflow between subcatchments and rivers was not included in the current model configuration due to insufficient data while the basin scale water balance remains the same local scale water balances may differ if there is significant difference between lateral inflow and outflow 6 conclusion this study configured and calibrated catchment and river models to investigate declining gwl in the nw region of bangladesh agreement between model predicted and observed gwls was generally good in all districts except nawabganj this deviation may be because nawabganj is located partly on floodplain and partly on the higher ground of the barind tract large declines in gwl were observed in districts such as nawabganj and rajshahi in the drier parts of the nw region historical groundwater data showed there is a consistent groundwater decline across the region the rate of gwl decline varies and in rajshahi and nawabganj it is very high 75 and 202 mm respectively the impacts of projected future climate were found to be mostly positive with a reduction in the rate of gwl decline compared to 2015 condition one of the main reasons for the improvement in gwl is the increase in recharge because of increases in rainfall under projected future climates as expected future climates with projected high rainfall produces improving gwl and high pet produces worsening gwl while some positive impacts of increasing rainfall are overshadowed by increasing et projected climate change generally results in positive outlook for irrigation water supply in nw bangladesh importantly groundwater irrigation may be sustainable except in rajshahi and nawabganj if rainfall increases as projected under future climate the results show that storing more surface water during wet season and using this additional water for irrigation during the dry period is a viable option for sustainable groundwater use in the region in the areas where the current declining rate is small our results suggest that management options influence gwls less this information is helpful for the planning of sustainable groundwater irrigation in the region and elsewhere declaration of competing interest the

11649,declining groundwater resources are a big concern for irrigated agriculture worldwide this study investigated the causes of declining groundwater and how future climate and management measures impact the groundwater resource in bangladesh a conceptual hydrological model nam was used to quantify catchment runoff groundwater recharge and evapotranspiration loss and a hydraulic model mike11 was used to quantify changes in river flow the models were calibrated using observed water level discharge groundwater level gwl and actual evapotranspiration et the modelling encompassed five contrasting climate scenarios of rainfall and potential evapotranspiration pet and a management scenario of additional surface water irrigation the results show that gwl is declining across 16 administrative districts in the northwest region of bangladesh on average the annual decline varies from 20 to 30 mm except for two southern districts where the annual decline was more than 80 mm declining rainfall and increasing use of groundwater for irrigation were the principal causes of declining gwl across the region under the climate change scenarios modelled groundwater conditions improve due to increased rainfall the increase in river water extraction for irrigation also produced positive outcomes for gwl i e lessening the declining rate graphical abstract image 1 keywords

during the wet season hossain et al 2021 mojid et al 2021a consequently gwls are decreasing at many places across bangladesh hodgson et al 2022 hossain et al 2021 janardhanan et al 2021 over the last few decades bangladesh has over exploited groundwater for irrigated agriculture especially for boro rice cultivation during the dry period while the country has achieved self sufficiency in rice

groundwater and this excessive extraction is considered as a major factor contributing to the declining gwl in the nw region mainuddin et al 2021b mojid et al 2021b tulip et al 2022 in some places groundwater extraction is higher than the recharge so the sustainability of its use in long term is questionable hodgson et al 2022 mojid et al 2021b the current trend of declining gwl has led to a

previous studies reported declining gwl across the nw districts hasanuzzaman et al 2017 janardhanan et al 2021 mainuddin et al 2021b mojid et al 2021a tulip et al 2022 however none of the studies reported causes of declining gwl and it is not evident whether the depletion is due to less recharge over exploitation of groundwater for irrigation or a combination of hydrologic and land management factors e g changes in land use low flows in the rivers to address this issue we have investigated various components of water balance rainfall evapotranspiration groundwater extraction recharge and identified possible causes of declining groundwater we also investigated how climate change and irrigation management impact current trends in gwl we explored five climate scenarios two for high and low rainfall two for high and low pet and the fifth for average rainfall and pet in addition our investigations include an additional management scenario of increased surface water contribution for irrigation the manuscript is organized as follows in section 2 we briefly describe the climate and hydrology of study area section 3 describes the methods and data used for model configuration and calibration section 4 presents the results and these are discussed in section 5 finally major conclusions of the study are presented in section 6 2 study area the study includes 16 nw administrative districts of bangladesh with an approximate area of 34 540 km2 fig 1 the area includes an uplifted block of terraced land commonly known as the barind tract the elevation of the barind tract is generally higher than adjoining lands and the area is free from seasonal floods hasan et al 2016 runoff from local rainfall and inflows through the teesta and jamuna rivers are the two primary sources of river water in the nw region the northern districts dinajpur kurigram lalmonirhat nilphamari panchagarh and thakurgaon districts consist of sloping land and highly permeable soil the middle districts gaibandha joypurhat and rangpur consist of flat land and less permeable soil the southern districts bogra naogaon natore nawabganj rajshahi pabna and sirajganj consist of low lying lands and permeable soil rainfall in the nw region of bangladesh varies spatially and temporally historical data from 1985 to 2015 indicate a decreasing rainfall trend in most of the nw districts karim et al 2020 mainuddin et al 2022 across the 16 nw districts average rainfall is 1890 mm annually with the maximum in kurigram 2540 mm and minimum in rajshahi 1430 mm karim et al 2020 mainuddin et al 2022 most of the rainfall 93 in the region occurs during may to october and there is a considerable variation between months from 6 mm in december to 395 mm in july the rainfall is least in december and january less than 1 compared to rainfall the spatial and temporal variability of pet is minimal at an annual scale pet varies from 1219 mm minimum 1106 maximum 1319 in the dinajpur district to 1362 mm minimum 1184 maximum 1614 in pabna across the region monthly variation of pet is also relatively small karim et al 2021 mainuddin et al 2022 3 material and methods 3 1 data sources climate data temperature rainfall and radiation were obtained from the bangladesh meteorological department bmd there are 6 weather stations that record temperature rainfall radiation humidity and wind speed and 11 stations to record rainfall table 1 see fig 1 for location daily data for these 17 stations were collected and processed from 1985 to 2015 pets for the 6 weather stations were estimated using the penman monteith equation monteith 1981 for the pets for the other districts we used the average of adjacent weather stations we note that the average size of a district is approximately 2160 km2 and the variation in climate data between districts is gradual karim et al 2020 mainuddin et al 2022 future rainfall and pet were derived using simulations from 28 different global climate models gcms there were 18 downscaled gcm grids in the nw region however we used data from six gcm grids closest to bmd s weather stations actual et data were obtained from a companion study by peña arancibia et al 2020 this data set is based on modis imagery mod09ga product and is commonly known as cmrset data river flow data water level and discharge for 42 river gauges in the study area were obtained from the bangladesh water development board bwdb table 1 depending on location data were available from 1972 however most of the gauges lacked continuous records and contained erroneous data the primary sources of errors arise from datum change or gauge shifting and sometimes from recording errors water level wl data were validated through consistency checking by visual inspection and plotting longitudinal water surface profiles for different periods discharge data were validated by plotting the stage discharge relationship and by identifying the outliers missing wl data during floods or due to faulty instruments were in filled by correlating downstream and upstream gauges on the same river we have used monthly time series of average gwl in each district derived from bwdb s weekly groundwater depth data bwdb operates 437 monitoring wells in the nw region and records weekly groundwater depth manually hodgson et al 2022 while bwdb s database has records from the mid 1960s we have used data from 1985 to 2015 based on the quality of record and completeness of the database some of these data were processed during an earlier csiro project kirby et al 2015 and we have extended the database to 2015 as a part of this study we produced a monthly district level time series by taking arithmetic mean of all data in a month phase difference between wells were adjusted during aggregation to produce district averaged time series 3 2 model configuration the focus of the study on conjunctive management and climate change impacts warranted the simulation of surface water processes and propagation of its effects to predict changes in gwl across the region hence we chose a combination of hydrological and hydrodynamic models that can simulate these effects similar approach was used by sridhar et al 2018 to investigate climate change impacts on gwl in the snake river basin in united states two models were configured one for simulating runoff and gwl catchment model and the other for simulating surface water availability across the river network river model the catchment model was configured using the nam nedbor afstromnings model hydrological model a physically based lumped water balance model dhi 2008 rainfall and pet were primary inputs to this model the model simulates catchment runoff by satisfying the moisture content in three interconnected storages surface zone root zone and groundwater agrawal and desmukh 2016 the model is based on 13 parameters including 5 parameters to estimate the changes in groundwater storage appendix 1 the river model was configured using the mike 11 a one dimensional hydrodynamic model based on shallow water saint venant equations of continuity and momentum dhi 2017 havno et al 1995 river flows from upstream catchments were incorporated into the model using several inflow boundaries and runoffs from local rainfall i e nam output were added to the river model using either distributed or point sources across the river network for the catchment modelling the study area was divided into 37 subcatchments based on topography administrative boundaries roads and rivers and grouped them into three subregions fig 2 a the northern subregion includes 18 subcatchments and consists of mostly porous soil and sloping land the middle region includes 8 subcatchments and consists of flat and less permeable soil the southern region includes 11 subcatchments and consists of depressions and flood cells the river model was configured by reproducing interconnecting rivers in the nw region fig 2b all rivers except mahananda drain to the jamuna river therefore flow through these rivers is significantly influenced by the wl in the jamuna there are several small rivers across the region but many of them carry no water during the dry season nov apr the karatoya and jamuneswari river systems carry a major proportion of catchment runoff to the jamuna river the river model consists of 21 boundaries including 10 cross boundary discharge 8 internal discharge and 3 wl boundaries daily discharge data were specified for inflow boundaries and wls were specified for outflow boundaries discharge data at gauging sites were generated using observed wl and the specific rating curves at each site i e discharge versus wl relationships at the zero flow boundaries a minimal flow usually 0 1 m3 s was specified to avoid drying up of rivers during the simulation havno et al 1995 3 3 parameter sensitivity and calibration understanding physical significance of model parameters and selecting an appropriate value for each parameter are an essential part of nam model calibration devak and dhanya 2017 santos et al 2022 as part of model calibration we investigated the sensitivity of all 13 nam parameters k0 and sy were the most significant parameters for gwl in our study fig a1 the model was used for the period of 1985 2015 however results from the 2001 2015 were used to calibrate the model because of lower confidence in the observed data before 2000 as the gwl is the focus of the study we calibrated the catchment model parameters against observed gwl and actual evapotranspiration model parameters were adjusted until a satisfactory agreement was achieved between modelled gwl and et and their corresponding observed values results were evaluated graphically as well as using the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse r correlation coefficient and pbias percent bias during the calibration emphasis was given to groundwater parameters such gwlbf0 ck1 2 ckbf lmax and sy table a1 calibration was carried out in two steps initial calibration was executed using a global parameter set i e single value for all 37 subcatchments results were evaluated against observed data and parameters were adjusted for individual subcatchment as necessary to achieve better match with observed data kumarasamy and belmont 2018 model simulated et were evaluated against cmrset data fig 3 depicts the observed and modelled groundwater depth for the selected subcatchments in the northwest region modelled groundwater depth captured well against 15 years of observed groundwater data for the most districts except for the nawabganj modelled gwls and timing of monthly fluctuations resembled well with observed gwls however there are some differences for the high and low gwls nawabganj and thakurgaon among the 16 subcatchments nse varied between 0 42 and 0 85 with an average of 0 72 in terms of nse and pbias model produced the best result for the pabna district and the worst results for nawabganj district in addition to gwl modelled monthly et across the nw region were evaluated against satellite based actual et data modelled et was found in good agreement with cmrset data however there were discrepancies for the peak et for some subcatchments across the region the model simulated monthly et varied from 80 to 101 mm between 37 subcatchments with an average of 89 3 mm the cnrset estimated average monthly et was 93 6 mm the nse varied from 0 51 to 0 84 with an average of 0 72 at an annual scale modelled et varied from 1039 to 1169 mm compared to 1087 to 1161 average of 1119 mm in cmrset data for the 18 subcatchments in the northern subregion similar results were obtained for the subcatchments in the middle and southern subregions for the 19 subcatchments in the middle and southern subregions modelled et varied from 1060 to 1185 mm average of 1105 mm compared to 1032 to 1170 average of 1108 mm by cmrset for all three regions the bias is small 2 across the region correlation coefficients varied from 0 78 to 0 93 with an average of 0 88 noting that the catchment model was run at subcatchment scale while cmrset data were at district scale section 2 1 which is 2 3 times bigger some differences in nam and cmrset estimates could be due to the differences in the spatial resolution results from the river model were evaluated against the observed wl and discharge at gauging sites model parameter surface roughness coefficient manning s n was calibrated using an iterative process and results were evaluated against observed wl and discharge for each set of parameter value during the calibration river cross sections were manually adjusted to ensure a continuous flow path simulated wls compared well with the observed data with nse of between 0 55 and 0 72 fig 4 a although the model slightly underpredicted peaks badarganj and kurigram the differences are not large it is important to note that we could not make a thorough comparison for discharge because of limited observed data in general modelled discharge matched reasonably well with observed data where available fig 4b modelled discharge also resembled with timing of observed wl peaks and lows calibrated n varied from 0 034 to 0 042 for rivers and 0 045 to 0 055 for floodplains 3 4 scenario modelling an assessment of changes in gwl for future climate and water management options was conducted using the calibrated catchment and river models scenario results were evaluated with respect to the current climate and development scenario also called baseline for the baseline scenario irrigated crop and other vegetation were estimated based on 2015 land cover data we investigated five contrasting climate scenarios encompassing uncertainties in projected rainfall and pet these include two scenarios for extreme rainfall low high two for extreme pet low high and one for average rainfall and average pet for each scenario the best gcm was selected using an algorithm described by karim et al 2020 future rainfall and pet for the 2060s were estimated using gcms results for selected models we have used scaling factors and historical data to generate time series data as described in zheng et al 2018 five climate scenarios are designated as avpetlor avpethir avpetavr lopetavr hipetavr where av stands for average lo for low hi for high and r for rainfall in addition to the five climate scenarios we ran a scenario on irrigation water management this scenario considered 20 surface water supply an increase from current 5 and 80 groundwater supply to meet irrigation demand 4 results 4 1 changes in rainfall most future climate scenarios show an increase in rainfall across the nw bangladesh fig 5 for an average future climate scenario avpetavr rainfall in 16 nw district varies from 1598 to 2844 mm compared to historical rainfall of 1430 2540 mm in the period of 1985 2015 approximately an 11 9 increase for the low rainfall scenario avpetlor changes in rainfall are minimal 2 however for the high rainfall scenario avpethir up to a 21 9 increase in rainfall is projected 4 2 changes in evapotranspiration the evapotranspiration loss is projected to increase under future climates fig 6 a four scenarios out of five produce higher et than the historical climate and one scenario lopetavr delivered a slightly lower et on an annual scale et varied from 1097 mm in nawabganj to 1215 mm in bogra for an average future climate avpetavr compared to changes in rainfall see section 4 1 et varies less between districts in the five climate scenarios the mean annual et across the region varies from 1026 mm in nawabganj for the low pet scenario lopetavr to 1237 mm in bogra for the high pet scenario hipetavr for the avpetavr scenario the projected et is about 5 6 more than the current et of 1161 mm the increase in et for avpetlor and avpethir scenarios are 2 9 and 7 0 respectively fig 6b 4 3 impacts on groundwater level the projected rate of gwl decline reduces for three of the climate scenarios avpetavr avpethir lopetavr and for the increased river water use scenario however for the high pet and low rainfall scenarios the gwl decline increases fig 7 a across the region gwl decreases by 8 mm at bogra and 202 mm at nawabganj annually for the baseline scenario for the avpetavr these rates are 7 6 mm and 177 mm for the bogra and nawabganj respectively the current rate of gwl decline is greatest at nawabganj 202 mm and 2nd largest at rajshahi 75 mm while some improvements are expected under future climates the rates of decline will still be high for these two districts 177 and 70 mm respectively for the avpetavr scenario the current rate of gwl decline is in the range of 30 35 at dinajpur lalmonirhat naogaon and pabna and less than 20 mm in the remaining districts in terms of percentage changes the high rainfall scenario avpethir produces the most improvement for declining gwl ranging from 10 to 42 between 16 districts fig 7b the impacts of avpetavr scenario are positive for all 16 districts 1 21 however the gwl can decline further if the low rainfall or high pet scenario is realised amongst the 16 districts the rate of gwl decline could increase by 1 20 for the avpetlor scenarios and 1 4 14 for the hipetavr scenario 4 4 impacts on river flow climate change is projected to have a significant influence on river flow however the impacts are not uniform between rivers and locations fig 8 as expected the high rainfall scenario produces more river flow while the low rainfall scenario produces less river flow generally rivers with less flow are more sensitive to climate change e g atrai bangali jamuneswari and the rivers with high flows are less sensitive e g dharla mahananda the climate change impact varies between months primarily because of high catchment runoff during wetter months june to october for an average rainfall and pet scenario river flow increases from 1 5 at kurigram to 38 at joypurhat as much as 65 increase in river flow is projected at joypurhat for the high rainfall scenario for all scenarios the maximum increase occurred at joypurhat station on the little jamuna river fig 9 5 discussion the historical data show that rainfall in the nw region of bangladesh varies spatially and temporally and that most districts have a decreasing rainfall trend dey et al 2017 fahad et al 2018 mainuddin et al 2022 mojid et al 2019 however most studies on future climate project a rainfall increase for bangladesh including in the nw region e g hasan et al 2018 kamruzzaman and cho 2019 karim et al 2020 this may have a significant influence on the gwl across the country especially in the nw region where groundwater recharge primarily depends on rainfall mojid et al 2021a this study found an increase in projected rainfall under future climates scenarios except for the low rainfall scenario avpetlor although rainfall increase is projected for the entire nw at an annual scale deceases in rainfall is projected for some months karim et al 2020 across the 16 nw districts actual et varies spatially and temporally this variation arises because the cropping intensity varies between districts and the climate varies between years like rainfall an increase in et is projected for all 16 districts under future climate primarily due to increases in pet for the average climate scenario approximately 6 more et is projected for the region this indicates an additional water requirement to sustain the current level of irrigated crops et estimates in this study are very similar to average et increase reported in mainuddin et al 2021a availability of more water under a future climate also contributes to increase in et however the scenario of more river water use for irrigation produced little increase in et 1 because water availability for et is not changed only the source is changed present and predicted future gwls are consistent with earlier studies on declining groundwater trend across the nw region e g hodgson et al 2022 mojid et al 2019 the study assessed declining gwl across nw region but with different declining rates in most cases declining gwl varies from 20 to 30 mm annually however declining rate in the two southern districts nawabganj and rajshahi are very high which is alarming for future sustainable groundwater resources while there are many factors in the decline of gwl the two main reasons are the decreasing rainfall and increasing groundwater use for irrigation the high rates of decrease in gwl simulated for nawabganj and rajshahi compare well with the corresponding average values of 250 mm and 119 mm simulated by janardhanan et al 2021 using different groundwater models trends in observed gwl also agree with these high rates of declining gwl hodgson et al 2021 generally high declining rates of gwl were found for the joypurhat naogaon nawabganj and rajshahi around the barind tract assessment of recharge dynamics identified that rejected recharge is the least in the southern districts indicating that potential maximum recharge may have been achieved for these areas mojid et al 2021a on the other hand the northern districts still have higher proportions of rejected recharge indicating groundwater development may induce further recharge in these districts thus the smaller levels of gwl decline could be reflective of the declining rainfall in the northern districts high rates of decline could also lead to permanent lowering of gwl below the suction limit approximately 7 m from the ground level in many places this may cause loss of access to groundwater for the majority of the population as they rely on hand tubewells to access groundwater for drinking this will also affect the irrigation by shallow tubewells which covers about 70 of the irrigated area hodgson et al 2021 results from climate change scenarios show that gwl could get better in the future rainfall was identified as the key element for gwl in the nw region as expected high rainfall increases groundwater recharge and contributes to more groundwater storage during the monsoonal months importantly if the rainfall increases as projected gwls in the nawabganj and rajshahi districts could be significantly improved however irrigation demand will increase if pet increases overall there is a possibility of reduction in current declining trend across the nw regions the results also confirmed that if additional surface water can be sourced for irrigation there is a strong possibility of reduction in current declining trend of gwl the greatest improvement is projected for the rajshahi and nawabganj districts where current rates of gwl decline are very high 75 and 202 mm respectively this indicates that increasing surface water irrigation is an option for sustainable groundwater management in the region this management option can be implemented by creating storages e g ponds weirs deepening local canals and capturing water from rainfall and river flow to sustain groundwater irrigation in the future several water saving measures such as conservation agriculture and alternate wetting and drying are being promoted by the bangladesh government however hydrological impacts of these water saving measures are yet to be tested diversification of crops and using more surface water irrigation are other recommended measures to reduce pressure on groundwater the government policies are based on the understanding that the gwls are falling in all 16 districts and that the sustainability of groundwater is in question results of this study show that declining groundwater trend is concerning for southern districts nawabganj and rajshahi but there is no problem of groundwater irrigation in the northern part of the region in fact there is rejection of recharge in the northern part of the region which indicates that further increase in groundwater irrigation though further increase may not be possible as there are no land to irrigate may not cause any permanent decline mojid et al 2021a the results of this study provide compelling evidence that i the sustainability of groundwater irrigation is not as dire as it is sometimes perceived ii gwl decline is not a problem in the whole region iii there are other factors e g declining rainfall in addition to net overuse in the southern barind region and iv in the future the gwl decline is not projected to be worse under most climate change scenarios rather the overall impact is positive the current government policy of increase in surface water usage through creating water storages and excavating canals will reduce pressure on groundwater and increase recharge thus likely to sustain groundwater irrigation as shown in this study findings of this study are invaluable to develop new policies and plans for sustaining groundwater irrigation not only for the nw region but for the entire country as mentioned earlier nw region is a small downstream part of the ganges brahmaputra basin the upstream areas of which are going through much change and development as reported in surinaidu et al 2020 and wahid et al 2021 furthermore most rivers in the nw bangladesh are transboundary and it is reasonable to expect that changes in himalayan climate will impact the flow regimes of these transboundary rivers however this study did not incorporate upstream basin development and climate change therefore our results should be interpreted cautiously because basin development and future climate may alter river flow in some places moreover lateral inflow outflow between subcatchments and rivers was not included in the current model configuration due to insufficient data while the basin scale water balance remains the same local scale water balances may differ if there is significant difference between lateral inflow and outflow 6 conclusion this study configured and calibrated catchment and river models to investigate declining gwl in the nw region of bangladesh agreement between model predicted and observed gwls was generally good in all districts except nawabganj this deviation may be because nawabganj is located partly on floodplain and partly on the higher ground of the barind tract large declines in gwl were observed in districts such as nawabganj and rajshahi in the drier parts of the nw region historical groundwater data showed there is a consistent groundwater decline across the region the rate of gwl decline varies and in rajshahi and nawabganj it is very high 75 and 202 mm respectively the impacts of projected future climate were found to be mostly positive with a reduction in the rate of gwl decline compared to 2015 condition one of the main reasons for the improvement in gwl is the increase in recharge because of increases in rainfall under projected future climates as expected future climates with projected high rainfall produces improving gwl and high pet produces worsening gwl while some positive impacts of increasing rainfall are overshadowed by increasing et projected climate change generally results in positive outlook for irrigation water supply in nw bangladesh importantly groundwater irrigation may be sustainable except in rajshahi and nawabganj if rainfall increases as projected under future climate the results show that storing more surface water during wet season and using this additional water for irrigation during the dry period is a viable option for sustainable groundwater use in the region in the areas where the current declining rate is small our results suggest that management options influence gwls less this information is helpful for the planning of sustainable groundwater irrigation in the region and elsewhere declaration of competing interest the
