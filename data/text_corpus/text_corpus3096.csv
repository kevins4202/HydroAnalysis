15480,there are numerous studies concerning the impacts of widespread microplastic pollution on the ecological environment and it shows synergistic effect of microplastics and co exposed pollutants in risk enhancement however the control methods for removing harmful pollutants from microplastic surface to reduce their ecological toxicity has rarely been explored in this paper magnetic graphitized biochar as a catalyst is shown to achieve 97 removal of tetrabromobisphenol a tbbpa from microplastics by biochar mediated electron transfer the changes in the surface and structure of microplastics caused by various aging processes affected the pollutant attachment and subsequent removal efficiency after chlorination the highest disinfection by product dbp generation potential was observed by the group of microplastics attached with tbbpa the oxidation system of biochar activating peroxodisulfate pds can not only reduce the kinds of dbps but also greatly reduce the total amount of detected dbps by 76 as well as reducing the overall toxicity this paper highlights an overlooked contribution of pollutant attachment to the potential risks of dbp generated from natural microplastics during chlorination process and provides the underlying insights to guide the design of a biochar based catalyst from wastes to achieve the removal of tbbpa from microplastics and reduce the risks and hazards of co contamination graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords microplastics tetrabromobisphenol a sr aops biochar disinfection by products data availability the authors are unable or have chosen not to specify which data has been used 1 introduction the extensive and uncontrolled use of plastics as well as the limited recovery and improper disposal has led that large amounts of plastics enter natural waters lee et al 2020 shen et al 2020 more than 13 million tons of plastic are released into rivers and oceans globally each year foerster 2017 enfrin et al 2019 the discarded plastic is subjected to fragmentation and embrittlement by a combination of mechanical abrasion uv radiation and biological erosion fotopoulou and karapanagioti 2015 weinstein et al 2016 plastic fragments of all dimensions 1μm x 5 mm are defined as microplastics ter halle and ghiglione 2021 and exhibit potential toxic risks in aquatic ecosystem due to the small particle dimension and high mobility siegfried et al 2017 during migration into the natural environment microplastics show a high attractive affinity for harmful substances due to their rough surface and hydrophobicity therefore microplastics are regarded as vectors to achieve the long distance transmission of harmful substances huffer and hofmann 2016 fu et al 2021 sarkar et al 2021 microplastics along with the attached hazardous substances could increase the risks on inflammation and immune impairment of organisms carbery et al 2018 and also promote the accumulation and magnification of contaminants on organisms via the food chain turner and holmes 2015 kalcikova et al 2020 therefore there are growing concerns regarding the plastic fragments as well as their attached hazardous substances tetrabromobisphenol a tbbpa is widely used as a brominated flame retardant in electronic products and might be released into environment when the product waste is not properly disposed of chen et al 2020 tbbpa is frequently detected in various environmental matrices law et al 2006 makinen et al 2009 making potential health risks due to the hepatorenal toxicity and endocrine disrupting effect van der ven et al 2008 considering that tbbpa is mainly used as an additive for plastic products de wit et al 2010 microplastic particles and tbbpa are simultaneously exposed to a high level in related industrial wastewater because of its hydrophobicity tbbpa is neither easily dissolved in water nor diluted by water the co existing microplastic and tbbpa tend to form the aggregated organic co polluter wu et al 2019 which could cause synergistic toxic effects and accelerate the spread of pollutants in natural water bodies moreover the surface changes of microplastics during weathering process provide a more suitable sites for interaction with organic chemicals by hydrophobic force electrostatic force hydrogen binding and non covalent binding wu et al 2019 jin et al 2020 although traditional treatment can remove some of microplastics in sewage owing to the large amount of water discharged by sewage treatment plants municipal sewage treatment plants are also considered to be an important source of microplastics releasing up to 1010 particles day in the effluent of single plant mintenig et al 2017 gatidou et al 2019 and tbbpa suzuki and hasegawa 2006 the micrometer sizes of plastic particles make it difficult for the general filtration equipment to completely remove the organic co polluter of microplastic attached with tbbpa chlorine disinfection would be operated in water treatment before final discharge kozari et al 2020 wan et al 2020 it is an unavoidable consequence that the formation of toxic and carcinogenic disinfection byproducts dbps during chlorination since the organics as the dbp precursor would react with the added chlorine in water to form haloforms and other halogenated substances both microplastics derived dissolved organic matter lee et al 2020 and synthetic organic chemicals li et al 2020a zhu et al 2021 should be treated as dbps precursors during chlorination it can be expected that the tbbpa loaded microplastics have a higher risk of dbp generation than individual microplastic therefore it is necessary to focus on reducing the potential threat of natural microplastic by removing the attached organics sulfate radical advanced oxidation processes sr aops have been reported to be able to efficiently eliminate organic pollutants in water treatment with advantages of the high oxidation potential of radical e0 2 5 3 1 v a wide range of

rich functional groups produced in the process of biochar preparation oh et al 2018 ye et al 2020b which can promote the efficient electron transfer to achieve redox reactions in a pds system ho et al 2019 in addition biochar exhibits a high adsorption affinity for most pollutants ye et al 2019b li et al 2020b yang et al 2020 showing a promising application as a filter medium for municipal sewage treatment plants consequently biochar activated pds process has potential to be applied as a pre oxidation method for catalytic removal of attached tbbpa from microplastic surface and following a decrease in dbp formation during chlorination by altering the structure and concentration of the precursors this paper for the first time focuses on reducing the toxic risks from microplastics by removing the attached organic pollutants through an oxidation system the main purposes of this paper are to 1 investigate the performance of biochar pds system on the removal of the attached tbbpa from microplastics as well as the influence of water quality parameters on the removal efficiency 2 explore the effects of microplastic aging processes on the interaction between microplastics and tbbpa and the different removal efficiencies of tbbpa from various aged microplastics by biochar pds system 3 reveal the dbps formation potential of the tbbpa loaded microplastics and 4 discuss the risk assessment of dbps formation of microplastics attached with tbbpa undergone the biochar pds oxidation system in the subsequent chlorination process 2 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials besides the wide distribution in discharge water of plastic factories polyvinyl chloride pvc particles may be produced by long term weathering of water transportation pipeline and they were selected as type of microplastics mps in the experiment the tested pvc microplastic particles were purchased from aladdin chemical company shanghai china the organic pollutant representative tbbpa was acquired from sigma aldrich usa detailed information was provided in supporting information si the sodium peroxydisulfate na2s2o8 pds purity 98 0 and potassium ferrate k2feo4 purity 99 0 were provided by shanghai macklin biochemical co ltd haloacetic acids haas and trihalomethanes thms and their mix standard solution were obtained from rhawn shanghai china and accustandard new haven usa 2 2 synthesis of biochar based catalyst straw powders particle size of 0 15 mm were treated as precursors for biochar catalyst and they were soaked into the solution of k2feo4 0 1 m with continuous agitation lasting for 12 h after filtration and then vacuum drying at 80 c overnight the pre treated biomass solid was annealed in tube furnace operating at 900 c lasting for 2 h with continuous flow of n2 the carbonized solid after naturally cooling was soaked and rinsed with 0 1 m hcl to remove the excess dissolved inorganic and organic impurities on the surface and thereby the resulted solid was regarded as a biochar catalyst with little matter leaching the details in characterization methods were provided in supplementary material 2 3 experiment procedure 2 3 1 oxidation process pvc microplastics were dispersed in a 50 ml solution containing 3 mg l tbbpa to simulate the co existence of a high concentration of microplastics and additives in discharge industrial wastewater adsorption desorption equilibrium was established by maintaining moderate oscillation overnight and the attached amount of tbbpa onto microplastic surface was calculated before the oxidation treatment in typical sr aops 2 mg biochar and a certain concentration of pds solution were added successively to trigger the oxidation process the solution samples were taken at regular intervals for determination after filtration with 0 45 μm pvdf disposable filter the tbbpa attached on solids was extracted by methanol according to the high recovery of methanol for tbbpa in pre experiment the solid particles were filtered and magnetically separated into the magnetic biochar and microplastic particles after ultrasonic extraction by methanol for 45 min period the solution was filtered for concentration detection the tbbpa concentration was measured by high performance liquid chromatography hplc agilent 1260 infinity usa performed with infinitylab poroshell 120 ec c18 column 4 6 mm 150 mm at detecting λ of 209 nm temperature of 30 c and injection volume of 20 μl the mobile phase used for detection was methanol water 85 15 v v with at a flow rate of 1 0 ml min 2 3 2 chlorination and bdps determination after

id 0 25 μm film thickness agilent j w 3 results and discussion 3 1 oxidation performance of biochar pds 3 1 1 biochar activated pds for tbbpa removal on microplastic surface when pvc microplastics and tbbpa are co exposed in an aqueous solution tbbpa molecules tend to attach onto the microplastic surface due to the strong hydrophobicity of contaminants the adsorption equilibrium capacity for tbbpa by pvc microplastics was calculated to be as high as 10 3 mg g fig s1 which indicated the adsorption ability of microplastics and their role as vectors in respect of the pollutant transport in the water environment compared the extracted amount of tbbpa by methanol from the microplastics with its saturated adsorption capacity mentioned after adsorption equilibrium it could be found the recovery efficiency for tbbpa from microplastics by methanol can reach more than 99 therefore it is convincing to employ methanol extraction to calculate the residual tbbpa on microplastic surface fig 1 a exhibits the content changes of tbbpa on microplastics and solution under different treatments that were subjected to the individual biochar pds and biochar activated pds system compared with the blank experiment content of tbbpa on the microplastic surface decreased only a little in the individual biochar 5 7 or pds 21 treated group in terms of the biochar alone biochar could reduce the tbbpa concentration in the solution by adsorption but the removal of tbbpa from microplastic surface cannot be achieved effectively by mere competitive adsorption incorporation of pds with biochar into the solution suspended with microplastics it could be observed by the significant decrease in tbbpa contents on both microplastic surface and solution suggesting the critical role of oxidation process induced by pds activation with biochar for tbbpa removal the variation of tbbpa concentration at different periods was shown in fig 1b there is a time dependent oxidation process and the kinetics curve of tbbpa degradation shows about 70 proportion of removal in the first 30 minutes seen from the extracted tbbpa content from the tested microplastics about 97 removal of tbbpa from microplastic surface could be received by biochar pds system after oxidation for 150 minutes to identify the content changes of tbbpa on microplastic surfaces several characterization methods were carried out on pvc microplastics which were undergone the tbbpa attachment and subsequent sr aops variations in absorption peak position can be observed by ftir spectra of mps before and after tbbpa loaded and undergone oxidation treatment fig 2 a a new peak located at approximately 3480 cm 1 attributed to the stretching vibration of hydroxy and carboxy moieties or the hydrogen bonds between the organic molecules liu et al 2019 was only detected on the spectra of tbbpa loaded pvc it confirmed that the attachment behavior of tbbpa onto microplastic was classified as a multilayer adsorption on nonuniform surface and the partition and hydrogen bonding were regarded as the possible interaction mechanisms moreover the fresh bands appearing at peak position of 1560 and 1470 cm 1 are assigned to the vibration of benzene ring and methyl group ch3 respectively which are not likely to appear in the spectra of pvc microplastic yet belong to the functional groups of tbbpa considering the intensity increase of peak at about 500 cm 1 derived from the c br vibration the ability of microplastics to bind tbbpa molecules could be verified it can also be observed in the ftir spectra of the treated microplastic that the peak intensities of the mentioned tbbpa characteristic signals are significantly reduced or even completely disappeared indicating the effectiveness of biochar pds oxidation system in removing organic pollutants from the microplastic surface similar results can be obtained from the xps spectra shown in fig 2b besides the composition elements of pvc particles extra bromine element can be observed on the full survey of tbbpa loaded mps the high resolution spectra of br 3d exhibited in fig 2c and d before and after oxidation process could be resolved into two fitted peaks as 70 9 ev and 69 7 ev after the removal treatment of biochar pds oxidation system not only did the signal intensity of br element decrease significantly but also the proportion of each bonding on br 3d was changed this is another evidence that the loaded tbbpa on microplastic surface can be transformed by biochar pds system elemental mapping analysis was performed by scanning transmission electron microscopy stem mode assisted with eds to visualize the element distribution on the surface of microplastics fig s2 it can be clearly observed from the mapping images that when the microplastics co existed with tbbpa molecules the characteristic signal of br on microplastic surface was significantly enhanced due to the attachment of tbbpa undergone the biochar pds oxidation process the signal of br was weakened markedly detailed information in table s1 shows the mass ratio of each element detected by eds and the element proportion of br significantly decreases from 0 45 to 0 11 wt the higher detected br atomic percentage on microplastics than expected may be explained by the adsorption of br containing intermediates or br ion degraded from tbbpa onto the microplastics 3 1 2 effects of environmental conditions considering that microplastics can be used as potential vectors for the spread of hazardous substances to different waters the impacts of complex water quality on tbbpa attachment and subsequent removal from microplastics should be analyzed and discussed the salinity of the solution surrounding the microplastics changes significantly between the wastewater to the ocean the effect of salinity gradient was studied and shown in fig 3 a the attachment of tbbpa on the microplastic surface was found to be increased as the electrolyte strength increased from 0 to 2 the reason might be that the salting out effect of nacl promoted the hydrophobic interaction of tbbpa and pvc particles by decreasing the solubility of organic compounds li et al 2021 however the continuous increase of salinity might reduce the repulsion between microplastic particles by neutralizing their surface charge and compressing the electric double layer li et al 2018 thus subsequently facilitating the agglomeration of microplastics the reduction of free volume and surface accessible sites of microplastic particles caused by the compaction might further decrease the attached amount of tbbpa onto microplastic surface in addition the degradation of tbbpa both on microplastic surface and in solution by biochar pds system was slightly inhibited at high salinity it might be explained by the captured behavior of chloride ions for free radicals to produce low oxidizing species another reason might be the few contact opportunities between reactive species and the tbbpa attached onto microplastic surface due to the gradual agglomeration of microplastic particles it is difficult for the reactive species generated on biochar surface to get close to the microplastic surface humic acid ha with negative charge is a common organic matter found in natural water which is rich in oxygen containing functional groups consequently ha would like to form copolymers with microplastics and play various roles in the adsorption performance of mps for pollutants chen et al 2018 zhang et al 2018a it could be found from fig 3b that a slight promotion in tbbpa attachment onto mps was observed at a low concentration of ha which may be attributed to the improvement of hydrophobicity and charge on microplastic surface by ha on the one hand it was beneficial to the dispersion of pvc particles on the other hand it enhanced the hydrogen bonding and π π interaction of the copolymers to improve the attracting affinity for tbbpa molecules a high concentration of ha 15 mg l showed inhibiting effect on tbbpa adsorption by microplastics it could be explained by the more ha adhesion on microplastic surface occupying the adsorbed sites besides the interaction of tbbpa molecules and ha might enhance pollutant mobility thereby hindering the access of pollutants reaching microplastic surface the covered ha on microplastic surface also affected the removal performance of biochar pds system to the attached tbbpa through the competition with tbbpa for reactive species or interfering with their connection the lowest tbbpa concentration in solution after oxidation was found at a condition of 20 mg l ha which may be due to the influence of the soluble complex compounds formed by ha and tbbpa on the membrane filtration and detection besides the surface charge of microplastics the chemical speciation of tbbpa molecules is also transformed through the protonation deprotonation of ionizable functional groups at different ph considering the near neutral environment of natural water the experiment was conducted with an initial ph varying in the range of 6 5 8 5 fig 3c based on the two dissociation constant pka 7 5 and 8 5 li et al 2021 tbbpa can exist in the form of zwitterions tbbpa0 and anions tbbpa and tbbpa2 the zeta potential test fig s3 showed that zero potential point phzpc of microplastic was around 2 08 and the negative charge enhanced with the increase of the tested ph value weak acidity of solution was in favour of the adsorption process since the main existing form of tbbpa as protonated and molecular form preferred to interact with the microplastic surface by electrostatic attraction under the weak alkaline condition the electrostatic repulsion between the negatively charged microplastics and deprotonated tbbpa inhibited their interaction the highest degradation efficiency of tbbpa on microplastic surface as well as in solution was found in the weakly alkaline environment this may be due to the faster hydrolysis of pds and subsequent chain reaction for more reactive species production under alkaline condition to participate in tbbpa degradation ye et al 2021 1 s2o8 2 2 h2o ho2 2 so4 2 3 h 2 s2o8 2 ho2 so4 so4 2 o2 h 3 3 s2o8 2 4 oh 2 o2 6 so4 2 4 h 4 o2 h2o hoo oh 5 o2 hoo hoo 1o2 6 hoo hoo h2o2 1o2 the influence of the frequent environmental inorganic anions on the oxidation system performance is shown in fig 3d from the perspective of tbbpa removal efficiency on the microplastic surface only slight changes occurred under the coexistence of inorganic anions at concentration of 10 mm although these anions were proved to be radical scavengers in previous studies ye et al 2019a the ph buffering action of hco3 and hpo4 2 derived from the hydrolysis tended to alkalinize the solution then contributed to enhancing tbbpa degradation which is consistent with the ph influence the hydrolysis of h2po4 can acidify the solution to a certain extent in which the more tbbpa attachment as well as the higher subsequent degradation efficiency on microplastic surface were both received 3 1 3 oxidation mechanisms the removal of attached tbbpa from microplastic surface by biochar activated pds was relied on the reactive species which was proved by the electron paramagnetic resonance epr with spin trapping agents of dmpo and temp fig 4 a showed the characteristic peaks of tempo 1o2 dmpo so4 dmpo oh and dmpo o2 adducts under different tested conditions illustrating the generation of reactive species in oxidation system accounting for pollutant removal pore characterization results in fig 4b demonstrated the mesoporous characteristics of the prepared biochar with an iv type isothermal curve and an h4 type hysteretic loop the specific surface area ssa was calculated to be about 360 2 m2 g based on bet model the highly open porous structure of biochar was in favour of the accessibility of active sites and the mass transport in process of pds activation high resolution tem analysis was performed to reveal the morphological structure of biochar catalyst at nanoscale level it is clearly showed in fig 4c that the nanoparticles were dispersed over the carbon skeleton and the lattice spacing of the nanoparticle was 0 202 nm which can be ascribed to the 110 plane of fe jiang et al 2021 similar observations can be obtained from the wide angle x ray diffraction xrd patterns fig 4d describing the crystallinity of biochar a diffraction peak appearing at 26 3 was characteristic of representative reflections of 002 graphitic carbon zhang et al 2018b it confirmed the locally ordered carbon structure on the biochar which facilitated the transfer of electrons during the oxidation process other three detected peaks appearing at 2θ values of 44 6 65 2 and 82 4 can be indexed to the fe0 ye et al 2020a demonstrating the binding between the fe0 particles and carbon structure this bond was different from the surface bound fe2o3 and fe3o4 that were easily removed by pickling fe0 particles were proven to efficiently activate pds by providing electrons and continuously and slowly produce fe ii to avoid additional consumption of free radicals peluffo et al 2016 raman spectra of biochar in fig s2 provided the id ig ratio value of 1 06 as well as an intense 2d band at around 2700 cm 1 corresponded to the two phonon double resonance confirming a certain degree of graphitization with sp2 hybridized carbon zhang et al 2018b therefore the prepared biochar could be employed as a mediator to accelerate electron transfer and promote oxidation reaction the changes in valence state of the elements in biochar during the oxidation were conducted using x ray photoelectron spectroscopy details in the deconvoluted peaks and their fitting area ratios of each element are estimated and shown in fig 5 disappearance of π π vibration 293 2 ev and decrease of c o peak 289 2 ev could be found along with the increase of c o peak 286 7 ev suggesting defects on aromatic cluster and lewis basic sites of c o with unpaired electrons were regarded as reactive center duan et al 2016 ye et al 2021 besides the binding energies of fe 2p3 2 and fe 2p1 2 at 710 8 and 725 1 ev respectively the extra satellite peaks in the high resolution spectrum of fe 2p undergone oxidation were observed which manifested that the low valent fe was oxidized and provided electrons for pds activation process the stability of biochar catalyst was proven by the slight amount of iron leaching 0 052 mg l measured by icp ms and the insignificant change in saturation magnetization value before and after reaction 3 2 performance of biochar pds for treatment of different aged mps 3 2 1 tbbpa removal from different aged mps microplastics in the environment are exposed to ultraviolet photo oxidation high temperature and humidity and other conditions typically encountered at beaches they would lose their physical integrity and receive surface modification by chemical oxidation biofilm formation particle wearing and deposition of inorganic minerals it is obvious that the surface modifications make great influence on the interaction between organic pollutants and microplastics aged microplastics were obtained by simulating different weathering processes table s2 experiments were carried out to explore the tbbpa attachment on different aged mps as well as the removal efficiency of the attached tbbpa from aged mps surface by biochar activated pds system it can be seen from fig 6 a that there were few changes in the attached amount of tbbpa on the aged microplastics that were treated by h2o2 oxidation and ultraviolet radiation uv while the adsorption ability of hno3 aged microplastic was significantly lower than that of the pristine microplastic in addition the group of hno3 uv inducing oxidation and biological aging process was found to promote the attachment behavior of tbbpa onto the aged microplastics as the oxidation performance of system was concerned an obvious reduction in removal efficiency of the attached tbbpa from microplastics was observed in the treatment group of hno3 uv aging this phenomenon indicated that the aging process close to the natural weathering can indeed influence the binding force between microplastics and the loaded pollutants these altered weathering processes make it more difficult for the attached pollutants to be removed from the microplastic surface 3 2 1 characterization of different aged mps by characterizing the aged microplastics it could be found that surface oxidation occurred in microplastics which is shown in fig 6b in the case of similar peak strength of the c cl bond located at 609 cm 1 intensities of several signal peaks attributed to the vibration of oxygen containing functional groups in the range of 1000 1750 cm 1 were observed to be enhanced after aging treatment demonstrating that simulated aging accelerated the surface oxidation of microplastics taking the lowest tbbpa adsorption capacity of hno3 aged mps into account there was no direct correlation between the increase of functional groups on the aged microplastics and their adsorption performance for pollutants it implied that the electrostatic interaction dependent on oxygen containing functional groups was not the dominant mechanism for tbbpa adsorption process the pore structural properties of the aged microplastics were analyzed by n2 adsorption desorption isotherm to explain the effects of different aging methods on textural characteristics of microplastics the results for porous structure of various microplastics are shown in table 1 compared with the pristine pvc particles the microplastics after hno3 impregnation and oxidation exhibited higher specific surface area but smaller pore volume and pore size calculated by the bjh mode of desorption branch there were more shallow micropores on microplastic surface produced by chemical corrosion while these micropores showed almost no contribution to the adsorption of organic pollutants li et al 2021 resulting in the decrease in adsorption capacity of hno3 aged mps in the group of hno3 uv combined treatment the oxidation of microplastics was facilitated by condition of ultraviolet irradiation and high temperature and humidity manufactured by the aging device programmable xenon lamp aging test chamber ht0xd 159 besides the higher specific surface area than the pristine mps hno3 uv aged mps also obtained larger pore volume and pore size which was conducive to the pore filling mechanism through partitioning effect for tbbpa attachment the trapped pollutants entering the microplastic pore were not easy to contact with oxidizing species generated by biochar activated pds leading to a reduction in removal efficiency of the attached tbbpa from the hno3 uv aged microplastic surface when microplastics were exposed to ponds for incubation the average pore size remained basically unchanged while the specific surface area and pore volume of microplastics were increased in the process of biological aging the load of natural organic matter such as biological residues could increase surface roughness and improve hydrophobicity and dispersion of microplastics leading to the increased attachment of tbbpa on bio aged microplastics however the organics loaded on the aged microplastic surface might affect adversely the contact chance between available oxidizing species and the attached tbbpa by shielding and competition these reasons caused poor performance of biochar pds system for tbbpa removal from the bio aged microplastic surface 3 3 changes in dbps formation potential of microplastics attached with tbbpa by biochar pds system during chlorination 3 3 1 detection of dbps concentration because of the large quantity and small particle size microplastics are ubiquitous in substantial quantities in wastewater treatment systems including water supply facilities and water disinfection treatment the dissolved organic matter originating from microplastics would inevitably produce undesirable dbps during chlorination process moreover the microplastics exposed to the natural environment for a long term could be covered by large amounts of organic compounds on the surface which theoretically significantly increases the dbp formation potential tbbpa can be also treated as the precursor of dbps and the released bromide ions as intermediate could be oxidized to the more reactive hbro by hclo resulting in the generation of brominated dbps br dbps with higher cytotoxicity and genotoxicity research from andersson et al 2019 reported the high complexity of the dbps that include many compounds with uncertain structure and the diversity of dbps stems from differences in bromide levels and relative abundances of isomers in the nom composition andersson et al 2019 thus it was of significance to evaluate the dbp formation potential of the overall microplastics attached with tbbpa the control effect of biochar pds oxidation system to dbp formation in the chlorination process was also investigated it can be seen from fig 7 a that the dissolved organic matter including additives from microplastics presented a considerable amount of thms during the chlorination process which was mainly composed of bdcm and dbcm while few haas were detected in the group where only mps are dispersed in water fig 7b indicating that the easily soluble organics derived from microplastics were more likely to produce thms more species of dbps with the quite high concentrations of br dbps were found in the chlorination process of tbbpa solution suggesting the role of tbbpa as dbps precursor the highest total concentrations of thms 55 µg l and haas 150 µg l were both detected in the group of coexisting suspension of microplastics and tbbpa in particular the concentrations of tbm and bdca were significantly higher in co exposure of microplastics and tbbpa than that in individual polluted solution the attachment of tbbpa onto microplastics was confirmed to contribute to raising the formation potential of dbps generated from mps dom when the chlorination process occurred after the sample of polluted microplastics attached with tbbpa was exposed to biochar alone a decrease in dbp content can be observed this might be owing to the adsorption and immobilization of the generated dbps by biochar thereby affecting the extraction and further detection it could also be found that in comparison to the formed thms haas were more sensitive to the adsorption by the tested biochar what is more noteworthy is that when biochar was employed to activate pds for tbbpa removal from the microplastic surface in addition to a significant decrease in total dbp concentration from 210 to 49 µg l total amount of thms and haas was decreased by 47 and 87 respectively the types of dbps were observed to be reduced tbaa and tbm almost disappeared shown in fig s4 these results revealed that the biochar pds oxidation system played an important role in the decomposition and removal of dbp precursors considering that the biochar derived dom may be also served as dbp precursor in the chlorination process the dbp formation potential of biochar used in this oxidation system was investigated fig 7 shows a small amount of dbps produced from the solution dispersed with individual biochar with or without pds it can be concluded that the biochar based materials used in water treatment plants before the chlorination process posed little additional burden on environmental risks 3 3 2 toxicity assessment of dbps due to the different toxic potential of each dbp species the ecological risks could not be evaluated only from the concentration of dbps produced during the chlorination process the potential hazards of dbps were calculated based on the combined toxicity values ctv reported by plewa et al in which the cytotoxicity and genotoxicity of a series of halogenated dbps were systematically investigated using chinese hamster ovary cells plewa et al 2004 plewa and wagner 2015 to further evaluate the feasibility of biochar pds system as a pre oxidation technology for risk control of microplastics pollution a preliminary toxic risk analysis was carried out by calculating the toxic risk value of dbps multiplying the ctv by concentration of the corresponding dbp the final integrated toxic risk value itrv is the sum of the toxic risk value of all detected dbps it is clearly shown in table 2 that the itrv of dbps detected in suspension of tbbpa attached mps was much higher than that of the individual mps or tbbpa demonstrating a significant synergistic enhancement of toxic risks when mps co existed with tbbpa during chlorination the treatment of individual biochar in tbbpa attached mps suspension could achieve a reduction of more than half of the itrv furthermore the itrv in solution co exposed with tbbpa and microplastics was calculated to be dropped by 92 in the successful combination of biochar and pds which was related to the precursor degradation by biochar pds oxidation for inhibiting dbps generation fig 8 it could be concluded that the biochar pds oxidation system played a significant function in controlling the environmental risks of polluted microplastics 4 conclusion the catalytic behavior of the prepared biochar was investigated about its performance for removal of tbbpa from microplastic surface by activating pds with promoting electron transfer under complicated water environments the aging of microplastics showed impacts on the tbbpa attachment and the subsequent surface decontamination by the oxidation process the most difficult removal of tbbpa from microplastic surface was found in the group of bio aged microplastics cultivated in ponds as well as the removal efficiency dropped from 97 to 81 during the chlorination process suspension of tbbpa attached microplastics exhibited the highest dbp formation potential and its itrv was significantly larger than that of the individual group of microplastics or tbbpa undergone the treatment of biochar pds system the total amount of thms and haas decreased by 47 and 87 respectively indicating the decomposition and removal of dbp precursors by oxidation based on the integrated toxicity analysis it could be concluded that these findings open opportunities for developing a treatment method of biochar activated pds for organic wastewater containing a substantial amount of microplastics prior to the disinfection step in order to control

15480,there are numerous studies concerning the impacts of widespread microplastic pollution on the ecological environment and it shows synergistic effect of microplastics and co exposed pollutants in risk enhancement however the control methods for removing harmful pollutants from microplastic surface to reduce their ecological toxicity has rarely been explored in this paper magnetic graphitized biochar as a catalyst is shown to achieve 97 removal of tetrabromobisphenol a tbbpa from microplastics by biochar mediated electron transfer the changes in the surface and structure of microplastics caused by various aging processes affected the pollutant attachment and subsequent removal efficiency after chlorination the highest disinfection by product dbp generation potential was observed by the group of microplastics attached with tbbpa the oxidation system of biochar activating peroxodisulfate pds can not only reduce the kinds of dbps but also greatly reduce the total amount of detected dbps by 76 as well as reducing the overall toxicity this paper highlights an overlooked contribution of pollutant attachment to the potential risks of dbp generated from natural microplastics during chlorination process and provides the underlying insights to guide the design of a biochar based catalyst from wastes to achieve the removal of tbbpa from microplastics and reduce the risks and hazards of co contamination graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords microplastics tetrabromobisphenol a sr aops biochar disinfection by products data availability the authors are unable or have chosen not to specify which data has been used 1 introduction the extensive and uncontrolled use of plastics as well as the limited recovery and improper disposal has led that large amounts of plastics enter natural waters lee et al 2020 shen et al 2020 more than 13 million tons of plastic are released into rivers and oceans globally each year foerster 2017 enfrin et al 2019 the discarded plastic is subjected to fragmentation and embrittlement by a combination of mechanical abrasion uv radiation and biological erosion fotopoulou and karapanagioti 2015 weinstein et al 2016 plastic fragments of all dimensions 1μm x 5 mm are defined as microplastics ter halle and ghiglione 2021 and exhibit potential toxic risks in aquatic ecosystem due to the small particle dimension and high mobility siegfried et al 2017 during migration into the natural environment microplastics show a high attractive affinity for harmful substances due to their rough surface and hydrophobicity therefore microplastics are regarded as vectors to achieve the long distance transmission of harmful substances huffer and hofmann 2016 fu et al 2021 sarkar et al 2021 microplastics along with the attached hazardous substances could increase the risks on inflammation and immune impairment of organisms carbery et al 2018 and also promote the accumulation and magnification of contaminants on organisms via the food chain turner and holmes 2015 kalcikova et al 2020 therefore there are growing concerns regarding the plastic fragments as well as their attached hazardous substances tetrabromobisphenol a tbbpa is widely used as a brominated flame retardant in electronic products and might be released into environment when the product waste is not properly disposed of chen et al 2020 tbbpa is frequently detected in various environmental matrices law et al 2006 makinen et al 2009 making potential health risks due to the hepatorenal toxicity and endocrine disrupting effect van der ven et al 2008 considering that tbbpa is mainly used as an additive for plastic products de wit et al 2010 microplastic particles and tbbpa are simultaneously exposed to a high level in related industrial wastewater because of its hydrophobicity tbbpa is neither easily dissolved in water nor diluted by water the co existing microplastic and tbbpa tend to form the aggregated organic co polluter wu et al 2019 which could cause synergistic toxic effects and accelerate the spread of pollutants in natural water bodies moreover the surface changes of microplastics during weathering process provide a more suitable sites for interaction with organic chemicals by hydrophobic force electrostatic force hydrogen binding and non covalent binding wu et al 2019 jin et al 2020 although traditional treatment can remove some of microplastics in sewage owing to the large amount of water discharged by sewage treatment plants municipal sewage treatment plants are also considered to be an important source of microplastics releasing up to 1010 particles day in the effluent of single plant mintenig et al 2017 gatidou et al 2019 and tbbpa suzuki and hasegawa 2006 the micrometer sizes of plastic particles make it difficult for the general filtration equipment to completely remove the organic co polluter of microplastic attached with tbbpa chlorine disinfection would be operated in water treatment before final discharge kozari et al 2020 wan et al 2020 it is an unavoidable consequence that the formation of toxic and carcinogenic disinfection byproducts dbps during chlorination since the organics as the dbp precursor would react with the added chlorine in water to form haloforms and other halogenated substances both microplastics derived dissolved organic matter lee et al 2020 and synthetic organic chemicals li et al 2020a zhu et al 2021 should be treated as dbps precursors during chlorination it can be expected that the tbbpa loaded microplastics have a higher risk of dbp generation than individual microplastic therefore it is necessary to focus on reducing the potential threat of natural microplastic by removing the attached organics sulfate radical advanced oxidation processes sr aops have been reported to be able to efficiently eliminate organic pollutants in water treatment with advantages of the high oxidation potential of radical e0 2 5 3 1 v a wide range of

rich functional groups produced in the process of biochar preparation oh et al 2018 ye et al 2020b which can promote the efficient electron transfer to achieve redox reactions in a pds system ho et al 2019 in addition biochar exhibits a high adsorption affinity for most pollutants ye et al 2019b li et al 2020b yang et al 2020 showing a promising application as a filter medium for municipal sewage treatment plants consequently biochar activated pds process has potential to be applied as a pre oxidation method for catalytic removal of attached tbbpa from microplastic surface and following a decrease in dbp formation during chlorination by altering the structure and concentration of the precursors this paper for the first time focuses on reducing the toxic risks from microplastics by removing the attached organic pollutants through an oxidation system the main purposes of this paper are to 1 investigate the performance of biochar pds system on the removal of the attached tbbpa from microplastics as well as the influence of water quality parameters on the removal efficiency 2 explore the effects of microplastic aging processes on the interaction between microplastics and tbbpa and the different removal efficiencies of tbbpa from various aged microplastics by biochar pds system 3 reveal the dbps formation potential of the tbbpa loaded microplastics and 4 discuss the risk assessment of dbps formation of microplastics attached with tbbpa undergone the biochar pds oxidation system in the subsequent chlorination process 2 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials besides the wide distribution in discharge water of plastic factories polyvinyl chloride pvc particles may be produced by long term weathering of water transportation pipeline and they were selected as type of microplastics mps in the experiment the tested pvc microplastic particles were purchased from aladdin chemical company shanghai china the organic pollutant representative tbbpa was acquired from sigma aldrich usa detailed information was provided in supporting information si the sodium peroxydisulfate na2s2o8 pds purity 98 0 and potassium ferrate k2feo4 purity 99 0 were provided by shanghai macklin biochemical co ltd haloacetic acids haas and trihalomethanes thms and their mix standard solution were obtained from rhawn shanghai china and accustandard new haven usa 2 2 synthesis of biochar based catalyst straw powders particle size of 0 15 mm were treated as precursors for biochar catalyst and they were soaked into the solution of k2feo4 0 1 m with continuous agitation lasting for 12 h after filtration and then vacuum drying at 80 c overnight the pre treated biomass solid was annealed in tube furnace operating at 900 c lasting for 2 h with continuous flow of n2 the carbonized solid after naturally cooling was soaked and rinsed with 0 1 m hcl to remove the excess dissolved inorganic and organic impurities on the surface and thereby the resulted solid was regarded as a biochar catalyst with little matter leaching the details in characterization methods were provided in supplementary material 2 3 experiment procedure 2 3 1 oxidation process pvc microplastics were dispersed in a 50 ml solution containing 3 mg l tbbpa to simulate the co existence of a high concentration of microplastics and additives in discharge industrial wastewater adsorption desorption equilibrium was established by maintaining moderate oscillation overnight and the attached amount of tbbpa onto microplastic surface was calculated before the oxidation treatment in typical sr aops 2 mg biochar and a certain concentration of pds solution were added successively to trigger the oxidation process the solution samples were taken at regular intervals for determination after filtration with 0 45 μm pvdf disposable filter the tbbpa attached on solids was extracted by methanol according to the high recovery of methanol for tbbpa in pre experiment the solid particles were filtered and magnetically separated into the magnetic biochar and microplastic particles after ultrasonic extraction by methanol for 45 min period the solution was filtered for concentration detection the tbbpa concentration was measured by high performance liquid chromatography hplc agilent 1260 infinity usa performed with infinitylab poroshell 120 ec c18 column 4 6 mm 150 mm at detecting λ of 209 nm temperature of 30 c and injection volume of 20 μl the mobile phase used for detection was methanol water 85 15 v v with at a flow rate of 1 0 ml min 2 3 2 chlorination and bdps determination after

id 0 25 μm film thickness agilent j w 3 results and discussion 3 1 oxidation performance of biochar pds 3 1 1 biochar activated pds for tbbpa removal on microplastic surface when pvc microplastics and tbbpa are co exposed in an aqueous solution tbbpa molecules tend to attach onto the microplastic surface due to the strong hydrophobicity of contaminants the adsorption equilibrium capacity for tbbpa by pvc microplastics was calculated to be as high as 10 3 mg g fig s1 which indicated the adsorption ability of microplastics and their role as vectors in respect of the pollutant transport in the water environment compared the extracted amount of tbbpa by methanol from the microplastics with its saturated adsorption capacity mentioned after adsorption equilibrium it could be found the recovery efficiency for tbbpa from microplastics by methanol can reach more than 99 therefore it is convincing to employ methanol extraction to calculate the residual tbbpa on microplastic surface fig 1 a exhibits the content changes of tbbpa on microplastics and solution under different treatments that were subjected to the individual biochar pds and biochar activated pds system compared with the blank experiment content of tbbpa on the microplastic surface decreased only a little in the individual biochar 5 7 or pds 21 treated group in terms of the biochar alone biochar could reduce the tbbpa concentration in the solution by adsorption but the removal of tbbpa from microplastic surface cannot be achieved effectively by mere competitive adsorption incorporation of pds with biochar into the solution suspended with microplastics it could be observed by the significant decrease in tbbpa contents on both microplastic surface and solution suggesting the critical role of oxidation process induced by pds activation with biochar for tbbpa removal the variation of tbbpa concentration at different periods was shown in fig 1b there is a time dependent oxidation process and the kinetics curve of tbbpa degradation shows about 70 proportion of removal in the first 30 minutes seen from the extracted tbbpa content from the tested microplastics about 97 removal of tbbpa from microplastic surface could be received by biochar pds system after oxidation for 150 minutes to identify the content changes of tbbpa on microplastic surfaces several characterization methods were carried out on pvc microplastics which were undergone the tbbpa attachment and subsequent sr aops variations in absorption peak position can be observed by ftir spectra of mps before and after tbbpa loaded and undergone oxidation treatment fig 2 a a new peak located at approximately 3480 cm 1 attributed to the stretching vibration of hydroxy and carboxy moieties or the hydrogen bonds between the organic molecules liu et al 2019 was only detected on the spectra of tbbpa loaded pvc it confirmed that the attachment behavior of tbbpa onto microplastic was classified as a multilayer adsorption on nonuniform surface and the partition and hydrogen bonding were regarded as the possible interaction mechanisms moreover the fresh bands appearing at peak position of 1560 and 1470 cm 1 are assigned to the vibration of benzene ring and methyl group ch3 respectively which are not likely to appear in the spectra of pvc microplastic yet belong to the functional groups of tbbpa considering the intensity increase of peak at about 500 cm 1 derived from the c br vibration the ability of microplastics to bind tbbpa molecules could be verified it can also be observed in the ftir spectra of the treated microplastic that the peak intensities of the mentioned tbbpa characteristic signals are significantly reduced or even completely disappeared indicating the effectiveness of biochar pds oxidation system in removing organic pollutants from the microplastic surface similar results can be obtained from the xps spectra shown in fig 2b besides the composition elements of pvc particles extra bromine element can be observed on the full survey of tbbpa loaded mps the high resolution spectra of br 3d exhibited in fig 2c and d before and after oxidation process could be resolved into two fitted peaks as 70 9 ev and 69 7 ev after the removal treatment of biochar pds oxidation system not only did the signal intensity of br element decrease significantly but also the proportion of each bonding on br 3d was changed this is another evidence that the loaded tbbpa on microplastic surface can be transformed by biochar pds system elemental mapping analysis was performed by scanning transmission electron microscopy stem mode assisted with eds to visualize the element distribution on the surface of microplastics fig s2 it can be clearly observed from the mapping images that when the microplastics co existed with tbbpa molecules the characteristic signal of br on microplastic surface was significantly enhanced due to the attachment of tbbpa undergone the biochar pds oxidation process the signal of br was weakened markedly detailed information in table s1 shows the mass ratio of each element detected by eds and the element proportion of br significantly decreases from 0 45 to 0 11 wt the higher detected br atomic percentage on microplastics than expected may be explained by the adsorption of br containing intermediates or br ion degraded from tbbpa onto the microplastics 3 1 2 effects of environmental conditions considering that microplastics can be used as potential vectors for the spread of hazardous substances to different waters the impacts of complex water quality on tbbpa attachment and subsequent removal from microplastics should be analyzed and discussed the salinity of the solution surrounding the microplastics changes significantly between the wastewater to the ocean the effect of salinity gradient was studied and shown in fig 3 a the attachment of tbbpa on the microplastic surface was found to be increased as the electrolyte strength increased from 0 to 2 the reason might be that the salting out effect of nacl promoted the hydrophobic interaction of tbbpa and pvc particles by decreasing the solubility of organic compounds li et al 2021 however the continuous increase of salinity might reduce the repulsion between microplastic particles by neutralizing their surface charge and compressing the electric double layer li et al 2018 thus subsequently facilitating the agglomeration of microplastics the reduction of free volume and surface accessible sites of microplastic particles caused by the compaction might further decrease the attached amount of tbbpa onto microplastic surface in addition the degradation of tbbpa both on microplastic surface and in solution by biochar pds system was slightly inhibited at high salinity it might be explained by the captured behavior of chloride ions for free radicals to produce low oxidizing species another reason might be the few contact opportunities between reactive species and the tbbpa attached onto microplastic surface due to the gradual agglomeration of microplastic particles it is difficult for the reactive species generated on biochar surface to get close to the microplastic surface humic acid ha with negative charge is a common organic matter found in natural water which is rich in oxygen containing functional groups consequently ha would like to form copolymers with microplastics and play various roles in the adsorption performance of mps for pollutants chen et al 2018 zhang et al 2018a it could be found from fig 3b that a slight promotion in tbbpa attachment onto mps was observed at a low concentration of ha which may be attributed to the improvement of hydrophobicity and charge on microplastic surface by ha on the one hand it was beneficial to the dispersion of pvc particles on the other hand it enhanced the hydrogen bonding and π π interaction of the copolymers to improve the attracting affinity for tbbpa molecules a high concentration of ha 15 mg l showed inhibiting effect on tbbpa adsorption by microplastics it could be explained by the more ha adhesion on microplastic surface occupying the adsorbed sites besides the interaction of tbbpa molecules and ha might enhance pollutant mobility thereby hindering the access of pollutants reaching microplastic surface the covered ha on microplastic surface also affected the removal performance of biochar pds system to the attached tbbpa through the competition with tbbpa for reactive species or interfering with their connection the lowest tbbpa concentration in solution after oxidation was found at a condition of 20 mg l ha which may be due to the influence of the soluble complex compounds formed by ha and tbbpa on the membrane filtration and detection besides the surface charge of microplastics the chemical speciation of tbbpa molecules is also transformed through the protonation deprotonation of ionizable functional groups at different ph considering the near neutral environment of natural water the experiment was conducted with an initial ph varying in the range of 6 5 8 5 fig 3c based on the two dissociation constant pka 7 5 and 8 5 li et al 2021 tbbpa can exist in the form of zwitterions tbbpa0 and anions tbbpa and tbbpa2 the zeta potential test fig s3 showed that zero potential point phzpc of microplastic was around 2 08 and the negative charge enhanced with the increase of the tested ph value weak acidity of solution was in favour of the adsorption process since the main existing form of tbbpa as protonated and molecular form preferred to interact with the microplastic surface by electrostatic attraction under the weak alkaline condition the electrostatic repulsion between the negatively charged microplastics and deprotonated tbbpa inhibited their interaction the highest degradation efficiency of tbbpa on microplastic surface as well as in solution was found in the weakly alkaline environment this may be due to the faster hydrolysis of pds and subsequent chain reaction for more reactive species production under alkaline condition to participate in tbbpa degradation ye et al 2021 1 s2o8 2 2 h2o ho2 2 so4 2 3 h 2 s2o8 2 ho2 so4 so4 2 o2 h 3 3 s2o8 2 4 oh 2 o2 6 so4 2 4 h 4 o2 h2o hoo oh 5 o2 hoo hoo 1o2 6 hoo hoo h2o2 1o2 the influence of the frequent environmental inorganic anions on the oxidation system performance is shown in fig 3d from the perspective of tbbpa removal efficiency on the microplastic surface only slight changes occurred under the coexistence of inorganic anions at concentration of 10 mm although these anions were proved to be radical scavengers in previous studies ye et al 2019a the ph buffering action of hco3 and hpo4 2 derived from the hydrolysis tended to alkalinize the solution then contributed to enhancing tbbpa degradation which is consistent with the ph influence the hydrolysis of h2po4 can acidify the solution to a certain extent in which the more tbbpa attachment as well as the higher subsequent degradation efficiency on microplastic surface were both received 3 1 3 oxidation mechanisms the removal of attached tbbpa from microplastic surface by biochar activated pds was relied on the reactive species which was proved by the electron paramagnetic resonance epr with spin trapping agents of dmpo and temp fig 4 a showed the characteristic peaks of tempo 1o2 dmpo so4 dmpo oh and dmpo o2 adducts under different tested conditions illustrating the generation of reactive species in oxidation system accounting for pollutant removal pore characterization results in fig 4b demonstrated the mesoporous characteristics of the prepared biochar with an iv type isothermal curve and an h4 type hysteretic loop the specific surface area ssa was calculated to be about 360 2 m2 g based on bet model the highly open porous structure of biochar was in favour of the accessibility of active sites and the mass transport in process of pds activation high resolution tem analysis was performed to reveal the morphological structure of biochar catalyst at nanoscale level it is clearly showed in fig 4c that the nanoparticles were dispersed over the carbon skeleton and the lattice spacing of the nanoparticle was 0 202 nm which can be ascribed to the 110 plane of fe jiang et al 2021 similar observations can be obtained from the wide angle x ray diffraction xrd patterns fig 4d describing the crystallinity of biochar a diffraction peak appearing at 26 3 was characteristic of representative reflections of 002 graphitic carbon zhang et al 2018b it confirmed the locally ordered carbon structure on the biochar which facilitated the transfer of electrons during the oxidation process other three detected peaks appearing at 2θ values of 44 6 65 2 and 82 4 can be indexed to the fe0 ye et al 2020a demonstrating the binding between the fe0 particles and carbon structure this bond was different from the surface bound fe2o3 and fe3o4 that were easily removed by pickling fe0 particles were proven to efficiently activate pds by providing electrons and continuously and slowly produce fe ii to avoid additional consumption of free radicals peluffo et al 2016 raman spectra of biochar in fig s2 provided the id ig ratio value of 1 06 as well as an intense 2d band at around 2700 cm 1 corresponded to the two phonon double resonance confirming a certain degree of graphitization with sp2 hybridized carbon zhang et al 2018b therefore the prepared biochar could be employed as a mediator to accelerate electron transfer and promote oxidation reaction the changes in valence state of the elements in biochar during the oxidation were conducted using x ray photoelectron spectroscopy details in the deconvoluted peaks and their fitting area ratios of each element are estimated and shown in fig 5 disappearance of π π vibration 293 2 ev and decrease of c o peak 289 2 ev could be found along with the increase of c o peak 286 7 ev suggesting defects on aromatic cluster and lewis basic sites of c o with unpaired electrons were regarded as reactive center duan et al 2016 ye et al 2021 besides the binding energies of fe 2p3 2 and fe 2p1 2 at 710 8 and 725 1 ev respectively the extra satellite peaks in the high resolution spectrum of fe 2p undergone oxidation were observed which manifested that the low valent fe was oxidized and provided electrons for pds activation process the stability of biochar catalyst was proven by the slight amount of iron leaching 0 052 mg l measured by icp ms and the insignificant change in saturation magnetization value before and after reaction 3 2 performance of biochar pds for treatment of different aged mps 3 2 1 tbbpa removal from different aged mps microplastics in the environment are exposed to ultraviolet photo oxidation high temperature and humidity and other conditions typically encountered at beaches they would lose their physical integrity and receive surface modification by chemical oxidation biofilm formation particle wearing and deposition of inorganic minerals it is obvious that the surface modifications make great influence on the interaction between organic pollutants and microplastics aged microplastics were obtained by simulating different weathering processes table s2 experiments were carried out to explore the tbbpa attachment on different aged mps as well as the removal efficiency of the attached tbbpa from aged mps surface by biochar activated pds system it can be seen from fig 6 a that there were few changes in the attached amount of tbbpa on the aged microplastics that were treated by h2o2 oxidation and ultraviolet radiation uv while the adsorption ability of hno3 aged microplastic was significantly lower than that of the pristine microplastic in addition the group of hno3 uv inducing oxidation and biological aging process was found to promote the attachment behavior of tbbpa onto the aged microplastics as the oxidation performance of system was concerned an obvious reduction in removal efficiency of the attached tbbpa from microplastics was observed in the treatment group of hno3 uv aging this phenomenon indicated that the aging process close to the natural weathering can indeed influence the binding force between microplastics and the loaded pollutants these altered weathering processes make it more difficult for the attached pollutants to be removed from the microplastic surface 3 2 1 characterization of different aged mps by characterizing the aged microplastics it could be found that surface oxidation occurred in microplastics which is shown in fig 6b in the case of similar peak strength of the c cl bond located at 609 cm 1 intensities of several signal peaks attributed to the vibration of oxygen containing functional groups in the range of 1000 1750 cm 1 were observed to be enhanced after aging treatment demonstrating that simulated aging accelerated the surface oxidation of microplastics taking the lowest tbbpa adsorption capacity of hno3 aged mps into account there was no direct correlation between the increase of functional groups on the aged microplastics and their adsorption performance for pollutants it implied that the electrostatic interaction dependent on oxygen containing functional groups was not the dominant mechanism for tbbpa adsorption process the pore structural properties of the aged microplastics were analyzed by n2 adsorption desorption isotherm to explain the effects of different aging methods on textural characteristics of microplastics the results for porous structure of various microplastics are shown in table 1 compared with the pristine pvc particles the microplastics after hno3 impregnation and oxidation exhibited higher specific surface area but smaller pore volume and pore size calculated by the bjh mode of desorption branch there were more shallow micropores on microplastic surface produced by chemical corrosion while these micropores showed almost no contribution to the adsorption of organic pollutants li et al 2021 resulting in the decrease in adsorption capacity of hno3 aged mps in the group of hno3 uv combined treatment the oxidation of microplastics was facilitated by condition of ultraviolet irradiation and high temperature and humidity manufactured by the aging device programmable xenon lamp aging test chamber ht0xd 159 besides the higher specific surface area than the pristine mps hno3 uv aged mps also obtained larger pore volume and pore size which was conducive to the pore filling mechanism through partitioning effect for tbbpa attachment the trapped pollutants entering the microplastic pore were not easy to contact with oxidizing species generated by biochar activated pds leading to a reduction in removal efficiency of the attached tbbpa from the hno3 uv aged microplastic surface when microplastics were exposed to ponds for incubation the average pore size remained basically unchanged while the specific surface area and pore volume of microplastics were increased in the process of biological aging the load of natural organic matter such as biological residues could increase surface roughness and improve hydrophobicity and dispersion of microplastics leading to the increased attachment of tbbpa on bio aged microplastics however the organics loaded on the aged microplastic surface might affect adversely the contact chance between available oxidizing species and the attached tbbpa by shielding and competition these reasons caused poor performance of biochar pds system for tbbpa removal from the bio aged microplastic surface 3 3 changes in dbps formation potential of microplastics attached with tbbpa by biochar pds system during chlorination 3 3 1 detection of dbps concentration because of the large quantity and small particle size microplastics are ubiquitous in substantial quantities in wastewater treatment systems including water supply facilities and water disinfection treatment the dissolved organic matter originating from microplastics would inevitably produce undesirable dbps during chlorination process moreover the microplastics exposed to the natural environment for a long term could be covered by large amounts of organic compounds on the surface which theoretically significantly increases the dbp formation potential tbbpa can be also treated as the precursor of dbps and the released bromide ions as intermediate could be oxidized to the more reactive hbro by hclo resulting in the generation of brominated dbps br dbps with higher cytotoxicity and genotoxicity research from andersson et al 2019 reported the high complexity of the dbps that include many compounds with uncertain structure and the diversity of dbps stems from differences in bromide levels and relative abundances of isomers in the nom composition andersson et al 2019 thus it was of significance to evaluate the dbp formation potential of the overall microplastics attached with tbbpa the control effect of biochar pds oxidation system to dbp formation in the chlorination process was also investigated it can be seen from fig 7 a that the dissolved organic matter including additives from microplastics presented a considerable amount of thms during the chlorination process which was mainly composed of bdcm and dbcm while few haas were detected in the group where only mps are dispersed in water fig 7b indicating that the easily soluble organics derived from microplastics were more likely to produce thms more species of dbps with the quite high concentrations of br dbps were found in the chlorination process of tbbpa solution suggesting the role of tbbpa as dbps precursor the highest total concentrations of thms 55 µg l and haas 150 µg l were both detected in the group of coexisting suspension of microplastics and tbbpa in particular the concentrations of tbm and bdca were significantly higher in co exposure of microplastics and tbbpa than that in individual polluted solution the attachment of tbbpa onto microplastics was confirmed to contribute to raising the formation potential of dbps generated from mps dom when the chlorination process occurred after the sample of polluted microplastics attached with tbbpa was exposed to biochar alone a decrease in dbp content can be observed this might be owing to the adsorption and immobilization of the generated dbps by biochar thereby affecting the extraction and further detection it could also be found that in comparison to the formed thms haas were more sensitive to the adsorption by the tested biochar what is more noteworthy is that when biochar was employed to activate pds for tbbpa removal from the microplastic surface in addition to a significant decrease in total dbp concentration from 210 to 49 µg l total amount of thms and haas was decreased by 47 and 87 respectively the types of dbps were observed to be reduced tbaa and tbm almost disappeared shown in fig s4 these results revealed that the biochar pds oxidation system played an important role in the decomposition and removal of dbp precursors considering that the biochar derived dom may be also served as dbp precursor in the chlorination process the dbp formation potential of biochar used in this oxidation system was investigated fig 7 shows a small amount of dbps produced from the solution dispersed with individual biochar with or without pds it can be concluded that the biochar based materials used in water treatment plants before the chlorination process posed little additional burden on environmental risks 3 3 2 toxicity assessment of dbps due to the different toxic potential of each dbp species the ecological risks could not be evaluated only from the concentration of dbps produced during the chlorination process the potential hazards of dbps were calculated based on the combined toxicity values ctv reported by plewa et al in which the cytotoxicity and genotoxicity of a series of halogenated dbps were systematically investigated using chinese hamster ovary cells plewa et al 2004 plewa and wagner 2015 to further evaluate the feasibility of biochar pds system as a pre oxidation technology for risk control of microplastics pollution a preliminary toxic risk analysis was carried out by calculating the toxic risk value of dbps multiplying the ctv by concentration of the corresponding dbp the final integrated toxic risk value itrv is the sum of the toxic risk value of all detected dbps it is clearly shown in table 2 that the itrv of dbps detected in suspension of tbbpa attached mps was much higher than that of the individual mps or tbbpa demonstrating a significant synergistic enhancement of toxic risks when mps co existed with tbbpa during chlorination the treatment of individual biochar in tbbpa attached mps suspension could achieve a reduction of more than half of the itrv furthermore the itrv in solution co exposed with tbbpa and microplastics was calculated to be dropped by 92 in the successful combination of biochar and pds which was related to the precursor degradation by biochar pds oxidation for inhibiting dbps generation fig 8 it could be concluded that the biochar pds oxidation system played a significant function in controlling the environmental risks of polluted microplastics 4 conclusion the catalytic behavior of the prepared biochar was investigated about its performance for removal of tbbpa from microplastic surface by activating pds with promoting electron transfer under complicated water environments the aging of microplastics showed impacts on the tbbpa attachment and the subsequent surface decontamination by the oxidation process the most difficult removal of tbbpa from microplastic surface was found in the group of bio aged microplastics cultivated in ponds as well as the removal efficiency dropped from 97 to 81 during the chlorination process suspension of tbbpa attached microplastics exhibited the highest dbp formation potential and its itrv was significantly larger than that of the individual group of microplastics or tbbpa undergone the treatment of biochar pds system the total amount of thms and haas decreased by 47 and 87 respectively indicating the decomposition and removal of dbp precursors by oxidation based on the integrated toxicity analysis it could be concluded that these findings open opportunities for developing a treatment method of biochar activated pds for organic wastewater containing a substantial amount of microplastics prior to the disinfection step in order to control

15481,in most cases point of use tap water quality is not routinely monitored due to widely dispersed sampling sites and the costly tests although previous studies have revealed the variation of drinking water quality during distribution in municipal networks the influence of aging pipes in buildings on quality is still unknown and this makes it difficult for water utilities to conduct regular maintenance herein we have undertaken a survey of tap water samples across 8 districts in beijing china to evaluate the potential effects of pipe age on point of use water quality including turbidity organic matter characteristics and bacterial community by grouping the collected samples according to the pipe age and source water respectively the results suggested that bacterial diversity is significantly influenced by the pipe age however bacterial community structure is clearly influenced by the source water similarly aging pipes in buildings are also responsible for the deterioration of the final water quality and their effects have been closely linked to selected water quality parameters by evaluating the relevant factors moreover the interrelationships between physico chemical parameters and bacteria abundance were identified for example ph ca2 mg2 na and k showed a positive relationship with bacillus abundance in addition an intelligent analysis method for understanding pipe age organic matter concentration and hardness i e ca2 and mg2 concentration based on image analysis of filtered membranes has been developed the accuracy of prediction was encouraging but can be improved with the collection of more data from tap water samples we expect that this method can be exploited by the public to monitor their tap water and provide a feasible and cost effective approach for water suppliers to locate aging deteriorating pipes which need to be replaced or maintained graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords tap water pipe age water quality point of use bacterial communities membrane filters 1 introduction drinking sufficient amounts of water is important for human health in order to transport nutrients and oxygen to bodily cells flushing bacteria from the bladder balancing blood pressure and so forth harvard medical school 2016 however people may be exposed to water causing diseases even if they have access to safe water which meets national local standards firstly halogenated by products at low concentrations in tap water present toxicity e g carcinogenicity risks which are of concern to people worldwide who live in the areas supplied by chlorinated water supply systems sedlak and von gunten 2011 li and mitch 2018 secondly contaminants released from urban pipe distribution networks premise plumbing systems and storage facilities may also reach levels that are toxic and cause chronic diseases such as cancers and high blood pressure zhuang et al 2019 hanna attisha et al 2016 these contaminants include metal fe pb etc ions and corrosion particles which often coexist with microbial pollution nelson et al 1996 wang et al 2012 for point of use systems these contaminants are commonly not included in regular surveillance by water suppliers and government bodies as drinking water standards are applied to the water samples collected at drinking water treatment plants dwtps prior to drinking water distribution systems dwdss the testing of point of use water quality is often considered costly and time consuming and this prevents consumers from having information describing their tap water quality and being assured of its safety and compliance with drinking water standards in the last decade many studies have concentrated on the variation of drinking water from dwtps to point of use sites and certain findings regarding microbial community changes han et al 2020 hull et al 2017 biofilm characteristics wang et al 2014 sun et al 2014 particulate formation and metal ions release ng et al 2012 gora et al 2020 were obtained as illustrated schematically in fig 1 for example one study perrin et al 2019 observed microbiome changes in distribution using four paris distribution networks over one year and found that there were no significant differences in bacterial diversity among them however a bacterial compositional perturbation was linked to a flood event in comparison a more recent research revealed a bacterial similarity of 50 between source water and tap water which suggested that microbial quality of the source water should receive more attention in order to protect tap water bio safety han et al 2020 normally distribution networks provide aerobic environments which shape different microbial communities under specific physico chemical conditions such as ph nitrate phosphate and chlorine concentrations douterelo et al 2020 kelly et al 2014 ling et al 2018 previous research has traced the trends of metal ion release organic matter accumulation and microbial community characteristics in unchlorinated dwdss netherlands and switzerland liu et al 2014 lautenschlager et al 2013 and chlorinated dwdss us and china gomez smith et al 2015 similarly interactive factors were also found in premise plumbing for example it has been shown ling et al 2018 that residual chlorine concentrations in point of use tap water affected by stagnation time in pipes that shapes significant various microbial communities and even the influence of sampling sites in a building on microorganisms was predominant in addition impacted microbiome in hot water supplying system in buildings was also identified ji et al 2017 rhoads et al 2015 however little research has been reported to date regarding the effects of pipe age on water quality such as physico chemical properties and microbial communities it should be noted that aging pipes also play a critical often negative role in delivering drinking water to point of use consumers as these pipes may lead to increasing concentrations of metal ions and organic matter accumulation such as dwdss in cities inkinen et al 2013 liu et al 2014 if it is assumed that changes in water quality are minor in the pipe distribution process then the quality of the consumer s tap water will be determined by the premise plumbing in the building in general tap water quality is determined by both the dwdss and premise plumbing in buildings and non compliance with regulated standards has been widely reported in recent years for example in the us and canada lead has been found to be as much as 5 20 times the regulated level and its release has led to numerous health related incidences trueman et al 2019 allaire et al 2018 to prevent water quality deterioration water utilities authorities have programmes to replace the old pipes kim and herrera 2010 hall 1972 an estimated 22 of the pipes in the united states are more than 50 years old and only 43 of pipes are in good condition folkman 2018 while in the uk the average pipe age was estimated to be 75 80 years ukwir 2011 in china due to the lack of records of pipe inventories an average age of overall pipes was estimated to be at least 60 years and red water problems have raised concern among responsible authorities li et al 2010 zhang et al 2014 however to improve the aging infrastructure requires major and continuous investment with estimates ranging from tens of millions to 1 5 billion usd for flint michigan as an example rosario ortiz et al 2016 this is a common problem worldwide and is even worse in some underdeveloped countries due to lack of the available finance a further limitation is the inability to locate aging pipes for regular maintenance and replacement which has been ranked as the top challenge by water professionals in industry brett walton 2019 therefore finding technologies that enhance the monitoring of drinking water supply systems are of great importance as well as improving water supply infrastructure source water quality enhancement is also needed china launched the largest to date water pipeline project the south to north water diversion project snwdp and tens of millions of people have benefited from the source water from southern regions where surface water quality is better than that in the northern areas liu 1998 in order to supply high quality drinking water to residents the beijing government has scheduled an important plan of improvement which includes premise plumbing in 1223 communities beijing evening news 2019 however the current point of use tap water quality in beijing remains unclear which has become an obstacle towards the improvement goal therefore it is now urgent to gain a greater understanding of the quality of tap water in terms of physico chemical and microbial characteristics which can contribute to and enhance the improvement plan in this study we present the results of a tap water sampling exercise across 8 administrative districts in beijing supplied by both surface water sw and ground water gw the tap water quality tests relating to microbial communities and physico chemical properties e g organic matter metal ions were conducted and analyzed with reference to the pipe building age fig 1 moreover we also present a rapid method for the public to obtain primary information of their tap water quality by automatically analyzing filtered membranes based on an intelligent algorithm which can also help local governments and water suppliers to locate the old and polluting pipelines precisely and effectively 2 materials and methods 2 1 sample collection beijing drinking water is supplied from 3 major sources including miyun my reservoir local ground water and surface water delivered via the snwdp specifically water from the my reservoir and the snwdp is blended prior to drinking water production each source water is purified at dwtps and produced water is delivered via city s dwdss to communities point of use tap water samples were collected from 22 sites across 8 administrative districts in beijing 5 urban and 3 suburban areas the sampling sites were randomly selected and all the samples from dwdss were collected at lower levels of buildings below the 5th floor to avoid secondary pollution from roof tanks from july to september 2019 in order to alleviate the potential effects of seasonal change on microbial communities in source waters moreover in order to sample fresh tap water from the premise plumbing cast iron pipes each tap was flushed for at least 5 min 200 ml water samples were employed for analyzing physical and chemical properties immediately after they were transferred to the laboratory specifically 100 ml sample was used for organics measurement and another 100 ml sample was employed for analyzing other parameters the section 2 5 the remainder of the samples 10 l were stored at 4 c for further experiments detailed information about the water samples is summarized in the supporting information supplementary table s1 2 2 dna extraction and illumina sequencing the collected water samples 10 l were carefully filtered using 0 22 µm mixed cellulose membranes diameter 47 mm millipore us for biomass collection this was scheduled carefully within the experimental procedure as the filtration process was estimated to last 5 30 h depending on the water quality each sample was kept at a low temperature 10 c during the whole process the filtered membranes were subsequently moved into sterile falcon tubes and stored in a 80 c refrigerator for microbiological analyses dna was extracted using a dna isolation kit dneasy powerwater qiagen the netherlands following the method described in the equipment manual and nested pcr amplification was performed for all samples to increase the sensitivity of dna sequencing was conducted on an illumina miseq platform illumina san diego usa targeting 16s rrna v3 v4 region following the illumina dual index strategy 2 3 sequencing data analyses the obtained sequences were selected for operational taxonomic unit otu at 97 similarity on usearch version 7 0 and taxonomy classification was further obtained via the silva online server release132 http www arb silva de further analyses regarding alpha diversity analysis additional beta diversity analysis and community differences were carried out based on an on line platform majorbio cloud china https cloud majorbio com index html where requisite packages including primer e version 6 0 phyloseq version 1 23 1 vegan version 2 5 and iq tree version 1 6 8 were pre installed 2 4 organic matter characterization the organic content of tap water samples 100 ml after filtration by 0 22 µm mixed cellulose membranes diameter 47 mm millipore us was evaluated in terms of total organic carbon toc uv absorbance at 254 nm denoted as uv254 fluorescent spectra and molecular weight distribution specifically for the total organic carbon and humic like substances indicated by uv254 measurements a toc analyzer toc vwp shimadzu japan and a uv visible spectrophotometer uv 2600 shimadzu japan were used respectively the fluorescent spectra of tap water were obtained via three dimensional 3d scanning using an excitation emission matrix eem spectrofluorometer f 4600fl hitachi japan emission and excitation scans were conducted from 220 to 550 nm and from 220 to 450 nm separately and the scanning interval was selected at 5 nm according to a previous study liu et al 2011 ultrapure water produced by milli q system was employed to reduce raman scattering and background noise the molecular weight distribution of organic matter was determined by size exclusion chromatography sec which employed a high performance liquid chromatography hplc system waters usa and a sec column phenomenex biosep 5 μm secs3000 290 å equipped with securityguard cartridge phenomenex kj0 4282 the hplc system and the relevant operational parameters were the same as those reported in our previous studies xu et al 2020 2 5 other water properties the primary characteristics of tap water samples were also tested in this regard turbidity ph conductivity and zeta potential zp were measured by a turbidimeter 2100 n hach us a ph meter fp20 bio fiveeasy plus mettler toledo us a conductivity meter s230 mettler toledo us and a nano zetasizer zs90 malvern uk respectively metal concentrations of iron fe aluminum al manganese mn calcium ca magnesium mg sodium na and potassium k were determined by inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy icp aes perkinelmer us after the ph value of the test solutions was adjusted to 2 using nitric acid 98 all the tests were repeated 3 times and average values were reported 2 6 image processing and prediction after filtration 10 l tap water the procedure shown in the section 2 2 each finished test membrane was immediately placed on a white sheet as background for image collection optical images of the test membranes were captured using a camera huawei p20 with a pixel resolution of 3968 2976 all the raw images were imported and analyzed using pillow library in python 3 6 red green and blue rgb values of regions of interest roi were extracted ranging from 0 to 255 in each channel for the roi selection any reflection or shadow should be avoided the average values vr vg and vb of the regions in each channel were summed as a total value denoted as vtot for further analysis following the equation 1 vr g b vr g b vtot these normalized values were within a range between 0 and 1 then linear regression models were constructed based on the normalized values and 70 data of target water parameters si tables s3 and s4 according to ordinary least squares based on the python 3 6 platform subsequently the residual 30 data of water quality was used to test the models finally these membranes were fully air dried at 40 c using an oven dhg 9031a yiheng china for 30 h and stored in plastic petri dishes separately all the gold coated membranes were observed for their surface morphologies under a field scanning electron microscope sem su8000 hitachi japan 3 results and discussion 3 1 variation in community composition across different districts profiles of bacterial communities were constructed from the sequencing results of 12 point of use tap water samples and 571 807 sequences were collected in total si supplementary table s2 moreover the rarefaction curves reached a plateau after 30 000 sequence reads as shown in the si supplementary fig 1 indicating enough sample coverage throughout the sequencing tests overall the microbial sequences were clustered to 1739 operational taxonomic units otus defined at 97 sequence similarity which is higher than the results derived from previous research studies that sequenced tap water samples from a unique source water ling et al 2018 revetta et al 2010 holinger et al 2014 in general the specific numbers of otus in tap water supplied from ground water were clearly larger than those summarized from surface water sources as indicated in the si supplementary table s2 this suggests that greater concern regarding microbial safety should be given to tap water which is supplied by ground water since greater microorganisms variability may have more potential for contaminating ground water and result in illness e g hepatitis cholera etc even though disinfectants e g chlorine were applied us epa 1993 fig 2 a displays the compositional distribution of bacteria at the phylum level it can be seen that proteobacteria is the dominant bacteria in all samples ranging from 63 to 97 this result was consistent with many previous studies ling et al 2018 el chakhtoura et al 2015 the proportion of proteobacteria in tap water hd1 hd2 hd3 etc produced from surface water was much higher than that observed in tap water sjs1 sjs2 tz1 etc produced from ground water more precisely proteobacteria can be further classified into alpha beta and gamma proteobacteria and this analysis was also made in this study the results fig 2b showed that gamma proteobacteria was the major component and the relative proportion of alpha proteobacteria of sjs1 sjs2 and tz samples was significantly higher than the hd1 hd2 and cy2 samples in general these findings were distinctive from the relevant data reported in other research studies which were carried out in the us ling et al 2018 due to the common resistant characteristics of proteobacteria during disinfection the nature of the source waters in china and the us were considered to be responsible for this difference other bacteria at the phylum level including actinobacteria planctomycetes cyanobacteria firmicutes acidobacteria presented in a decreasing order were also identified as shown in fig 2a in particular the proportions of actinobacteria in tw from ground water were clearly greater than those found in the tw from surface water besides the various bacteria communities shown in fig 2a and b more direct observations were displayed in figure 2c 5 representative filtered membranes with 1 control blank membrane were presented and obvious differences can be identified for example different microorganisms deposited can be distinguished among these membrane samples in addition membrane pores can be found in sem images of the control sjs and tz however nearly full blockage of membrane pores was observed in hd cy and fs samples thus for membrane pore blockage the differences in water quality can provide a feasible explanation and will be discussed in the following sections 3 2 impact of pipe age on microbial community the impact of pipe age on microbial communities was investigated by separating the tested samples into two groups pipes older or younger than 15 years thus the beta diversity results were presented in a non metric multidimensional scaling analysis nmds plot via calculating weighted unifrac distance as shown in fig 3 a specifically the similarity of bacterial communities shaped by pipe age cannot be identified in contrast some other results hd1 3 cy1 2 and dx1 shown in green selection in fig 3a were closely gathered because of their similar source of surface water si supplementary table s2 this can be explained by the tap water microbial composition which is largely influenced by source water han et al 2020 and the beijing city drinking water is produced mainly from 2 surface water sources i e miyun reservoir and the raw water from the snwdp in contrast disperse dots sjs1 2 tz1 and fs1 of tw from ground water were presented in fig 3a regardless of pipe age this suggested that these bacterial communities may be influenced significantly by their surrounding geological conditions e g deep soil or possibly by artificial chemicals e g herbicide moreover hierarchical clustering of the obtained sequences was conducted according to the unweighted pair group method with arithmetic mean upgma showing very similar results in the si supplementary fig 2 comparing the effects of pipe age on the similarity of bacteria among various tap water samples there was an obvious difference between the quantities of otus of the 2 groups fig 3b the results showed that a total number of 1469 otus in old pipes 15 years was identified and only 674 otus were found in the relatively new pipes 15 years thus it can be deduced that pipe age exerted a significant effect on the microbial diversity in tap water but was not responsible for the microbial similarity various biofilms formed in pipes of age from 3 to 37 years are considered to lead to this difference similarly in a previous study biofilms shaped by different pipe materials were found to contribute to the difference of water microbial diversity rożej et al 2015 in order to obtain further understanding of the influence of pipe age on microbial diversity a relationship between the number of otus and pipe age was found using linear regression fig 3c the results revealed an approximate linear relationship p 0 01 suggesting that microbial diversity in tap water increased with increasing pipe age and this finding can be indicative and used for predictive explorations which will be discussed in the following section furthermore clustered otus presented in the phylogenetic tree provided detailed observations and also verified the obtained results si supplementary fig 3 from the results summarized in fig 3a it was evident that the microbial community structure of tap water was significantly influenced by the source water even though the increase in pipe age led to an increase in microbial abundance fig 3b and 3c this finding is consistent with a previous study suggesting that source water microbial characteristics play a significant role in the microbiome content of point of use tap water with a weight coefficient of 20 16 han et al 2020 for microbial communities shown in the network analysis fig 3b the classification of the target groups was considered according to the type of source water i e surface water and ground water in order to observe any differences a wilcoxon rank sum test was conducted via a statistical method of bootstrap on the genus level the results clearly showed that the proportions of enterobacter pseudomonas mycobacterium and zoogloea in the gw group were clearly higher than those in the sw group with a p value 0 05 in contrast only the proportion of phreatobacter in the sw group was higher than that in the gw group 3 3 physico chemical characteristics of point of use tap water in order to further identify the interactions between chemical characteristics and microbial communities of tap water several physico chemical parameters including turbidity organic matter ph metal ions and species charge characteristics were measured for each water sample as shown in fig 4 it can be seen that the values of turbidity varied among the test samples ranging from 0 01 ntu to 1 04 ntu and a clear difference was observed among the samples collected in one district e g the hd district this suggested that the turbidity of point of use sites was simultaneously determined by the source water as well as pipes and the relevant values of tw sjs1 5 hd10 tz1 fs1 from ground water were generally similar to those of tw from surface water with respect to the influence of pipe age the deposited and newly formed particles released into tap water are believed to be major contributors to the increasing value of turbidity li et al 2020 zhao et al 2018 in contrast the concentrations of organic matter indicated by toc and particularly uv254 absorbance values showed a similar trend among the samples collected from different districts for example the uv254 values of samples from ground water sjs1 5 hd10 tz1 fs1 were significantly lower than samples from surface water hd1 9 cy1 2 dc1 mtg1 dx1 a similar trend was also observed in the toc results although the corresponding difference between the above mentioned two groups was slightly smaller the same type of tap water source e g ground water was thus deduced as the main reason responsible for the similar values of uv254 among the collected samples furthermore it can be concluded that the presence of humic like substances were not significantly influenced by the pipe age during drinking water distribution based on the observation on less difference among the samples collected in the same district in comparison to the corresponding toc values in addition the calculated values of suva which is often correlated with the formation potential of disinfection by products showed a similar trend with uv254 indicating a lower toxicity risk of tap water produced from ground water karanfil et al 2002 with regard to the species charge of the tap water samples there was an apparent inverse relationship between the zeta potential and conductivity measurements fig 4 as would be consistent with colloid theory specifically the conductivity of samples e g hd1 9 and sjs1 5 representing the ionic strength of solution would be expected to influence the surface charge zeta potential of colloids and particles in the tap water viz higher conductivity lower charge potential the concentrations of metal ions provide more detail concerning the conductivity values the major cations in tap water ca2 mg2 k and na showed a clear relationship with source and the values were very similar in the same region fig 4 the proportions of metal ions in water samples from two representative districts hd surface water samples and sjs ground water samples were displayed as arithmetic mean values in fig 5 a and b the results revealed an increased proportion of sodium in the sjs samples 70 mg l which is a relatively high level that may be undesirable from a health perspective scheelbeek et al 2016 elliott and alexander 1961 these metal cations ca2 mg2 k and na are generally considered to be determined by source waters while the presence of al3 and fe3 can be from the combination of residuals of metal based coagulants used and coagulant precipitates accumulated on the aging pipes su et al 2017 wang et al 2012 all the detailed water quality values can be found in the si tables s3 and s4 in addition to the humic like substances the presence of other macromolecules which are included in the toc measurements and commonly recognized as biopolymers was identified as displayed in fig 5c f as shown in fig 5c and d biopolymers with molecular weight between 6 kda and 60 kda were detected in the sec spectra of ground water samples sjs1 and tz1 further evidence was indicated by the eem analyses fig 5e and f which displays the fluorescent response of organic matter in surface water fig 5e and ground water fig 5f samples the supplementary figs s 5e and 5f showed that aromatic proteins peak t and other soluble microbial by product like substances peak b were present chen et al 2003 the results indicated the loss of some protein like substances in the tap water sec spectra fig 5c and d at 254 nm wavelength and may need further optimization on the relative measurement methodologies the same observations can also be made from the sec and eem spectra of other representative samples as provided in the si supplementary figs s4 and s5 from the results regarding the point of use tap water quality characteristics it was clear that the physico chemical parameters can be categorized as those determined by the source water and those impacted by the pipes during distribution further analyses aiming at clarifying these parameters were conducted by investigating their relationship with pipe age specifically compared to the complexity of factors e g microbial metabolism contributing to toc values turbidity values that are mainly determined by particles were successfully linked to the pipe age fig 6 a in contrast a relationship between toc values and pipe age was not found fig 6b due to the specific role of particles in zeta potential measurement a significant relationship p 0 05 between the values of zeta potential and pipe age was also identified fig 6c however there was no significant relationship between any metal ion such as al3 fe3 shown in the si supplementary fig s6 concentration and pipe age interestingly the concentrations of ca2 and mg2 had a close relationship p 0 001 as shown in fig 6d from the aspects of human health the relative ca based and mg based complexes coexisting in all the tested tap water samples should receive more attentions because magnesium intake significantly reduces the risk of hypertension yang and chiu 1999 3 4 contributions of water chemistry to bacteria in most cases the microbial microenvironment existing in pipes is relatively stable and shaped by the water quality characteristics such as the organic matter ph and conductivity we therefore investigated the impact of relevant physico chemical properties of tap water on the beta diversity using canonical correspondence analyses cca based on weighted unifrac distances fig 7 a and b the results fig 7a showed that there was a clear positive correlation between the measured parameters such as toc uv turbidity and pipe age pipe age had a relatively negative influence on the ph value indicating a decrease in alkalinity when pipes aged this result is also consistent with the finding derived from the influence of pipe age on turbidity and toc shown in fig 6a and b for the impact of metal elements fig 7b ca2 mg2 na and k were found to behave similarly in shaping microbial community in comparison to fe3 and al3 these distinctive influences on bacteria diversity were further explored by calculating spearman correlation coefficients between water parameters and bacteria abundance at the genus level as displayed in fig 7c the formated heatmap indicated an inversely proportional relationship between the concentration of humic like substances indicated by uv254 and the specific bacteria zoogloea mycobacterium chloroplast enterobacter pseudomonas ralstonia and bacillus abundance with p values 0 05 in general similar findings for the abundance of these bacteria caused by the concentrations of fe3 and al3 were also obtained as reflected by cluster analysis see top middle green rectangle shown in fig 7c conversely ph ca2 mg2 na and k top left green rectangle showed a positive relationship with bacillus abundance indicating that more bacillus can be found in ground water related samples which are normally characterized by relatively higher concentrations of ca2 mg2 na and k detailed coefficients are given in the si supplementary table s5 3 5 implications in practical water applications this study brings a geographical perspective to microbial community structure of point of use tap water supplied by municipal distribution systems across 8 districts in beijing although various source waters surface water and ground water were employed general similarities at the phylum level were observed among the collected samples in disparate systems indicating that proteobacteria was the dominant bacteria fig 2 in particular the differences in microbial communities and physico chemical properties of tap water impacted by pipe building age was further revealed in contrast to previous studies where this was neglected inkinen et al 2014 pinto et al 2014 however the characteristics of plumbing systems are key factors responsible for the end of use tap water quality particles and planktonic organisms flushed out from biofilms associated with aging pipes always pollute original clean water holinger et al 2014 herein we found that bacterial abundance was closely linked to the age of pipes fig 3c however the similarity of bacterial community among the tested samples was determined by the source of tap water fig 3a moreover water chemistry also shapes the structure of microbial community fig 7a and b and the relevant parameters e g concentrations of certain metal ions were found to be indicative of specific bacterial abundance fig 7c therefore an evaluation of the water physico chemical properties and microbial communities and their underlying interactions was conducted which suggested selective micro ecosystems harbored in the aging pipes although continuing efforts are made to improve the public satisfaction of tap water it remains difficult to guarantee the availability of clean and safe drinking water the development of network monitoring and analysis in recent years is proving to be beneficial to this issue and technology relating to exploiting big data has been successfully applied in several environmental research areas for example li et al 2020 implemented an intelligent technique to monitor lagoon water quality by applying machine learning algorithms based on the spectra of collected samples similarly machine learning based on big data has been extensively employed in pollutant removal efficiency hou et al 2018 surface water quality prediction chen et al 2020 and burst locations in water distribution networks zhou et al 2019 inspired by the above mentioned advances in this study we propose a feasible approach for obtaining information regarding tap water quality a schematic of an intelligent analysis process is shown in fig 8 a which includes the collection of tap water filtered membranes feature extraction model construction and prediction specifically 14 images of finished membranes using samples from surface water were randomly selected and the extracted rgb values were adopted as input features for building models in which pipe age toc value and ca2 mg2 concentration were used as target variables respectively in general our results showed that image analysis of filtered membranes whose color varied with the nature of the sample was able to provide a reasonable prediction of pipe age organic matter concentration indicated by toc value ca2 and mg2 concentration i e hardness of water as presented in fig 8b and c respectively it s worth noting that accuracy of the predicted values of pipe age and toc was better than that of ca2 mg2 concentrations the strong binding ability of organic matter with ca2 and mg2 yan and korshin 2014 might be a critical factor which contributes to models prediction e g ca2 mg2 concentrations in contrast fe3 with its yellow red color can act as a color developing agent on the filtered membranes and thus it can be indicative of other water parameters such as toc concentration the corresponding process is presented schematically in the si supplementary fig 8 this innovative finding can be employed at point of use sites by the public whereby a tailor made membrane filter can be connected to a faucet for 10 min flushing and an image of the membrane captured easily by a smartphone and then uploaded to the cloud for analysis using algorithms built previously thus the public can be able to gain more information about their tap water and water utilities able to use the data to locate aging pipes for subsequent maintenance using a similar approach jin et al 2018 developed an on line imaging based technique for the rapid and accurate identification and enumeration of cynobacteria this method is recognized as a cost effective and rapid approach for watershed management and potable water production moreover the prediction accuracy of the method can be further improved with the collection of more water quality data and thus this novel method can be a cost saving and efficient monitoring tool not only for the public but also for regulatory bodies and water suppliers 4 conclusions in this study the physico chemical and microbiological characteristics of point of use tap water were evaluated with samples collected across different districts in beijing china in particular plumbing age was technically hypothesized as a major factor which may determine the tap water quality several laboratory measurement techniques combined with optical analysis of membrane filters after sample treatment were also applied the main findings of the study are as follows the nature of bacterial communities of point of use tap water is mainly determined by the water source i e groundwater river water the variability of bacteria represented by otu is significantly influenced by plumbing age specifically the statistical number of otus in buildings with a pipe age 15 years was 1469 which was much greater than that in buildings with a pipe age 15 years 674 the metal ion composition of tap water greatly contributes to shaping the properties of bacterial communities the total concentration of metals in groundwater sourced samples was clearly higher than river sourced samples it was found that ca2 and mg2 concentrations were well correlated the membrane filters after sample treatment were photographed and the images can be employed to give useful information regarding the building pipe age etc during which fe based oxides as a chromogenic reagent played an important role in predicting indexes with more data collection this methodology could be employed practically to locate aging pipelines quickly

15481,in most cases point of use tap water quality is not routinely monitored due to widely dispersed sampling sites and the costly tests although previous studies have revealed the variation of drinking water quality during distribution in municipal networks the influence of aging pipes in buildings on quality is still unknown and this makes it difficult for water utilities to conduct regular maintenance herein we have undertaken a survey of tap water samples across 8 districts in beijing china to evaluate the potential effects of pipe age on point of use water quality including turbidity organic matter characteristics and bacterial community by grouping the collected samples according to the pipe age and source water respectively the results suggested that bacterial diversity is significantly influenced by the pipe age however bacterial community structure is clearly influenced by the source water similarly aging pipes in buildings are also responsible for the deterioration of the final water quality and their effects have been closely linked to selected water quality parameters by evaluating the relevant factors moreover the interrelationships between physico chemical parameters and bacteria abundance were identified for example ph ca2 mg2 na and k showed a positive relationship with bacillus abundance in addition an intelligent analysis method for understanding pipe age organic matter concentration and hardness i e ca2 and mg2 concentration based on image analysis of filtered membranes has been developed the accuracy of prediction was encouraging but can be improved with the collection of more data from tap water samples we expect that this method can be exploited by the public to monitor their tap water and provide a feasible and cost effective approach for water suppliers to locate aging deteriorating pipes which need to be replaced or maintained graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords tap water pipe age water quality point of use bacterial communities membrane filters 1 introduction drinking sufficient amounts of water is important for human health in order to transport nutrients and oxygen to bodily cells flushing bacteria from the bladder balancing blood pressure and so forth harvard medical school 2016 however people may be exposed to water causing diseases even if they have access to safe water which meets national local standards firstly halogenated by products at low concentrations in tap water present toxicity e g carcinogenicity risks which are of concern to people worldwide who live in the areas supplied by chlorinated water supply systems sedlak and von gunten 2011 li and mitch 2018 secondly contaminants released from urban pipe distribution networks premise plumbing systems and storage facilities may also reach levels that are toxic and cause chronic diseases such as cancers and high blood pressure zhuang et al 2019 hanna attisha et al 2016 these contaminants include metal fe pb etc ions and corrosion particles which often coexist with microbial pollution nelson et al 1996 wang et al 2012 for point of use systems these contaminants are commonly not included in regular surveillance by water suppliers and government bodies as drinking water standards are applied to the water samples collected at drinking water treatment plants dwtps prior to drinking water distribution systems dwdss the testing of point of use water quality is often considered costly and time consuming and this prevents consumers from having information describing their tap water quality and being assured of its safety and compliance with drinking water standards in the last decade many studies have concentrated on the variation of drinking water from dwtps to point of use sites and certain findings regarding microbial community changes han et al 2020 hull et al 2017 biofilm characteristics wang et al 2014 sun et al 2014 particulate formation and metal ions release ng et al 2012 gora et al 2020 were obtained as illustrated schematically in fig 1 for example one study perrin et al 2019 observed microbiome changes in distribution using four paris distribution networks over one year and found that there were no significant differences in bacterial diversity among them however a bacterial compositional perturbation was linked to a flood event in comparison a more recent research revealed a bacterial similarity of 50 between source water and tap water which suggested that microbial quality of the source water should receive more attention in order to protect tap water bio safety han et al 2020 normally distribution networks provide aerobic environments which shape different microbial communities under specific physico chemical conditions such as ph nitrate phosphate and chlorine concentrations douterelo et al 2020 kelly et al 2014 ling et al 2018 previous research has traced the trends of metal ion release organic matter accumulation and microbial community characteristics in unchlorinated dwdss netherlands and switzerland liu et al 2014 lautenschlager et al 2013 and chlorinated dwdss us and china gomez smith et al 2015 similarly interactive factors were also found in premise plumbing for example it has been shown ling et al 2018 that residual chlorine concentrations in point of use tap water affected by stagnation time in pipes that shapes significant various microbial communities and even the influence of sampling sites in a building on microorganisms was predominant in addition impacted microbiome in hot water supplying system in buildings was also identified ji et al 2017 rhoads et al 2015 however little research has been reported to date regarding the effects of pipe age on water quality such as physico chemical properties and microbial communities it should be noted that aging pipes also play a critical often negative role in delivering drinking water to point of use consumers as these pipes may lead to increasing concentrations of metal ions and organic matter accumulation such as dwdss in cities inkinen et al 2013 liu et al 2014 if it is assumed that changes in water quality are minor in the pipe distribution process then the quality of the consumer s tap water will be determined by the premise plumbing in the building in general tap water quality is determined by both the dwdss and premise plumbing in buildings and non compliance with regulated standards has been widely reported in recent years for example in the us and canada lead has been found to be as much as 5 20 times the regulated level and its release has led to numerous health related incidences trueman et al 2019 allaire et al 2018 to prevent water quality deterioration water utilities authorities have programmes to replace the old pipes kim and herrera 2010 hall 1972 an estimated 22 of the pipes in the united states are more than 50 years old and only 43 of pipes are in good condition folkman 2018 while in the uk the average pipe age was estimated to be 75 80 years ukwir 2011 in china due to the lack of records of pipe inventories an average age of overall pipes was estimated to be at least 60 years and red water problems have raised concern among responsible authorities li et al 2010 zhang et al 2014 however to improve the aging infrastructure requires major and continuous investment with estimates ranging from tens of millions to 1 5 billion usd for flint michigan as an example rosario ortiz et al 2016 this is a common problem worldwide and is even worse in some underdeveloped countries due to lack of the available finance a further limitation is the inability to locate aging pipes for regular maintenance and replacement which has been ranked as the top challenge by water professionals in industry brett walton 2019 therefore finding technologies that enhance the monitoring of drinking water supply systems are of great importance as well as improving water supply infrastructure source water quality enhancement is also needed china launched the largest to date water pipeline project the south to north water diversion project snwdp and tens of millions of people have benefited from the source water from southern regions where surface water quality is better than that in the northern areas liu 1998 in order to supply high quality drinking water to residents the beijing government has scheduled an important plan of improvement which includes premise plumbing in 1223 communities beijing evening news 2019 however the current point of use tap water quality in beijing remains unclear which has become an obstacle towards the improvement goal therefore it is now urgent to gain a greater understanding of the quality of tap water in terms of physico chemical and microbial characteristics which can contribute to and enhance the improvement plan in this study we present the results of a tap water sampling exercise across 8 administrative districts in beijing supplied by both surface water sw and ground water gw the tap water quality tests relating to microbial communities and physico chemical properties e g organic matter metal ions were conducted and analyzed with reference to the pipe building age fig 1 moreover we also present a rapid method for the public to obtain primary information of their tap water quality by automatically analyzing filtered membranes based on an intelligent algorithm which can also help local governments and water suppliers to locate the old and polluting pipelines precisely and effectively 2 materials and methods 2 1 sample collection beijing drinking water is supplied from 3 major sources including miyun my reservoir local ground water and surface water delivered via the snwdp specifically water from the my reservoir and the snwdp is blended prior to drinking water production each source water is purified at dwtps and produced water is delivered via city s dwdss to communities point of use tap water samples were collected from 22 sites across 8 administrative districts in beijing 5 urban and 3 suburban areas the sampling sites were randomly selected and all the samples from dwdss were collected at lower levels of buildings below the 5th floor to avoid secondary pollution from roof tanks from july to september 2019 in order to alleviate the potential effects of seasonal change on microbial communities in source waters moreover in order to sample fresh tap water from the premise plumbing cast iron pipes each tap was flushed for at least 5 min 200 ml water samples were employed for analyzing physical and chemical properties immediately after they were transferred to the laboratory specifically 100 ml sample was used for organics measurement and another 100 ml sample was employed for analyzing other parameters the section 2 5 the remainder of the samples 10 l were stored at 4 c for further experiments detailed information about the water samples is summarized in the supporting information supplementary table s1 2 2 dna extraction and illumina sequencing the collected water samples 10 l were carefully filtered using 0 22 µm mixed cellulose membranes diameter 47 mm millipore us for biomass collection this was scheduled carefully within the experimental procedure as the filtration process was estimated to last 5 30 h depending on the water quality each sample was kept at a low temperature 10 c during the whole process the filtered membranes were subsequently moved into sterile falcon tubes and stored in a 80 c refrigerator for microbiological analyses dna was extracted using a dna isolation kit dneasy powerwater qiagen the netherlands following the method described in the equipment manual and nested pcr amplification was performed for all samples to increase the sensitivity of dna sequencing was conducted on an illumina miseq platform illumina san diego usa targeting 16s rrna v3 v4 region following the illumina dual index strategy 2 3 sequencing data analyses the obtained sequences were selected for operational taxonomic unit otu at 97 similarity on usearch version 7 0 and taxonomy classification was further obtained via the silva online server release132 http www arb silva de further analyses regarding alpha diversity analysis additional beta diversity analysis and community differences were carried out based on an on line platform majorbio cloud china https cloud majorbio com index html where requisite packages including primer e version 6 0 phyloseq version 1 23 1 vegan version 2 5 and iq tree version 1 6 8 were pre installed 2 4 organic matter characterization the organic content of tap water samples 100 ml after filtration by 0 22 µm mixed cellulose membranes diameter 47 mm millipore us was evaluated in terms of total organic carbon toc uv absorbance at 254 nm denoted as uv254 fluorescent spectra and molecular weight distribution specifically for the total organic carbon and humic like substances indicated by uv254 measurements a toc analyzer toc vwp shimadzu japan and a uv visible spectrophotometer uv 2600 shimadzu japan were used respectively the fluorescent spectra of tap water were obtained via three dimensional 3d scanning using an excitation emission matrix eem spectrofluorometer f 4600fl hitachi japan emission and excitation scans were conducted from 220 to 550 nm and from 220 to 450 nm separately and the scanning interval was selected at 5 nm according to a previous study liu et al 2011 ultrapure water produced by milli q system was employed to reduce raman scattering and background noise the molecular weight distribution of organic matter was determined by size exclusion chromatography sec which employed a high performance liquid chromatography hplc system waters usa and a sec column phenomenex biosep 5 μm secs3000 290 å equipped with securityguard cartridge phenomenex kj0 4282 the hplc system and the relevant operational parameters were the same as those reported in our previous studies xu et al 2020 2 5 other water properties the primary characteristics of tap water samples were also tested in this regard turbidity ph conductivity and zeta potential zp were measured by a turbidimeter 2100 n hach us a ph meter fp20 bio fiveeasy plus mettler toledo us a conductivity meter s230 mettler toledo us and a nano zetasizer zs90 malvern uk respectively metal concentrations of iron fe aluminum al manganese mn calcium ca magnesium mg sodium na and potassium k were determined by inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy icp aes perkinelmer us after the ph value of the test solutions was adjusted to 2 using nitric acid 98 all the tests were repeated 3 times and average values were reported 2 6 image processing and prediction after filtration 10 l tap water the procedure shown in the section 2 2 each finished test membrane was immediately placed on a white sheet as background for image collection optical images of the test membranes were captured using a camera huawei p20 with a pixel resolution of 3968 2976 all the raw images were imported and analyzed using pillow library in python 3 6 red green and blue rgb values of regions of interest roi were extracted ranging from 0 to 255 in each channel for the roi selection any reflection or shadow should be avoided the average values vr vg and vb of the regions in each channel were summed as a total value denoted as vtot for further analysis following the equation 1 vr g b vr g b vtot these normalized values were within a range between 0 and 1 then linear regression models were constructed based on the normalized values and 70 data of target water parameters si tables s3 and s4 according to ordinary least squares based on the python 3 6 platform subsequently the residual 30 data of water quality was used to test the models finally these membranes were fully air dried at 40 c using an oven dhg 9031a yiheng china for 30 h and stored in plastic petri dishes separately all the gold coated membranes were observed for their surface morphologies under a field scanning electron microscope sem su8000 hitachi japan 3 results and discussion 3 1 variation in community composition across different districts profiles of bacterial communities were constructed from the sequencing results of 12 point of use tap water samples and 571 807 sequences were collected in total si supplementary table s2 moreover the rarefaction curves reached a plateau after 30 000 sequence reads as shown in the si supplementary fig 1 indicating enough sample coverage throughout the sequencing tests overall the microbial sequences were clustered to 1739 operational taxonomic units otus defined at 97 sequence similarity which is higher than the results derived from previous research studies that sequenced tap water samples from a unique source water ling et al 2018 revetta et al 2010 holinger et al 2014 in general the specific numbers of otus in tap water supplied from ground water were clearly larger than those summarized from surface water sources as indicated in the si supplementary table s2 this suggests that greater concern regarding microbial safety should be given to tap water which is supplied by ground water since greater microorganisms variability may have more potential for contaminating ground water and result in illness e g hepatitis cholera etc even though disinfectants e g chlorine were applied us epa 1993 fig 2 a displays the compositional distribution of bacteria at the phylum level it can be seen that proteobacteria is the dominant bacteria in all samples ranging from 63 to 97 this result was consistent with many previous studies ling et al 2018 el chakhtoura et al 2015 the proportion of proteobacteria in tap water hd1 hd2 hd3 etc produced from surface water was much higher than that observed in tap water sjs1 sjs2 tz1 etc produced from ground water more precisely proteobacteria can be further classified into alpha beta and gamma proteobacteria and this analysis was also made in this study the results fig 2b showed that gamma proteobacteria was the major component and the relative proportion of alpha proteobacteria of sjs1 sjs2 and tz samples was significantly higher than the hd1 hd2 and cy2 samples in general these findings were distinctive from the relevant data reported in other research studies which were carried out in the us ling et al 2018 due to the common resistant characteristics of proteobacteria during disinfection the nature of the source waters in china and the us were considered to be responsible for this difference other bacteria at the phylum level including actinobacteria planctomycetes cyanobacteria firmicutes acidobacteria presented in a decreasing order were also identified as shown in fig 2a in particular the proportions of actinobacteria in tw from ground water were clearly greater than those found in the tw from surface water besides the various bacteria communities shown in fig 2a and b more direct observations were displayed in figure 2c 5 representative filtered membranes with 1 control blank membrane were presented and obvious differences can be identified for example different microorganisms deposited can be distinguished among these membrane samples in addition membrane pores can be found in sem images of the control sjs and tz however nearly full blockage of membrane pores was observed in hd cy and fs samples thus for membrane pore blockage the differences in water quality can provide a feasible explanation and will be discussed in the following sections 3 2 impact of pipe age on microbial community the impact of pipe age on microbial communities was investigated by separating the tested samples into two groups pipes older or younger than 15 years thus the beta diversity results were presented in a non metric multidimensional scaling analysis nmds plot via calculating weighted unifrac distance as shown in fig 3 a specifically the similarity of bacterial communities shaped by pipe age cannot be identified in contrast some other results hd1 3 cy1 2 and dx1 shown in green selection in fig 3a were closely gathered because of their similar source of surface water si supplementary table s2 this can be explained by the tap water microbial composition which is largely influenced by source water han et al 2020 and the beijing city drinking water is produced mainly from 2 surface water sources i e miyun reservoir and the raw water from the snwdp in contrast disperse dots sjs1 2 tz1 and fs1 of tw from ground water were presented in fig 3a regardless of pipe age this suggested that these bacterial communities may be influenced significantly by their surrounding geological conditions e g deep soil or possibly by artificial chemicals e g herbicide moreover hierarchical clustering of the obtained sequences was conducted according to the unweighted pair group method with arithmetic mean upgma showing very similar results in the si supplementary fig 2 comparing the effects of pipe age on the similarity of bacteria among various tap water samples there was an obvious difference between the quantities of otus of the 2 groups fig 3b the results showed that a total number of 1469 otus in old pipes 15 years was identified and only 674 otus were found in the relatively new pipes 15 years thus it can be deduced that pipe age exerted a significant effect on the microbial diversity in tap water but was not responsible for the microbial similarity various biofilms formed in pipes of age from 3 to 37 years are considered to lead to this difference similarly in a previous study biofilms shaped by different pipe materials were found to contribute to the difference of water microbial diversity rożej et al 2015 in order to obtain further understanding of the influence of pipe age on microbial diversity a relationship between the number of otus and pipe age was found using linear regression fig 3c the results revealed an approximate linear relationship p 0 01 suggesting that microbial diversity in tap water increased with increasing pipe age and this finding can be indicative and used for predictive explorations which will be discussed in the following section furthermore clustered otus presented in the phylogenetic tree provided detailed observations and also verified the obtained results si supplementary fig 3 from the results summarized in fig 3a it was evident that the microbial community structure of tap water was significantly influenced by the source water even though the increase in pipe age led to an increase in microbial abundance fig 3b and 3c this finding is consistent with a previous study suggesting that source water microbial characteristics play a significant role in the microbiome content of point of use tap water with a weight coefficient of 20 16 han et al 2020 for microbial communities shown in the network analysis fig 3b the classification of the target groups was considered according to the type of source water i e surface water and ground water in order to observe any differences a wilcoxon rank sum test was conducted via a statistical method of bootstrap on the genus level the results clearly showed that the proportions of enterobacter pseudomonas mycobacterium and zoogloea in the gw group were clearly higher than those in the sw group with a p value 0 05 in contrast only the proportion of phreatobacter in the sw group was higher than that in the gw group 3 3 physico chemical characteristics of point of use tap water in order to further identify the interactions between chemical characteristics and microbial communities of tap water several physico chemical parameters including turbidity organic matter ph metal ions and species charge characteristics were measured for each water sample as shown in fig 4 it can be seen that the values of turbidity varied among the test samples ranging from 0 01 ntu to 1 04 ntu and a clear difference was observed among the samples collected in one district e g the hd district this suggested that the turbidity of point of use sites was simultaneously determined by the source water as well as pipes and the relevant values of tw sjs1 5 hd10 tz1 fs1 from ground water were generally similar to those of tw from surface water with respect to the influence of pipe age the deposited and newly formed particles released into tap water are believed to be major contributors to the increasing value of turbidity li et al 2020 zhao et al 2018 in contrast the concentrations of organic matter indicated by toc and particularly uv254 absorbance values showed a similar trend among the samples collected from different districts for example the uv254 values of samples from ground water sjs1 5 hd10 tz1 fs1 were significantly lower than samples from surface water hd1 9 cy1 2 dc1 mtg1 dx1 a similar trend was also observed in the toc results although the corresponding difference between the above mentioned two groups was slightly smaller the same type of tap water source e g ground water was thus deduced as the main reason responsible for the similar values of uv254 among the collected samples furthermore it can be concluded that the presence of humic like substances were not significantly influenced by the pipe age during drinking water distribution based on the observation on less difference among the samples collected in the same district in comparison to the corresponding toc values in addition the calculated values of suva which is often correlated with the formation potential of disinfection by products showed a similar trend with uv254 indicating a lower toxicity risk of tap water produced from ground water karanfil et al 2002 with regard to the species charge of the tap water samples there was an apparent inverse relationship between the zeta potential and conductivity measurements fig 4 as would be consistent with colloid theory specifically the conductivity of samples e g hd1 9 and sjs1 5 representing the ionic strength of solution would be expected to influence the surface charge zeta potential of colloids and particles in the tap water viz higher conductivity lower charge potential the concentrations of metal ions provide more detail concerning the conductivity values the major cations in tap water ca2 mg2 k and na showed a clear relationship with source and the values were very similar in the same region fig 4 the proportions of metal ions in water samples from two representative districts hd surface water samples and sjs ground water samples were displayed as arithmetic mean values in fig 5 a and b the results revealed an increased proportion of sodium in the sjs samples 70 mg l which is a relatively high level that may be undesirable from a health perspective scheelbeek et al 2016 elliott and alexander 1961 these metal cations ca2 mg2 k and na are generally considered to be determined by source waters while the presence of al3 and fe3 can be from the combination of residuals of metal based coagulants used and coagulant precipitates accumulated on the aging pipes su et al 2017 wang et al 2012 all the detailed water quality values can be found in the si tables s3 and s4 in addition to the humic like substances the presence of other macromolecules which are included in the toc measurements and commonly recognized as biopolymers was identified as displayed in fig 5c f as shown in fig 5c and d biopolymers with molecular weight between 6 kda and 60 kda were detected in the sec spectra of ground water samples sjs1 and tz1 further evidence was indicated by the eem analyses fig 5e and f which displays the fluorescent response of organic matter in surface water fig 5e and ground water fig 5f samples the supplementary figs s 5e and 5f showed that aromatic proteins peak t and other soluble microbial by product like substances peak b were present chen et al 2003 the results indicated the loss of some protein like substances in the tap water sec spectra fig 5c and d at 254 nm wavelength and may need further optimization on the relative measurement methodologies the same observations can also be made from the sec and eem spectra of other representative samples as provided in the si supplementary figs s4 and s5 from the results regarding the point of use tap water quality characteristics it was clear that the physico chemical parameters can be categorized as those determined by the source water and those impacted by the pipes during distribution further analyses aiming at clarifying these parameters were conducted by investigating their relationship with pipe age specifically compared to the complexity of factors e g microbial metabolism contributing to toc values turbidity values that are mainly determined by particles were successfully linked to the pipe age fig 6 a in contrast a relationship between toc values and pipe age was not found fig 6b due to the specific role of particles in zeta potential measurement a significant relationship p 0 05 between the values of zeta potential and pipe age was also identified fig 6c however there was no significant relationship between any metal ion such as al3 fe3 shown in the si supplementary fig s6 concentration and pipe age interestingly the concentrations of ca2 and mg2 had a close relationship p 0 001 as shown in fig 6d from the aspects of human health the relative ca based and mg based complexes coexisting in all the tested tap water samples should receive more attentions because magnesium intake significantly reduces the risk of hypertension yang and chiu 1999 3 4 contributions of water chemistry to bacteria in most cases the microbial microenvironment existing in pipes is relatively stable and shaped by the water quality characteristics such as the organic matter ph and conductivity we therefore investigated the impact of relevant physico chemical properties of tap water on the beta diversity using canonical correspondence analyses cca based on weighted unifrac distances fig 7 a and b the results fig 7a showed that there was a clear positive correlation between the measured parameters such as toc uv turbidity and pipe age pipe age had a relatively negative influence on the ph value indicating a decrease in alkalinity when pipes aged this result is also consistent with the finding derived from the influence of pipe age on turbidity and toc shown in fig 6a and b for the impact of metal elements fig 7b ca2 mg2 na and k were found to behave similarly in shaping microbial community in comparison to fe3 and al3 these distinctive influences on bacteria diversity were further explored by calculating spearman correlation coefficients between water parameters and bacteria abundance at the genus level as displayed in fig 7c the formated heatmap indicated an inversely proportional relationship between the concentration of humic like substances indicated by uv254 and the specific bacteria zoogloea mycobacterium chloroplast enterobacter pseudomonas ralstonia and bacillus abundance with p values 0 05 in general similar findings for the abundance of these bacteria caused by the concentrations of fe3 and al3 were also obtained as reflected by cluster analysis see top middle green rectangle shown in fig 7c conversely ph ca2 mg2 na and k top left green rectangle showed a positive relationship with bacillus abundance indicating that more bacillus can be found in ground water related samples which are normally characterized by relatively higher concentrations of ca2 mg2 na and k detailed coefficients are given in the si supplementary table s5 3 5 implications in practical water applications this study brings a geographical perspective to microbial community structure of point of use tap water supplied by municipal distribution systems across 8 districts in beijing although various source waters surface water and ground water were employed general similarities at the phylum level were observed among the collected samples in disparate systems indicating that proteobacteria was the dominant bacteria fig 2 in particular the differences in microbial communities and physico chemical properties of tap water impacted by pipe building age was further revealed in contrast to previous studies where this was neglected inkinen et al 2014 pinto et al 2014 however the characteristics of plumbing systems are key factors responsible for the end of use tap water quality particles and planktonic organisms flushed out from biofilms associated with aging pipes always pollute original clean water holinger et al 2014 herein we found that bacterial abundance was closely linked to the age of pipes fig 3c however the similarity of bacterial community among the tested samples was determined by the source of tap water fig 3a moreover water chemistry also shapes the structure of microbial community fig 7a and b and the relevant parameters e g concentrations of certain metal ions were found to be indicative of specific bacterial abundance fig 7c therefore an evaluation of the water physico chemical properties and microbial communities and their underlying interactions was conducted which suggested selective micro ecosystems harbored in the aging pipes although continuing efforts are made to improve the public satisfaction of tap water it remains difficult to guarantee the availability of clean and safe drinking water the development of network monitoring and analysis in recent years is proving to be beneficial to this issue and technology relating to exploiting big data has been successfully applied in several environmental research areas for example li et al 2020 implemented an intelligent technique to monitor lagoon water quality by applying machine learning algorithms based on the spectra of collected samples similarly machine learning based on big data has been extensively employed in pollutant removal efficiency hou et al 2018 surface water quality prediction chen et al 2020 and burst locations in water distribution networks zhou et al 2019 inspired by the above mentioned advances in this study we propose a feasible approach for obtaining information regarding tap water quality a schematic of an intelligent analysis process is shown in fig 8 a which includes the collection of tap water filtered membranes feature extraction model construction and prediction specifically 14 images of finished membranes using samples from surface water were randomly selected and the extracted rgb values were adopted as input features for building models in which pipe age toc value and ca2 mg2 concentration were used as target variables respectively in general our results showed that image analysis of filtered membranes whose color varied with the nature of the sample was able to provide a reasonable prediction of pipe age organic matter concentration indicated by toc value ca2 and mg2 concentration i e hardness of water as presented in fig 8b and c respectively it s worth noting that accuracy of the predicted values of pipe age and toc was better than that of ca2 mg2 concentrations the strong binding ability of organic matter with ca2 and mg2 yan and korshin 2014 might be a critical factor which contributes to models prediction e g ca2 mg2 concentrations in contrast fe3 with its yellow red color can act as a color developing agent on the filtered membranes and thus it can be indicative of other water parameters such as toc concentration the corresponding process is presented schematically in the si supplementary fig 8 this innovative finding can be employed at point of use sites by the public whereby a tailor made membrane filter can be connected to a faucet for 10 min flushing and an image of the membrane captured easily by a smartphone and then uploaded to the cloud for analysis using algorithms built previously thus the public can be able to gain more information about their tap water and water utilities able to use the data to locate aging pipes for subsequent maintenance using a similar approach jin et al 2018 developed an on line imaging based technique for the rapid and accurate identification and enumeration of cynobacteria this method is recognized as a cost effective and rapid approach for watershed management and potable water production moreover the prediction accuracy of the method can be further improved with the collection of more water quality data and thus this novel method can be a cost saving and efficient monitoring tool not only for the public but also for regulatory bodies and water suppliers 4 conclusions in this study the physico chemical and microbiological characteristics of point of use tap water were evaluated with samples collected across different districts in beijing china in particular plumbing age was technically hypothesized as a major factor which may determine the tap water quality several laboratory measurement techniques combined with optical analysis of membrane filters after sample treatment were also applied the main findings of the study are as follows the nature of bacterial communities of point of use tap water is mainly determined by the water source i e groundwater river water the variability of bacteria represented by otu is significantly influenced by plumbing age specifically the statistical number of otus in buildings with a pipe age 15 years was 1469 which was much greater than that in buildings with a pipe age 15 years 674 the metal ion composition of tap water greatly contributes to shaping the properties of bacterial communities the total concentration of metals in groundwater sourced samples was clearly higher than river sourced samples it was found that ca2 and mg2 concentrations were well correlated the membrane filters after sample treatment were photographed and the images can be employed to give useful information regarding the building pipe age etc during which fe based oxides as a chromogenic reagent played an important role in predicting indexes with more data collection this methodology could be employed practically to locate aging pipelines quickly and beneficially for pipe systems lacking the relevant technical records declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal

15482,the integration of uv sulfite autoxidation process usap i e uv activation of sulfite in the presence of 5 10 mg l o2 into conventional water to degrade micropollutants rises extensive attention but its impact on water quality and especially the formation of disinfection byproducts is still unclear herein the formation of dibromoacetonitrile dban from bromate bro3 upon treatment with usap followed by chlorination was evaluated in the presence of amino acids aas selected as representative organic matter in drinking water results revealed that hydrated electrons eaq produced during usap contribute to the reduction of bro3 to br which is then converted into hbro bro during post chlorination at the same time sulfate radicals so4 and hydroxyl radicals oh generated in usap mediated aas

et al 2020 wu et al 2021a during radical transformation steps the content of do dominates the distribution of radicals in uv sulfite process chen et al 2021b do in excess may completely oxidize eaq h and so3 to so4 oh and o2 making uv sulfite to be an advanced oxidation process in contrast in insufficient do or do free conditions uv sulfite which only produces eaq h and so3 is definitely an advanced reduction process wu et al 2021a under typical water treatment conditions with do content of 5 10 mg l it is reported that eaq h so3 so4 oh and o2 may coexist making uv sulfite a process with multiple radicals and possibly degrading a variety of organic contaminants cao et al 2021a 2021b liu et al 2021 zhang et al 2021 this treatment technology is also called uv sulfite autoxidation

2020 actually studies have reported that the reduction of bro3 by zero valent iron enhances the formation of brominated dbps during post chlorination wu et al 2021b in our previous study we also found that uv sulfite treatment of bro3 under do free conditions induces haloacetonitriles formation chen et al 2022 however when the uv sulfite process is used under typical water treatment conditions the effect of usap treatment of bro3 on the formation of brominated n dbps has never been studied this study selected dibromoacetonitrile dban as a typical brominated n dbp to investigate its formation mechanism from bro3 during the usap followed by chlorination dban is the most prevalent and most toxic species among the brominated n dbps reported to date chen et al 2019 besides amino acids aas which featured high dban formation potential and are significant components in drinking water were selected as representative compounds for organic matter zhang et al 2019b the main objectives of this study were 1 to investigate the effects of usap treatment of bro3 on the formation of dban during post chlorination 2 to evaluate the underlying stepwise conversion mechanisms from bro3 to dban 3 to illustrate the effect of different factors including usap treatment time initial concentrations of bro3 and aas ph and real water matrices on the formation of dban and 4 to assess the toxic risk of

a heating rate of 40 c min and held for 2 min the detection port temperature was set at 300 c and the sample injection volume was 2 μl to evaluate the repeatability and reproducibility for dban detection recovery of aqueous substrate n 6 was calculated from spiked samples 1 μg l of water and the acquisition sequence was repeated in different days the repeatability and reproducibility were determined to be 93 76 3 49 and 96 31 5 84 respectively electron spin resonance esr spectroscopy to determine the formation of reactive species was recorded on a emx 10 12 esr spectrometer bruker germany 5 5 dimethyl 1 pyrroline n oxide dmpo was used as a spin trapping agent the operating parameters were as follows center field of 3320 gs scan width of 500 gs microwave frequency of 10 mw sweep time of 60 s and modulation amplitude of 2 gs the concentration of alanine ala was measured using a high performance liquid chromatograph hplc agilent 1260 equipped with a 1260 diode array detector at detection wavelength of 338 nm ying et al 2016 before measurement ala was firstly derivatized with benzaldehyde solution according to previous literature lindroth et al 1979 ala was separated on an eclipse xbd c18 column 4 6 mm 150 mm 5 μm the mobile phase was a mixture of methanol and water 30 70 v v at a flow rate of 0 2 ml min the column temperature was 34 5 c and the sample injection volume was 20 μl the organic acids including acetic acid and pyruvate produced from ala were detected at the wavelength of 210 nm and the hplc operating parameters were the same as above apart from the mobile phase being a mixture of acetonitrile and n octylamine at ph 6 8 in water the retention times of acetic acid and pyruvate were 9 3 min and 7 6 min respectively gc mass spectrometry gc ms 6890b 5977a agilent equipped with a fused capillary column db 5 60 m 0 25 mm 0 25 μm was used to identify the ala transformation products formed during usap treatment the ala transformation byproducts were

time of 20 min extraction time of 20 min the gc oven temperature was programmed from 60 to 220 c at a heating rate of 5 c min and the injector and detector temperature were set at 220 and 250 c respectively the carrier gas he flow rate was 0 7 ml min the mass spectra were obtained using ei ionization at 70 ev and the ion source temperature was maintained at 250 c adamiec et al 2001 the concentration of sulfite was measured with a uv spectrophotometer using the 5 5 dithiobis 2 nitrobenzoic acid dtnb method as described in the literature humphrey et al 1970 the concentrations of br and bro3 were determined using ion chromatography ic dionex ics 2100 equipped with a conductivity detector dionex aces 300 qiao et al 2019 the toc content was measured on a model 1030 toc analyzer from oianaltica nh4 n no3 and no2 were analyzed following standard methods spea of china 2002 the energetics of the hydrogen abstraction reaction between so4 and oh with ala were calculated using density functional theory dft calculations with the gaussian 09 program the geometries of all the substances were optimized using the m06 2x 6 31 g method single point energies were calculated using the m06 2x 6 311 g method based on the optimized structures and the smd model was used to assess the solvent effect all of the transition state species have only one imaginary frequency and no imaginary vibrational frequency for each local minimum 3 results and discussion 3 1 formation of dban during different treatment scenarios as shown in fig s3 and fig 1 a the formation of dban from br and bro3 during different treatment processes was investigated in the presence of typical aas i e ala tyr asp as well as the three mixed aas i e mixture with equal mass ratios of the 3 aas respectively without pretreatment addition of chlorine to br in the presence of typical aas could give different yields of dban while no dban was produced from addition of chlorine to bro3 the results can be attributed to the fact that 1 br is oxidized by hclo to form hbro bro which rapidly reacts with the aas to give different yields of brominated dbps including dban yields are aa dependent because the different side chain groups in the aas would affect their activity in the bromine substitution reaction jia et al 2016 wang et al 2014 and 2 the stable bro3 species will not react with the aas to form dban or be transformed into hbro bro upon reaction with hclo when uv irradiation or sulfite reduction was introduced the formation of dban from bro3 was observed instead these results may be due to the fact that either uv photolysis or sulfite reduction of bro3 can generate br eqs 8 10 making it possible to form hbro bro during post chlorination qiao et al 2019 interestingly when usap was introduced as a pretreatment process 8 4 2 9 3 3 and 6 4 μg l of dban was formed from bro3 in the presence of ala tyr asp and the mixed aas respectively it should be acknowledged that subjecting bro3 to usap produces 3 times more br into post chlorination when compared to uv alone or sulfite alone fig s4 however the formation of dban via usap was 12 5 28 0 times higher when compared to that by uv or sulfite which is much higher than the increase in proportion with the produced br bromide utilization factor buf was further used to indicate the percentage of generated br utilized to form dban eq 11 zhang et al 2019a as shown in fig 1b usap treatment led to a significant increase in buf values for dban formation from bro3 in the presence of aas besides buf values for usap treatment of bro3 in the presence of aas followed by chlorination were 1 6 4 7 times higher than that for usap treatment of bro3 followed by chlorination in the presence of aas where aas were added only after the usap step fig s5 together with the fact that the formation of dban from br during usap treatment in the presence of aas was also enhanced when compared to those samples treated by uv irradiation or sulfite reduction fig s3 it can be inferred that aas may be transformed in usap to give precursors that are more prone to incorporate bromine to further analyze the source of bromine during the formation of dban the formation of dban from usap followed by chlorination was compared with a treatment where chlorination was replaced by incubation as shown in fig s6 no dban was detected during usap treatment of bro3 followed by 24 h incubation in the dark this indicates that hbro bro formed from the reaction between chlorine and generated br was key to the formation of dban hbro bro was not observed which was also reflected by the mass balance of bromine between bro3 and br in fig s4 in usap due to its fast reaction with excess sulfite k 1 0 109 m 1s 1 wang et al 2012 on the contrary hbro bro reacts much more slowly with aas k 103 106 m 1s 1 heeb et al 2014 which further verifies the negligible role of hbro bro as reactive intermediate species in usap overall the reduction of bro3 in usap generated br which was converted into hbro bro during post chlorination meanwhile usap transformed aas into precursors that more readily reacted with hbro bro to form dban 8 b r o 3 h v b r o

from bro3 3 2 1 reactive species mediated mechanism as shown in fig s7a no esr signal was observed during sulfite treatment while a clear four line spectrum with 1 1 1 1 intensity was observed during usap corresponding to the dmpo so3 adduct zamora and villamena 2012 h did not occur indicating that h did not exist in the usap at neutral condition chu et al 2021 besides the typical peaks corresponding to the dmpo so4 and dmpo oh adducts were observed proving the formation of so4 and oh in usap qiao et al 2019 tetranitroblue tetrazolium chloride nbt has been widely used for the detection of o2 because it could react with o2 to form the specific mono formazan organics which have the largest molar absorption coefficient at the wavelength of 530 nm ɛ530 15 000 m 1cm 1 hayyan et al 2016 as shown in fig s7b a characteristic peak at wavelength of 255 nm was observed for solely nbt solution while a peak at wavelength of 530 nm appeared when nbt was added to usap indicating the formation of o2 in usap the gradually decreased concentration of do fig s8 also supports the generation of so4 oh and o2 because 1 so3 reacts with do with a second order reaction rate constant of 2 5 109 m 1s 1 to form so4 and oh eqs 3 5 2 eaq reacts with do with a second order reaction rate constant of 1 9 1010 m 1s 1 to form o2 eq 6 brandt and eldik 1995 to better explore the mechanism of the reactive species in usap that induce the formation of dban from bro3 ala was selected as the representative aa for further investigation because of its simple structure and wide distribution in drinking water scavenging tests were carried out using no3 superoxide dismutase sod etoh and tba as quenchers for eaq o2 so4 and oh and oh respectively no3 is capable to quench eaq with a second order rate constant of 9 7 109 m 1s 1 xiao et al 2017b and the reactivity of no3 with o2 so4 and oh is much lower than that with eaq seid et al 2020 sod can be used as a quencher for o2 in the presence of eaq so4 and oh because sod is an enzyme which carries out catalytic decomposition of o2 chu et al 2021 fang et al 2013 as shown in fig 2 a and b with the addition of no3 sod etoh and tba the removal of bro3 in the presence of ala followed pseudo first order kinetics with reaction rate constants of 0 0020 min 1 0 0281 min 1 0 0460 min 1 0 0343 min 1 respectively whereas the removal of solely bro3 during usap followed pseudo first order kinetics with reaction rate constants of 0 0020 min 1 0 0294 min 1 0 0567 min 1 0 0388 min 1 upon addition of no3 sod etoh and tba respectively fig s9a and b it could be seen that the removal rate of bro3 with ala upon addition of no3 was almost equal to that without ala suggesting that eaq only played a role in the removal of bro3 during usap this may be because the second order reaction rate constant of eaq with bro3 was 3 4 109 m 1s 1 buxton et al 1988 which is much higher than that with ala 5 8 106 m 1s 1 thogersen et al 2017 the addition of sod showed little effect on the removal rate of bro3 no matter in the presence of ala or not indicating that o2 played negligible role in the removal of bro3 however with the addition of etoh and tba the presence of ala promoted the removal of bro3 demonstrating that ala would compete with br for so4 and oh and would therefore retard the secondary formation of bro3 the degradation efficiency of ala in the presence of bro3 with the addition of different quenchers is shown in fig 2c and d the addition of no3 and sod had no effect on ala degradation further demonstrating that eaq would preferentially react with bro3 while o2 played negligible role in the degradation of ala with the addition of etoh and tba the degradation rate constants of ala in the presence of bro3 decreased from 0 0370 min 1 to 0 006 min 1 and 0 0108 min 1 respectively this revealed that so4 and oh dominated the degradation of ala when bro3 was present with oh exhibiting a more pronounced effect than so4 overall the above results suggest that eaq would be completely used for the reduction of bro3 without any effect on the degradation of ala o2 showed no effect on either the removal of bro3 or the degradation of ala while so4 and oh contributed to the degradation of ala in the presence of bro3 3 2 2 dban formation pathway the evolutions of toc nh4 n and organic acids e g acetic acid and pyruvic acid during ala degradation in usap treatment of bro3 were measured as shown in fig s10a ala was degraded from 3 mg c l to 1 38 mg c l within 20 min while toc content was almost unchanged during the treatment this suggested that ala during usap mainly produced other organics rather than being mineralized into co2 and h2o as shown in fig s10b during the degradation of ala the productions of nh4 n acetic acid and pyruvic acid were 0 467 mg l 0 93 mg l and 0 36 mg l respectively at 20 min reaction time based on the carbon conservation principle the produced acetic acid and pyruvic acid account for only 33 2 of the overall organics produced by ala degradation during usap besides the nh4 n produced also only accounts for 33 0 of the nitrogen content in ala these findings suggest that the other organics produced from ala degradation during usap may be dominated by organic nitrogen those nitrogenous organic intermediates were possibly responsible for the enhanced formation of dban to further investigate the precursors more prone to form dban the products formed from ala during usap treatment of bro3 were identified using gc ms figs s11a and s12 hn c ch3 cooh ch3 ch nh and ch3 cn were detected which have similarly been reported in previous study using oh to degrade ala ying et al 2016 the evolution profiles of the three intermediates formed during usap show that they both initially accumulated and then degraded fig s11b indicating their potential to form dban during subsequent bromination the conversion of aas to hans through halogenation reaction has been fully investigated by many researchers and can be summarized in scheme s1 chu et al 2010 jia et al 2016 accordingly the transformation pathway of ala to dban via bromination could be presented as scheme s2 interestingly it was found that the three intermediates were the structural analogues of transformation products t2 t4 and t3 in the transformation pathway of ala to dban via bromination therefore it can be inferred that ala degradation during usap produces hn c ch3 cooh ch3 ch nh and ch3 cn which shortens the reaction pathway of dban formation during bromination and increases the buf values as well as enhancing the formation of dban furthermore dft was used to calculate the energetic feasibility of reactions of so4 and oh with ala to form hn c ch3 cooh ch3 ch nh and ch3 cn in usap the subsequent bromination of hn c ch3 cooh ch3 ch nh and ch3 cn to form dban and a comparison to the energy scale of ala transformed to dban during the direct bromination as shown in fig 3 a the stepwise bromination of ala to dban was thermodynamically accessible with a negative total gibbs free energy change of 146 73 kcal mol 1 hydrogen abstraction is reported to be the major oxidation mechanism for oxidative radicals with organic matter including alkynes aliphatic alcohols and aas lee et al 2020 merenyi and lind 1994 ying et al 2016 which generate their dehydrogenation intermediates the possible hydrogen extraction sites of ala are the α hydrogen atom located on ch β hydrogen atom located on ch3 and hydrogen atom located on nh2 respectively with reported transformation pathway shown in scheme s3 ying et al 2016 the α hydrogen abstraction reaction of ala leads to the formation of a transient radical h2n c ch3 cooh which can be dehydrogenated to form hn c ch3 cooh ying et al 2016 the subsequent bromination of hn c ch3 cooh results in the formation of dban via decarboxylation and substitution as shown in fig 3b the feasibility of so4 and oh mediated α hydrogen abstraction follows the order of so4 oh with an activation energy barrier δ g of 2 75 and 9 63 kcal mol 1 respectively the reduction in the relative gibbs free energy reveals the stepwise transformation of ala to hn c ch3 cooh during usap and hn c ch3 cooh to dban during bromination were thermodynamically favorable the other pathway hydrogen abstraction from nh2 to produce hn ch ch3 cooh which undergoes decarboxylation and further dehydrogenation to generate ch3 cn during usap ying et al 2016 followed by bromination of ch3 cn to form dban was also thermodynamically favorable fig 3c so4 and oh have positive effects during the hydrogen abstraction reaction of nh2 in ala with δ g of 5 64 and 3 95 kcal mol 1 respectively the β hydrogen atom abstraction reaction is beyond the discussion in this study because it produces vinylamine h2n ch ch which is not capable of forming dban during bromination in summary the results obtained during our gc ms analysis as well as dft calculations illustrate that so4 and oh mainly mediate two hydrogen abstraction pathways α hydrogen abstraction and hydrogen abstraction from nh2 which produce hn c ch3 cooh ch3 ch nh and ch3 cn and form dban during subsequent bromination hence hn c ch3 cooh ch3 ch nh and ch3 cn may exhibit higher buf values than ala and therefore favor the formation of dban 3 3 the effect of usap treatment time bro3 concentration ala concentration ph and real water matrix on the formation of dban five factors that may influence the formation of dban were investigated usap treatment time 10 20 and 30 min bro3 concentration 5 20 and 50 μm ala concentration 0 3 and 6 mg c l ph 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 0 and 9 0 and real water matrix ozone biological activated carbon o3 bac effluents as shown in fig 4 a 3 2 8 4 and 5 9 μg l of dban were generated at usap treatment times of 10 20 and 30 min respectively the trend observed for the formation of dban was consistent with that observed for the evolution of hn c ch3 cooh ch3 ch nh and ch3 cn fig s11b although the amount of generated br gradually increased with usap treatment time the buf value exhibited a similar trend to that observed for the formation of hn c ch3 cooh ch3 ch nh and ch3 cn the buf value was 0 00503 at usap treatment time of 10 min it reached its highest value 0 00898 at 20 min and then decreased to 0 00539 at 30 min fig s13a obviously upon increasing usap treatment time from 0 to 20 min the precursors e g hn c ch3 cooh ch3 ch nh and ch3 cn accumulated leading to an increased buf value and hence to enhanced formation of dban further increasing the pretreatment time to 30 min may result in the elimination of hn c ch3 cooh ch3 ch nh and ch3 cn to as previously reported aldehydes acetic acids ammonia etc leitner et al 2002 ying et al 2016 the effects of the initial bro3 concentration and ala concentration upon usap treatment for 20 min on the formation of dban are illustrated in fig 4b upon fixing the ala concentration at 3 mg c l the formation of dban significantly increased from 3 8 to 8 4 μg l when the initial bro3 concentration increased from 5 to 20 μm and then slightly increased to 8 8 μg l at 50 μm bro3 this was attributed to more br being generated during usap which was transformed into hbro bro during chlorination similar results have also been reported which show that the formation of dban increases to some extent with the br concentration during chlorination roccaro et al 2013 however the buf values showed a completely opposite trend they continuously decreased from 0 0134 to 0 0038 upon increasing the bro3 concentration from 5 to 50 μm fig s13b as a potential explanation the increased initial concentration of bro3 absorbs a greater portion of uv light which in turn interferes with the activation of sulfite nawaz et al 2017 and consequently hinders the degradation of ala to hn c ch3 cooh ch3 ch nh and ch3 cn the ala concentration determines the amounts of hn c ch3 cooh ch3 ch nh and ch3 cn formed during usap at a fixed bro3 concentration of 20 μm therefore increasing the initial ala concentration from 0 to 6 mg c l increases the formation of dban as well as the buf value figs 4b and s13b as ph is an important factor affecting not only usap treatment but also the formation of n dbps during chlorination the reaction ph in the range of 5 0 9 0 was investigated the production of br from bro3 was promoted upon increasing the ph during usap fig 4c this was attributed to the different sulfite species formed under different ph conditions fig 14a i e hso3 is the dominant species at ph 5 0 6 0 hso3 and so3 2 coexist at ph 6 0 8 0 and so3 2 is dominant at ph 8 0 9 0 which result in a different primary content of eaq i e eaq was formed in lower quantities at ph 5 0 8 0 and in higher amounts at ph 8 0 9 0 which affects the reduction efficiency of bro3 li et al 2012 interestingly the formation of dban was increased in a more pronounced way than the generation of br upon increasing the ph from 5 0 to 9 0 fig 4c this was attributed to 1 so3 production is enhanced with increasing ph due to the fact that the quantum yield for the formation of so3 under uv irradiation of sulfite increases with increasing ph fig s14b and 2 enhanced formation of so3 induces the production of a larger amount of so4 and oh eqs 8 10 therefore favoring the conversion of ala into hn c ch3 cooh ch3 ch nh and ch3 cn finally boosting the formation of dban during post chlorination this was also supported by the increasing buf values observed upon increasing the ph fig s13c as for the disinfection hbro with a high pka of 8 7 will dominate in bromination reaction hbro bro over a ph range of 5 0 9 0 liu et al 2018 therefore hbro favors the formation of dban in the ph range of 5 0 to 9 0 although dban is more easily hydrolyzed at higher ph gao et al 2020 this issue clearly cannot counteract the enhanced formation of dban caused by the conversion of ala into hn c ch3 cooh ch3 ch nh and ch3 cn and the increased generation of br two o3 bac effluents were used as representative water backgrounds to investigate the formation of dban from bro3 during usap treatment in real water followed by chlorination and compared to that using ultrapure water spiked with ala the basic water qualities of the two o3 bac effluents named as effluent a and effluent b are shown in table s2 compared with effluent b effluent a featured higher contents of organic matter and no3 as a result the production of br in effluent b 9 3 μm during usap was higher than that in effluent a 7 8 μm fig 4d nevertheless the dban formation from effluent a was higher than that from effluent b mainly because the higher content of organic matter in effluent a provided more precursors which favored dban formation consistent with the trend observed for buf values in the corresponding water samples fig s13d the formations of dban in effluent a 4 3 μg l and effluent b 3 0 μg l were both significantly lower than that in ala spiked ultrapure water 8 4 μg l fig 4d however due to the high toxicity of dban its formation from bro3 during usap treatment of real waters followed by chlorination should not be ignored 3 4 comprehensive toxicity assessment during usap treatment followed by chlorination in view of the above results usap treatment has a high risk of dban formation from bro3 in the presence of aas aas have been proven to be the most typical precursors of cx3r type n dbps yu and reckhow 2020 zhang et al 2019b accordingly the formation of cx3r type n dbps including four hans four hacams and four hnms from bro3 during the usap treatment in the presence of ala were measured to determine the potential risk of usap during practical applications as shown in fig s15 chlorination of ala in the presence of bro3 only formed chlorinated cx3r type n dbps with formation potential following the order of dcan tcan dcacam tcacam and tcnm dcnm with the introduction of usap treatment the formation of chlorinated cx3r type n dbps were reduced by 49 2 however all of the brominated cx3r type n dbps were generated with total concentration of 29 3 μg l accounting for 36 5 of cx3r type n dbps by weight this may bring a higher potential risk considering the several orders of magnitude higher toxicity of brominated cx3r type n dbps compared to their chlorinated analogues kali et al 2021 muellner et al 2007 due to the different degrees of cx3r type n dbp formation from bro3 during usap treatment in the presence of ala whether bro3 was converted into cx3r type n dbps to contribute to the increase in the toxicity was evaluated dbp associated additive toxicity and specifically the toxicity index ti which was obtained by dividing the measured dbp concentrations by the lc50 determined in chinese hamster ovary cell toxicological assays table s3 was calculated to estimate the contributions of cx3r type n dbps to the non specific toxicity of the treated water samples chuang and mitch 2017 as shown in fig 5 the ti value 0 0282 was dominated by bro3 and chlorinated cx3r type n dbps in the case without usap treatment when usap was applied although the toxicity of bro3 and chlorinated cx3r type n dbps reduced by 63 5 after post chlorination the ti value increased by 1 5 fold because of the formation of brominated cx3r type n dbps note that the toxicity of the formed brominated cx3r type n dbps contributed to 63 2 of the comprehensive toxicity suggesting that the application of usap requires a trade off when bro3 occurs in the water source due to the high risk of the formation of brominated cx3r type n dbps during post chlorination 4 conclusions the formation of dban from bro3 during usap treatment in the presence of aas followed by chlorination was investigated the following main results were demonstrated in the research i the reductive eaq produced in usap is exclusively responsible for the removal of bro3 producing br that is finally converted into hbro bro during post chlorination meanwhile usap also produced so4 and oh under do atmosphere which mediate the transformation of ala to form hn c ch3 cooh ch3 ch nh and ch3 cn via α hydrogen abstraction and nh2 hydrogen abstraction reactions ii the hn c ch3 cooh ch3 ch nh and ch3 cn occurring in the chlorination step increase the buf value and hence promote the formation of dban iii the formation of dban was significantly affected by usap treatment time ala and bro3 concentrations ph and components of real water matrices although the presence of organic matter and no3 retarded the production of br organic matter can still promote dban formation by providing more precursors iv although bro3 and chlorinated cx3r type n dbps can be effectively controlled by usap the increased toxicity observed during the subsequent chlorination due to the formation of brominated cx3r type n dbps is a great challenge implying that the application of usap requires a trade off declaration of competing interest we declare that we

15482,the integration of uv sulfite autoxidation process usap i e uv activation of sulfite in the presence of 5 10 mg l o2 into conventional water to degrade micropollutants rises extensive attention but its impact on water quality and especially the formation of disinfection byproducts is still unclear herein the formation of dibromoacetonitrile dban from bromate bro3 upon treatment with usap followed by chlorination was evaluated in the presence of amino acids aas selected as representative organic matter in drinking water results revealed that hydrated electrons eaq produced during usap contribute to the reduction of bro3 to br which is then converted into hbro bro during post chlorination at the same time sulfate radicals so4 and hydroxyl radicals oh generated in usap mediated aas conversion via α hydrogen abstraction and nh2 hydrogen abstraction reactions to produce hn c ch3 cooh ch3 ch nh and ch3 cn which are released into the post chlorination stage and therefore enhance the bromine utilization factor buf value and dban formation the effects of the usap treatment time bro3 concentration aa concentration ph and real waters were also evaluated although 63 5 of bro3 was eliminated by usap followed by chlorination the toxicity index ti was increased by 1 5 fold due to the formation of the all brominated cx3r type nitrogenous disinfection byproducts n dbps

10 ug l by who standards and usepa guidelines fang and shang 2012 it can be unavoidably formed in bromide containing water treated by oxidation during drinking water treatment process li et al 2015 once formed bro3 would be recalcitrant to removal by conventional drinking water treatment processes olsinska 2017 in some regions the occurrence of bro3 in drinking water was reported to be as high as 66 ug l wu et al 2021b as a highly reactive process uv sulfite treatment for bro3 removal raises great attention and wide application xiao et al 2017a 2017b during uv sulfite treatment hydrated electrons eaq hydrogen radicals h and sulfite radicals so3 would be produced eqs 1 and 2 and jointly contribute to the reduction of bro3 to br with remarkable efficiency xiao et al 2017c recently researchers found that dissolved oxygen do in water may be participate in the oxidation of eaq h and so3 to form sulfate radicals so4 hydroxyl radicals oh and superoxide anion radicals o2 eqs 3 6 seid et al 2020 wu et al 2021a during radical transformation steps the content of do dominates the distribution of radicals in uv sulfite process chen et al 2021b do in excess may completely oxidize eaq h and so3 to so4 oh and o2 making uv sulfite to be an advanced oxidation process in contrast in insufficient do or do free conditions uv sulfite which only produces eaq h and so3 is definitely an advanced reduction process wu et al 2021a under typical water treatment conditions with do content of 5 10 mg l it is reported that eaq h so3 so4 oh and o2 may coexist making uv sulfite a process with multiple radicals and possibly degrading a variety of organic contaminants cao et al 2021a 2021b liu et al 2021 zhang et al 2021 this treatment technology is also called uv sulfite autoxidation process usap although the presence of do under typical water treatment conditions quenches eaq h and so3 to some extent the usap in pilot scale experiments confirmed excellent removal efficiency

dbps c dbps and nitrogenous dbps n dbps chen et al 2020 among n dbps haloacetonitriles hans associated with highly adverse health effects and frequent occurrence in drinking water triggered special concern kali et al 2021 while usap is applied to bro3 removal br can be produced and organic matter including n dbps precursors degradation may be simultaneously promoted via radical chemistry this may have significant impacts on the formation of brominated n dbps during chlorination e g reactive bromine species may be incorporated into n dbp precursors to form toxic brominated n dbps wang et al 2020 actually studies have reported that the reduction of bro3 by zero valent iron enhances the formation of brominated dbps during post chlorination wu et al 2021b in our previous study we also found that uv sulfite treatment of bro3 under do free conditions induces haloacetonitriles formation chen et al 2022 however when the uv sulfite process is used under typical water treatment conditions the effect of usap treatment of bro3 on the formation of brominated n dbps has never been studied this study selected dibromoacetonitrile dban as a typical brominated n dbp to investigate its formation mechanism from bro3 during the usap followed by chlorination dban is the most prevalent and most toxic species among the brominated n dbps reported to date chen et al 2019 besides amino acids aas which featured high dban formation potential and are significant components in drinking water were selected as representative compounds for organic matter zhang et al 2019b the main objectives of this study were 1 to investigate the effects of usap treatment of bro3 on the formation of dban during post chlorination 2 to evaluate the underlying stepwise conversion mechanisms from bro3 to dban 3 to illustrate the effect of different factors including usap treatment time initial concentrations of bro3 and aas ph and real water matrices on the formation of dban and 4 to assess the toxic risk of potential n dbps formed during the treatment of bro3 in usap this study is an important contribution to the understanding of the risk of applying advanced technologies 2 materials and methods 2 1

sulfite solution was added and the resulting mixture was immediately exposed to uv irradiation after uv irradiation for a specified time 20 min the residual sulfite in the solution was measured and a stoichiometric amount of potassium persulfate was added to remove the residual sulfite eq 7 the major product so4 2 would have no effect on the subsequent chlorination step gao et al 2019 subsequently 200 μm of chlorine was dosed into the solution for dban formation test the dban formation test was conducted in triplicate in 50 ml headspace free screw cap amber glass vials with ptfe lined septa in the dark for 24 h at 25 1 c the residual disinfectant was quenched using a stoichiometric amount of ascorbic acid and the as formed dban was measured as soon as possible 7 s o 3 2 s 2 o 8 2 h 2 o 3 s

tert butyl ether mtbe the detection was performed using gas chromatography gc agilent 7890b coupled with a micro electron capture detector μ ecd dban was separated on a rtx 5 column 30 m 0 25 mm 0 25 μm agilent usa the injection port temperature was 200 c the initial oven temperature was held at 35 c for 10 min ramped to 72 c at a heating rate of 14 c min and held for 1 min then ramped to 200 c at a heating rate of 40 c min and held for 2 min the detection port temperature was set at 300 c and the sample injection volume was 2 μl to evaluate the repeatability and reproducibility for dban detection recovery of aqueous substrate n 6 was calculated from spiked samples 1 μg l of water and the acquisition sequence was repeated in different days the repeatability and reproducibility were determined to be 93 76 3 49 and 96 31 5 84 respectively electron spin resonance esr spectroscopy to determine the formation of reactive species was recorded on a emx 10 12 esr spectrometer bruker germany 5 5 dimethyl 1 pyrroline n oxide dmpo was used as a spin trapping agent the operating parameters were as follows center field of 3320 gs scan width of 500 gs microwave frequency of 10 mw sweep time of 60 s and modulation amplitude of 2 gs the concentration of alanine ala was measured using a high performance liquid chromatograph hplc agilent 1260 equipped with a 1260 diode array detector at detection wavelength of 338 nm ying et al 2016 before measurement ala was firstly derivatized with benzaldehyde solution according to previous literature lindroth et al 1979 ala was separated on an eclipse xbd c18 column 4 6 mm 150 mm 5 μm the mobile phase was a mixture of methanol and water 30 70 v v at a flow rate of 0 2 ml min the column temperature was 34 5 c and the sample injection volume was 20 μl the organic acids including acetic acid and pyruvate produced from ala were detected at the wavelength of 210 nm and the hplc operating parameters were the same as above apart from the mobile phase being a mixture of acetonitrile and n octylamine at ph 6 8 in water the retention times of acetic acid and pyruvate were 9 3 min and 7 6 min respectively gc mass spectrometry gc ms 6890b 5977a agilent equipped with a fused capillary column db 5 60 m 0 25 mm 0 25 μm was used to identify the ala transformation products formed during usap treatment the ala transformation byproducts were

time of 20 min extraction time of 20 min the gc oven temperature was programmed from 60 to 220 c at a heating rate of 5 c min and the injector and detector temperature were set at 220 and 250 c respectively the carrier gas he flow rate was 0 7 ml min the mass spectra were obtained using ei ionization at 70 ev and the ion source temperature was maintained at 250 c adamiec et al 2001 the concentration of sulfite was measured with a uv spectrophotometer using the 5 5 dithiobis 2 nitrobenzoic acid dtnb method as described in the literature humphrey et al 1970 the concentrations of br and bro3 were determined using ion chromatography ic dionex ics 2100 equipped with a conductivity detector dionex aces 300 qiao et al 2019 the toc content was measured on a model 1030 toc analyzer from oianaltica nh4 n no3 and no2 were analyzed following standard methods spea of china 2002 the energetics of the hydrogen abstraction reaction between so4 and oh with ala were calculated using density functional theory dft calculations with the gaussian 09 program the geometries of all the substances were optimized using the m06 2x 6 31 g method single point energies were calculated using the m06 2x 6 311 g method based on the optimized structures and the smd model was used to assess the solvent effect all of the transition state species have only one imaginary frequency and no imaginary vibrational frequency for each local minimum 3 results and discussion 3 1 formation of dban during different treatment scenarios as shown in fig s3 and fig 1 a the formation of dban from br and bro3 during different treatment processes was investigated in the presence of typical aas i e ala tyr asp as well as the three mixed aas i e mixture with equal mass ratios of the 3 aas respectively without pretreatment addition of chlorine to br in the presence of typical aas could give different yields of dban while no dban was produced from addition of chlorine to bro3 the results can be attributed to the fact that 1 br is oxidized by hclo to form hbro bro which rapidly reacts with the aas to give different yields of brominated dbps including dban yields are aa dependent because the different side chain groups in the aas would affect their activity in the bromine substitution reaction jia et al 2016 wang et al 2014 and 2 the stable bro3 species will not react with the aas to form dban or be transformed into hbro bro upon reaction with hclo when uv irradiation or sulfite reduction was introduced the formation of dban from bro3 was observed instead these results may be due to the fact that either uv photolysis or sulfite reduction of bro3 can generate br eqs 8 10 making it possible to form hbro bro during post chlorination qiao et al 2019 interestingly when usap was introduced as a pretreatment process 8 4 2 9 3 3 and 6 4 μg l of dban was formed from bro3 in the presence of ala tyr asp and the mixed aas respectively it should be acknowledged that subjecting bro3 to usap produces 3 times more br into post chlorination when compared to uv alone or sulfite alone fig s4 however the formation of dban via usap was 12 5 28 0 times higher when compared to that by uv or sulfite which is much higher than the increase in proportion with the produced br bromide utilization factor buf was further used to indicate the percentage of generated br utilized to form dban eq 11 zhang et al 2019a as shown in fig 1b usap treatment led to a significant increase in buf values for dban formation from bro3 in the presence of aas besides buf values for usap treatment of bro3 in the presence of aas followed by chlorination were 1 6 4 7 times higher than that for usap treatment of bro3 followed by chlorination in the presence of aas where aas were added only after the usap step fig s5 together with the fact that the formation of dban from br during usap treatment in the presence of aas was also enhanced when compared to those samples treated by uv irradiation or sulfite reduction fig s3 it can be inferred that aas may be transformed in usap to give precursors that are more prone to incorporate bromine to further analyze the source of bromine during the formation of dban the formation of dban from usap followed by chlorination was compared with a treatment where chlorination was replaced by incubation as shown in fig s6 no dban was detected during usap treatment of bro3 followed by 24 h incubation in the dark this indicates that hbro bro formed from the reaction between chlorine and generated br was key to the formation of dban hbro bro was not observed which was also reflected by the mass balance of bromine between bro3 and br in fig s4 in usap due to its fast reaction with excess sulfite k 1 0 109 m 1s 1 wang et al 2012 on the contrary hbro bro reacts much more slowly with aas k 103 106 m 1s 1 heeb et al 2014 which further verifies the negligible role of hbro bro as reactive intermediate species in usap overall the reduction of bro3 in usap generated br which was converted into hbro bro during post chlorination meanwhile usap transformed aas into precursors that more readily reacted with hbro bro to form dban 8 b r o 3 h v b r o

from bro3 3 2 1 reactive species mediated mechanism as shown in fig s7a no esr signal was observed during sulfite treatment while a clear four line spectrum with 1 1 1 1 intensity was observed during usap corresponding to the dmpo so3 adduct zamora and villamena 2012 h did not occur indicating that h did not exist in the usap at neutral condition chu et al 2021 besides the typical peaks corresponding to the dmpo so4 and dmpo oh adducts were observed proving the formation of so4 and oh in usap qiao et al 2019 tetranitroblue tetrazolium chloride nbt has been widely used for the detection of o2 because it could react with o2 to form the specific mono formazan organics which have the largest molar absorption coefficient at the wavelength of 530 nm ɛ530 15 000 m 1cm 1 hayyan et al 2016 as shown in fig s7b a characteristic peak at wavelength of 255 nm was observed for solely nbt solution while a peak at wavelength of 530 nm appeared when nbt was added to usap indicating the formation of o2 in usap the gradually decreased concentration of do fig s8 also supports the generation of so4 oh and o2 because 1 so3 reacts with do with a second order reaction rate constant of 2 5 109 m 1s 1 to form so4 and oh eqs 3 5 2 eaq reacts with do with a second order reaction rate constant of 1 9 1010 m 1s 1 to form o2 eq 6 brandt and eldik 1995 to better explore the mechanism of the reactive species in usap that induce the formation of dban from bro3 ala was selected as the representative aa for further investigation because of its simple structure and wide distribution in drinking water scavenging tests were carried out using no3 superoxide dismutase sod etoh and tba as quenchers for eaq o2 so4 and oh and oh respectively no3 is capable to quench eaq with a second order rate constant of 9 7 109 m 1s 1 xiao et al 2017b and the reactivity of no3 with o2 so4 and oh is much lower than that with eaq seid et al 2020 sod can be used as a quencher for o2 in the presence of eaq so4 and oh because sod is an enzyme which carries out catalytic decomposition of o2 chu et al 2021 fang et al 2013 as shown in fig 2 a and b with the addition of no3 sod etoh and tba the removal of bro3 in the presence of ala followed pseudo first order kinetics with reaction rate constants of 0 0020 min 1 0 0281 min 1 0 0460 min 1 0 0343 min 1 respectively whereas the removal of solely bro3 during usap followed pseudo first order kinetics with reaction rate constants of 0 0020 min 1 0 0294 min 1 0 0567 min 1 0 0388 min 1 upon addition of no3 sod etoh and tba respectively fig s9a and b it could be seen that the removal rate of bro3 with ala upon addition of no3 was almost equal to that without ala suggesting that eaq only played a role in the removal of bro3 during usap this may be because the second order reaction rate constant of eaq with bro3 was 3 4 109 m 1s 1 buxton et al 1988 which is much higher than that with ala 5 8 106 m 1s 1 thogersen et al 2017 the addition of sod showed little effect on the removal rate of bro3 no matter in the presence of ala or not indicating that o2 played negligible role in the removal of bro3 however with the addition of etoh and tba the presence of ala promoted the removal of bro3 demonstrating that ala would compete with br for so4 and oh and would therefore retard the secondary formation of bro3 the degradation efficiency of ala in the presence of bro3 with the addition of different quenchers is shown in fig 2c and d the addition of no3 and sod had no effect on ala degradation further demonstrating that eaq would preferentially react with bro3 while o2 played negligible role in the degradation of ala with the addition of etoh and tba the degradation rate constants of ala in the presence of bro3 decreased from 0 0370 min 1 to 0 006 min 1 and 0 0108 min 1 respectively this revealed that so4 and oh dominated the degradation of ala when bro3 was present with oh exhibiting a more pronounced effect than so4 overall the above results suggest that eaq would be completely used for the reduction of bro3 without any effect on the degradation of ala o2 showed no effect on either the removal of bro3 or the degradation of ala while so4 and oh contributed to the degradation of ala in the presence of bro3 3 2 2 dban formation pathway the evolutions of toc nh4 n and organic acids e g acetic acid and pyruvic acid during ala degradation in usap treatment of bro3 were measured as shown in fig s10a ala was degraded from 3 mg c l to 1 38 mg c l within 20 min while toc content was almost unchanged during the treatment this suggested that ala during usap mainly produced other organics rather than being mineralized into co2 and h2o as shown in fig s10b during the degradation of ala the productions of nh4 n acetic acid and pyruvic acid were 0 467 mg l 0 93 mg l and 0 36 mg l respectively at 20 min reaction time based on the carbon conservation principle the produced acetic acid and pyruvic acid account for only 33 2 of the overall organics produced by ala degradation during usap besides the nh4 n produced also only accounts for 33 0 of the nitrogen content in ala these findings suggest that the other organics produced from ala degradation during usap may be dominated by organic nitrogen those nitrogenous organic intermediates were possibly responsible for the enhanced formation of dban to further investigate the precursors more prone to form dban the products formed from ala during usap treatment of bro3 were identified using gc ms figs s11a and s12 hn c ch3 cooh ch3 ch nh and ch3 cn were detected which have similarly been reported in previous study using oh to degrade ala ying et al 2016 the evolution profiles of the three intermediates formed during usap show that they both initially accumulated and then degraded fig s11b indicating their potential to form dban during subsequent bromination the conversion of aas to hans through halogenation reaction has been fully investigated by many researchers and can be summarized in scheme s1 chu et al 2010 jia et al 2016 accordingly the transformation pathway of ala to dban via bromination could be presented as scheme s2 interestingly it was found that the three intermediates were the structural analogues of transformation products t2 t4 and t3 in the transformation pathway of ala to dban via bromination therefore it can be inferred that ala degradation during usap produces hn c ch3 cooh ch3 ch nh and ch3 cn which shortens the reaction pathway of dban formation during bromination and increases the buf values as well as enhancing the formation of dban furthermore dft was used to calculate the energetic feasibility of reactions of so4 and oh with ala to form hn c ch3 cooh ch3 ch nh and ch3 cn in usap the subsequent bromination of hn c ch3 cooh ch3 ch nh and ch3 cn to form dban and a comparison to the energy scale of ala transformed to dban during the direct bromination as shown in fig 3 a the stepwise bromination of ala to dban was thermodynamically accessible with a negative total gibbs free energy change of 146 73 kcal mol 1 hydrogen abstraction is reported to be the major oxidation mechanism for oxidative radicals with organic matter including alkynes aliphatic alcohols and aas lee et al 2020 merenyi and lind 1994 ying et al 2016 which generate their dehydrogenation intermediates the possible hydrogen extraction sites of ala are the α hydrogen atom located on ch β hydrogen atom located on ch3 and hydrogen atom located on nh2 respectively with reported transformation pathway shown in scheme s3 ying et al 2016 the α hydrogen abstraction reaction of ala leads to the formation of a transient radical h2n c ch3 cooh which can be dehydrogenated to form hn c ch3 cooh ying et al 2016 the subsequent bromination of hn c ch3 cooh results in the formation of dban via decarboxylation and substitution as shown in fig 3b the feasibility of so4 and oh mediated α hydrogen abstraction follows the order of so4 oh with an activation energy barrier δ g of 2 75 and 9 63 kcal mol 1 respectively the reduction in the relative gibbs free energy reveals the stepwise transformation of ala to hn c ch3 cooh during usap and hn c ch3 cooh to dban during bromination were thermodynamically favorable the other pathway hydrogen abstraction from nh2 to produce hn ch ch3 cooh which undergoes decarboxylation and further dehydrogenation to generate ch3 cn during usap ying et al 2016 followed by bromination of ch3 cn to form dban was also thermodynamically favorable fig 3c so4 and oh have positive effects during the hydrogen abstraction reaction of nh2 in ala with δ g of 5 64 and 3 95 kcal mol 1 respectively the β hydrogen atom abstraction reaction is beyond the discussion in this study because it produces vinylamine h2n ch ch which is not capable of forming dban during bromination in summary the results obtained during our gc ms analysis as well as dft calculations illustrate that so4 and oh mainly mediate two hydrogen abstraction pathways α hydrogen abstraction and hydrogen abstraction from nh2 which produce hn c ch3 cooh ch3 ch nh and ch3 cn and form dban during subsequent bromination hence hn c ch3 cooh ch3 ch nh and ch3 cn may exhibit higher buf values than ala and therefore favor the formation of dban 3 3 the effect of usap treatment time bro3 concentration ala concentration ph and real water matrix on the formation of dban five factors that may influence the formation of dban were investigated usap treatment time 10 20 and 30 min bro3 concentration 5 20 and 50 μm ala concentration 0 3 and 6 mg c l ph 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 0 and 9 0 and real water matrix ozone biological activated carbon o3 bac effluents as shown in fig 4 a 3 2 8 4 and 5 9 μg l of dban were generated at usap treatment times of 10 20 and 30 min respectively the trend observed for the formation of dban was consistent with that observed for the evolution of hn c ch3 cooh ch3 ch nh and ch3 cn fig s11b although the amount of generated br gradually increased with usap treatment time the buf value exhibited a similar trend to that observed for the formation of hn c ch3 cooh ch3 ch nh and ch3 cn the buf value was 0 00503 at usap treatment time of 10 min it reached its highest value 0 00898 at 20 min and then decreased to 0 00539 at 30 min fig s13a obviously upon increasing usap treatment time from 0 to 20 min the precursors e g hn c ch3 cooh ch3 ch nh and ch3 cn accumulated leading to an increased buf value and hence to enhanced formation of dban further increasing the pretreatment time to 30 min may result in the elimination of hn c ch3 cooh ch3 ch nh and ch3 cn to as previously reported aldehydes acetic acids ammonia etc leitner et al 2002 ying et al 2016 the effects of the initial bro3 concentration and ala concentration upon usap treatment for 20 min on the formation of dban are illustrated in fig 4b upon fixing the ala concentration at 3 mg c l the formation of dban significantly increased from 3 8 to 8 4 μg l when the initial bro3 concentration increased from 5 to 20 μm and then slightly increased to 8 8 μg l at 50 μm bro3 this was attributed to more br being generated during usap which was transformed into hbro bro during chlorination similar results have also been reported which show that the formation of dban increases to some extent with the br concentration during chlorination roccaro et al 2013 however the buf values showed a completely opposite trend they continuously decreased from 0 0134 to 0 0038 upon increasing the bro3 concentration from 5 to 50 μm fig s13b as a potential explanation the increased initial concentration of bro3 absorbs a greater portion of uv light which in turn interferes with the activation of sulfite nawaz et al 2017 and consequently hinders the degradation of ala to hn c ch3 cooh ch3 ch nh and ch3 cn the ala concentration determines the amounts of hn c ch3 cooh ch3 ch nh and ch3 cn formed during usap at a fixed bro3 concentration of 20 μm therefore increasing the initial ala concentration from 0 to 6 mg c l increases the formation of dban as well as the buf value figs 4b and s13b as ph is an important factor affecting not only usap treatment but also the formation of n dbps during chlorination the reaction ph in the range of 5 0 9 0 was investigated the production of br from bro3 was promoted upon increasing the ph during usap fig 4c this was attributed to the different sulfite species formed under different ph conditions fig 14a i e hso3 is the dominant species at ph 5 0 6 0 hso3 and so3 2 coexist at ph 6 0 8 0 and so3 2 is dominant at ph 8 0 9 0 which result in a different primary content of eaq i e eaq was formed in lower quantities at ph 5 0 8 0 and in higher amounts at ph 8 0 9 0 which affects the reduction efficiency of bro3 li et al 2012 interestingly the formation of dban was increased in a more pronounced way than the generation of br upon increasing the ph from 5 0 to 9 0 fig 4c this was attributed to 1 so3 production is enhanced with increasing ph due to the fact that the quantum yield for the formation of so3 under uv irradiation of sulfite increases with increasing ph fig s14b and 2 enhanced formation of so3 induces the production of a larger amount of so4 and oh eqs 8 10 therefore favoring the conversion of ala into hn c ch3 cooh ch3 ch nh and ch3 cn finally boosting the formation of dban during post chlorination this was also supported by the increasing buf values observed upon increasing the ph fig s13c as for the disinfection hbro with a high pka of 8 7 will dominate in bromination reaction hbro bro over a ph range of 5 0 9 0 liu et al 2018 therefore hbro favors the formation of dban in the ph range of 5 0 to 9 0 although dban is more easily hydrolyzed at higher ph gao et al 2020 this issue clearly cannot counteract the enhanced formation of dban caused by the conversion of ala into hn c ch3 cooh ch3 ch nh and ch3 cn and the increased generation of br two o3 bac effluents were used as representative water backgrounds to investigate the formation of dban from bro3 during usap treatment in real water followed by chlorination and compared to that using ultrapure water spiked with ala the basic water qualities of the two o3 bac effluents named as effluent a and effluent b are shown in table s2 compared with effluent b effluent a featured higher contents of organic matter and no3 as a result the production of br in effluent b 9 3 μm during usap was higher than that in effluent a 7 8 μm fig 4d nevertheless the dban formation from effluent a was higher than that from effluent b mainly because the higher content of organic matter in effluent a provided more precursors which favored dban formation consistent with the trend observed for buf values in the corresponding water samples fig s13d the formations of dban in effluent a 4 3 μg l and effluent b 3 0 μg l were both significantly lower than that in ala spiked ultrapure water 8 4 μg l fig 4d however due to the high toxicity of dban its formation from bro3 during usap treatment of real waters followed by chlorination should not be ignored 3 4 comprehensive toxicity assessment during usap treatment followed by chlorination in view of the above results usap treatment has a high risk of dban formation from bro3 in the presence of aas aas have been proven to be the most typical precursors of cx3r type n dbps yu and reckhow 2020 zhang et al 2019b accordingly the formation of cx3r type n dbps including four hans four hacams and four hnms from bro3 during the usap treatment in the presence of ala were measured to determine the potential risk of usap during practical applications as shown in fig s15 chlorination of ala in the presence of bro3 only formed chlorinated cx3r type n dbps with formation potential following the order of dcan tcan dcacam tcacam and tcnm dcnm with the introduction of usap treatment the formation of chlorinated cx3r type n dbps were reduced by 49 2 however all of the brominated cx3r type n dbps were generated with total concentration of 29 3 μg l accounting for 36 5 of cx3r type n dbps by weight this may bring a higher potential risk considering the several orders of magnitude higher toxicity of brominated cx3r type n dbps compared to their chlorinated analogues kali et al 2021 muellner et al 2007 due to the different degrees of cx3r type n dbp formation from bro3 during usap treatment in the presence of ala whether bro3 was converted into cx3r type n dbps to contribute to the increase in the toxicity was evaluated dbp associated additive toxicity and specifically the toxicity index ti which was obtained by dividing the measured dbp concentrations by the lc50 determined in chinese hamster ovary cell toxicological assays table s3 was calculated to estimate the contributions of cx3r type n dbps to the non specific toxicity of the treated water samples chuang and mitch 2017 as shown in fig 5 the ti value 0 0282 was dominated by bro3 and chlorinated cx3r type n dbps in the case without usap treatment when usap was applied although the toxicity of bro3 and chlorinated cx3r type n dbps reduced by 63 5 after post chlorination the ti value increased by 1 5 fold because of the formation of brominated cx3r type n dbps note that the toxicity of the formed brominated cx3r type n dbps contributed to 63 2 of the comprehensive toxicity suggesting that the application of usap requires a trade off when bro3 occurs in the water source due to the high risk of the formation of brominated cx3r type n dbps during post chlorination 4 conclusions the formation of dban from bro3 during usap treatment in the presence of aas followed by chlorination was investigated the following main results were demonstrated in the research i the reductive eaq produced in usap is exclusively responsible for the removal of bro3 producing br that is finally converted into hbro bro during post chlorination meanwhile usap also produced so4 and oh under do atmosphere which mediate the transformation of ala to form hn c ch3 cooh ch3 ch nh and ch3 cn via α hydrogen abstraction and nh2 hydrogen abstraction reactions ii the hn c ch3 cooh ch3 ch nh and ch3 cn occurring in the chlorination step increase the buf value and hence promote the formation of dban iii the formation of dban was significantly affected by usap treatment time ala and bro3 concentrations ph and components of real water matrices although the presence of organic matter and no3 retarded the production of br organic matter can still promote dban formation by providing more precursors iv although bro3 and chlorinated cx3r type n dbps can be effectively controlled by usap the increased toxicity observed during the subsequent chlorination due to the formation of brominated cx3r type n dbps is a great challenge implying that the application of usap requires a trade off declaration of competing interest we declare that we

15483,among the available technologies for ammonium removal from wastewater ion exchange represents one of the most promising ones in the perspective to recover ammonium and produce a fertilizing product however the vast majority of previous studies on ammonium ion exchange did not evaluate the process robustness under real operational conditions nor optimized the desorption step in this paper tests of ammonium removal and recovery were conducted on a metakaolin k based geopolymer compared with a high performing italian natural zeolite in k form real municipal and saline wastewater was treated in a continuous flow pilot plant equipped with a 60 cm adsorption bed bed volume 203 ml sorbent mass 145 173 g empty bed contact time 10 min geopolymer granules showed higher performances in terms of selectivity towards ammonium operating capacity 8 5 mgn g 1 dry adsorbent at an inlet concentration of 40 mgn l 1 bed volumes of wastewater treated at the selected breakpoint 149 geopolymer resulted to be a cost effective adsorbent for wastewater treatment capable to adsorb cations by ion exchange allowing a fractionated desorption procedure that led to recover ammonium in a solution composed mainly by nh4no3 37 wt and kno3 56 wt potentially usable as fertilizer the geopolymer robustness was assessed after repeated adsorption regeneration cycles showing that the geopolymer mechanical and morphological properties did not deteriorate the results make the tested geopolymer a very promising material for the optimization and scale up of the ammonium recovery process in a circular economy perspective graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords ion exchange geopolymer natural zeolite ammonium recovery nutrient recovery wastewater treatment data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction one of the major concerns deriving from environmental pollution is the contamination of water bodies among wastewater contaminants that include bacteria heavy metals and dyes the excessive presence of nitrogen in water such as ammonium nh4 primarily originated from municipal sewage fertiliser and agricultural wastes wang and peng 2010 accelerates the eutrophication of lakes and rivers tan et al 2020 guida et al 2020 for this reason the water framework directive 2000 60 ec and council directive 91 271 eec regulated collection treatment and discharge of urban wastewater to protect the environment from eutrophication concerning ammonium removal from municipal wastewaters mww the current typical technique is the biological nitrification denitrification process that converts ammonium into gaseous n2 however this process has a substantial energy consumption and does not allow any n recovery several technologies allow the removal and recovery of nh4 from ww in a circular economy perspective beckinghausen et al 2020 among them adsorption and ion exchange ie are very promising technologies for n recovery when ammonium is at medium low concentration as in mww thus ion exchange treatments are becoming nowadays more and more interesting than conventional biological treatments carrera et al 2003 because they are based on easy to use and cost effective solid adsorbents with lower environmental impact lower co2 emission guida et al 2020 huang et al 2020 a key component of the process is the sorbent that should have a high capacity and selectivity naturally occurring zeolites in particular clinoptilolite in na form are especially attractive for nh4 adsorption guida et al 2020 jha and hayashi 2009 in fact natural zeolites are microporous and low cost adsorbents with na k mg2 and ca2 exchangeable cations that make them particularly suitable for wastewater treatment tasić et al 2019 furthermore the si al ratio of zeolites influences both adsorption and ion exchange capacity clinoptilolite having a high molar si al ratio 4 58 possesses a high adsorption capacity for nh4 due to the presence of six to twelve membered ring channels that help the entry of cations also when hydrated chen et al 2018 however a low si al ratio increases the number of exchangeable cations since al atoms add negative charges in the framework for this reason natural zeolites such as merlinoite or chabazite with si al molar ratios between 2 and 3 have high nh4 exchange capacities chen et al 2018 despite the cheapness of natural zeolites is indisputable they are less performant in ammonium exchange capacity than the more expensive synthetic ones this is mainly due to the octahedral coordination of al3 occurring in natural zeolites instead of the tetrahedral coordination in synthetic zeolites even though thermal and chemical treatments can be performed to improve the selectivity and ion exchange capacity of natural zeolites thornton 2007 guida et al 2020 in this scenario geopolymer technology is gaining interest in research and development because it is based on versatile mesoporous materials with many potential applications in water and wastewater treatment luukkonen et al 2019 el eswed 2019 including adsorbents ion exchangers membranes and filters photocatalysts antimicrobials buffers and carriers for bioreactors luukkonen et al 2019 el eswed 2019 asim et al 2019 rasaki et al 2019 siyala et al 2018 novais et al 2017 geopolymers can boast high mechanical performance with an easy shaping and reproducibility medri et al 2020a even on a large scale with a production process less expensive than those required for synthetic zeolites in fact geopolymers are synthetic alkali aluminosilicates produced by the reaction of an aluminosilicate powder with an alkali aqueous solution at a temperature below 100 c although geopolymers are amorphous due to the short range ordering of their network al is in tetrahedral coordination in eight membered or larger aluminosilicate rings as in synthetic zeolites bortnovsky et al 2008 depending on the si al ratio which can be easily modified in the staring formulation davidovits 2008 furthermore mesoporous geopolymers can be shaped with interconnected micro meso macro ultramacro porosities as monoliths medri et al 2013 papa et al 2015 beads ge et al 2015 medri et al 2020b and components fabricated by 3d printing franchin et al 2020 enabling a fast mass transport and diffusion of cations towards the internal porosity as zeolites geopolymers preferentially adsorb cations by ion exchange bibliographic data regarding geopolymer adsorption performances are affected by test conditions and protocols stationary or in flux cations starting concentrations ph etc geopolymer stoichiometry si al ratio charge balancing cation and shape granules size macro porosity etc resulting in a wide range of results for example regarding ammonium luukkonen et al 2018 reported that using a powdered metakaolin based geopolymer with si al and na al ratios around 1 4 and 0 4 respectively the maximum ammonium exchange capacities were 31 79 28 77 and 17 75 mgn g 1 in synthetic screened and pre sedimented municipal wastewater estimated using the asymptotic values of the relative isotherms however using millimetric granulated geopolymer in a wastewater treatment plant the exchange capacity decreases below 4 mg g 1 sanguanpak et al 2021 reported that macro porous metakaolin based geopolymer granules with na as charge balancing cation reached a removal efficiency of 84 for piggery wastewater at a nh4 starting concentration of 75 mg l 1 franchin et al 2020 reported that 3d printed metakaolin based geopolymers with si al 1 9 and na al 1 0 have ion exchange capacity larger than 2 6 mg g 1 and removal efficiency over 80 in a nh4 model solution nh4 removal efficiency is generally higher using na as adsorbent charge balancing cation than k luukkonen et al 2017 since na has lower hydration energy because of the smaller atomic radius it is fixed in a less stable way to the ion exchanger however in this work in view of a potential reuse of the recovered ammonium as a fertilizer potassium was selected as a regenerating agent being na harmful for plants and soil the main goal of this work was to compare a metakaolin based geopolymer having a si al ratio equal to 2 and k as exchangeable cation bell et al 2009 landi et al 2013 with an italian natural zeolite activated in k form and containing chabazite and phillipsite with a si al ratio close to 2 shoumkova 2011 in terms of ammonium retention recovery performances and granules characterization recently niu et al 2022 reported that a metakaolin based geopolymer with the same stoichiometry studied in this work had a negative zeta potential regardless of ph therefore the surface was permanently charged allowing adsorption of cations through electrostatic interactions the tests were conducted following a procedure that integrates batch isotherm tests often used in the literature to compare materials for adsorption processes with continuous flow adsorption desorption tests that allow to assess key parameters such as the adsorbent operating capacity at the selected breakpoint and the process robustness pinelli et al 2022 the tests were conducted with a saline wastewater containing other competing cations in addition to nh4 an in depth characterization of the fresh and used geopolymer granules was performed in order to assess the entity of material deterioration after adsorption desorption cycles the main novelties of this work are i the development of a process of ammonium recovery with geopolymers from real municipal wastewater mww in a continuous flow pilot plant equipped with a 60 cm 0 20 l adsorption bed ii the use in the tests of a saline mww due to the presence of a local hotspot of seawater intrusion characterized by a strong competition between ammonium and other cations iii the development of a fractionated desorption process aimed at obtaining a nearly na free product potentially usable as fertilizer to the best of the authors knowledge none of the previous studies on ammonium recovery from mww with either zeolites or geopolymers have included the optimization of the desorption step in order to obtain a fertilizing product 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials metakaolin k based geopolymer coded as g13 with theoretical molar ratios si al 2 and k al 1 was synthetized as reported in papa et al 2022 the g13 slurry was placed in a plastic mold and cured in a heater at 80 c for 24 h in a closed vessel and then for further 24 h in an open vessel a zeolite bearing rock from pyroclastic deposits of volcanic origin apostolico tanagro s n c naples italy containing sanidine k feldspar biotite mica pyroxene and 50 to 80 wt of chabazite and phillipsite was used as natural zeolite adsorbent g13 and natural zeolite granules were prepared by crushing and sieving the materials in the range of 355 710 µm and were used for the characterizations and the ammonium adsorption tests 2 2 adsorption desorption tests 2 2 1 wastewater and synthetic solution composition isotherms and continuous flow tests were conducted with an actual high salinity treated municipal wastewater tmww namely the effluent of a pilot scale anaerobic membrane bioreactor placed in side stream configuration after an up flow anaerobic sludge blanket reactor that treats the saline mww of falconara marittima italy foglia et al 2020 this mww is particularly challenging for an ion exchange process as it is saline due to the presence of a local hotspot of seawater intrusion the saline tmww was spiked with nh4cl to obtain 40 mgn l 1 corresponding to the average ammonium content of the effluent of a mww treatment plant in which nitrogen removal is not performed the detailed composition of the tmww is reported in table 1 the falconara groundwater is subject to a significant seawater intrusion thus the studied tmww is characterized by high concentrations of na 214 7 mg l 1 cl 311 3 mg l 1 k 24 3 mg l 1 mg2 32 1 mg l 1 and ca2 97 9 mg l 1 2 2 2 cec assessment cation exchange capacity cec was assessed by using a 5 step experimental method based on the common practice of commercial cation exchangers characterization rohm and hass company 2005 the test was carried out in a laboratory column with an inner diameter of 13 mm packed with a 100 mm adsorption bed of the sorbent to be analyzed in the first step the bed was conditioned to k form eluting 12 bed volumes bvs of a 1 m solution of kcl with a 4 bv h flow rate corresponding to the typical range applied in the desorption regeneration step at laboratory scale rohm and hass company 2005 in the second step 4 bvs of deionized water were eluted to remove the k cations from the liquid of the bed in the third step k was displaced by nh4 in the fourth step a second wash was performed with 4 bvs of deionized water finally in the fifth step 12 bvs of a 12 m solution of kcl were eluted to displace the previously adsorbed nh4 the relatively high concentration of the regenerant was chosen to reduce the duration of the desorption phase the cec was assessed by analyzing k and nh4 contents in the eluted solutions generated by steps 3 and 5 thus two values were obtained by dividing the equivalents of displaced cations by the mass of sorbent loaded in the column 1a c e c k v l s t e p 3 c k m d r y s o r b e n t 1b c e c n v l s t e p 5 c n m d r y s o r b e n t where vl step 3 and vl step 5 indicate the total volume of effluent collected from the column during step 3 k displacement with nh4 and step 5 nh4 displacement with k whereas ck and cn indicate the concentrations of k and n nh4 in the two collected effluents the mean of these two values was assumed as the best estimate of cec for the tested sorbent in order to obtain a reliable cec estimate and to reduce the cec confidence interval the number of bvs used to completely exchange the cations in the sorbent was calculated as five times the one that is necessary to feed the equivalents corresponding to the expected cation exchange capacity rohm and hass company 2005 the actual saturation of the bed was verified by monitoring the displaced cation until it disappeared from the outlet stream at the end of steps 3 and 5 the resulting cec values were compared with the data obtained from the isotherm batch tests see section 3 1 1 isotherm tests 2 2 3 adsorption isotherm tests isotherm tests were performed with the actual high salinity tmww a nitrogen concentration range up to 600 mgn l 1 was tested at room temperature 20 22 c in glass bottles containing 100 ml of spiked tmww and 2 g l 1 of dry adsorbent which were agitated for 7 h in a rotatory shaker 200 rpm to reach equilibrium the time needed to reach equilibrium was defined according to the results of preliminary kinetic tests data not shown the n concentration at equilibrium in the solid phase cs eq was expressed as mgn per gram of dry adsorbent and determined according to eq 2 2 c s e q c l 0 c l e q v l m s where ms is the mass of dry adsorbent cl 0 and cl are the initial and final n concentrations in the liquid and vl is the liquid volume each test was performed in triplicates and the 95 confidence intervals associated to cs eq were calculated from the standard deviation of the mean values the experimental data were interpolated by means of the langmuir model the model parameters were estimated by non linear least squares regression of the calculated n solid phase concentrations to the corresponding experimental values more details about apparatuses and procedures can be found in pinelli et al 2022 2 2 4 continuous flow breakthrough tests the continuous flow adsorption desorption tests breakthrough tests bt were conducted with n spiked tmww in a pvc column with a total volume of 0 436 l a total height of 1 26 m and an inner diameter of 21 mm the final adsorbent bed height was 60 cm the minimum value commonly used in industrial applications after column packing the natural zeolite adsorbent was activated in k form through the elution of 10 bed volumes bvs of a 100 g l 1 kcl solution while g13 was directly produced in k form before conducting the breakthrough tests the fluid dynamic behavior of the adsorption bed was studied by means of conventional frontal analysis tests conducted with a kcl solution as the tracer adsorption was performed at a 10 min empty bed contact time ebct defined as the volume of adsorption bed over the volumetric flow rate a typical value commonly used in ion exchange tests hedström 2001 the bt was carried out at a constant column temperature of 22 c pressure drop and flow rate were measured hourly outlet samples were collected and analysed every 30 min inlet samples were collected every 3 h cation outlet concentrations were normalized by the average inlet concentration the adsorption performances were quantified at a breakpoint bp corresponding to an outlet concentration of 4 mgn l 1 three main parameters were used to describe the performance at the bp i the number of bvs needed to reach the bp defined as tmww volume treated at the bp adsorbent bv ii the adsorbent operating capacity defined as n mass adsorbed at the bp adsorbent dry mass and iii the nh4 adsorption yield yads a dimensionless parameter defined as n mass adsorbed at bp n mass fed at bp the n mass adsorbed at the bp mn sorbed bp was assessed by integrating the outlet n concentration in the liquid breakthrough curve 3 m n s o r b e d b p q 0 t b p c n i n c n o u t d t where q indicates the volumetric flow rate and tbp the time corresponding to the selected bp the desorption regeneration procedure was performed by counter current elution of 2 bvs of deionized di water to wash the tmww from the adsorption bed and then 10 bvs of a kcl or kno3 solution 50 g l 1 in the natural zeolite tests and 10 g l 1 in the g13 tests to regenerate the adsorbent and recover the n rich product desorption was performed at a 20 min ebct a commonly used contact time hedström 2001 the number of bvs in the regeneration was chosen to ensure the complete desorption of all cations the complete regeneration of the bed was verified by monitoring the outlet stream more details about column packing apparatuses and procedures for parameter determination from the breakthrough curves can be found in pinelli et al 2016 and 2022 and frascari et al 2019 2 3 characterization of granules the morphological and macro structural features of the granules were investigated by digital microscopy 3d digital microscope rh2000 hirox japan the poured bulk density of the granules was determined by pouring the granules of known mass into a graduated cylinder and measuring the occupied volume tapped density was then determined by measuring the volume occupied by the granules after tapping the graduated cylinder densities were calculated as the ratio of the mass of the granules to the volume occupied by them the true density i e mass volume of the solid material was obtained by helium pycnometer accupyc 1330 micromeritics x ray diffraction xrd patterns were collected using a powder diffractometer bruker d8 advance with cukα radiation karlsruhe germany on the powdered granules the elemental composition of the granules was determined by x ray fluorescence xrf analysis on powdered material measurements were performed by x met7500 mining analyser oxford instruments equipped with mining le fp standardless fundamentl parameter calibration possible modifications in the geopolymer vibrating mode after adsorption test were evaluated by attenuated total reflection atr measurements obtained using a thermo scientific nicolet is5 ftir spectrometer equipped with an id7 atr accessory and diamond crystal each spectrum was accumulated from 32 individual measurements in the acquisition range 4000 400 cm 1 performed on pulverized granules pore size distribution in the range 0 0058 100 µm was analyzed by mercury intrusion porosimetry mip thermo finnigan pascal 140 and thermo finnigan pascal 240 with an instrument accuracy of 4 total porosity was roughly estimated using the bulk density calculated from mip analysis volume of the analysis cell occupied by granules and true density obtained by helium pycnometer the measurement of the specific surface area ssa was carried out in a thermo scientific surfer instrument the specific surface area was calculated by the brunauer emmett teller bet method by means of nitrogen adsorption at 77 k mechanical tests were performed simultaneously on several granules 0 8 g of granules for each test at room temperature as reported in papa et al 2021 according to the international standard iso 18 591 the applied standard allows to calculate the average compressive strength of the granules pc and the relative density of the compressed granules ρc in function of the applied pressure and performing the test at least 4 times 3 results and discussion 3 1 ammonium adsorption regeneration tests the performance of g13 was compared to that of the natural zeolite activated in k form the comparison was based on batch equilibrium tests isotherms with an actual tmww and in a pilot plant continuous flow tests designed for testing adsorbents with an adsorption bed like those used in ion exchange process at full scale 3 1 1 isotherm tests the first step of the comparison was to run an isotherm with the actual tmww table 1 spiked with different amounts of nh4cl the experimental data and the best fitting interpolations conducted with the langmuir model are shown in fig 1 the scrutiny of fig 1 suggests similar equilibrium adsorption performances with a favorable isotherm type for both g13 and the natural zeolite in order to have an estimation of the ammonium sorption performances in the actual operating conditions the langmuir model was used to interpolate the isotherm experimental data and the best fitting parameters were used to estimate the operating capacity in equilibrium with an ammonium concentration of 40 mgn l 1 the typical value expected in a tmww with no nitrogen removal the value obtained with g13 was 9 3 1 7 mgn g 1 27 higher than that of the natural zeolite 7 3 1 5 mgn g 1 of dry adsorbent this result is a first indication that g13 is potentially a better adsorbent than the natural zeolite also in the presence of competing cations a rough estimation of the cation exchange capacity cec of each material is the maximum adsorption capacity that can be obtained from the asymptotic value of the adsorbed concentration in the solid estimated by the best fit with langmuir isotherm the two values 36 15 mgn g 1 of dry adsorbent for g13 and 38 11 mgn g 1 for the natural zeolite resulted similar and in good agreement with the cecs measured by means of the column method described in section 2 2 2 equal to 42 8 mgn g 1 for g13 and 34 3 mgn g 1 for the natural zeolite it should be noted that the distance between the g13 and the chabazite values decreases as the concentration in the liquid increases the g13 isotherm is more favourable than the chabazite isotherm and the gain in the performance of g13 is higher at the low n concentrations targeted by the process of n recovery from mww 3 1 2 continuous flow breakthrough tests the concentrations of the main cations in the column outlet at different bed volumes breakthrough curves obtained with g13 and the natural zeolite are shown in fig 2 a and b respectively in both cases ammonium is the last cation eluted confirming the good selectivity of both materials towards nh4 however the elution order is slightly different na mg2 ca2 nh4 for g13 and mg2 na ca2 nh4 for natural zeolite the elution of na before mg2 in the case of g13 is of interest in view of a potential reuse of the recovered product as a fertilizer indeed the na mg2 ca2 nh4 elution order allows to perform a fractionated desorption and the consequent collection of a fraction with a very low concentration of na harmful for several crops a description of the fractioned desorption is given later on in this section the high selectivity of the adsorbents towards nh4 can be explained with the steric hindrance that cations encounter during diffusion inside the pores in general the greater the al content of zeolites i e the more extra framework cations needed to balance the charge the higher the cation exchange capacity of the zeolite mumpton 1999 as regards the selectivity and the sorption capacity of the zeolite for different cations these are defined also by zeolite porosity pore size distribution and specific surface area furthermore natural zeolites from different deposits may vary widely in purity chemical composition crystal size porosity pore diameter and other properties determining their sorption and ion exchange capacity wang and peng 2010 therefore the high selectivity in zeolites is mainly given by the particular microporous rigid structure which can preferentially adsorb and accommodate different cations since geopolymers are considered as the amorphous counterpart of zeolites also their cation exchange capacity depends on the cations available for exchange and at the same time on the particular porosity developed during their synthesis in both adsorbents ammonium ions probably diffused easily in the interstices whilst other cations as na were impeded by the bigger hydrate shell and were thus incorporated more slowly ammonium possesses a small hydrated radius equal to about 0 15 nm sidey 2016 smaller than the typical size of the channels and nanopores that are respectively in natural zeolite 0 37 0 42 nm for chabazite 0 28 0 48 nm for phillipsite shoumkova 2011 and in g13 landi et al 2013 conversely the radiuses of the other hydrated cations are bigger israelachvili 2011 comparable to the size of the natural zeolite microchannels indicating that the exchange of these cations is likely to be limited by steric hindrance indeed the determining factor is the hydration energy smaller ions have a higher electric charge therefore they hydrate more easily and have a lower affinity for the exchanger explaining the elution order a second important aspect of comparison between the two adsorbents is their capacity and in particular the ammonium operating capacity that is the ammonium concentration that can be obtained in the adsorbent at the selected breakpoint in tests conducted in the presence of competing cations this performance parameter is influenced not only by the total cation capacity but also by the concentration in the tmww and by the adsorbent selectivity the expected effect of a higher operating capacity is a delayed breakpoint namely an increase of the number of bvs necessary to reach the concentration limit and this in turn reduces the treatment cost the number of bvs of treated tmww and the operating capacity of g13 at the selected breakpoint equal to 149 and 8 5 mgn g 1 of dry adsorbent resulted 72 and 67 higher than the corresponding values obtained with the natural zeolite 87 bvs operating capacity 5 1 mgn g 1 these operating capacities assessed in continuous flow conditions are lower than those estimated by means of the isotherm tests 9 3 mgn g 1 for g13 7 3 mgn g 1 for the natural zeolite since in continuous flow tests the adsorbent does not reach equilibrium in the whole bed nevertheless they confirm a significantly better performance of g13 with respect to the tested natural zeolite the adsorption yields were similar 97 for g13 99 for the natural zeolite a final important aspect to be investigated is the possibility to easily regenerate the adsorbent after each adsorption phase and recover a n rich desorbed product the adsorption columns were regenerated with kcl in the first bt test then a kno3 solution was used to obtain a desorbed product rich in nh4no3 a widespread fertilizer no differences were observed in the tests performed with cl or no3 as anions the concentrations of desorbed ammonium in the regenerant versus the number of bvs of the regenerant fed are shown in fig 3 a and b since g13 adsorbs cations more strongly than zeolite the desorption process was quite slow requiring 15 regenerant bvs to release 95 of the adsorbed n versus 4 bvs needed using the natural zeolite nevertheless the slow desorption of g13 highlights an important and positive feature of this material indeed fig 3b clearly shows that it is possible to separate a first desorbed fraction 5 bvs containing almost all the na and then collect separately a second fraction 6 16 bvs containing 91 of the total desorbed ammonium the mean n concentration in the second fraction was 0 75 gn l 1 a value 19 times higher than the initial n content of the mww 0 040 gn l 1 and that can be increased by further optimizing the desorption procedure indeed optimal desorption conditions can be identified by means of a trade off between the positive effect of the selective recover of ammonium with respect to sodium and the higher operational cost associated to the larger amount of regenerant needed the important result of this procedure is that the 2nd desorption fraction the actual product had a very low content of na 0 022 g l 1 a cation that should be minimized in fertilizers as it is harmful for several crops and for soil texture the concentrations in the desorbed liquid were multiplied by the desorbed volume to calculate the mass of cations contained in the product expressed as the mass of the corresponding salts the 2nd desorption fraction obtained from the test regenerated with kno3 was mainly made of kno3 56 wt and nh4no3 37 wt with a very low content in nano3 just 0 06 wt the remaining 7 wt being composed by other nitrates indeed the composition of the solid that can be obtained from the desorption solution is of vital importance in view of the reuse of the recovered product as a fertilizer the results showed that even without any further treatment the desorbed product obtained in this work had a high ammonium content and a very low sodium content therefore the combined effect of the very promising performance of g13 in terms of capacity and selectivity and the possibility that g13 allows to fraction the desorption product make g13 a very promising material for the optimization and scale up of the ammonium removal recovery process leading to a final product that can potentially be used as an ammonium rich nitrate based fertilizer due to a short range order of the structure duxon et al 2007 the amorphous nature of the mesoporous geopolymer affects the selectivity being the ion paths more tortuous than in a crystalline zeolite it follows that g13 differentiates cations better than the natural zeolite on the basis of the steric hindrance but the adsorption and desorption processes resulted slowed down 3 2 characterization of the adsorbent granules in addition to a high adsorption capacity and selectivity durability robustness and easiness of regeneration are key features of a successful adsorbent therefore g13 granules were characterized after seven adsorption regeneration cycles g13ar and compared to g13 and fresh natural zeolite in order to assess possible changes or degradation effects on the material 3 2 1 morphological chemical and textural characteristics the optical microscope pictures in fig 4 show as prepared natural zeolite g13 and g13ar granules although the same crushing and sieving procedure was used granules look very different zeolite granules have rounded edges with surface debris from softer phases fig 4b in fact natural zeolites are not homogenous in composition as they belong to a mineral deposit of volcanic origin differently g13 granules being a synthetized product are uniform with sharp edges fig 4c and clean fracture surfaces fig 4d typical of a material with a brittle fracture behavior notably after the adsorption regeneration cycles fig 4e f neither size nor shape changed the sharp edges were maintained and the surfaces remained integer no cracks formation preserving the rounded ultra macropores formed by entrapped air in the geopolymer slurry during casting fig 4d f fig 5 a shows the xrd pattern of the g13 geopolymer before and after the adsorption regeneration cycles showing no evidence of new phases in g13ar together with the typical amorphous hump centered around 27 2θ duxson et al 2007 provis et al 2005 and only few crystalline phases such as quartz 46 1045 and muscovite 34 0175 belonging to the starting metakaolin papa et al 2014 moreover atr ftir spectra fig 5b of g13 and g13ar almost overlap being the most significant bands typical of geopolymers papa et al 2022 superimposable also after adsorption regeneration cycles highlighting no modifications nor formation of new bonding signals in g13ar table 2 reports the si al and k al molar ratios zeolite has a higher si al ratio 2 6 than g13 1 9 while k al ratio 0 6 is half that of the geopolymer zeolite also contains ca2 with a ca al 0 3 it should be noted that the si al and k al ratios are calculated on the total quantity of elements present in the natural zeolite i e belonging to all the other minerals not taking part to the adsorption process in addition to chabazite and phillipsite which have respectively si al 2 and si al 2 2 shoumkova 2011 similarly to g13 in g13ar si al and k al ratios did not statistically change with values fixed on the theoretical ones in particular regarding electroneutrality of k al 1 davidovits 2008 being k the exchanged cation the poured and tapped true density specific surface area ssa and the main values obtained by mercury intrusion porosimetry mip are also reported in table 2 poured and tapped densities were higher for zeolite since these are related to granules shape and size instead true density was similar in g13 and natural zeolite but it slightly decreased in g13ar especially in terms of standard deviation as all the traces of unreacted potassium silicate were eliminated during repeated adsorption and regeneration cycles regarding porosity g13 and g13ar granules showed a total porosity of 50 and zeolite granules showed a value of 54 conversely concerning mip data in the range 0 0058 100 µm g13 granules showed an open porosity and a total pore volume higher than natural zeolite ones 43 and 363 mm3 g 1 compared to 30 and 259 mm3 g 1 respectively and they remained about constant in g13ar furthermore the pore size distributions were very different fig 6 for natural zeolite granules porosity was broadly distributed along the dimensional acquisition range with the average pore size diameter of 0 12 µm an order of magnitude smaller than the modal one 1 24 µm the most frequent pore size diameter conversely g13 and g13ar pore size distributions were monomodal with the average and the modal pore size diameter centered at 0 01 µm for g13 and at a slightly higher value for g13ar 0 03 µm both distributions showed pores in the range of 10 100 µm in accordance with the ultra macropores revealed on the fracture surfaces of the geopolymer granules fig 4 the assessment of the porosity in this range highlighted for both geopolymer and natural zeolite the presence of interconnected meso and macropores a crucial aspect to enable a fast mass transport and diffusion of cations towards the internal micropores chen et al 2016 furthermore the pore diameter is one of the most important features of adsorbent materials that would affect the adsorbent selectivity based on the diameter of the adsorbed material kumar et al 2012 the geopolymer selectivity is guarantee as the synthesis of the geopolymer is reproducible i e the final synthetic product maintains the same characteristics full geopolymerization porosity si al ratio etc however it is important to point out that the measurement does not include the natural zeolite s microporosity which is typically in the range of 0 37 0 42 nm for chabazite and 0 28 0 48 nm for phillipsite shoumkova 2011 conversely g13 is predominantly mesoporous with the majority of smallest pores in the range of 20 40 nm landi et al 2013 finally the specific surface area of natural zeolite is slightly higher than that of the geopolymer table 2 while it decreases from 77 m2 g 1 in fresh g13 to 51 m2 g 1 in g13ar 3 2 2 mechanical characterization the robustness of the g13ar granules after the adsorption regeneration cycles was investigated through the compaction of a bed of granules iso 18 591 standard and compared with the strength of the as prepared g13 and natural zeolite granules the mechanical durability of granules gives information on how much stresses the material can withstand during use antonyuk et al 2005 the average compressive strengths pc and density values ρc of the compacted granules are reported in table 2 fig 7 shows the relative density versus the logarithmic pressure diagram used for calculating the strength of the granules indeed the compressive strength was measured by locating the spot where the curve has the steepest curvature at the intercept of the two regression lines showed as an example in fig 7 järveläinen et al 2016 the granules are first packed and rearranged in the die in fact the initial relative density is equal to the poured density measured for the granules table 2 subsequently the point where relative density increases most rapidly while pressure increase is minimal is interpreted as the point of fracture of the granules järveläinen et al 2016 the compressive strength of as prepared g13 granules resulted higher than that of natural zeolite furthermore the adsorption regeneration cycles determined a marked increase in g13ar compressive strength and a decrease in experimental error demonstrating an improvement in mechanical performance the bed strength represents the overall strength of an average granule the result is affected by the possible irregular force distribution in the bed but in particular by size porosity and roughness of the granules antonyuk et al 2005 together with the granules shape and internal imperfections subero couroyer et al 2003 in bed compression the result is also affected by the size distribution of the granules and by the friction among them kwan et al 2015 järveläinen et al 2016 the granules are very different as shown in fig 4 the presence of sharp edges in g13 granules avoided a high particle packing therefore a higher pressure is required before failure occurs increasing the compressive strength values moreover granules strength can be affected by loading through a fatigue effect where a force below the granules strength may cause further hardening increasing the strength antonyuk et al 2010 as possibly in the case of g13ar after adsorption regeneration cycles 4 conclusions in view of a large scale use as a fertilizer of the recovered ammonium from wastewaters a metakaolin k based geopolymer g13 was compared to a natural zeolite composed of chabazite and phillipsite and activated in k form in terms of granules characterization and ammonium adsorption capacity an actual treated municipal wastewater was used in the tests conducted following a procedure that integrates batch isotherm tests and continuous flow adsorption desorption tests despite a lower specific surface area the g13 geopolymer resulted in a higher porosity and compressive strength in comparison with the natural zeolite the ammonium removal tests indicated significantly better performances of g13 in terms of selectivity towards ammonium operating capacity 8 5 mgn g 1 of dry adsorbent bed volumes of wastewater treated at the selected breakpoint 149 and possibility to obtain a fractionated desorbed product composed mainly by kno3 56 wt and nh4no3 37 wt with a negligible concentration of na 0 022 g l 1 harmful for several crops this product can potentially be used as a fertilizer in a circular economy perspective finally the geopolymer granules did not deteriorate in their mechanical morphological nor textural properties after repeated adsorption regeneration cycles highlighting the robustness of the selected material overall g13 resulted a very promising material for the optimization and scale up of the

15483,among the available technologies for ammonium removal from wastewater ion exchange represents one of the most promising ones in the perspective to recover ammonium and produce a fertilizing product however the vast majority of previous studies on ammonium ion exchange did not evaluate the process robustness under real operational conditions nor optimized the desorption step in this paper tests of ammonium removal and recovery were conducted on a metakaolin k based geopolymer compared with a high performing italian natural zeolite in k form real municipal and saline wastewater was treated in a continuous flow pilot plant equipped with a 60 cm adsorption bed bed volume 203 ml sorbent mass 145 173 g empty bed contact time 10 min geopolymer granules showed higher performances in terms of selectivity towards ammonium operating capacity 8 5 mgn g 1 dry adsorbent at an inlet concentration of 40 mgn l 1 bed volumes of wastewater treated at the selected breakpoint 149 geopolymer resulted to be a cost effective adsorbent for wastewater treatment capable to adsorb cations by ion exchange allowing a fractionated desorption procedure that led to recover ammonium in a solution composed mainly by nh4no3 37 wt and kno3 56 wt potentially usable as fertilizer the geopolymer robustness was assessed after repeated adsorption regeneration cycles showing that the geopolymer mechanical and morphological properties did not deteriorate the results make the tested geopolymer a very promising material for the optimization and scale up of the ammonium recovery process in a circular economy perspective graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords ion exchange geopolymer natural zeolite ammonium recovery nutrient recovery wastewater treatment data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction one of the major concerns deriving from environmental pollution is the contamination of water bodies among wastewater contaminants that include bacteria heavy metals and dyes the excessive presence of nitrogen in water such as ammonium nh4 primarily originated from municipal sewage fertiliser and agricultural wastes wang and peng 2010 accelerates the eutrophication of lakes and rivers tan et al 2020 guida et al 2020 for this reason the water framework directive 2000 60 ec and council directive 91 271 eec regulated collection treatment and discharge of urban wastewater to protect the environment from eutrophication concerning ammonium removal from municipal wastewaters mww the current typical technique is the biological nitrification denitrification process that converts ammonium into gaseous n2 however this process has a substantial energy consumption and does not allow any n recovery several technologies allow the removal and recovery of nh4 from ww in a circular economy perspective beckinghausen et al 2020 among them adsorption and ion exchange ie are very promising technologies for n recovery when ammonium is at medium low concentration as in mww thus ion exchange treatments are becoming nowadays more and more interesting than conventional biological treatments carrera et al 2003 because they are based on easy to use and cost effective solid adsorbents with lower environmental impact lower co2 emission guida et al 2020 huang et al 2020 a key component of the process is the sorbent that should have a high capacity and selectivity naturally occurring zeolites in particular clinoptilolite in na form are especially attractive for nh4 adsorption guida et al 2020 jha and hayashi 2009 in fact natural zeolites are microporous and low cost adsorbents with na k mg2 and ca2 exchangeable cations that make them particularly suitable for wastewater treatment tasić et al 2019 furthermore the si al ratio of zeolites influences both adsorption and ion exchange capacity clinoptilolite having a high molar si al ratio 4 58 possesses a high adsorption capacity for nh4 due to the presence of six to twelve membered ring channels that help the entry of cations also when hydrated chen et al 2018 however a low si al ratio increases the number of exchangeable cations since al atoms add negative charges in the framework for this reason natural zeolites such as merlinoite or chabazite with si al molar ratios between 2 and 3 have high nh4 exchange capacities chen et al 2018 despite the cheapness of natural zeolites is indisputable they are less performant in ammonium exchange capacity than the more expensive synthetic ones this is mainly due to the octahedral coordination of al3 occurring in natural zeolites instead of the tetrahedral coordination in synthetic zeolites even though thermal and chemical treatments can be performed to improve the selectivity and ion exchange capacity of natural zeolites thornton 2007 guida et al 2020 in this scenario geopolymer technology is gaining interest in research and development because it is based on versatile mesoporous materials with many potential applications in water and wastewater treatment luukkonen et al 2019 el eswed 2019 including adsorbents ion exchangers membranes and filters photocatalysts antimicrobials buffers and carriers for bioreactors luukkonen et al 2019 el eswed 2019 asim et al 2019 rasaki et al 2019 siyala et al 2018 novais et al 2017 geopolymers can boast high mechanical performance with an easy shaping and reproducibility medri et al 2020a even on a large scale with a production process less expensive than those required for synthetic zeolites in fact geopolymers are synthetic alkali aluminosilicates produced by the reaction of an aluminosilicate powder with an alkali aqueous solution at a temperature below 100 c although geopolymers are amorphous due to the short range ordering of their network al is in tetrahedral coordination in eight membered or larger aluminosilicate rings as in synthetic zeolites bortnovsky et al 2008 depending on the si al ratio which can be easily modified in the staring formulation davidovits 2008 furthermore mesoporous geopolymers can be shaped with interconnected micro meso macro ultramacro porosities as monoliths medri et al 2013 papa et al 2015 beads ge et al 2015 medri et al 2020b and components fabricated by 3d printing franchin et al 2020 enabling a fast mass transport and diffusion of cations towards the internal porosity as zeolites geopolymers preferentially adsorb cations by ion exchange bibliographic data regarding geopolymer adsorption performances are affected by test conditions and protocols stationary or in flux cations starting concentrations ph etc geopolymer stoichiometry si al ratio charge balancing cation and shape granules size macro porosity etc resulting in a wide range of results for example regarding ammonium luukkonen et al 2018 reported that using a powdered metakaolin based geopolymer with si al and na al ratios around 1 4 and 0 4 respectively the maximum ammonium exchange capacities were 31 79 28 77 and 17 75 mgn g 1 in synthetic screened and pre sedimented municipal wastewater estimated using the asymptotic values of the relative isotherms however using millimetric granulated geopolymer in a wastewater treatment plant the exchange capacity decreases below 4 mg g 1 sanguanpak et al 2021 reported that macro porous metakaolin based geopolymer granules with na as charge balancing cation reached a removal efficiency of 84 for piggery wastewater at a nh4 starting concentration of 75 mg l 1 franchin et al 2020 reported that 3d printed metakaolin based geopolymers with si al 1 9 and na al 1 0 have ion exchange capacity larger than 2 6 mg g 1 and removal efficiency over 80 in a nh4 model solution nh4 removal efficiency is generally higher using na as adsorbent charge balancing cation than k luukkonen et al 2017 since na has lower hydration energy because of the smaller atomic radius it is fixed in a less stable way to the ion exchanger however in this work in view of a potential reuse of the recovered ammonium as a fertilizer potassium was selected as a regenerating agent being na harmful for plants and soil the main goal of this work was to compare a metakaolin based geopolymer having a si al ratio equal to 2 and k as exchangeable cation bell et al 2009 landi et al 2013 with an italian natural zeolite activated in k form and containing chabazite and phillipsite with a si al ratio close to 2 shoumkova 2011 in terms of ammonium retention recovery performances and granules characterization recently niu et al 2022 reported that a metakaolin based geopolymer with the same stoichiometry studied in this work had a negative zeta potential regardless of ph therefore the surface was permanently charged allowing adsorption of cations through electrostatic interactions the tests were conducted following a procedure that integrates batch isotherm tests often used in the literature to compare materials for adsorption processes with continuous flow adsorption desorption tests that allow to assess key parameters such as the adsorbent operating capacity at the selected breakpoint and the process robustness pinelli et al 2022 the tests were conducted with a saline wastewater containing other competing cations in addition to nh4 an in depth characterization of the fresh and used geopolymer granules was performed in order to assess the entity of material deterioration after adsorption desorption cycles the main novelties of this work are i the development of a process of ammonium recovery with geopolymers from real municipal wastewater mww in a continuous flow pilot plant equipped with a 60 cm 0 20 l adsorption bed ii the use in the tests of a saline mww due to the presence of a local hotspot of seawater intrusion characterized by a strong competition between ammonium and other cations iii the development of a fractionated desorption process aimed at obtaining a nearly na free product potentially usable as fertilizer to the best of the authors knowledge none of the previous studies on ammonium recovery from mww with either zeolites or geopolymers have included the optimization of the desorption step in order to obtain a fertilizing product 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials metakaolin k based geopolymer coded as g13 with theoretical molar ratios si al 2 and k al 1 was synthetized as reported in papa et al 2022 the g13 slurry was placed in a plastic mold and cured in a heater at 80 c for 24 h in a closed vessel and then for further 24 h in an open vessel a zeolite bearing rock from pyroclastic deposits of volcanic origin apostolico tanagro s n c naples italy containing sanidine k feldspar biotite mica pyroxene and 50 to 80 wt of chabazite and phillipsite was used as natural zeolite adsorbent g13 and natural zeolite granules were prepared by crushing and sieving the materials in the range of 355 710 µm and were used for the characterizations and the ammonium adsorption tests 2 2 adsorption desorption tests 2 2 1 wastewater and synthetic solution composition isotherms and continuous flow tests were conducted with an actual high salinity treated municipal wastewater tmww namely the effluent of a pilot scale anaerobic membrane bioreactor placed in side stream configuration after an up flow anaerobic sludge blanket reactor that treats the saline mww of falconara marittima italy foglia et al 2020 this mww is particularly challenging for an ion exchange process as it is saline due to the presence of a local hotspot of seawater intrusion the saline tmww was spiked with nh4cl to obtain 40 mgn l 1 corresponding to the average ammonium content of the effluent of a mww treatment plant in which nitrogen removal is not performed the detailed composition of the tmww is reported in table 1 the falconara groundwater is subject to a significant seawater intrusion thus the studied tmww is characterized by high concentrations of na 214 7 mg l 1 cl 311 3 mg l 1 k 24 3 mg l 1 mg2 32 1 mg l 1 and ca2 97 9 mg l 1 2 2 2 cec assessment cation exchange capacity cec was assessed by using a 5 step experimental method based on the common practice of commercial cation exchangers characterization rohm and hass company 2005 the test was carried out in a laboratory column with an inner diameter of 13 mm packed with a 100 mm adsorption bed of the sorbent to be analyzed in the first step the bed was conditioned to k form eluting 12 bed volumes bvs of a 1 m solution of kcl with a 4 bv h flow rate corresponding to the typical range applied in the desorption regeneration step at laboratory scale rohm and hass company 2005 in the second step 4 bvs of deionized water were eluted to remove the k cations from the liquid of the bed in the third step k was displaced by nh4 in the fourth step a second wash was performed with 4 bvs of deionized water finally in the fifth step 12 bvs of a 12 m solution of kcl were eluted to displace the previously adsorbed nh4 the relatively high concentration of the regenerant was chosen to reduce the duration of the desorption phase the cec was assessed by analyzing k and nh4 contents in the eluted solutions generated by steps 3 and 5 thus two values were obtained by dividing the equivalents of displaced cations by the mass of sorbent loaded in the column 1a c e c k v l s t e p 3 c k m d r y s o r b e n t 1b c e c n v l s t e p 5 c n m d r y s o r b e n t where vl step 3 and vl step 5 indicate the total volume of effluent collected from the column during step 3 k displacement with nh4 and step 5 nh4 displacement with k whereas ck and cn indicate the concentrations of k and n nh4 in the two collected effluents the mean of these two values was assumed as the best estimate of cec for the tested sorbent in order to obtain a reliable cec estimate and to reduce the cec confidence interval the number of bvs used to completely exchange the cations in the sorbent was calculated as five times the one that is necessary to feed the equivalents corresponding to the expected cation exchange capacity rohm and hass company 2005 the actual saturation of the bed was verified by monitoring the displaced cation until it disappeared from the outlet stream at the end of steps 3 and 5 the resulting cec values were compared with the data obtained from the isotherm batch tests see section 3 1 1 isotherm tests 2 2 3 adsorption isotherm tests isotherm tests were performed with the actual high salinity tmww a nitrogen concentration range up to 600 mgn l 1 was tested at room temperature 20 22 c in glass bottles containing 100 ml of spiked tmww and 2 g l 1 of dry adsorbent which were agitated for 7 h in a rotatory shaker 200 rpm to reach equilibrium the time needed to reach equilibrium was defined according to the results of preliminary kinetic tests data not shown the n concentration at equilibrium in the solid phase cs eq was expressed as mgn per gram of dry adsorbent and determined according to eq 2 2 c s e q c l 0 c l e q v l m s where ms is the mass of dry adsorbent cl 0 and cl are the initial and final n concentrations in the liquid and vl is the liquid volume each test was performed in triplicates and the 95 confidence intervals associated to cs eq were calculated from the standard deviation of the mean values the experimental data were interpolated by means of the langmuir model the model parameters were estimated by non linear least squares regression of the calculated n solid phase concentrations to the corresponding experimental values more details about apparatuses and procedures can be found in pinelli et al 2022 2 2 4 continuous flow breakthrough tests the continuous flow adsorption desorption tests breakthrough tests bt were conducted with n spiked tmww in a pvc column with a total volume of 0 436 l a total height of 1 26 m and an inner diameter of 21 mm the final adsorbent bed height was 60 cm the minimum value commonly used in industrial applications after column packing the natural zeolite adsorbent was activated in k form through the elution of 10 bed volumes bvs of a 100 g l 1 kcl solution while g13 was directly produced in k form before conducting the breakthrough tests the fluid dynamic behavior of the adsorption bed was studied by means of conventional frontal analysis tests conducted with a kcl solution as the tracer adsorption was performed at a 10 min empty bed contact time ebct defined as the volume of adsorption bed over the volumetric flow rate a typical value commonly used in ion exchange tests hedström 2001 the bt was carried out at a constant column temperature of 22 c pressure drop and flow rate were measured hourly outlet samples were collected and analysed every 30 min inlet samples were collected every 3 h cation outlet concentrations were normalized by the average inlet concentration the adsorption performances were quantified at a breakpoint bp corresponding to an outlet concentration of 4 mgn l 1 three main parameters were used to describe the performance at the bp i the number of bvs needed to reach the bp defined as tmww volume treated at the bp adsorbent bv ii the adsorbent operating capacity defined as n mass adsorbed at the bp adsorbent dry mass and iii the nh4 adsorption yield yads a dimensionless parameter defined as n mass adsorbed at bp n mass fed at bp the n mass adsorbed at the bp mn sorbed bp was assessed by integrating the outlet n concentration in the liquid breakthrough curve 3 m n s o r b e d b p q 0 t b p c n i n c n o u t d t where q indicates the volumetric flow rate and tbp the time corresponding to the selected bp the desorption regeneration procedure was performed by counter current elution of 2 bvs of deionized di water to wash the tmww from the adsorption bed and then 10 bvs of a kcl or kno3 solution 50 g l 1 in the natural zeolite tests and 10 g l 1 in the g13 tests to regenerate the adsorbent and recover the n rich product desorption was performed at a 20 min ebct a commonly used contact time hedström 2001 the number of bvs in the regeneration was chosen to ensure the complete desorption of all cations the complete regeneration of the bed was verified by monitoring the outlet stream more details about column packing apparatuses and procedures for parameter determination from the breakthrough curves can be found in pinelli et al 2016 and 2022 and frascari et al 2019 2 3 characterization of granules the morphological and macro structural features of the granules were investigated by digital microscopy 3d digital microscope rh2000 hirox japan the poured bulk density of the granules was determined by pouring the granules of known mass into a graduated cylinder and measuring the occupied volume tapped density was then determined by measuring the volume occupied by the granules after tapping the graduated cylinder densities were calculated as the ratio of the mass of the granules to the volume occupied by them the true density i e mass volume of the solid material was obtained by helium pycnometer accupyc 1330 micromeritics x ray diffraction xrd patterns were collected using a powder diffractometer bruker d8 advance with cukα radiation karlsruhe germany on the powdered granules the elemental composition of the granules was determined by x ray fluorescence xrf analysis on powdered material measurements were performed by x met7500 mining analyser oxford instruments equipped with mining le fp standardless fundamentl parameter calibration possible modifications in the geopolymer vibrating mode after adsorption test were evaluated by attenuated total reflection atr measurements obtained using a thermo scientific nicolet is5 ftir spectrometer equipped with an id7 atr accessory and diamond crystal each spectrum was accumulated from 32 individual measurements in the acquisition range 4000 400 cm 1 performed on pulverized granules pore size distribution in the range 0 0058 100 µm was analyzed by mercury intrusion porosimetry mip thermo finnigan pascal 140 and thermo finnigan pascal 240 with an instrument accuracy of 4 total porosity was roughly estimated using the bulk density calculated from mip analysis volume of the analysis cell occupied by granules and true density obtained by helium pycnometer the measurement of the specific surface area ssa was carried out in a thermo scientific surfer instrument the specific surface area was calculated by the brunauer emmett teller bet method by means of nitrogen adsorption at 77 k mechanical tests were performed simultaneously on several granules 0 8 g of granules for each test at room temperature as reported in papa et al 2021 according to the international standard iso 18 591 the applied standard allows to calculate the average compressive strength of the granules pc and the relative density of the compressed granules ρc in function of the applied pressure and performing the test at least 4 times 3 results and discussion 3 1 ammonium adsorption regeneration tests the performance of g13 was compared to that of the natural zeolite activated in k form the comparison was based on batch equilibrium tests isotherms with an actual tmww and in a pilot plant continuous flow tests designed for testing adsorbents with an adsorption bed like those used in ion exchange process at full scale 3 1 1 isotherm tests the first step of the comparison was to run an isotherm with the actual tmww table 1 spiked with different amounts of nh4cl the experimental data and the best fitting interpolations conducted with the langmuir model are shown in fig 1 the scrutiny of fig 1 suggests similar equilibrium adsorption performances with a favorable isotherm type for both g13 and the natural zeolite in order to have an estimation of the ammonium sorption performances in the actual operating conditions the langmuir model was used to interpolate the isotherm experimental data and the best fitting parameters were used to estimate the operating capacity in equilibrium with an ammonium concentration of 40 mgn l 1 the typical value expected in a tmww with no nitrogen removal the value obtained with g13 was 9 3 1 7 mgn g 1 27 higher than that of the natural zeolite 7 3 1 5 mgn g 1 of dry adsorbent this result is a first indication that g13 is potentially a better adsorbent than the natural zeolite also in the presence of competing cations a rough estimation of the cation exchange capacity cec of each material is the maximum adsorption capacity that can be obtained from the asymptotic value of the adsorbed concentration in the solid estimated by the best fit with langmuir isotherm the two values 36 15 mgn g 1 of dry adsorbent for g13 and 38 11 mgn g 1 for the natural zeolite resulted similar and in good agreement with the cecs measured by means of the column method described in section 2 2 2 equal to 42 8 mgn g 1 for g13 and 34 3 mgn g 1 for the natural zeolite it should be noted that the distance between the g13 and the chabazite values decreases as the concentration in the liquid increases the g13 isotherm is more favourable than the chabazite isotherm and the gain in the performance of g13 is higher at the low n concentrations targeted by the process of n recovery from mww 3 1 2 continuous flow breakthrough tests the concentrations of the main cations in the column outlet at different bed volumes breakthrough curves obtained with g13 and the natural zeolite are shown in fig 2 a and b respectively in both cases ammonium is the last cation eluted confirming the good selectivity of both materials towards nh4 however the elution order is slightly different na mg2 ca2 nh4 for g13 and mg2 na ca2 nh4 for natural zeolite the elution of na before mg2 in the case of g13 is of interest in view of a potential reuse of the recovered product as a fertilizer indeed the na mg2 ca2 nh4 elution order allows to perform a fractionated desorption and the consequent collection of a fraction with a very low concentration of na harmful for several crops a description of the fractioned desorption is given later on in this section the high selectivity of the adsorbents towards nh4 can be explained with the steric hindrance that cations encounter during diffusion inside the pores in general the greater the al content of zeolites i e the more extra framework cations needed to balance the charge the higher the cation exchange capacity of the zeolite mumpton 1999 as regards the selectivity and the sorption capacity of the zeolite for different cations these are defined also by zeolite porosity pore size distribution and specific surface area furthermore natural zeolites from different deposits may vary widely in purity chemical composition crystal size porosity pore diameter and other properties determining their sorption and ion exchange capacity wang and peng 2010 therefore the high selectivity in zeolites is mainly given by the particular microporous rigid structure which can preferentially adsorb and accommodate different cations since geopolymers are considered as the amorphous counterpart of zeolites also their cation exchange capacity depends on the cations available for exchange and at the same time on the particular porosity developed during their synthesis in both adsorbents ammonium ions probably diffused easily in the interstices whilst other cations as na were impeded by the bigger hydrate shell and were thus incorporated more slowly ammonium possesses a small hydrated radius equal to about 0 15 nm sidey 2016 smaller than the typical size of the channels and nanopores that are respectively in natural zeolite 0 37 0 42 nm for chabazite 0 28 0 48 nm for phillipsite shoumkova 2011 and in g13 landi et al 2013 conversely the radiuses of the other hydrated cations are bigger israelachvili 2011 comparable to the size of the natural zeolite microchannels indicating that the exchange of these cations is likely to be limited by steric hindrance indeed the determining factor is the hydration energy smaller ions have a higher electric charge therefore they hydrate more easily and have a lower affinity for the exchanger explaining the elution order a second important aspect of comparison between the two adsorbents is their capacity and in particular the ammonium operating capacity that is the ammonium concentration that can be obtained in the adsorbent at the selected breakpoint in tests conducted in the presence of competing cations this performance parameter is influenced not only by the total cation capacity but also by the concentration in the tmww and by the adsorbent selectivity the expected effect of a higher operating capacity is a delayed breakpoint namely an increase of the number of bvs necessary to reach the concentration limit and this in turn reduces the treatment cost the number of bvs of treated tmww and the operating capacity of g13 at the selected breakpoint equal to 149 and 8 5 mgn g 1 of dry adsorbent resulted 72 and 67 higher than the corresponding values obtained with the natural zeolite 87 bvs operating capacity 5 1 mgn g 1 these operating capacities assessed in continuous flow conditions are lower than those estimated by means of the isotherm tests 9 3 mgn g 1 for g13 7 3 mgn g 1 for the natural zeolite since in continuous flow tests the adsorbent does not reach equilibrium in the whole bed nevertheless they confirm a significantly better performance of g13 with respect to the tested natural zeolite the adsorption yields were similar 97 for g13 99 for the natural zeolite a final important aspect to be investigated is the possibility to easily regenerate the adsorbent after each adsorption phase and recover a n rich desorbed product the adsorption columns were regenerated with kcl in the first bt test then a kno3 solution was used to obtain a desorbed product rich in nh4no3 a widespread fertilizer no differences were observed in the tests performed with cl or no3 as anions the concentrations of desorbed ammonium in the regenerant versus the number of bvs of the regenerant fed are shown in fig 3 a and b since g13 adsorbs cations more strongly than zeolite the desorption process was quite slow requiring 15 regenerant bvs to release 95 of the adsorbed n versus 4 bvs needed using the natural zeolite nevertheless the slow desorption of g13 highlights an important and positive feature of this material indeed fig 3b clearly shows that it is possible to separate a first desorbed fraction 5 bvs containing almost all the na and then collect separately a second fraction 6 16 bvs containing 91 of the total desorbed ammonium the mean n concentration in the second fraction was 0 75 gn l 1 a value 19 times higher than the initial n content of the mww 0 040 gn l 1 and that can be increased by further optimizing the desorption procedure indeed optimal desorption conditions can be identified by means of a trade off between the positive effect of the selective recover of ammonium with respect to sodium and the higher operational cost associated to the larger amount of regenerant needed the important result of this procedure is that the 2nd desorption fraction the actual product had a very low content of na 0 022 g l 1 a cation that should be minimized in fertilizers as it is harmful for several crops and for soil texture the concentrations in the desorbed liquid were multiplied by the desorbed volume to calculate the mass of cations contained in the product expressed as the mass of the corresponding salts the 2nd desorption fraction obtained from the test regenerated with kno3 was mainly made of kno3 56 wt and nh4no3 37 wt with a very low content in nano3 just 0 06 wt the remaining 7 wt being composed by other nitrates indeed the composition of the solid that can be obtained from the desorption solution is of vital importance in view of the reuse of the recovered product as a fertilizer the results showed that even without any further treatment the desorbed product obtained in this work had a high ammonium content and a very low sodium content therefore the combined effect of the very promising performance of g13 in terms of capacity and selectivity and the possibility that g13 allows to fraction the desorption product make g13 a very promising material for the optimization and scale up of the ammonium removal recovery process leading to a final product that can potentially be used as an ammonium rich nitrate based fertilizer due to a short range order of the structure duxon et al 2007 the amorphous nature of the mesoporous geopolymer affects the selectivity being the ion paths more tortuous than in a crystalline zeolite it follows that g13 differentiates cations better than the natural zeolite on the basis of the steric hindrance but the adsorption and desorption processes resulted slowed down 3 2 characterization of the adsorbent granules in addition to a high adsorption capacity and selectivity durability robustness and easiness of regeneration are key features of a successful adsorbent therefore g13 granules were characterized after seven adsorption regeneration cycles g13ar and compared to g13 and fresh natural zeolite in order to assess possible changes or degradation effects on the material 3 2 1 morphological chemical and textural characteristics the optical microscope pictures in fig 4 show as prepared natural zeolite g13 and g13ar granules although the same crushing and sieving procedure was used granules look very different zeolite granules have rounded edges with surface debris from softer phases fig 4b in fact natural zeolites are not homogenous in composition as they belong to a mineral deposit of volcanic origin differently g13 granules being a synthetized product are uniform with sharp edges fig 4c and clean fracture surfaces fig 4d typical of a material with a brittle fracture behavior notably after the adsorption regeneration cycles fig 4e f neither size nor shape changed the sharp edges were maintained and the surfaces remained integer no cracks formation preserving the rounded ultra macropores formed by entrapped air in the geopolymer slurry during casting fig 4d f fig 5 a shows the xrd pattern of the g13 geopolymer before and after the adsorption regeneration cycles showing no evidence of new phases in g13ar together with the typical amorphous hump centered around 27 2θ duxson et al 2007 provis et al 2005 and only few crystalline phases such as quartz 46 1045 and muscovite 34 0175 belonging to the starting metakaolin papa et al 2014 moreover atr ftir spectra fig 5b of g13 and g13ar almost overlap being the most significant bands typical of geopolymers papa et al 2022 superimposable also after adsorption regeneration cycles highlighting no modifications nor formation of new bonding signals in g13ar table 2 reports the si al and k al molar ratios zeolite has a higher si al ratio 2 6 than g13 1 9 while k al ratio 0 6 is half that of the geopolymer zeolite also contains ca2 with a ca al 0 3 it should be noted that the si al and k al ratios are calculated on the total quantity of elements present in the natural zeolite i e belonging to all the other minerals not taking part to the adsorption process in addition to chabazite and phillipsite which have respectively si al 2 and si al 2 2 shoumkova 2011 similarly to g13 in g13ar si al and k al ratios did not statistically change with values fixed on the theoretical ones in particular regarding electroneutrality of k al 1 davidovits 2008 being k the exchanged cation the poured and tapped true density specific surface area ssa and the main values obtained by mercury intrusion porosimetry mip are also reported in table 2 poured and tapped densities were higher for zeolite since these are related to granules shape and size instead true density was similar in g13 and natural zeolite but it slightly decreased in g13ar especially in terms of standard deviation as all the traces of unreacted potassium silicate were eliminated during repeated adsorption and regeneration cycles regarding porosity g13 and g13ar granules showed a total porosity of 50 and zeolite granules showed a value of 54 conversely concerning mip data in the range 0 0058 100 µm g13 granules showed an open porosity and a total pore volume higher than natural zeolite ones 43 and 363 mm3 g 1 compared to 30 and 259 mm3 g 1 respectively and they remained about constant in g13ar furthermore the pore size distributions were very different fig 6 for natural zeolite granules porosity was broadly distributed along the dimensional acquisition range with the average pore size diameter of 0 12 µm an order of magnitude smaller than the modal one 1 24 µm the most frequent pore size diameter conversely g13 and g13ar pore size distributions were monomodal with the average and the modal pore size diameter centered at 0 01 µm for g13 and at a slightly higher value for g13ar 0 03 µm both distributions showed pores in the range of 10 100 µm in accordance with the ultra macropores revealed on the fracture surfaces of the geopolymer granules fig 4 the assessment of the porosity in this range highlighted for both geopolymer and natural zeolite the presence of interconnected meso and macropores a crucial aspect to enable a fast mass transport and diffusion of cations towards the internal micropores chen et al 2016 furthermore the pore diameter is one of the most important features of adsorbent materials that would affect the adsorbent selectivity based on the diameter of the adsorbed material kumar et al 2012 the geopolymer selectivity is guarantee as the synthesis of the geopolymer is reproducible i e the final synthetic product maintains the same characteristics full geopolymerization porosity si al ratio etc however it is important to point out that the measurement does not include the natural zeolite s microporosity which is typically in the range of 0 37 0 42 nm for chabazite and 0 28 0 48 nm for phillipsite shoumkova 2011 conversely g13 is predominantly mesoporous with the majority of smallest pores in the range of 20 40 nm landi et al 2013 finally the specific surface area of natural zeolite is slightly higher than that of the geopolymer table 2 while it decreases from 77 m2 g 1 in fresh g13 to 51 m2 g 1 in g13ar 3 2 2 mechanical characterization the robustness of the g13ar granules after the adsorption regeneration cycles was investigated through the compaction of a bed of granules iso 18 591 standard and compared with the strength of the as prepared g13 and natural zeolite granules the mechanical durability of granules gives information on how much stresses the material can withstand during use antonyuk et al 2005 the average compressive strengths pc and density values ρc of the compacted granules are reported in table 2 fig 7 shows the relative density versus the logarithmic pressure diagram used for calculating the strength of the granules indeed the compressive strength was measured by locating the spot where the curve has the steepest curvature at the intercept of the two regression lines showed as an example in fig 7 järveläinen et al 2016 the granules are first packed and rearranged in the die in fact the initial relative density is equal to the poured density measured for the granules table 2 subsequently the point where relative density increases most rapidly while pressure increase is minimal is interpreted as the point of fracture of the granules järveläinen et al 2016 the compressive strength of as prepared g13 granules resulted higher than that of natural zeolite furthermore the adsorption regeneration cycles determined a marked increase in g13ar compressive strength and a decrease in experimental error demonstrating an improvement in mechanical performance the bed strength represents the overall strength of an average granule the result is affected by the possible irregular force distribution in the bed but in particular by size porosity and roughness of the granules antonyuk et al 2005 together with the granules shape and internal imperfections subero couroyer et al 2003 in bed compression the result is also affected by the size distribution of the granules and by the friction among them kwan et al 2015 järveläinen et al 2016 the granules are very different as shown in fig 4 the presence of sharp edges in g13 granules avoided a high particle packing therefore a higher pressure is required before failure occurs increasing the compressive strength values moreover granules strength can be affected by loading through a fatigue effect where a force below the granules strength may cause further hardening increasing the strength antonyuk et al 2010 as possibly in the case of g13ar after adsorption regeneration cycles 4 conclusions in view of a large scale use as a fertilizer of the recovered ammonium from wastewaters a metakaolin k based geopolymer g13 was compared to a natural zeolite composed of chabazite and phillipsite and activated in k form in terms of granules characterization and ammonium adsorption capacity an actual treated municipal wastewater was used in the tests conducted following a procedure that integrates batch isotherm tests and continuous flow adsorption desorption tests despite a lower specific surface area the g13 geopolymer resulted in a higher porosity and compressive strength in comparison with the natural zeolite the ammonium removal tests indicated significantly better performances of g13 in terms of selectivity towards ammonium operating capacity 8 5 mgn g 1 of dry adsorbent bed volumes of wastewater treated at the selected breakpoint 149 and possibility to obtain a fractionated desorbed product composed mainly by kno3 56 wt and nh4no3 37 wt with a negligible concentration of na 0 022 g l 1 harmful for several crops this product can potentially be used as a fertilizer in a circular economy perspective finally the geopolymer granules did not deteriorate in their mechanical morphological nor textural properties after repeated adsorption regeneration cycles highlighting the robustness of the selected material overall g13 resulted a very promising material for the optimization and scale up of the

15484,microbial co hosts of nitrate reduction genes nrgs and antibiotic resistance genes args have been recently reported but their ecology and biochemical role in urban waterways remain largely unknown here we collected 29 surface water and 29 sediment samples in the huangshui river on the qinghai tibet plateau during the wet and dry season and 11 water samples from wastewater treatment plants and wetlands along the river using metagenomic sequencing we retrieved 278 medium to high quality metagenome assembled genomes mags of nrg arg co hosts mainly belonging to the phyla proteobacteria actinobacteriota and bacteroidota of microorganisms carrying args a high proportion 75 3 94 9 also encoded nrgs supporting nitrate reducing bacteria as dominant hosts of args seasonal changes in antibiotic levels corresponded to significant variation in the relative abundance of nrg arg co host in both water and sediments resulting in a concomitant change in antibiotic resistance pathways in contrast the contribution of nrg arg co hosts to nitrate reduction was stable between seasons we identify specific antibiotics e g sulphonamides and microbial taxa e g acinetobacter and hafnia that may disproportionately impact these relationships to serve as a basis for laboratory investigations into bioremediation strategies our study suggests that highly abundant nitrate reducing microorganisms in contaminated environments may also directly impact human health as carriers of antibiotic resistance graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords urban river qinghai tibet plateau metagenome assembled genomes nitrate reduction antibiotic resistance sulphonamides data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the discharge of excess antibiotics into the river ecosystems has become a rising global concern ju et al 2019 larsson and flach 2022 zhang et al 2021a exposure to antibiotics influences microbial evolution and increases the prevalence of antibiotic resistance genes args emerging contaminants that may pose a substantial health risk previous studies reported an increase of arg abundance and diversity in wetlands yang et al 2019 soils wang et al 2022a wang et al 2022d and rivers liu et al 2021 on the plateau which was mainly attributed to elevated intensity of animal farming crop cultivation sewage discharge and tourism activity wang et al 2022a wang et al 2022d recent studies also found that args typically co occurred with nitrate reduction genes nrgs in microbial genomes especially in engineered systems with high antibiotic levels such as solid waste landfills wang et al 2021 and wastewater treatment plants wwtps yang et al 2020 yuan et al 2021 for instance wang et al 2021 found that bacterial species e g pseudomonas sp and bacillus sp co carried more than 86 6 of sequenced args with denitrification genes in leachates with high antibiotics concentrations of 5000 50 000 ng l and metals concentrations of 10 60 mg l moreover our previous study dang et al 2021 found the co occurrence of nrgs and args in common hosts particularly in denitrifying bacteria such as rhodoferax polaromonas and limnohabitans in a drinking water reservoir in china therefore an in depth understanding of nrg arg co host communities is essential to reveal the specific role of these unique species their links to biogeochemical nitrogen cycling and antibiotic resistance in natural ecosystems and their role in human health because containing the largest reserve of freshwater outside the polar regions the qinghai tibet plateau is recognized as the world s third pole providing versatile ecological services and feeding several large rivers e g the yellow river the yangtze river the brahmaputra the ganges immerzeel et al 2010 the huangshui river located in the northeastern qinghai tibetan plateau is the largest tributary of the upper yellow river our previous study kuang et al 2020 investigated 83 antibiotics in surface water and sediment from this river and detected 53 antibiotics with relatively low concentrations 552 ng l in water and 164 ng g in sediments for the individual antibiotics hence we collected surface water and sediment samples along the huangshui river during the wet and dry seasons associated with low and high antibiotic concentrations respectively we hypothesized that nitrate reducing bacteria are dominant hosts of args and nrg arg co hosts that illustrate seasonal variation in nitrate reduction pathways and antibiotic resistance mechanisms associated with changes in antibiotic levels to test this we 1 identified the metagenome assembled genome mag of nrg arg co hosts 2 explored the seasonal variation i e biomarkers and taxa in the composition and relative abundance of nrg arg co

qinghai province with a catchment area of more than 3200 km2 and a total length of 374 km wang et al 2022b xu et al 2022 it flows through the main urban areas of xining city the capital of the qinghai province with a population of more than 2 million along its path there are six sewage wwtps with treatment capacities of 15 000 100 000 m3 d and two engineered wetlands beichuan and ninghu the

wl1 and effluent wl2 monitoring sites in the beichuan wetland and influent wl3 inside wl4 and effluent wl5 monitoring sites in the ninghu wetland the effluents of wwtps and wetlands are discharged into the huangshui river surface water and sediment samples of the huangshui river were collected in july 2018 wet season and april 2019 dry season fig 1 and table s1 there were no major rainfalls or other surface flow runoffs during 15 days before our sampling periods tables s2 s3 in the wet season we collected samples at seven stations m1 m2 m3 m5 m6 m7 and m10 in the mainstream and five

wwtps ew1 ew6 and five water samples from wetlands wl1 wl5 in the dry season to evaluate their impacts according to the location of sample sites along with the composition of their microbial communities wang et al 2022b we considered m1 m2 m3 t1 t2 t5 t6 and t7 as effluent unaffected reach and others m4 m5 m6 m7 m8 m9 m10 t3 and t4 in the mainstream and tributaries as effluent affected reach in total we collected 12 water and 12 sediments samples in the wet season and 28 water and 17 sediment samples in the dry season for metagenomic analysis 10 l water samples were collected into sterile pet bottles stored at 4 c and then filtered through 0 22 μm polycarbonate membranes millipore us within 24 h of sample collection the filtered membranes and well mixed sedimental samples 0 5 g

wang et al 2022b xu et al 2022 antibiotic levels in the water and sediment samples were retrieved from our previous study kuang et al 2020 specifically we detected 83 antibiotics tables s6 s7 covering

extraction and illumina sequencing we extracted the total genomic dna from 2 filtered membranes for water samples or 0 5 g of well mixed sediments in duplicate using the fastdna spin kit for soil mp biomedicals us following the manufacturer s protocol then the duplicate dna extracts were mixed and the dna quantity and quality were determined using a nanodrop spectrophotometer nanodrop technologies inc us we sequenced metagenomic dna on the illumina hiseq 4000 platform majorbio company china with 2 150 bp paired end reads the sequencing obtained 16 billion raw reads with the length of 150 bp for 69 metagenomic samples with the average of 239 million per sample and the range of 205 302 million table s8 we have submitted the sequence data to ncbi sequence read archive under the accession number prjna790652 2 3 calculation of nfg abundances raw reads were trimmed by the metawrap read qc module uritskiy et al 2018 default parameters to generate clean reads the nitrogen functional genes nfgs dang et al 2021 from the clean reads were annotated using the ncycdb database an integrative database for profiling n cycle gene families tu et al 2019 the cell numbers were calculated using args oap v2 0 yin et al 2018 which estimated cell numbers by using the average coverage of 30 essential single copy gene escg families the nfgs abundance was also normalized using the cell numbers in each sample based on escg families representing the relative abundance nfg copies cell numbers according to the ncycdb database we classified nfgs into eight categories including 1 nitrification 2 denitrification 3 assimilatory nitrate reduction 4 dissimilatory nitrate reduction 5 nitrogen fixation 6 anammox 7 biosynthesis and biodegradation and 8 others genes involved in the denitrification no2 n n2 assimilatory nitrate reduction no3 n nh4 n dissimilatory nitrate reduction no3 n no2 n and no3 n nh4 n pathways were uniformly referenced as nitrate reduction genes nrgs in our study 2 4 genome binning and quality control of metagenome assembled genomes metagenomic sequencing reads were processed with the complete metawrap v1 2 3 uritskiy et al 2018 pipeline with recommended databases clean reads from all samples were individually assembled with the metawrap assembly module megahit l 500 options then the contigs acquired from the assembly were binned with the metawrap binning module maxbin2 concoct metabat2 options using two halves of clean reads for differential coverage information resulting in three bin sets at last three bin sets were consolidated into a final bin set with metawrap bin refinement module c 70 x 10 options which automatically picked the highest score one and dereplicated the contigs in the final bin set we assessed the completeness and contamination of each mag using checkm v1 1 2 parks et al 2015 we chose mags with at least 70 completeness and less than 10 contamination for the following analysis 2 5 nrg and arg hosts identification metagenemark v3 38 was applied to find the open reading frames orfs of the mags zhu et al 2010 the mags harboring args arg hosts were identified based on structured antibiotic resistance genes sarg database yin et al 2018 a gene sequence was annotated as an arg if its best hit showed a similarity higher than 75 and a bitscore higher than 60 jing and yan 2020 the identified args were assigned to types and subtypes based on the structure list in args oap the resistance mechanisms of args were determined by the comprehensive antibiotic resistance database card alcock et al 2020 the mags carrying nrgs nrg hosts were annotated using blastkoala kanehisa et al 2016 and eggnog mapper in diamond mode huerta cepas et al 2017 finally 278 mags simultaneously carrying nrg and arg nrg arg co hosts were retrieved from all the 69 samples the taxonomic position of 278 mags was determined according to the genome taxonomy database gtdb using gtdb tk v1 3 0 parks et al 2018 the taxonomic classification of each genome was generated using the gtdb tk classify wf module the output file containing multiple sequence alignments of submitted genomes was used to generate the phylogenetic tree using fasttree v2 1 1126 price et al 2009 wag gamma quote options the generated phylogenetic tree was visualized with interactive tree of life itol v6 4 letunic and bork 2021 we identified mobile genetic elements mges by using the orf annotation results of 278 mags and matching strings with one of the following keywords conjugal conjugative integrase integron mobilization plasmid recombinase recombination transposase and transposon dang et al 2020 a benchmarked set of 37 elite marker genes emgs darling et al 2014 of 278 mags were combined into a single database for abundance evaluation liu et al 2020 the clean reads of all samples were then mapped onto this database using bbmap v38 86 https sourceforge net projects bbmap minid 0 9 ambig random options the estimated mag abundance was normalized using reads numbers of each sample si section 1 2 6 statistical analysis bray curtis dissimilarity between samples was visualized using canonical correlation analysis cca anosim was performed to test the differences of nrg arg co hosts between seasons both cca and anosim were conducted using the vegan r package we identified the differential nfgs and nrg arg host community at phylum level between seasons using stamp based on t tests with an adjusted false discovery rate parks et al 2014 lefse was performed to identify the high dimensional biomarkers and explain the taxa difference between seasons using logarithmic lda threshold 3 5 and statistical parameters of p 0 05 segata et al 2011 rf analysis was performed using the rfpermute r package to predict the contribution of environmental factors and antibiotics in the abundance and composition of nrg arg co hosts we evaluated the model significance and cross validation r2 by 1000 permutations of response variables with the a3 package spearman s correlation coefficients were calculated among nrg arg co hosts and antibiotic types using r4 1 1 and visualized through correlation heatmaps using the pheatmap r package source tracker analysis was conducted using the sourcetracker r package https github com danknights sourcetracker to reveal the contributions of nrg arg co hosts in the e wwtps and wetlands to those in the water and sediments of the huangshui river knights et al 2011 to evaluate the role of nrg arg co hosts in whole bacterial communities we constructed a co occurrence network of nrg arg co hosts with other bacterial genera using cytoscape v3 8 2 shannon et al 2003 by only including the strong pearson s r 0 80 and significant fdr adjusted p 0 01 correlations 3 results and discussion 3 1 nitrate reduction pathways nitrate reduction pathways dominated nitrogen cycling processes in the huangshui river and were primarily comprised of denitrification and dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium dnra based on the ncycdb database tu et al 2019 we identified 69 nfgs in the water and sediments fig s3a si section 2 notably nfgs involved in nitrate reduction and biosynthesis and biodegradation pathways were prominently dominant in both water and sediments fig s5 with the highest abundance of nfgs in biosynthesis and biodegradation because genes encoding biosynthesis and biodegradation were mostly related to assimilatory metabolisms we concluded nitrate reduction pathways were the predominate nitrogen cycling in the huangshui river dang et al 2021 rathour et al 2020 among nitrate reduction pathways genes involved in nitrate reduction to nitrite no3 n no2 n had the highest abundance 11 3 3 17 copies cell in water and 14 4 3 25 copies cell in sediments fig s6 followed by genes of dissimilatory nitrate reduction no3 n nh4 n 5 44 1 28 copies cell in water and 7 74 1 70 copies cell in sediments and nitrite reduction to nitrogen no2 n n2 5 23 2 08 copies cell in water and 7 28 1 73 copies cell in sediments this result suggested the dominance of denitrification and dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium dnra in nitrate reduction pathways in the huangshui river 3 2 nitrate reduction bacteria as dominant hosts of args nitrate reducing bacteria were the primary hosts of args in the huangshui river we found that 278 out of 401 69 3 arg carrying mags simultaneously harbored nrgs fig 2 a in detail we retrieved 2259 medium high quality mags from all the 69 samples and further identified 1561 nrg carrying and 401 arg carrying mags among these mags 278 mags co carried nrgs and args with genome sizes of 1 2 7 9 mb and gc contents of 27 5 72 0 table s9 based on the genome taxonomy database gtdb 278 mags spanned 10 phyla 12 classes 31 orders 54 families and 81 genera figs 2b and c whereas 1 1 15 and 187 mags were not assigned to a known order family genera and species respectively suggesting 67 3 of the nrg arg co hosts with the potential affiliation of new species although we acknowledge that sequence based phylogenetic assignment to the species level is often challenging castelle and banfield 2018 at phylum level proteobacteria 193 mags actinobacteriota 33 mags firmicutes 28 mags and bacteroidota 10 mags were predominant in the nrg arg co hosts fig 2b gammaproteobacteria was the most abundant class of proteobacteria 176 mags which were further assigned to the burkholderiales pseudomonadales enterobacterales xanthomonadales legionellales and thiotrichales orders among these organisms burkholderials and pseudomonadales have been previously identified as keystone aerobic denitrifying bacteria in lakes zhou et al 2020 and dominant arg hosts in wwtps zhang et al 2021b zhao et al 2020 while enterobacterales and xanthomonadales are known to be arg hosts zhang et al 2021b but are rarely reported as carrying nrgs at genus level the co host community was dominated by acinetobacter 13 3 hafnia 12 6 pseudomonas e 7 6 and stenotrophomonas 5 6 in the water whereas rhodoferax 7 9 arenimonas 7 9 and hydrogenophaga 7 1 were the most abundant genera in the sediments though the arg hosts in different aquatic ecosystems were dominantly affiliated with phyla proteobacteria actinobacteria and bacteroidetes the host community composition was quite different at the genus level in the yangtze river limnohabitans acidimicrobium and candidatus methylopumilus were major planktonic hosts and methylotenera and flavobacterium dominated the sedimentary hosts wang et al 2022c whereas nitrospira and clostridium were relatively common arg hosts in wastewater and urban rivers guan et al 2022 jia et al 2017 these results suggested the importance of environmental selection in shaping arg hosts arg mge co carrying mags were mainly assigned to proteobacteria 26 mags followed by bacteroidota 4 mags actinobacteriota 2 mags and firmicutes 2 mags indicating that proteobacteria might represent a potential conduit for arg dissemination mges usually showed positive correlation with most args in aquatic environment zheng et al 2017 and the distribution of mges played a crucial role in shaping the arg profile chen et al 2019 yu et al 2022 we further identified 50 args from 34 out of 278 12 2 host mags that were located near 10 kb the mobile gene elements mges yuan et al 2021 including 10 args directly adjacent to putative mges on the same contigs in 9 mags table s10 ellabaan et al 2021 jiang et al 2017 mges in the neighborhood of args are more prone to capture and horizontally transfer args to other bacterial species ellabaan et al 2021 zhao et al 2020 the ratio of arg mge adjacent mags was lower than that in urban wwtps 19 8 yuan et al 2021 suggesting a relatively lower possibility of horizontal gene transfer hgt in urban rivers arg annotation revealed that 39 6 of nrg arg co hosts encoded multi resistant genes 110 mags whereas 60 4 encoded resistance to a single antibiotic 168 mags the 278 nrg arg co hosts carried 125 arg subtypes encoding resistance functions of 18 antibiotic types fig 2c and tables s11 s12 args against bacitracin 135 mags 48 6 and multidrug 101 mags 36 3 were observed to be two most frequent resistance types followed by args against beta lactam 39 mags 14 0 and unclassified types 40mags 14 4 the most frequent nrg carried by nrg arg hosts was nirb 161 mags 57 9 involved in dissimilatory nitrite reduction to ammonia followed by genes of nari narv 156 mags 56 1 narj narw 149 mags 53 6 narh nvi 147 mags 52 9 and narg narz 138 mags 49 6 table s13 involved in nitrate reduction to nitrite further gene arrangement analysis revealed a few contigs of nrg arg co hosts harboring both nitrate reduction genes and args fig s7 such adjacent gene positions might simultaneously evolve nrgs and args and increase their co expression resulting in nrg arg co hosts as important antibiotic tolerant players ribeiro et al 2021 3 3 seasonal variation of nrg arg co hosts the relative abundance and composition of the nrg arg co host community varied significantly between wet and dry seasons in both water and sediments figs 3 and s8 9 si section 3 cca analysis based on bray curtis distances showed that samples from different seasons separated from each other further analysis revealed that the average relative abundance of nrg arg co hosts in the water in the dry season 0 876 0 518 was two fold higher than that in the wet season 0 441 0 152 the difference in the sediments was much lower and the relative abundance in the dry season 0 481 0 159 was one third higher than that in the wet season 0 342 0 105 several studies have found seasonal changes in arg host abundance and diversity as well as args in natural aquatic systems dang et al 2020 yu et al 2022 zhang et al 2022 zheng et al 2018 with higher abundance in dry season than wet season the higher abundance of co hosts in the dry season might be due to the higher abundance of arg and arg hosts which was probably caused by higher antibiotics levels chen et al 2019 dang et al 2020 zheng et al 2017 and greater hgt potential mediated by mges dang et al 2020 yu et al 2022 zhang et al 2022 zheng et al 2018 these changes in community composition were reflected in specific biomarker taxa across seasons in the water and sediment we identified 63 and 42 taxa as biomarkers of seasonal nrg arg co hosts in the water lefse p 0 05 lda 3 5 fig 3c and sediment lefse p 0 05 lda 3 0 fig 3d respectively in the water the most significant biomarkers of nrg arg co hosts were members of actinobacteriota and firmicutes in the dry season and of campylobacterota planctomycetota and proteobacteria in the wet season the relative abundance of biomarkers in the dry season was much higher than those in the wet season in the sediments the most significant biomarkers were members of firmicutes and desulfobacterota in the dry season and of the alphaproteobacteria class in the wet season the occurrence frequency between seasons varied significantly for args paired t test p 0 0355 in water paired t test p 0 0464 in sediments fig 3b but not significantly for nrgs paired t test p 0 4254 in water paired t test p 0 2719 in sediments fig 3b in biomarker mags for instance the average occurrence frequencies among four sample types were 36 5 45 6 for narghij genes involving nitrate reduction to nitrite in biomarker genomes most biomarker mags encoded multidrug genes 29 0 in the dry season but mainly encoded bacitracin 41 9 and sulfonamide 37 0 genes in the wet season previous studies also found the prevalence of multidrug genes in the dry season and the dominance of bacitracin genes in the wet season wang et al 2022c zhang et al 2022 mainly triggered by a variety of inducers including of antibiotics dyes and detergents blanco et al 2016 moreover the antibiotic resistance mechanisms of args in nrg arg co hosts primarily included enzyme inactivation target alteration and efflux pump with 37 2 21 9 and 54 8 in dry season and 10 7 21 9 and 41 1 in wet season table s14 this result indicated seasonal variation of antibiotic resistant mechanisms in the nrg arg co hosts which could possibly be attributed to the discrepancy in gene subtypes encoded by the hosts zhang et al 2021c 3 4 factors influencing nrg arg co hosts antibiotic level co varied with seasonality and played a prominent role in shaping the nrg arg co hosts in both water and sediments of the huangshui river rf analysis suggested that the most important determinants of the overall relative abundance of nrg arg co hosts were in the order of sulphonamides sas no2 dissolved oxygen tetracyclines tcs water temperature β lactams β ls quinolones qns in the water fig 4 a and sas tp nh4 in the sediments fig 4b we also found a significant linear and positive correlation between the overall relative abundance of nrg arg co hosts and total antibiotic level in both water r 0 4664 p 0 0108 fig 4c and sediment r 0 4533 p 0 0135 fig 4d which further confirmed the importance of antibiotics in influencing the relative abundance of nrg arg co hosts moreover we found significant and positive correlations between five dominant genera i e acinetobacter hafnia limnohabitans acidovorax b and rahnella and all studied antibiotic types except tcs in the water in the sediments one dominant genera e g trichococcus was significantly and positively correlated to all studied antibiotic types fig s10 overall these results indicated a positive influence of antibiotics on the relative abundance of the nrg arg co hosts in both water and sediments of the huangshui river notably the positive relationship was further observed between the relative abundance of nrg hosts and total antibiotic levels in both water y 0 0000015x 0 0008 pearson r 0 6571 p 0 0001 and sediments y 0 0000046x 0 0006 pearson r 0 5598 p 0 0016 fig s11 the similar correlation also existed between the relative abundance of arg hosts and total antibiotic level in both water r 0 4832 p 0 0079 fig 4c and sediment r 0 4659 p 0 0109 fig 4d it has been widely reported that sub lethal concentrations of antibiotics might change the composition of bacterial communities and contribute to increased arg hosts danner et al 2019 harms et al 2016 yang et al 2018 for nitrate reduction stimulation rather than inhibition would occur due to the phenomenon of hormesis laureti et al 2013 stimulatory effects of various types of antibiotics on nitrogen cycling have been observed in different matrices such as sulfamethazine sulfamethoxazole gentamicin and narasin on denitrification in the soil devries et al 2015 fluoroquinolones on denitrification in groundwater zou et al 2019 and amoxicillin on denitrification in compost liu et al 2019 intriguingly wwtp and wetlands along the huangshui river potentially served a critical role in propagating the nrg carrying mags and nrg arg co hosts we found that the relative abundances of nrg carrying mags in effluent affected reach were significantly higher than those in effluent unaffected reach in both water paired t test p 0 0007 fig 4e and sediments paired t test p 0 0085 fig 4f the average relative abundance of nrg arg co hosts was greatest in wetlands 1 2 0 4 in water followed by the immediate downstream effluent affected reach 0 6 0 3 in water 0 3 0 1 in sediments then e wwtps 0 4 0 2 in water and finally the effluent unaffected reach 0 2 0 1 in water 0 2 0 1 in sediments the relative abundance of nrg arg co hosts in wetlands was significantly higher paired t test p 0 05 fig s12a than those in other sample types and the abundances in effluent affected reach were significantly higher than those in effluent unaffected reach in both water paired t test p 0 0158 fig s12a and sediments paired t test p 0 0014 fig s12b further source tracker analysis showed that e wwtps and wetlands contributed to 29 4 and 26 0 of variation in nrg arg co host community structure in the monitoring stations adjacent to wwtps and wetlands fig s13 wwtps are currently viewed as hotspots of antibiotics and arg hosts cacace et al 2019 jiang et al 2014 wang et al 2020 and resulted in increase in args and mges in effluent affected reach teixeira et al 2022 previous study jia et al 2017 reported that tetracycline and aminoglycoside resistance genes dominated in the wastewater and the abundances of these genes obviously increased in the receiving river water caused by the wastewater discharge proia et al 2016 found a significant increase of the concentrations of macrolides and sulfonamides resistance genes in the downstream of wwtp discharge points in addition we found greater abundance of arg mge co carrying mags in wetlands e wwtps and effluent affected reach than effluent unaffected reach fig s14 suggesting that wwtps and wetlands along the river might enhance the mobility potential of args mediated by mges in the river conco et al 2022 goulas et al 2020 osinska et al 2020 our study concluded that wwtps and wetlands along the huangshui river played an essential role in propagating nrg arg co hosts throughout river networks possibly due to their discharge of antibiotics kuang et al 2020 and nrg arg carrying bacteria to the receiving water 3 5 possible roles of nrg arg hosts in nitrate reduction and antibiotic resistance network analysis at the genus level found that 64 genera of nrg arg co hosts exhibited strong and significant correlations with 198 genera of 19 phyla suggesting the important role of nrg arg co hosts in whole bacteria community nrg arg co hosts were strongly correlated proteobacteria 56 genera actinobacteriota 51 genera and bacteroidota phyla 41 genera fig s15 which were observed to be the dominant phyla relative abundance 15 number of mags 450 in whole bacterial community of the huangshui river microbial community plays an important role in the composition of args in most aquatic ecosystems which might be the possible reason for the strong correlation between the dominant species and nrg arg co hosts zhao et al 2019 the average relative abundance of nrg arg co hosts involved in each nitrate reduction pathway showed significant seasonal variations in both water anosim global r 0 14 p 0 0211 and sediments global r 0 16 p 0 0242 fig 5 a and table s15 but the overall metabolic profiles of nitrate reduction i e contribution of denitrification dnra and anammox to nitrogen removal was similar across seasons global r 0 081 p 0 0882 fig 5b in the water the average relative abundance of nrg arg co hosts involved in each nitrogen reduction pathway in the dry season was almost 2 fold higher than that in the wet season corresponding to elevated antibiotic loadings a similar increase was observed in the sediments in the dry season fig 5a further analysis revealed that the fraction of nrg arg co hosts in total nrg hosts in each nitrate reduction pathway showed little difference 10 between seasons in both water and sediments fig 5b suggesting the contribution of nrg arg co hosts to nitrate reduction changed slightly between seasons in addition we found higher nitrate reduction rate in the dry season compared with wet season fig s16 dry season had lower temperature paired t test p 0 0001 and higher abundance of nrg hosts paired t test p 0 0070 compared with wet season this result possibly indicated a more important role for nrg hosts than water temperature in nitrate reduction rate the antibiotic resistance mechanisms of the nrg arg co hosts in the dry season water inferred from gene annotations was significantly different from other three sample groups fig 5c the antibiotic resistance mechanisms were dominated by 60 6 of efflux pumps in dry season water 57 4 of target alternation in wet season water and 50 6 and 60 4 of target alternation in the dry and wet season sediments respectively due to high relative abundance of mags encoding multi resistant genes fig s17 the water in the dry season illustrated highest relative abundance of args with efflux pumps 60 6 which was higher than that of an urban river 30 0 zhou et al 2017 and a reservoir 37 9 guo et al 2018 but lower than that of soils 86 2 chen et al 2017 efflux pumps actively move antibiotics through a cell s cytoplasmic membrane to prevent the antibiotic accumulation up to inhibitory concentrations in hosts jiang et al 2018 bacteria usually acquire resistance to tetracycline collins et al 2016 macrolide lincosamide streptogramin zhang et al 2016 and or multiple drugs spengler et al 2017 via genes encoding efflux pumps considering relatively higher antibiotic levels in the dry season we infer that the increase in efflux pump related genes could enhance antibiotic resistance and maintain bacterial survival li and nikaido 2009 webber and piddock 2003 3 6 limitations in our study we interpreted the relative read abundance as the relative abundance of microbes however the processes of dna extraction sequencing quality control assembly and binning in our study could introduce the biases in the abundance of functional genes lamb et al 2019 yang et al 2021 specifically costea et al 2017 reported dna extraction with the largest effect on the outcome of metagenomic analysis compared to library preparation and sample storage though qa qc is not commonly included in the metagenomic analysis and mags quantitation levy booth et al 2021 nayfach et al 2019 using mock microbial communities with individually cultured microbes combined at known abundances as reference standards will potentially reduce the biases during metagenomic analysis processes han et al 2020 tourlousse et al 2022 therefore the lack of standard samples as controls potentially compromised the quantitative relationship in our study to some extent butler et al 2022 though we compared three normalization methods in the quantitative interpretations 4 conclusions our study retrieved 278 medium to high quality mags co carrying nrgs and args in water and sediments from the huangshui river in the qinghai tibet plateau during the wet and dry seasons the water and sediment samples in dry season had significantly higher antibiotic levels compared to wet season nrg arg co hosts experienced seasonal variation in their relative abundance and composition we observed positive correlations between the loadings of antibiotics i e sas tcs and tp and the relative abundance of nrg arg co hosts in both water and sediments putatively indicating a crucial role of antibiotics in shaping the nrg arg co hosts in addition effluents from wwtps and wetlands contributed to 29 4 and 26 0 of the variation in downstream nrg arg co hosts suggesting their promoting effect on the relative abundance of nrg arg co hosts most importantly we found that the relative abundance of nrg arg co hosts accounted for more than 75 3 94 9 of arg hosts implying that nitrate reducing bacteria carrying args could hold critical roles in protecting nitrogen cycles from antibiotic stress in the huangshui river compared with the wet season the dry season with higher antibiotic levels contained nrg arg co hosts at higher average relative abundance across all nitrate reduction pathways but the percentage of nrg arg co hosts in nrg hosts in each nitrate reduction pathway was similar between seasons overall we demonstrate the importance of nitrate reducing microorganisms previously recognized for their role in wastewater remediation as the primary carriers of args in an urban river thereby suggesting a need to carefully couple management strategies for nitrogen and antibiotic pollution credit authorship contribution statement jinyun hu conceptualization methodology

15484,microbial co hosts of nitrate reduction genes nrgs and antibiotic resistance genes args have been recently reported but their ecology and biochemical role in urban waterways remain largely unknown here we collected 29 surface water and 29 sediment samples in the huangshui river on the qinghai tibet plateau during the wet and dry season and 11 water samples from wastewater treatment plants and wetlands along the river using metagenomic sequencing we retrieved 278 medium to high quality metagenome assembled genomes mags of nrg arg co hosts mainly belonging to the phyla proteobacteria actinobacteriota and bacteroidota of microorganisms carrying args a high proportion 75 3 94 9 also encoded nrgs supporting nitrate reducing bacteria as dominant hosts of args seasonal changes in antibiotic levels corresponded to significant variation in the relative abundance of nrg arg co host in both water and sediments resulting in a concomitant change in antibiotic resistance pathways in contrast the contribution of nrg arg co hosts to nitrate reduction was stable between seasons we identify specific antibiotics e g sulphonamides and microbial taxa e g acinetobacter and hafnia that may disproportionately impact these relationships to serve as a basis for laboratory investigations into bioremediation strategies our study suggests that highly abundant nitrate reducing microorganisms in contaminated environments may also directly impact human health as carriers of antibiotic resistance graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords urban river qinghai tibet plateau metagenome assembled genomes nitrate reduction antibiotic resistance sulphonamides data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the discharge of excess antibiotics into the river ecosystems has become a rising global concern ju et al 2019 larsson and flach 2022 zhang et al 2021a exposure to antibiotics influences microbial evolution and increases the prevalence of antibiotic resistance genes args emerging contaminants that may pose a substantial health risk previous studies reported an increase of arg abundance and diversity in wetlands yang et al 2019 soils wang et al 2022a wang et al 2022d and rivers liu et al 2021 on the plateau which was mainly attributed to elevated intensity of animal farming crop cultivation sewage discharge and tourism activity wang et al 2022a wang et al 2022d recent studies also found that args typically co occurred with nitrate reduction genes nrgs in microbial genomes especially in engineered systems with high antibiotic levels such as solid waste landfills wang et al 2021 and wastewater treatment plants wwtps yang et al 2020 yuan et al 2021 for instance wang et al 2021 found that bacterial species e g pseudomonas sp and bacillus sp co carried more than 86 6 of sequenced args with denitrification genes in leachates with high antibiotics concentrations of 5000 50 000 ng l and metals concentrations of 10 60 mg l moreover our previous study dang et al 2021 found the co occurrence of nrgs and args in common hosts particularly in denitrifying bacteria such as rhodoferax polaromonas and limnohabitans in a drinking water reservoir in china therefore an in depth understanding of nrg arg co host communities is essential to reveal the specific role of these unique species their links to biogeochemical nitrogen cycling and antibiotic resistance in natural ecosystems and their role in human health because containing the largest reserve of freshwater outside the polar regions the qinghai tibet plateau is recognized as the world s third pole providing versatile ecological services and feeding several large rivers e g the yellow river the yangtze river the brahmaputra the ganges immerzeel et al 2010 the huangshui river located in the northeastern qinghai tibetan plateau is the largest tributary of the upper yellow river our previous study kuang et al 2020 investigated 83 antibiotics in surface water and sediment from this river and detected 53 antibiotics with relatively low concentrations 552 ng l in water and 164 ng g in sediments for the individual antibiotics hence we collected surface water and sediment samples along the huangshui river during the wet and dry seasons associated with low and high antibiotic concentrations respectively we hypothesized that nitrate reducing bacteria are dominant hosts of args and nrg arg co hosts that illustrate seasonal variation in nitrate reduction pathways and antibiotic resistance mechanisms associated with changes in antibiotic levels to test this we 1 identified the metagenome assembled genome mag of nrg arg co hosts 2 explored the seasonal variation i e biomarkers and taxa in the composition and relative abundance of nrg arg co hosts 3 examined the contribution of environmental factors antibiotics the effluents of wwtps e wwtps and wetlands in the composition and relative abundance of nrg arg co hosts and 4 unveiled the possible role of nrg arg co hosts in nitrate reduction and antibiotic resistance 2 materials and methods 2 1 sample collection and analyses the huangshui river originates in the baohutu mountain of qinghai province with a catchment area of more than 3200 km2 and a total length of 374 km wang et al 2022b xu et al 2022 it flows through the main urban areas of xining city the capital of the qinghai province with a population of more than 2 million along its path there are six sewage wwtps with treatment capacities of 15 000 100 000 m3 d and two engineered wetlands beichuan and ninghu the beichuan wetland is a bypath for improving the water quality of the huangshui river while the ninghu wetland with a capacity of 20 000 m3 d is used for further treating the e wwtps there are inside wl1 and effluent wl2 monitoring sites in the beichuan wetland and influent wl3 inside wl4 and effluent wl5 monitoring sites in the ninghu wetland the effluents of wwtps and wetlands are discharged into the huangshui river surface water and sediment samples of the huangshui river were collected in july 2018 wet season and april 2019 dry season fig 1 and table s1 there were no major rainfalls or other surface flow runoffs during 15 days before our sampling periods tables s2 s3 in the wet season we collected samples at seven stations m1 m2 m3 m5 m6 m7 and m10 in the mainstream and five stations t1 t2 t5 t6 and t7 in the tributaries we collected samples at ten stations m1 m10 in the mainstream and seven stations t1 t7 in the tributaries in the dry season moreover we collected six e wwtps ew1 ew6 and five water samples from wetlands wl1 wl5 in the dry season to evaluate their impacts according to the location of sample sites along with the composition of their microbial communities wang et al 2022b we considered m1 m2 m3 t1 t2 t5 t6 and t7 as effluent unaffected reach and others m4 m5 m6 m7 m8 m9 m10 t3 and t4 in the mainstream and tributaries as effluent affected reach in total we collected 12 water and 12 sediments samples in the wet season and 28 water and 17 sediment samples in the dry season for metagenomic analysis 10 l water samples were collected into sterile pet bottles stored at 4 c and then filtered through 0 22 μm polycarbonate membranes millipore us within 24 h of sample collection the filtered membranes and well mixed sedimental samples 0 5 g were frozen at 80 c before dna extraction we determined the levels of toc nh4 n no2 n no3 n tn and tp in the water and sediment samples tables s4 s5 using the methods described in our previous studies wang et al 2022b xu et al 2022 antibiotic levels in the water and sediment samples were retrieved from our previous study kuang et al 2020 specifically we detected 83 antibiotics tables s6 s7 covering

extraction and illumina sequencing we extracted the total genomic dna from 2 filtered membranes for water samples or 0 5 g of well mixed sediments in duplicate using the fastdna spin kit for soil mp biomedicals us following the manufacturer s protocol then the duplicate dna extracts were mixed and the dna quantity and quality were determined using a nanodrop spectrophotometer nanodrop technologies inc us we sequenced metagenomic dna on the illumina hiseq 4000 platform majorbio company china with 2 150 bp paired end reads the sequencing obtained 16 billion raw reads with the length of 150 bp for 69 metagenomic samples with the average of 239 million per sample and the range of 205 302 million table s8 we have submitted the sequence data to ncbi sequence read archive under the accession number prjna790652 2 3 calculation of nfg abundances raw reads were trimmed by the metawrap read qc module uritskiy et al 2018 default parameters to generate clean reads the nitrogen functional genes nfgs dang et al 2021 from the clean reads were annotated using the ncycdb database an integrative database for profiling n cycle gene families tu et al 2019 the cell numbers were calculated using args oap v2 0 yin et al 2018 which estimated cell numbers by using the average coverage of 30 essential single copy gene escg families the nfgs abundance was also normalized using the cell numbers in each sample based on escg families representing the relative abundance nfg copies cell numbers according to the ncycdb database we classified nfgs into eight categories including 1 nitrification 2 denitrification 3 assimilatory nitrate reduction 4 dissimilatory nitrate reduction 5 nitrogen fixation 6 anammox 7 biosynthesis and biodegradation and 8 others genes involved in the denitrification no2 n n2 assimilatory nitrate reduction no3 n nh4 n dissimilatory nitrate reduction no3 n no2 n and no3 n nh4 n pathways were uniformly referenced as nitrate reduction genes nrgs in our study 2 4 genome binning and quality control of metagenome assembled genomes metagenomic sequencing reads were processed with the complete metawrap v1 2 3 uritskiy et al 2018 pipeline with recommended databases clean reads from all samples were individually assembled with the metawrap assembly module megahit l 500 options then the contigs acquired from the assembly were binned with the metawrap binning module maxbin2 concoct metabat2 options using two halves of clean reads for differential coverage information resulting in three bin sets at last three bin sets were consolidated into a final bin set with metawrap bin refinement module c 70 x 10 options which automatically picked the highest score one and dereplicated the contigs in the final bin set we assessed the completeness and contamination of each mag using checkm v1 1 2 parks et al 2015 we chose mags with at least 70 completeness and less than 10 contamination for the following analysis 2 5 nrg and arg hosts identification metagenemark v3 38 was applied to find the open reading frames orfs of the mags zhu et al 2010 the mags harboring args arg hosts were identified based on structured antibiotic resistance genes sarg database yin et al 2018 a gene sequence was annotated as an arg if its best hit showed a similarity higher than 75 and a bitscore higher than 60 jing and yan 2020 the identified args were assigned to types and subtypes based on the structure list in args oap the resistance mechanisms of args were determined by the comprehensive antibiotic resistance database card alcock et al 2020 the mags carrying nrgs nrg hosts were annotated using blastkoala kanehisa et al 2016 and eggnog mapper in diamond mode huerta cepas et al 2017 finally 278 mags simultaneously carrying nrg and arg nrg arg co hosts were retrieved from all the 69 samples the taxonomic position of 278 mags was determined according to the genome taxonomy database gtdb using gtdb tk v1 3 0 parks et al 2018 the taxonomic classification of each genome was generated using the gtdb tk classify wf module the output file containing multiple sequence alignments of submitted genomes was used to generate the phylogenetic tree using fasttree v2 1 1126 price et al 2009 wag gamma quote options the generated phylogenetic tree was visualized with interactive tree of life itol v6 4 letunic and bork 2021 we identified mobile genetic elements mges by using the orf annotation results of 278 mags and matching strings with one of the following keywords conjugal conjugative integrase integron mobilization plasmid recombinase recombination transposase and transposon dang et al 2020 a benchmarked set of 37 elite marker genes emgs darling et al 2014 of 278 mags were combined into a single database for abundance evaluation liu et al 2020 the clean reads of all samples were then mapped onto this database using bbmap v38 86 https sourceforge net projects bbmap minid 0 9 ambig random options the estimated mag abundance was normalized using reads numbers of each sample si section 1 2 6 statistical analysis bray curtis dissimilarity between samples was visualized using canonical correlation analysis cca anosim was performed to test the differences of nrg arg co hosts between seasons both cca and anosim were conducted using the vegan r package we identified the differential nfgs and nrg arg host community at phylum level between seasons using stamp based on t tests with an adjusted false discovery rate parks et al 2014 lefse was performed to identify the high dimensional biomarkers and explain the taxa difference between seasons using logarithmic lda threshold 3 5 and statistical parameters of p 0 05 segata et al 2011 rf analysis was performed using the rfpermute r package to predict the contribution of environmental factors and antibiotics in the abundance and composition of nrg arg co hosts we evaluated the model significance and cross validation r2 by 1000 permutations of response variables with the a3 package spearman s correlation coefficients were calculated among nrg arg co hosts and antibiotic types using r4 1 1 and visualized through correlation heatmaps using the pheatmap r package source tracker analysis was conducted using the sourcetracker r package https github com danknights sourcetracker to reveal the contributions of nrg arg co hosts in the e wwtps and wetlands to those in the water and sediments of the huangshui river knights et al 2011 to evaluate the role of nrg arg co hosts in whole bacterial communities we constructed a co occurrence network of nrg arg co hosts with other bacterial genera using cytoscape v3 8 2 shannon et al 2003 by only including the strong pearson s r 0 80 and significant fdr adjusted p 0 01 correlations 3 results and discussion 3 1 nitrate reduction pathways nitrate reduction pathways dominated nitrogen cycling processes in the huangshui river and were primarily comprised of denitrification and dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium dnra based on the ncycdb database tu et al 2019 we identified 69 nfgs in the water and sediments fig s3a si section 2 notably nfgs involved in nitrate reduction and biosynthesis and biodegradation pathways were prominently dominant in both water and sediments fig s5 with the highest abundance of nfgs in biosynthesis and biodegradation because genes encoding biosynthesis and biodegradation were mostly related to assimilatory metabolisms we concluded nitrate reduction pathways were the predominate nitrogen cycling in the huangshui river dang et al 2021 rathour et al 2020 among nitrate reduction pathways genes involved in nitrate reduction to nitrite no3 n no2 n had the highest abundance 11 3 3 17 copies cell in water and 14 4 3 25 copies cell in sediments fig s6 followed by genes of dissimilatory nitrate reduction no3 n nh4 n 5 44 1 28 copies cell in water and 7 74 1 70 copies cell in sediments and nitrite reduction to nitrogen no2 n n2 5 23 2 08 copies cell in water and 7 28 1 73 copies cell in sediments this result suggested the dominance of denitrification and dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium dnra in nitrate reduction pathways in the huangshui river 3 2 nitrate reduction bacteria as dominant hosts of args nitrate reducing bacteria were the primary hosts of args in the huangshui river we found that 278 out of 401 69 3 arg carrying mags simultaneously harbored nrgs fig 2 a in detail we retrieved 2259 medium high quality mags from all the 69 samples and further identified 1561 nrg carrying and 401 arg carrying mags among these mags 278 mags co carried nrgs and args with genome sizes of 1 2 7 9 mb and gc contents of 27 5 72 0 table s9 based on the genome taxonomy database gtdb 278 mags spanned 10 phyla 12 classes 31 orders 54 families and 81 genera figs 2b and c whereas 1 1 15 and 187 mags were not assigned to a known order family genera and species respectively suggesting 67 3 of the nrg arg co hosts with the potential affiliation of new species although we acknowledge that sequence based phylogenetic assignment to the species level is often challenging castelle and banfield 2018 at phylum level proteobacteria 193 mags actinobacteriota 33 mags firmicutes 28 mags and bacteroidota 10 mags were predominant in the nrg arg co hosts fig 2b gammaproteobacteria was the most abundant class of proteobacteria 176 mags which were further assigned to the burkholderiales pseudomonadales enterobacterales xanthomonadales legionellales and thiotrichales orders among these organisms burkholderials and pseudomonadales have been previously identified as keystone aerobic denitrifying bacteria in lakes zhou et al 2020 and dominant arg hosts in wwtps zhang et al 2021b zhao et al 2020 while enterobacterales and xanthomonadales are known to be arg hosts zhang et al 2021b but are rarely reported as carrying nrgs at genus level the co host community was dominated by acinetobacter 13 3 hafnia 12 6 pseudomonas e 7 6 and stenotrophomonas 5 6 in the water whereas rhodoferax 7 9 arenimonas 7 9 and hydrogenophaga 7 1 were the most abundant genera in the sediments though the arg hosts in different aquatic ecosystems were dominantly affiliated with phyla proteobacteria actinobacteria and bacteroidetes the host community composition was quite different at the genus level in the yangtze river limnohabitans acidimicrobium and candidatus methylopumilus were major planktonic hosts and methylotenera and flavobacterium dominated the sedimentary hosts wang et al 2022c whereas nitrospira and clostridium were relatively common arg hosts in wastewater and urban rivers guan et al 2022 jia et al 2017 these results suggested the importance of environmental selection in shaping arg hosts arg mge co carrying mags were mainly assigned to proteobacteria 26 mags followed by bacteroidota 4 mags actinobacteriota 2 mags and firmicutes 2 mags indicating that proteobacteria might represent a potential conduit for arg dissemination mges usually showed positive correlation with most args in aquatic environment zheng et al 2017 and the distribution of mges played a crucial role in shaping the arg profile chen et al 2019 yu et al 2022 we further identified 50 args from 34 out of 278 12 2 host mags that were located near 10 kb the mobile gene elements mges yuan et al 2021 including 10 args directly adjacent to putative mges on the same contigs in 9 mags table s10 ellabaan et al 2021 jiang et al 2017 mges in the neighborhood of args are more prone to capture and horizontally transfer args to other bacterial species ellabaan et al 2021 zhao et al 2020 the ratio of arg mge adjacent mags was lower than that in urban wwtps 19 8 yuan et al 2021 suggesting a relatively lower possibility of horizontal gene transfer hgt in urban rivers arg annotation revealed that 39 6 of nrg arg co hosts encoded multi resistant genes 110 mags whereas 60 4 encoded resistance to a single antibiotic 168 mags the 278 nrg arg co hosts carried 125 arg subtypes encoding resistance functions of 18 antibiotic types fig 2c and tables s11 s12 args against bacitracin 135 mags 48 6 and multidrug 101 mags 36 3 were observed to be two most frequent resistance types followed by args against beta lactam 39 mags 14 0 and unclassified types 40mags 14 4 the most frequent nrg carried by nrg arg hosts was nirb 161 mags 57 9 involved in dissimilatory nitrite reduction to ammonia followed by genes of nari narv 156 mags 56 1 narj narw 149 mags 53 6 narh nvi 147 mags 52 9 and narg narz 138 mags 49 6 table s13 involved in nitrate reduction to nitrite further gene arrangement analysis revealed a few contigs of nrg arg co hosts harboring both nitrate reduction genes and args fig s7 such adjacent gene positions might simultaneously evolve nrgs and args and increase their co expression resulting in nrg arg co hosts as important antibiotic tolerant players ribeiro et al 2021 3 3 seasonal variation of nrg arg co hosts the relative abundance and composition of the nrg arg co host community varied significantly between wet and dry seasons in both water and sediments figs 3 and s8 9 si section 3 cca analysis based on bray curtis distances showed that samples from different seasons separated from each other further analysis revealed that the average relative abundance of nrg arg co hosts in the water in the dry season 0 876 0 518 was two fold higher than that in the wet season 0 441 0 152 the difference in the sediments was much lower and the relative abundance in the dry season 0 481 0 159 was one third higher than that in the wet season 0 342 0 105 several studies have found seasonal changes in arg host abundance and diversity as well as args in natural aquatic systems dang et al 2020 yu et al 2022 zhang et al 2022 zheng et al 2018 with higher abundance in dry season than wet season the higher abundance of co hosts in the dry season might be due to the higher abundance of arg and arg hosts which was probably caused by higher antibiotics levels chen et al 2019 dang et al 2020 zheng et al 2017 and greater hgt potential mediated by mges dang et al 2020 yu et al 2022 zhang et al 2022 zheng et al 2018 these changes in community composition were reflected in specific biomarker taxa across seasons in the water and sediment we identified 63 and 42 taxa as biomarkers of seasonal nrg arg co hosts in the water lefse p 0 05 lda 3 5 fig 3c and sediment lefse p 0 05 lda 3 0 fig 3d respectively in the water the most significant biomarkers of nrg arg co hosts were members of actinobacteriota and firmicutes in the dry season and of campylobacterota planctomycetota and proteobacteria in the wet season the relative abundance of biomarkers in the dry season was much higher than those in the wet season in the sediments the most significant biomarkers were members of firmicutes and desulfobacterota in the dry season and of the alphaproteobacteria class in the wet season the occurrence frequency between seasons varied significantly for args paired t test p 0 0355 in water paired t test p 0 0464 in sediments fig 3b but not significantly for nrgs paired t test p 0 4254 in water paired t test p 0 2719 in sediments fig 3b in biomarker mags for instance the average occurrence frequencies among four sample types were 36 5 45 6 for narghij genes involving nitrate reduction to nitrite in biomarker genomes most biomarker mags encoded multidrug genes 29 0 in the dry season but mainly encoded bacitracin 41 9 and sulfonamide 37 0 genes in the wet season previous studies also found the prevalence of multidrug genes in the dry season and the dominance of bacitracin genes in the wet season wang et al 2022c zhang et al 2022 mainly triggered by a variety of inducers including of antibiotics dyes and detergents blanco et al 2016 moreover the antibiotic resistance mechanisms of args in nrg arg co hosts primarily included enzyme inactivation target alteration and efflux pump with 37 2 21 9 and 54 8 in dry season and 10 7 21 9 and 41 1 in wet season table s14 this result indicated seasonal variation of antibiotic resistant mechanisms in the nrg arg co hosts which could possibly be attributed to the discrepancy in gene subtypes encoded by the hosts zhang et al 2021c 3 4 factors influencing nrg arg co hosts antibiotic level co varied with seasonality and played a prominent role in shaping the nrg arg co hosts in both water and sediments of the huangshui river rf analysis suggested that the most important determinants of the overall relative abundance of nrg arg co hosts were in the order of sulphonamides sas no2 dissolved oxygen tetracyclines tcs water temperature β lactams β ls quinolones qns in the water fig 4 a and sas tp nh4 in the sediments fig 4b we also found a significant linear and positive correlation between the overall relative abundance of nrg arg co hosts and total antibiotic level in both water r 0 4664 p 0 0108 fig 4c and sediment r 0 4533 p 0 0135 fig 4d which further confirmed the importance of antibiotics in influencing the relative abundance of nrg arg co hosts moreover we found significant and positive correlations between five dominant genera i e acinetobacter hafnia limnohabitans acidovorax b and rahnella and all studied antibiotic types except tcs in the water in the sediments one dominant genera e g trichococcus was significantly and positively correlated to all studied antibiotic types fig s10 overall these results indicated a positive influence of antibiotics on the relative abundance of the nrg arg co hosts in both water and sediments of the huangshui river notably the positive relationship was further observed between the relative abundance of nrg hosts and total antibiotic levels in both water y 0 0000015x 0 0008 pearson r 0 6571 p 0 0001 and sediments y 0 0000046x 0 0006 pearson r 0 5598 p 0 0016 fig s11 the similar correlation also existed between the relative abundance of arg hosts and total antibiotic level in both water r 0 4832 p 0 0079 fig 4c and sediment r 0 4659 p 0 0109 fig 4d it has been widely reported that sub lethal concentrations of antibiotics might change the composition of bacterial communities and contribute to increased arg hosts danner et al 2019 harms et al 2016 yang et al 2018 for nitrate reduction stimulation rather than inhibition would occur due to the phenomenon of hormesis laureti et al 2013 stimulatory effects of various types of antibiotics on nitrogen cycling have been observed in different matrices such as sulfamethazine sulfamethoxazole gentamicin and narasin on denitrification in the soil devries et al 2015 fluoroquinolones on denitrification in groundwater zou et al 2019 and amoxicillin on denitrification in compost liu et al 2019 intriguingly wwtp and wetlands along the huangshui river potentially served a critical role in propagating the nrg carrying mags and nrg arg co hosts we found that the relative abundances of nrg carrying mags in effluent affected reach were significantly higher than those in effluent unaffected reach in both water paired t test p 0 0007 fig 4e and sediments paired t test p 0 0085 fig 4f the average relative abundance of nrg arg co hosts was greatest in wetlands 1 2 0 4 in water followed by the immediate downstream effluent affected reach 0 6 0 3 in water 0 3 0 1 in sediments then e wwtps 0 4 0 2 in water and finally the effluent unaffected reach 0 2 0 1 in water 0 2 0 1 in sediments the relative abundance of nrg arg co hosts in wetlands was significantly higher paired t test p 0 05 fig s12a than those in other sample types and the abundances in effluent affected reach were significantly higher than those in effluent unaffected reach in both water paired t test p 0 0158 fig s12a and sediments paired t test p 0 0014 fig s12b further source tracker analysis showed that e wwtps and wetlands contributed to 29 4 and 26 0 of variation in nrg arg co host community structure in the monitoring stations adjacent to wwtps and wetlands fig s13 wwtps are currently viewed as hotspots of antibiotics and arg hosts cacace et al 2019 jiang et al 2014 wang et al 2020 and resulted in increase in args and mges in effluent affected reach teixeira et al 2022 previous study jia et al 2017 reported that tetracycline and aminoglycoside resistance genes dominated in the wastewater and the abundances of these genes obviously increased in the receiving river water caused by the wastewater discharge proia et al 2016 found a significant increase of the concentrations of macrolides and sulfonamides resistance genes in the downstream of wwtp discharge points in addition we found greater abundance of arg mge co carrying mags in wetlands e wwtps and effluent affected reach than effluent unaffected reach fig s14 suggesting that wwtps and wetlands along the river might enhance the mobility potential of args mediated by mges in the river conco et al 2022 goulas et al 2020 osinska et al 2020 our study concluded that wwtps and wetlands along the huangshui river played an essential role in propagating nrg arg co hosts throughout river networks possibly due to their discharge of antibiotics kuang et al 2020 and nrg arg carrying bacteria to the receiving water 3 5 possible roles of nrg arg hosts in nitrate reduction and antibiotic resistance network analysis at the genus level found that 64 genera of nrg arg co hosts exhibited strong and significant correlations with 198 genera of 19 phyla suggesting the important role of nrg arg co hosts in whole bacteria community nrg arg co hosts were strongly correlated proteobacteria 56 genera actinobacteriota 51 genera and bacteroidota phyla 41 genera fig s15 which were observed to be the dominant phyla relative abundance 15 number of mags 450 in whole bacterial community of the huangshui river microbial community plays an important role in the composition of args in most aquatic ecosystems which might be the possible reason for the strong correlation between the dominant species and nrg arg co hosts zhao et al 2019 the average relative abundance of nrg arg co hosts involved in each nitrate reduction pathway showed significant seasonal variations in both water anosim global r 0 14 p 0 0211 and sediments global r 0 16 p 0 0242 fig 5 a and table s15 but the overall metabolic profiles of nitrate reduction i e contribution of denitrification dnra and anammox to nitrogen removal was similar across seasons global r 0 081 p 0 0882 fig 5b in the water the average relative abundance of nrg arg co hosts involved in each nitrogen reduction pathway in the dry season was almost 2 fold higher than that in the wet season corresponding to elevated antibiotic loadings a similar increase was observed in the sediments in the dry season fig 5a further analysis revealed that the fraction of nrg arg co hosts in total nrg hosts in each nitrate reduction pathway showed little difference 10 between seasons in both water and sediments fig 5b suggesting the contribution of nrg arg co hosts to nitrate reduction changed slightly between seasons in addition we found higher nitrate reduction rate in the dry season compared with wet season fig s16 dry season had lower temperature paired t test p 0 0001 and higher abundance of nrg hosts paired t test p 0 0070 compared with wet season this result possibly indicated a more important role for nrg hosts than water temperature in nitrate reduction rate the antibiotic resistance mechanisms of the nrg arg co hosts in the dry season water inferred from gene annotations was significantly different from other three sample groups fig 5c the antibiotic resistance mechanisms were dominated by 60 6 of efflux pumps in dry season water 57 4 of target alternation in wet season water and 50 6 and 60 4 of target alternation in the dry and wet season sediments respectively due to high relative abundance of mags encoding multi resistant genes fig s17 the water in the dry season illustrated highest relative abundance of args with efflux pumps 60 6 which was higher than that of an urban river 30 0 zhou et al 2017 and a reservoir 37 9 guo et al 2018 but lower than that of soils 86 2 chen et al 2017 efflux pumps actively move antibiotics through a cell s cytoplasmic membrane to prevent the antibiotic accumulation up to inhibitory concentrations in hosts jiang et al 2018 bacteria usually acquire resistance to tetracycline collins et al 2016 macrolide lincosamide streptogramin zhang et al 2016 and or multiple drugs spengler et al 2017 via genes encoding efflux pumps considering relatively higher antibiotic levels in the dry season we infer that the increase in efflux pump related genes could enhance antibiotic resistance and maintain bacterial survival li and nikaido 2009 webber and piddock 2003 3 6 limitations in our study we interpreted the relative read abundance as the relative abundance of microbes however the processes of dna extraction sequencing quality control assembly and binning in our study could introduce the biases in the abundance of functional genes lamb et al 2019 yang et al 2021 specifically costea et al 2017 reported dna extraction with the largest effect on the outcome of metagenomic analysis compared to library preparation and sample storage though qa qc is not commonly included in the metagenomic analysis and mags quantitation levy booth et al 2021 nayfach et al 2019 using mock microbial communities with individually cultured microbes combined at known abundances as reference standards will potentially reduce the biases during metagenomic analysis processes han et al 2020 tourlousse et al 2022 therefore the lack of standard samples as controls potentially compromised the quantitative relationship in our study to some extent butler et al 2022 though we compared three normalization methods in the quantitative interpretations 4 conclusions our study retrieved 278 medium to high quality mags co carrying nrgs and args in water and sediments from the huangshui river in the qinghai tibet plateau during the wet and dry seasons the water and sediment samples in dry season had significantly higher antibiotic levels compared to wet season nrg arg co hosts experienced seasonal variation in their relative abundance and composition we observed positive correlations between the loadings of antibiotics i e sas tcs and tp and the relative abundance of nrg arg co hosts in both water and sediments putatively indicating a crucial role of antibiotics in shaping the nrg arg co hosts in addition effluents from wwtps and wetlands contributed to 29 4 and 26 0 of the variation in downstream nrg arg co hosts suggesting their promoting effect on the relative abundance of nrg arg co hosts most importantly we found that the relative abundance of nrg arg co hosts accounted for more than 75 3 94 9 of arg hosts implying that nitrate reducing bacteria carrying args could hold critical roles in protecting nitrogen cycles from antibiotic stress in the huangshui river compared with the wet season the dry season with higher antibiotic levels contained nrg arg co hosts at higher average relative abundance across all nitrate reduction pathways but the percentage of nrg arg co hosts in nrg hosts in each nitrate reduction pathway was similar between seasons overall we demonstrate the importance of nitrate reducing microorganisms previously recognized for their role in wastewater remediation as the primary carriers of args in an urban river thereby suggesting a need to carefully couple management strategies for nitrogen and antibiotic pollution credit authorship contribution statement jinyun hu conceptualization methodology
