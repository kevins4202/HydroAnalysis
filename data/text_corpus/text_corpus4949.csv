flux density measures such as cutting thinning plowing and fertilization has become a major issue of carbon budgets in the context of global climate change bamboo forest also known as the second largest forest in the world plays an important role in the carbon cycle due to its high economic value im practices have been widely used to manage bamboo forests which in turn may affect the global carbon cycle and carbon budget balance of the ecosystem however due to a lack of long term field experiments and suitable representative models for carbon cycle research in bamboo forests there is little understanding of the effects of im measures on carbon sources sinks in bamboo forest ecosystems at large temporal scales in this study we used a representative lei bamboo phyllostachys praecox c d chu c s chao forest occurring in taihuyuan town zhejiang province china as the study object and a new generation triplex flux model to simulate the net ecosystem productivity nep and net primary productivity npp of the lei bamboo forest under im and non intensive management nim in 2011 2013 and 2015 the aim was to reveal the impact of im on the carbon cycle of a bamboo forest ecosystem the results showed that the triplex flux model was suitable for studying the carbon cycle in the lei bamboo forest on a 30 min time scale r2 values ranged between 0 78 0 91 p 0 01 and the rmse varied between 0 04 0 09 gc m 1 on a daily scale the model was also able to simulate the nep of the lei bamboo forest r2 0 42 p 0 001 however the triplex flux model failed to reveal the nep patterns as there were certain deviations between some of the simulated nep peak and valley values which were underestimated at noon and overestimated at night im played a key role in controlling carbon budget of the lei bamboo forest on a seasonal scale the effect of im measures was the most significant in spring harvesting old bamboo wood and removing new shoots caused a 27 71 and 58 52 decrease in nep and npp respectively hooking tips and trimming diseased branches had little impact on nep and npp 0 02 and 7 27 respectively in autumn on an annual scale im measures resulted in average annual decrease in nep and npp by 27 20 and 13 72 respectively our findings can provide a reference base that may be applicable to studying the carbon cycle in bamboo forests across the country and even at larger scales keywords triplex flux model bamboo forest intensive management net ecosystem productivity net primary productivity 1 introduction bamboo forest also known as the second largest forest in the world is widely distributed in subtropical regions with the total area in china reaching 31 5 million ha in 2010 because bamboo has the advantages of a fast growth rate short life cycle and is a highly renewable resource it plays an important role in replacing wood and carbon sequestration and has great economic value and ecological benefit liu et al 2018 song et al 2017 lei bamboo is an important bamboo species widely distributed in southern china li et al 2010 liu et al 2013 song et al 2011 in order to gain a high yield of bamboo shoots and therefore a higher income im practices are widely adopted in lei bamboo forests namely the heavy application of chemical fertilizers removal of shrubs and weeds and deep plowing of the surface soil layer zhou et al 2010 zhou et al 2006 in particular placing an abundant mixture of rice straw and rice husks in the bamboo forest maintains suitable temperature and moisture conditions to promote early bamboo shoot emergence in winter tao et al 2013 zhou et al 2010 zhou et al 2006 as the core management practice behind early maturing bamboo shoot production and high bamboo yields im has been widely used in recent years li et al 2010 although the technique has increased economic benefits the long term use of im on bamboo forests has brought about some negative ecological and environmental problems chen 2013 jiang et al 2006 liu et al 2013 for example it may alter the soil physical chemical and biological properties species composition stand density and age structure to significantly change the productivity and carbon budget of the forestland and have a significant impact on carbon sequestration in the ecosystem chen and chen 2013 garcia gonzalo et al 2007 packalen et al 2006 zhai et al 2010 recent studies pointed out that highly efficient im measures are an effective way to inhibit the increase in co2 concentration in the atmosphere sun 2011 in order to put the management concept of forest carbon sequestration into practice it is urgent that we understand the influence and regulation of management practices on the carbon cycle of forest systems garcia gonzalo et al 2007 packalen et al 2006 however there is little understanding of the effects of im measures on carbon sources sinks in bamboo forest ecosystems at large temporal scales this is due to a lack of long term field experiments and a suitable representative model for investigating the carbon cycle in bamboo forests mao et al 2017 mao 2016 photosynthetic models play a key link in building a model of co2 exchange between the surface vegetation and atmosphere in terrestrial ecosystems peng 2000 peng et al 2002 and they play an important role in natural resource management of terrestrial ecosystems peng 2000 peng et al 2002 therefore to better understand the impact of im on lei bamboo forest ecosystems at a national and even larger scale it is necessary to select a representative artificial bamboo forest ecosystem as the research object and a photosynthetic process model suitable for a bamboo forest ecosystem to investigate the impact of im measures on the carbon cycle of a bamboo forest ecosystem this may also provide some guidance for optimizing the management practices of bamboo forests in addition it is of great theoretical significance to evaluate the influence of im measures on the carbon sink ability of bamboo forests and the contribution of bamboo forests to the global carbon balance there are currently many process models used to simulate the photosynthetic mechanism of plants among which the representative models are as follows beps intec alexandre et al 1997 chen et al 1999 class verseghy 2000 ecosys grant et al 2005 c classa wang et al 2002 c classm arain et al 2002 ealco wang et al 2002 and ctem arora 2003 in recent years some models have gradually been developed in china such as avim ji and yu 1999 smpt sb yu et al 2003 yu et al 2001 and eppml zhang et al 2003 these models had been successfully applied to simulate the carbon cycle process and its spatiotemporal variation patterns in terrestrial ecosystems but they have the disadvantage of a complex structure and require numerous input parameters and meteorological variables that are usually difficult to obtain or estimate the triplex flux model is a biogeochemical model that belongs to a new generation of dynamic vegetation models dynamic global vegetation models dgvms zhou et al 2008 the triplex flux model has a simple structure requires few input parameters and meteorological variables and is mainly used to estimate the variation characteristics of net exchange productivity nep and net primary productivity npp of forest ecosystems over a short time scale 30 min sun et al 2008 zhou et al 2008 the triplex flux model has been extended and validated in ecosystems with different vegetation types in the united states and canada li et al 2015 sun 2011 sun et al 2008 zhou et al 2008 however the model has only been used in estimating the npp of moso bamboo phyllostachys pubescens forest in anji county china chen et al 2018 it has not yet been tested in other areas of china therefore in this study we used the triplex flux model to simulate the variation characteristics of nep and npp in a lei bamboo forest under im and nim at different time scales the objectives of this study were the following 1 to further evaluate the application of the triplex flux model in carbon cycle research of a lei bamboo forest ecosystem 2 to analyse the impact of im on nep and npp in a lei bamboo forest and 3 provide a database and reference for identifying a process model that is suitable for studying the carbon cycle in bamboo ecosystems across china 2 materials and methods 2 1 research area this research was carried out within an intensively managed lei bamboo plantation in taihuyuan town lin an county zhejiang province of china 30na 30ina 30china 30ei bambfig 1 which is known as the home of bamboo in china liu et al 2018 the average altitude is 185 m chen et al 2013 an 854 ha plantation was established here in 2007 and currently the area of economic bamboo forest in the study area has reached 1100 ha intensive management measures are adopted in odd numbered years the main im practices conducted in different seasons in the lei bamboo plantation in taihuyuan town are summarized in table 1 in even numbered years there is no manual intervention namely no intensive management measures the mean diameter and average height of bamboo stems were approximately 4 cm and 4 5 m at breast height chen et al 2013 respectively bamboo stems at a density of about 17 000 ha were mostly 2 3 years old liu et al 2018 the understory vegetation was composed of few herbs and shrubs due to regular manual weeding chen et al 2013 the study site has a typical subtropical monsoon climate with four distinct seasons the mean annual precipitation is 1600 mm in which 70 falls during spring and summer the mean annual temperature is 15 8 c the average annual frost free period is 234 days with 1939 h of sunshine annually the main soil type is sandy loam texture with a ph of 4 17 the alkali hydrolysable nitrogen available phosphorus content and soil potassium content in the study site were 271 414 and 120 mg kg 1 respectively the total nitrogen and soil organic carbon at a depth of 0 30 cm were 2 39 and 30 30 g kg 1 respectively gao et al 2015 liu et al 2018 2 2 meteorological as well as co2 flux measurements a micrometeorological observation steel tower 20 m in height was installed in the research site lei bamboo accounts for 67 28 of the forest around the steel tower the coverage rate of other vegetation types was 17 33 and other land types accounted for 15 39 of the study area an open path eddy covariance ec device was installed onto the 17 m height flux tower which consisted of a 3d sonic anemometer csat3 campbell scientific inc logan ut usa for measuring wind velocity together with an open path h2o and co2 infrared gas analyzer li 7500 li cor inc usa for measuring h2o and co2 densities in addition the frequency of raw sampling was set at 10 hz while statistics of sensible heat flux hs latent heat flux le and co2 flux fc were calculated online for 30 min according to the principle of vorticity and the data was stored in the data logger cr1000 campbell scientific inc micrometeorological instruments hmp45c vaisala helsinki finland including a three layer anemometer 010c metone usa humidity sensor and 3 layer atmospheric temperature sensor were installed at heights of 1 m 5 m and 17 m respectively a cnr4 net radiation sensor manufactured by kipp zonen holland was installed at a height of 17 m to collect the net radiation data two si 111 infrared temperature radiometers apogee inc usa were also mounted at heights of 1 5 m and 5 m respectively for collecting long short wave radiation in both upwelling and down welling directions as well as the surface and canopy temperatures soil heat flux instruments manufactured by hukse flux thermal sensors bv hfp01 delft the netherlands were installed at 3 cm and 5 cm underground for observing the flux of soil heat three cs 109 probes together with three cs 616 probes all from campbell inc usa were used to observe the soil volumetric water level vwc m3 m3 as well as the soil temperature at 5 cm underground t s 5 c m c a photosynthetically active radiation quantum sensor 1 instrument pqs1 kipp zonen netherlands was installed at an altitude of 7 m for measuring photosynthetically active radiation par μmol m 2 s 1 the data sampling frequency of the meteorological observation system was 0 5 hz the average wind speed temperature air pressure and net radiation was automatically recorded every 30 min by the data collector these meteorological data are used to interpolate the absence of flux observation data typically air temperature t a 7 m measured at a height of 7 m was used for calculating saturated vapour pressure in accordance with the magnus model and relative humidity rh measured at a height of 7 m was used to calculate actual vapor pressure while the difference between saturated and actual vapour pressure was deemed as the eventual vapor pressure deficit vpd kpa song et al 2017 2 3 description of the triplex flux model zhou et al 2008 sun et al 2008 and chen et al 2018 provide detailed information on the triplex flux model the main methods adopted in our study are presented below the triplex flux model included three submodels 1 a leaf photosynthetic submodel 2 canopy photosynthesis submodel and 3 the nep and npp ecosystem production submodel this model ran at each 30 min time step and the mean output values of nep npp and total primary productivity gpp were simulated within 30 min therefore the meteorological data from the carbon flux tower were used to simulate the nep npp and gpp data of the ecosystem at 30 min intervals fig 2 presents a diagram of the model structure which includes the main inputs the output process and control variables of the model the initial values of all input parameters and functions used to calculate the variables are listed in the appendix table a 1 referring to the zhou et al 2008 1 the leaf photosynthetic submodel which was constructed on the basis of farquhar s biochemical model farquhar et al 1980 together with collatz s semi analytical model collatza et al 1991 was used to estimate the instantaneous total photosynthetic rate of the leaves rubisco limited gross photosynthetic rate vc and the light limited gross photosynthesis rate vj were used to estimate the net co2 assimilation rate a of the leaves the minimum values of both were taken as the total photosynthetic rate of the leaves without considering the limitation of the carbon pool on co2 assimilation the net co2 assimilation rate was calculated by subtracting leaf dark respiration rd from the total photosynthetic rate of the leaves the equation used to calculate a was baldocchi and meyers 1998 collatza et al 1991 zhang et al 1996 1 a m i n v c v j r d 2 a g s c a c i 1 6 3 g s 20 8 75 a r h c a where gs is stomatal conductance rh is air relative humidity ca stands for atmospheric co2 content and ci represents the intercellular co2 concentration based on eqs 1 2 3 an iterative estimation was made for ci and a 1 the canopy photosynthesis submodel acanopy is also known as the gpp model of the ecosystem this submodel was coupled with the large leaf model and the two leaf model and the leaf scale was extended to the canopy scale the canopy was divided into two parts namely the shaded and sunlit leaves to calculate shaded and sunlit canopy photosynthesis respectively de pury and farquhar 1997 typically acanopy gpp is calculated according to the following formula 4 a c a n o p y g p p a s u n l a i s u n a s h a d e l a i s h a d e where acanopy represents the net co2 assimilation rates in the canopy ashade and asun represent the net co2 assimilation rates in the shaded and sunlit leaves respectively and laishade and laisun indicate the leaf area indexes of shaded and sunlit leaves respectively the calculations for laishade and laisun have been described in detail by de pury and farquhar 1997 1 the nep and npp ecosystem production submodel by deducting the ecosystem respiration re and autotrophic respiration ra from gpp we obtained the nep and npp lloyd and taylor 1994 the nep and npp were calculated according to the following formulas 5 nep gpp r e 6 npp gpp r a 7 r e r g r m r h 8 r a r m r g where rg is growth respiration which is calculated according to the respiratory coefficient and gpp rm is maintain respiration which is calculated by multiplying the q10 function by the biomass of each component of the plant and rh is heterotrophic respiration which is calculated by multiplying the exponential function of temperature by q10 lloyd and taylor 1994 2 4 model validation and input parameters 2 4 1 general input parameters of the model there were differences in the vegetation types and site conditions of the different ecosystems thus the input parameters of the model varied greatly which was key for the simulation and prediction of co2 flux three kinds of general parameters are needed for a triplex flux model site parameters photosynthesis parameters and respiration parameters therefore it was necessary to set these initial values in the model before simulation table 2 provides the reference values of these parameters that were entered into the model they are regarded as crucial parameters for predicting co2 flux they are also the parameters that are severely affected by im measures such as covering warming fertilization irrigation felling chen et al 2018 sun et al 2008 2 4 2 meteorological variables driving the model five meteorological variables were used to drive the model air temperature at a canopy

2011 2013 and 2015 the values of the meteorological variables were higher in summer than in winter the annual average t a 7 m and t s 5 c m were 15 7 ppfd during the two study pefig 3a during the two study periods the coefficients of variation cv were 2 9 and 2 5 respectively the average t s 5 c m was 11 61 he two study periods the coefficients of variation cv we t a 7 m of 3 67 1 he two study t s 5 c m was slightly lower than the t a 7 m in other seasons mean annual rh ranged from 55 24 to 68 79 fig 3b during the study periods with a cv of 10 7 mean annual vpd ranged from 0 72 to 0 95 kpa fig 3c with a cv of 15 3 mean annual ppfd ranged from 292 80 μmol m 1s 2 to 333 67 μmol m 1s 2 fig 3d with a cv of 5 0 the vpd and ppfd exhibited similar trends in variation average annual co2 was 440 9 μmol mol 1 fig 3e with a cv of 5 0 2 4 3 model validation based on the meteorological data from 2011 2013 and 2015 the triplex flux model was run for simulating nep and npp dataset patterns for 30 min in a lei bamboo forest comparing the simulated results of nep to those flux results acquired from actual site data in 2011 im and 2012 nim the coefficient of determination r 2 root mean square error rmse and statistical significance p were adopted for evaluating the modelled nep flux precision in addition rmse was computed according to the following formula 10 rmse 1 n i 1 n y m y 0 i 2 in the formula ym represents the modeled result while y 0 represents the measured result in general a high r 2 value with a low rmse value suggests high precision 2 5 data quality control and missing data interpolation the average covariance of atmospheric rotation with vertical wind velocity such as h2o co2 was used to calculate the carbon flux for 30 min after the raw eddy covariance ec data was processed by the eddypro li cor biosciences lincoln nebraska usa flux measuring system it is necessary to control the quality of the flux data due to the influences of precipitation condensation insects and random electrical signal anomalies we combined the flux observation principle of the eddy covariance method and chinaflux data processed standard to check and control the data quality of the 30 min flux data data were filtered out and treated as gaps when 1 in the case of 2 0 2 0 mg co2 m 2 s 1 co2 flux the co2 content fell in the range of 800 or 500 mg m 3 while the water vapor content beyond the range from 0 to 40 g m 3 2 the aberrant value namely the absolute difference value between that value and those at five consecutive points was 2 5 fold higher than the variance 3 measurements were carried out during precipitation events 4 an effective sample number of 15 000 and 5 the measured value showed a lower friction speed u 0 2 m s 1 according to the net radiation rn standard all values were divided into daytime and nighttime after initial screening the average effective data was 64 58 for the study periods the meteorological data for 2014 were missing because of instrument failure and thus nep and npp for 2014 were excluded from our study 3 results 3 1 sensitivity analysis the sensitivity analysis of the model was carried out at three levels using the control variable method namely the general parameters table 2 and meteorological variables fig 3 entered in the model model inputs were 10 20 and 30 respectively on the current basis the sensitivity was expressed as the variation in the percentage of nep the results indicated that nep was remarkably sensitive to changes in lai mr f n v m25 and q 10 fig 4 at all three gradients which led to an average change in nep of 9 41 22 86 the change in nep was in direct proportion to the change in these parameters except q 10 generally nep increased as these parameters increased the acanopy effectively increased only when there was an increase in the lai while keeping the other parameters unchanged which indicates that nep will increase increasing the v m25 enhanced vc and vj which then effectively promoted the acanopy and nep of the plants the higher the average nitrogen content in the leaf n the higher the carbon absorption while f n is the ratio of the average leaf nitrogen n content to the maximum leaf nitrogen content nm when nm is constant the greater the n the greater the f n thus nep will increase when f n increases as the respiratory sensitivity coefficient q 10 directly affects the variation in re and ra which increased with increasing q 10 but nep decreased and vice versa among the input meteorological variables used in the model fig 5 nep was extremely sensitive to changes in t s 5 c m co 2 and ppfd as nep changed by 10 34 6 09 and 3 70 respectively while rh vpd and ta had little influence on nep the change in nep was in direct proportion to the changes in t s 5 c m and ta but in inverse proportion to the changes in ppfd co 2 rh and vpd t s 5 c m affected re and ra mainly by affecting q 10 photosynthesis was often inhibited by a higher ppfd co 2 rh and vpd which then resulted in a further decrease in the sensitivity of nep 3 2 model validation the parameters table 2 and meteorological data obtained during the study period were entered into the triplex flux model to simulate the nep and npp of a lei bamboo forest at a 30 min time scale the observed im 2011 and nim 2012 nep determined by the ec method and the simulated nep based on the triplex flux model were used to test the validity of the model in a 1 1 relationship line the results indicated that the simulated nep was largely consistent with the observed nep the r 2 ranged between 0 78 0 91 p 0 001 and rmse varied between 0 04 0 09 gc m 1 fig 6 and fig 7 gpp could only be estimated via the nep and re values and not by direct observation using the ec method therefore to avoid any errors produced in estimating the gpp which would affect the evaluation accuracy of model the nep gpp and re values were simulated by the triplex flux model and compared with those observed by ec methods on daily scale fig 8 a c the results showed that the values simulated based on the triplex flux model were nearly identical to those measured using the ec method over the four years table 3 with an r 2 of 0 42 0 61 and 0 55 respectively fig 8d f it is evident that the input parameters of the model table 2 were able to simulate the nep and npp of the lei bamboo forest this means that the triplex flux model is suitable for the study of the carbon cycle at this site however it failed to reveal the nep diurnal patterns there were some gaps in the simulated peak and valley values of nep as these tended to be overestimated at night to some extent and underestimated during the day in this study we used july and august summer and january and february winter as examples to show the daily patterns of the nep simulated by the triplex flux model and observed by the ec method fig 9 a d 3 3 variation characteristics of nep under im and nim of a lei bamboo forest fig 10 shows the variation characteristics of the monthly average nep under two different management strategies during the two study periods nep 0 indicates that the ecosystem is a carbon sink nep 0 indicates that the ecosystem is a carbon source under im conditions the daily average nep was 0 32 gc m 2day 1 while under nim conditions the nep was 0 44 gc m 2day 1 which is 1 38 times higher than that under im on the seasonal scale the harvesting of old bamboo wood and bamboo shoots in spring reduced the nep by 27 71 in summer irrigation and fertilization measures increased nep by 14 40 in autumn hooking tips and trimming diseased branches had little effect on nep 0 02 decrease in winter organic mulching and bamboo shoot removal led to a decrease in nep by 13 10 causing the lei bamboo forest to being a carbon source nep 12 71 gcm 2 nep was positive and a carbon sink in all other seasons nep 0 under nim conditions nep was positive and a carbon sink in all seasons nep 0 at an annual scale the annual average nep of the im lei bamboo forest was 108 63 gc m 2a 1 with a cv of 5 7 under nim the annual average nep was 155 53 gc m 2yr 1 it evident that the nep of the lei bamboo forest decreased by 13 72 under im with an average annual decrease of 46 9 gc m 2yr 1 3 4 variation characteristics of nep under im and nim of the lei bamboo forest fig 11 illustrates the variation characteristics of the monthly average npp under different management practices during two study periods npp reached their maximum values in summer which accounted for 38 1 of the total annual npp the minimum npp occurred in winter which accounted for 12 6 of the total annual npp under im conditions the monthly average npp was 41 94 gc m 2 while under nim conditions the monthly average npp was 48 61 gc m 2 thus the npp of the lei bamboo forest under im was obviously lower than that under nim when compared with nim the onsite npp decreased by 13 10 58 52 and 7 27 in winter spring and autumn respectively and increased by 2 50 in summer at an annual scale the annual average npp of the lei bamboo forest under im was 496 29 gc m 2a 1 under nim the annual average npp was 557 97 gc m 2yr 1 im resulted in a decrease in the average npp by 80 05 gc m 2yr 1 27 20 when compared with that under nim it evident that im practices resulted in a decrease in the total annual onsite npp of lei bamboo 4 discussion 4 1 accuracy evaluation of the triplex flux model the triplex flux model was used to simulate the nep and npp of a lei bamboo forest under im and nim practices we made full consideration of the changes of lai caused by im practice the leaf nitrogen content n caused by fertilization and the changes of soil q 10 value caused by organic matter mulching and irrigation we also took into account biomass variation of foliage biomass mfoliage stem biomass mstem and shoot biomass mshoot altered by im table 2 therefore the triplex flux model could accurately simulate the nep of the lei bamboo forest and there was good consistency between the simulated and observed nep on the 30 min time scale the r 2 ranged between 0 78 0 91 p 0 01 and the rmse varied between 0 04 0 09 gc m 1 fig 6 and fig 7 on the daily time scale the average nep gpp and re values simulated using the triplex flux model over four years were nearly identical to those measured using the ec method table 3 with r2 values of 0 42 0 61 and 0 55 respectively fig 8d f this illustrates that the triplex flux model is suitable for studying the carbon cycle in lei bamboo forests although the triplex flux model could simulate the nep of lei bamboo forests it failed to reveal the nep patterns accurately as there were certain deviations between some of the simulated nep peak and valley values fig 9a d the simulated nep values were underestimated in the day and tended to be overestimated at night this phenomenon is consistent with the results of other models used to investigate the forest carbon cycle amthor et al 2001 gran r f et al 2005 hanson et al 2004 this error is due to the following aspects 1 the error of the model structure itself and model input parameter errors zhou et al 2008 2 most of the parameters of the input model were more sensitive to higher temperatures at noon than lower temperatures at night such as q 10 was related to soil respiration sun et al 2008 zhou et al 2008 3 due to missing meteorological variables required to drive the model and co 2 flux data for model validation errors were produced in data processing and interpolation chen et al 2018 4 terrain conditions and atmospheric heterogeneity above the canopy may affect the model which leads to some errors in the measurement of nep based on ec technology gran r f et al 2005 5 the model iterative algorithm used to calculate stomatal conductance in the triplex flux model does not consider the soil water content which is usually related to the opening and closing of stomata therefore it may affect the simulated nep thus decreasing the simulation accuracy tuzet et al 2003 and 6 it maybe the limitation of meteorological factors as model inputs which could not fully consider the characteristics of the variations in nep associated with changing meteorological factors at a short time scale therefore the accuracy of the sensitive parameters and meteorological variables should be improved and the calibration of the flux tower used to measure the meteorological variables and co 2 flux should be carried out regularly soil water content should also be incorporated into the model only by optimizing the model structure and decreasing system error as much as possible can we improve the accuracy of the model prediction 4 2 the influence of im on nep of lei bamboo the simulation results showed that the annual average nep under im and nim conditions were 108 63 gc m 2yr 1 and 155 53 gcm 2yr 1 respectively the former result was similar to the result obtained by ec in our study as well as that reported by liu et al 2018 based on the ec method 119 41 gc m 2yr 1 and 126 30 gcm 2yr 1 respectively it was evident that the nep of the lei bamboo forest was reduced by im on the seasonal scale im resulted in a 27 71 reduction in nep in spring and a 14 40 increase in summer while there was little effect on nep decrease of 0 02 in autumn in winter im resulted in nep decreasing by 13 10 whereby the lei bamboo forest acted as a carbon source nepaverage 12 71 gcm 2 however it acted as a carbon sink in other seasons nep 0 fig 8 this is consistent with the results reported by chen 2013 and liu et al 2018 the main reasons for this reduction in nep were analyzed from the perspective of bamboo wood harvesting shoot removal irrigation fertilization and winter organic mulching old bamboo wood 4 years old and bamboo shoots were harvested each year leading to about 787 50 gc m 2yr 1 of the total carbon being transported out of the site of which 14 was fixed by bamboo shoots and 86 was fixed by bamboo timber chen et al 2013 meanwhile fertilization and organic mulching resulted in 571 gc m 2 yr 1 of the total carbon entering the ecosystem from offsite chen 2013 there was also 216 5 gc m 2 yr 1 transported offsite after subtracting the total carbon that was input from offsite therefore the carbon sequestration capacity of the lei bamboo forest retained onsite decreased under im rimming branches and hooking tips are important measures of im which reduces the risk of lodging and breaking caused by fierce winds and heavy snow but it also decreased the lai of the bamboo forest stand fang et al 1994 therefore the harvesting of old bamboo wood and hooking tips both decrease photosynthesis by reducing the onsite lai this reduces canopy photosynthesis and affects autotrophic and heterotrophic respiration both directly and indirectly for example huang 2015 reported a carbon emission increase of 7 72 tc hm 2yr 1 under im jensen et al 2017 showed that harvesting grass resulted in the reduction of nee in a grassland ecosystem by 338 gc m 2yr 1 which converted it from a carbon sink into a carbon source herbst et al 2013 showed that nee was half that before harvesting which could explain 50 of the change in total ecosystem nee 4 3 the influence of im on the npp of lei bamboo the simulation results based on the triplex flux model showed that the average npp of the lei bamboo forest at our study site was 518 74 gc m 2yr 1 and 583 31 gc m 2yr 1 under im and nim respectively under im the annual average npp onsite decreased by 27 20 the main reasons for this are as follows on the one hand clearcutting bamboo wood 4 years bamboo shoot harvesting and hooking tips led to a decrease in onsite biomass and photosynthesis which led directly to npp decreasing by 13 10 58 52 and 7 27 in winter spring and autumn respectively although npp increased by 2 50 because of irrigation and fertilization in summer 78 89 of the total npp was still transported offsite which was much higher than the increase in npp 2 50 on the other hand the clearcutting of undergrowth vegetation increased the yield of bamboo shoots but decreased the productivity of the herb and shrub layers therefore the total productivity of the bamboo forest ecosystem further declined onsite li et al 2013 zhou et al 2010 in conclusion the productivity of the lei bamboo forest was reduced by im 5 conclusions this study found that the triplex flux model is suitable for studying the carbon cycle in lei bamboo forests however the model failed to accurately reveal the nep patterns as there were certain deviations between some of the simulated nep peak and valley values the simulated nep values were underestimated in day and tended to be overestimated at night the sensitivity analysis results indicate that nep was remarkably sensitive to lai mr f n v m25 q 10 which caused an average percentage change of 9 41 22 86 in nep among the input meteorological variables used in the model nep was extremely sensitive to t s 5 c m co 2 and ppfd which could explain about 10 34 6 09 and 3 70 of the changes in nep respectively it is evident that im measures are the key factor affecting nep im measures undertaken in the lei bamboo forest resulted in a decrease in the average annual nep and npp by 27 20 and 13 72 respectively in spring the nep and npp of the forest were greatly reduced by the harvesting of old bamboo wood and new shoots by analyzing the influence of im practices across the different seasons we found that the effect of im measures on nep and npp in spring was the most significant harvesting old bamboo wood and removing new shoots caused a 27 71 and 58 52 reduction in nep and npp respectively im had little impact on nep 0 02 and npp 7 27 in autumn by analyzing the simulated uncertainty of the model we found that the influence of soil water content should be incorporated into the stomatal conductance model in future research to improve the simulation accuracy of triplex flux model however due to the lack of a model suitable for predicting meteorological variables at this site it would be impossible to predict the nep and npp in the future thus we recommend this direction of study for future research

keywords triplex flux model bamboo forest intensive management net ecosystem productivity net primary productivity 1 introduction bamboo forest also known as the second largest forest in the world is widely distributed in subtropical regions with the total area in china reaching 31 5 million ha in 2010 because bamboo has the advantages of a fast growth rate short life cycle and is a highly renewable resource it plays an important role in replacing wood and carbon sequestration and has great economic value and ecological benefit liu et al 2018 song et al 2017 lei bamboo is an important bamboo species widely distributed in southern china li et al 2010 liu et al 2013 song et al 2011 in order to gain a high yield of bamboo shoots and therefore a higher income im practices are widely adopted in lei bamboo forests namely the heavy application of chemical fertilizers removal of shrubs and weeds and deep plowing of the surface soil layer zhou et al 2010 zhou et al 2006 in particular placing an abundant mixture of rice straw and rice husks in the bamboo forest maintains suitable temperature and moisture conditions to promote early bamboo shoot emergence in winter tao et al 2013 zhou et al 2010 zhou et al 2006 as the core management practice behind early maturing bamboo shoot production and high bamboo yields im has been widely used in recent years li et al 2010 although the technique has increased economic benefits the long term use of im on bamboo forests has brought about some negative ecological and environmental problems chen 2013 jiang et al 2006 liu et al 2013 for example it may alter the soil physical chemical and biological properties species composition stand density and age structure to significantly change the productivity and carbon budget of the forestland and have a significant impact on carbon sequestration in the ecosystem chen and chen 2013 garcia gonzalo et al 2007 packalen et al 2006 zhai et al 2010 recent studies pointed out that highly efficient im measures are an effective way to inhibit the increase in co2 concentration in the atmosphere sun 2011 in order to put the management concept of forest carbon sequestration into practice it is urgent that we understand the influence and regulation of management practices on the carbon cycle of forest systems garcia gonzalo et al 2007 packalen et al 2006 however there is little understanding of the effects of im measures on carbon sources sinks in bamboo forest ecosystems at large temporal scales this is due to a lack of long term field experiments and a suitable representative model for investigating the carbon cycle in bamboo forests mao et al 2017 mao 2016 photosynthetic models play a key link in building a model of co2 exchange between the surface vegetation and atmosphere in terrestrial ecosystems peng 2000 peng et al 2002 and they play an important role in natural resource management of terrestrial ecosystems peng 2000 peng et al 2002 therefore to better understand the impact of im on lei bamboo forest ecosystems at a national and even larger scale it is necessary to select a representative artificial bamboo forest ecosystem as the research object and a photosynthetic process model suitable for a bamboo forest ecosystem to investigate the impact of im measures on the carbon cycle of a bamboo forest ecosystem this may also provide some guidance for optimizing the management practices of bamboo forests in addition it is of great theoretical significance to evaluate the influence of im measures on the carbon sink ability of bamboo forests and the contribution of bamboo forests to the global carbon balance there are currently many process models used to simulate the photosynthetic mechanism of plants among which the representative models are as follows beps intec alexandre et al 1997 chen et al 1999 class verseghy 2000 ecosys grant et al 2005 c classa wang et al 2002 c classm arain et al 2002 ealco wang et al 2002 and ctem arora 2003 in recent years some models have gradually been developed in china such as avim ji and yu 1999 smpt sb yu et al 2003 yu et al 2001 and eppml zhang et al 2003 these models had been successfully applied to simulate the carbon cycle process and its spatiotemporal variation patterns in terrestrial ecosystems but they have the disadvantage of a complex structure and require numerous input parameters and meteorological variables that are usually difficult to obtain or estimate the triplex flux model is a biogeochemical model that belongs to a new generation of dynamic vegetation models dynamic global vegetation models dgvms zhou et al 2008 the triplex flux model has a simple structure requires few input parameters and meteorological variables and is mainly used to estimate the variation characteristics of net exchange productivity nep and net primary productivity npp of forest ecosystems over a short time scale 30 min sun et al 2008 zhou et al 2008 the triplex flux model has been extended and validated in ecosystems with different vegetation types in the united states and canada li et al 2015 sun 2011 sun et al 2008 zhou et al 2008 however the model has only been used in estimating the npp of moso bamboo phyllostachys pubescens forest in anji county china chen et al 2018 it has not yet been tested in other areas of china therefore in this study we used the triplex flux model to simulate the variation characteristics of nep and npp in a lei bamboo forest under im and nim at different time scales the objectives of this study were the following 1 to further evaluate the application of the triplex flux model in carbon cycle research of a lei bamboo forest ecosystem 2 to analyse the impact of im on nep and npp in a lei bamboo forest and 3 provide a database and reference for identifying a process model that is suitable for studying the carbon cycle in bamboo ecosystems across china 2 materials and methods 2 1 research area this research was carried out within an intensively managed lei bamboo plantation in taihuyuan town lin an county zhejiang province of china 30na 30ina 30china 30ei bambfig 1 which is known as the home of bamboo in china liu et al 2018 the average altitude is 185 m chen et al 2013 an 854 ha plantation was established here in 2007 and currently the area of economic bamboo forest in the study area has reached 1100 ha intensive management measures are adopted in odd numbered years the main im practices conducted in different seasons in the lei bamboo plantation in taihuyuan town are summarized in table 1 in even numbered years there is no manual intervention namely no intensive management measures the mean diameter and average height of bamboo stems were approximately 4 cm and 4 5 m at breast height chen et al 2013 respectively bamboo stems at a density of about 17 000 ha were mostly 2 3 years old liu et al 2018 the understory vegetation was composed of few herbs and shrubs due to regular manual weeding chen et al 2013 the study site has a typical subtropical monsoon climate with four distinct seasons the mean annual precipitation is 1600 mm in which 70 falls during spring and summer the mean annual temperature is 15 8 c the average annual frost free period is 234 days with 1939 h of sunshine annually the main soil type is sandy loam texture with a ph of 4 17 the alkali hydrolysable nitrogen available phosphorus content and soil potassium content in the study site were 271 414 and 120 mg kg 1 respectively the total nitrogen and soil organic carbon at a depth of 0 30 cm were 2 39 and 30 30 g kg 1 respectively gao et al 2015 liu et al 2018 2 2 meteorological as well as co2 flux measurements a micrometeorological observation steel tower 20 m in height was installed in the research site lei bamboo accounts for 67 28 of the forest around the steel tower the coverage rate of other vegetation types was 17 33 and other land types accounted for 15 39 of the study area an open path eddy covariance ec device was installed onto the 17 m height flux tower which consisted of a 3d sonic anemometer csat3 campbell scientific inc logan ut usa for measuring wind velocity together with an open path h2o and co2 infrared gas analyzer li 7500 li cor inc usa for measuring h2o and co2 densities in addition the frequency of raw sampling was set at 10 hz while statistics of sensible heat flux hs latent heat flux le and co2 flux fc were calculated online for 30 min according to the principle of vorticity and the data was stored in the data logger cr1000 campbell scientific inc micrometeorological instruments hmp45c vaisala helsinki finland including a three layer anemometer 010c metone usa humidity sensor and 3 layer atmospheric temperature sensor were installed at heights of 1 m 5 m and 17 m respectively a cnr4 net radiation sensor manufactured by kipp zonen holland was installed at a height of 17 m to collect the net radiation data two si 111 infrared temperature radiometers apogee inc usa were also mounted at heights of 1 5 m and 5 m respectively for collecting long short wave radiation in both upwelling and down welling directions as well as the surface and canopy temperatures soil heat flux instruments manufactured by hukse flux thermal sensors bv hfp01 delft the netherlands were installed at 3 cm and 5 cm underground for observing the flux of soil heat three cs 109 probes together with three cs 616 probes all from campbell inc usa were used to observe the soil volumetric water level vwc m3 m3 as well as the soil temperature at 5 cm underground t s 5 c m c a photosynthetically active radiation quantum sensor 1 instrument pqs1 kipp zonen netherlands was installed at an altitude of 7 m for measuring photosynthetically active radiation par μmol m 2 s 1 the data sampling frequency of the meteorological observation system was 0 5 hz the average wind speed temperature air pressure and net radiation was automatically recorded every 30 min by the data collector these meteorological data are used to interpolate the absence of flux observation data typically air temperature t a 7 m measured at a height of 7 m was used for calculating saturated vapour pressure in accordance with the magnus model and relative humidity rh measured at a height of 7 m was used to calculate actual vapor pressure while the difference between saturated and actual vapour pressure was deemed as the eventual vapor pressure deficit vpd kpa song et al 2017 2 3 description of the triplex flux model zhou et al 2008 sun et al 2008 and chen et al 2018 provide detailed information on the triplex flux model the main methods adopted in our study are presented below the triplex flux model included three submodels 1 a leaf photosynthetic submodel 2 canopy photosynthesis submodel and 3 the nep and npp ecosystem production submodel this model ran at each 30 min time step and the mean output values of nep npp and total primary productivity gpp were simulated within 30 min therefore the meteorological data from the carbon flux tower were used to simulate the nep npp and gpp data of the ecosystem at 30 min intervals fig 2 presents a diagram of the model structure which includes the main inputs the output process and control variables of the model the initial values of all input parameters and functions used to calculate the variables are listed in the appendix table a 1 referring to the zhou et al 2008 1 the leaf photosynthetic submodel which was constructed on the basis of farquhar s biochemical model farquhar et al 1980 together with collatz s semi analytical model collatza et al 1991 was used to estimate the instantaneous total photosynthetic rate of the leaves rubisco limited gross photosynthetic rate vc and the light limited gross photosynthesis rate vj were used to estimate the net co2 assimilation rate a of the leaves the minimum values of both were taken as the total photosynthetic rate of the leaves without considering the limitation of the carbon pool on co2 assimilation the net co2 assimilation rate was calculated by subtracting leaf dark respiration rd from the total photosynthetic rate of the leaves the equation used to calculate a was baldocchi and meyers 1998 collatza et al 1991 zhang et al 1996 1 a m i n v c v j r d 2 a g s c a c i 1 6 3 g s 20 8 75 a r h c a where gs is stomatal conductance rh is air relative humidity ca stands for atmospheric co2 content and ci represents the intercellular co2 concentration based on eqs 1 2 3 an iterative estimation was made for ci and a 1 the canopy photosynthesis submodel acanopy is also known as the gpp model of the ecosystem this submodel was coupled with the large leaf model and the two leaf model and the leaf scale was extended to the canopy scale the canopy was divided into two parts namely the shaded and sunlit leaves to calculate shaded and sunlit canopy photosynthesis respectively de pury and farquhar 1997 typically acanopy gpp is calculated according to the following formula 4 a c a n o p y g p p a s u n l a i s u n a s h a d e l a i s h a d e where acanopy represents the net co2 assimilation rates in the canopy ashade and asun represent the net co2 assimilation rates in the shaded and sunlit leaves respectively and laishade and laisun indicate the leaf area indexes of shaded and sunlit leaves respectively the calculations for laishade and laisun have been described in detail by de pury and farquhar 1997 1 the nep and npp ecosystem production submodel by deducting the ecosystem respiration re and autotrophic respiration ra from gpp we obtained the nep and npp lloyd and taylor 1994 the nep and npp were calculated according to the following formulas 5 nep gpp r e 6 npp gpp r a 7 r e r g r m r h 8 r a r m r g where rg is growth respiration which is calculated according to the respiratory coefficient and gpp rm is maintain respiration which is calculated by multiplying the q10 function by the biomass of each component of the plant and rh is heterotrophic respiration which is calculated by multiplying the exponential function of temperature by q10 lloyd and taylor 1994 2 4 model validation and input parameters 2 4 1 general input parameters of the model there were differences in the vegetation types and site conditions of the different ecosystems thus the input parameters of the model varied greatly which was key for the simulation and prediction of co2 flux three kinds of general parameters are needed for a triplex flux model site parameters photosynthesis parameters and respiration parameters therefore it was necessary to set these initial values in the model before simulation table 2 provides the reference values of these parameters that were entered into the model they are regarded as crucial parameters for predicting co2 flux they are also the parameters that are severely affected by im measures such as covering warming fertilization irrigation felling chen et al 2018 sun et al 2008 2 4 2 meteorological variables driving the model five meteorological variables were used to drive the model air temperature at a canopy

2011 2013 and 2015 the values of the meteorological variables were higher in summer than in winter the annual average t a 7 m and t s 5 c m were 15 7 ppfd during the two study pefig 3a during the two study periods the coefficients of variation cv were 2 9 and 2 5 respectively the average t s 5 c m was 11 61 he two study periods the coefficients of variation cv we t a 7 m of 3 67 1 he two study t s 5 c m was slightly lower than the t a 7 m in other seasons mean annual rh ranged from 55 24 to 68 79 fig 3b during the study periods with a cv of 10 7 mean annual vpd ranged from 0 72 to 0 95 kpa fig 3c with a cv of 15 3 mean annual ppfd ranged from 292 80 μmol m 1s 2 to 333 67 μmol m 1s 2 fig 3d with a cv of 5 0 the vpd and ppfd exhibited similar trends in variation average annual co2 was 440 9 μmol mol 1 fig 3e with a cv of 5 0 2 4 3 model validation based on the meteorological data from 2011 2013 and 2015 the triplex flux model was run for simulating nep and npp dataset patterns for 30 min in a lei bamboo forest comparing the simulated results of nep to those flux results acquired from actual site data in 2011 im and 2012 nim the coefficient of determination r 2 root mean square error rmse and statistical significance p were adopted for evaluating the modelled nep flux precision in addition rmse was computed according to the following formula 10 rmse 1 n i 1 n y m y 0 i 2 in the formula ym represents the modeled result while y 0 represents the measured result in general a high r 2 value with a low rmse value suggests high precision 2 5 data quality control and missing data interpolation the average covariance of atmospheric rotation with vertical wind velocity such as h2o co2 was used to calculate the carbon flux for 30 min after the raw eddy covariance ec data was processed by the eddypro li cor biosciences lincoln nebraska usa flux measuring system it is necessary to control the quality of the flux data due to the influences of precipitation condensation insects and random electrical signal anomalies we combined the flux observation principle of the eddy covariance method and chinaflux data processed standard to check and control the data quality of the 30 min flux data data were filtered out and treated as gaps when 1 in the case of 2 0 2 0 mg co2 m 2 s 1 co2 flux the co2 content fell in the range of 800 or 500 mg m 3 while the water vapor content beyond the range from 0 to 40 g m 3 2 the aberrant value namely the absolute difference value between that value and those at five consecutive points was 2 5 fold higher than the variance 3 measurements were carried out during precipitation events 4 an effective sample number of 15 000 and 5 the measured value showed a lower friction speed u 0 2 m s 1 according to the net radiation rn standard all values were divided into daytime and nighttime after initial screening the average effective data was 64 58 for the study periods the meteorological data for 2014 were missing because of instrument failure and thus nep and npp for 2014 were excluded from our study 3 results 3 1 sensitivity analysis the sensitivity analysis of the model was carried out at three levels using the control variable method namely the general parameters table 2 and meteorological variables fig 3 entered in the model model inputs were 10 20 and 30 respectively on the current basis the sensitivity was expressed as the variation in the percentage of nep the results indicated that nep was remarkably sensitive to changes in lai mr f n v m25 and q 10 fig 4 at all three gradients which led to an average change in nep of 9 41 22 86 the change in nep was in direct proportion to the change in these parameters except q 10 generally nep increased as these parameters increased the acanopy effectively increased only when there was an increase in the lai while keeping the other parameters unchanged which indicates that nep will increase increasing the v m25 enhanced vc and vj which then effectively promoted the acanopy and nep of the plants the higher the average nitrogen content in the leaf n the higher the carbon absorption while f n is the ratio of the average leaf nitrogen n content to the maximum leaf nitrogen content nm when nm is constant the greater the n the greater the f n thus nep will increase when f n increases as the respiratory sensitivity coefficient q 10 directly affects the variation in re and ra which increased with increasing q 10 but nep decreased and vice versa among the input meteorological variables used in the model fig 5 nep was extremely sensitive to changes in t s 5 c m co 2 and ppfd as nep changed by 10 34 6 09 and 3 70 respectively while rh vpd and ta had little influence on nep the change in nep was in direct proportion to the changes in t s 5 c m and ta but in inverse proportion to the changes in ppfd co 2 rh and vpd t s 5 c m affected re and ra mainly by affecting q 10 photosynthesis was often inhibited by a higher ppfd co 2 rh and vpd which then resulted in a further decrease in the sensitivity of nep 3 2 model validation the parameters table 2 and meteorological data obtained during the study period were entered into the triplex flux model to simulate the nep and npp of a lei bamboo forest at a 30 min time scale the observed im 2011 and nim 2012 nep determined by the ec method and the simulated nep based on the triplex flux model were used to test the validity of the model in a 1 1 relationship line the results indicated that the simulated nep was largely consistent with the observed nep the r 2 ranged between 0 78 0 91 p 0 001 and rmse varied between 0 04 0 09 gc m 1 fig 6 and fig 7 gpp could only be estimated via the nep and re values and not by direct observation using the ec method therefore to avoid any errors produced in estimating the gpp which would affect the evaluation accuracy of model the nep gpp and re values were simulated by the triplex flux model and compared with those observed by ec methods on daily scale fig 8 a c the results showed that the values simulated based on the triplex flux model were nearly identical to those measured using the ec method over the four years table 3 with an r 2 of 0 42 0 61 and 0 55 respectively fig 8d f it is evident that the input parameters of the model table 2 were able to simulate the nep and npp of the lei bamboo forest this means that the triplex flux model is suitable for the study of the carbon cycle at this site however it failed to reveal the nep diurnal patterns there were some gaps in the simulated peak and valley values of nep as these tended to be overestimated at night to some extent and underestimated during the day in this study we used july and august summer and january and february winter as examples to show the daily patterns of the nep simulated by the triplex flux model and observed by the ec method fig 9 a d 3 3 variation characteristics of nep under im and nim of a lei bamboo forest fig 10 shows the variation characteristics of the monthly average nep under two different management strategies during the two study periods nep 0 indicates that the ecosystem is a carbon sink nep 0 indicates that the ecosystem is a carbon source under im conditions the daily average nep was 0 32 gc m 2day 1 while under nim conditions the nep was 0 44 gc m 2day 1 which is 1 38 times higher than that under im on the seasonal scale the harvesting of old bamboo wood and bamboo shoots in spring reduced the nep by 27 71 in summer irrigation and fertilization measures increased nep by 14 40 in autumn hooking tips and trimming diseased branches had little effect on nep 0 02 decrease in winter organic mulching and bamboo shoot removal led to a decrease in nep by 13 10 causing the lei bamboo forest to being a carbon source nep 12 71 gcm 2 nep was positive and a carbon sink in all other seasons nep 0 under nim conditions nep was positive and a carbon sink in all seasons nep 0 at an annual scale the annual average nep of the im lei bamboo forest was 108 63 gc m 2a 1 with a cv of 5 7 under nim the annual average nep was 155 53 gc m 2yr 1 it evident that the nep of the lei bamboo forest decreased by 13 72 under im with an average annual decrease of 46 9 gc m 2yr 1 3 4 variation characteristics of nep under im and nim of the lei bamboo forest fig 11 illustrates the variation characteristics of the monthly average npp under different management practices during two study periods npp reached their maximum values in summer which accounted for 38 1 of the total annual npp the minimum npp occurred in winter which accounted for 12 6 of the total annual npp under im conditions the monthly average npp was 41 94 gc m 2 while under nim conditions the monthly average npp was 48 61 gc m 2 thus the npp of the lei bamboo forest under im was obviously lower than that under nim when compared with nim the onsite npp decreased by 13 10 58 52 and 7 27 in winter spring and autumn respectively and increased by 2 50 in summer at an annual scale the annual average npp of the lei bamboo forest under im was 496 29 gc m 2a 1 under nim the annual average npp was 557 97 gc m 2yr 1 im resulted in a decrease in the average npp by 80 05 gc m 2yr 1 27 20 when compared with that under nim it evident that im practices resulted in a decrease in the total annual onsite npp of lei bamboo 4 discussion 4 1 accuracy evaluation of the triplex flux model the triplex flux model was used to simulate the nep and npp of a lei bamboo forest under im and nim practices we made full consideration of the changes of lai caused by im practice the leaf nitrogen content n caused by fertilization and the changes of soil q 10 value caused by organic matter mulching and irrigation we also took into account biomass variation of foliage biomass mfoliage stem biomass mstem and shoot biomass mshoot altered by im table 2 therefore the triplex flux model could accurately simulate the nep of the lei bamboo forest and there was good consistency between the simulated and observed nep on the 30 min time scale the r 2 ranged between 0 78 0 91 p 0 01 and the rmse varied between 0 04 0 09 gc m 1 fig 6 and fig 7 on the daily time scale the average nep gpp and re values simulated using the triplex flux model over four years were nearly identical to those measured using the ec method table 3 with r2 values of 0 42 0 61 and 0 55 respectively fig 8d f this illustrates that the triplex flux model is suitable for studying the carbon cycle in lei bamboo forests although the triplex flux model could simulate the nep of lei bamboo forests it failed to reveal the nep patterns accurately as there were certain deviations between some of the simulated nep peak and valley values fig 9a d the simulated nep values were underestimated in the day and tended to be overestimated at night this phenomenon is consistent with the results of other models used to investigate the forest carbon cycle amthor et al 2001 gran r f et al 2005 hanson et al 2004 this error is due to the following aspects 1 the error of the model structure itself and model input parameter errors zhou et al 2008 2 most of the parameters of the input model were more sensitive to higher temperatures at noon than lower temperatures at night such as q 10 was related to soil respiration sun et al 2008 zhou et al 2008 3 due to missing meteorological variables required to drive the model and co 2 flux data for model validation errors were produced in data processing and interpolation chen et al 2018 4 terrain conditions and atmospheric heterogeneity above the canopy may affect the model which leads to some errors in the measurement of nep based on ec technology gran r f et al 2005 5 the model iterative algorithm used to calculate stomatal conductance in the triplex flux model does not consider the soil water content which is usually related to the opening and closing of stomata therefore it may affect the simulated nep thus decreasing the simulation accuracy tuzet et al 2003 and 6 it maybe the limitation of meteorological factors as model inputs which could not fully consider the characteristics of the variations in nep associated with changing meteorological factors at a short time scale therefore the accuracy of the sensitive parameters and meteorological variables should be improved and the calibration of the flux tower used to measure the meteorological variables and co 2 flux should be carried out regularly soil water content should also be incorporated into the model only by optimizing the model structure and decreasing system error as much as possible can we improve the accuracy of the model prediction 4 2 the influence of im on nep of lei bamboo the simulation results showed that the annual average nep under im and nim conditions were 108 63 gc m 2yr 1 and 155 53 gcm 2yr 1 respectively the former result was similar to the result obtained by ec in our study as well as that reported by liu et al 2018 based on the ec method 119 41 gc m 2yr 1 and 126 30 gcm 2yr 1 respectively it was evident that the nep of the lei bamboo forest was reduced by im on the seasonal scale im resulted in a 27 71 reduction in nep in spring and a 14 40 increase in summer while there was little effect on nep decrease of 0 02 in autumn in winter im resulted in nep decreasing by 13 10 whereby the lei bamboo forest acted as a carbon source nepaverage 12 71 gcm 2 however it acted as a carbon sink in other seasons nep 0 fig 8 this is consistent with the results reported by chen 2013 and liu et al 2018 the main reasons for this reduction in nep were analyzed from the perspective of bamboo wood harvesting shoot removal irrigation fertilization and winter organic mulching old bamboo wood 4 years old and bamboo shoots were harvested each year leading to about 787 50 gc m 2yr 1 of the total carbon being transported out of the site of which 14 was fixed by bamboo shoots and 86 was fixed by bamboo timber chen et al 2013 meanwhile fertilization and organic mulching resulted in 571 gc m 2 yr 1 of the total carbon entering the ecosystem from offsite chen 2013 there was also 216 5 gc m 2 yr 1 transported offsite after subtracting the total carbon that was input from offsite therefore the carbon sequestration capacity of the lei bamboo forest retained onsite decreased under im rimming branches and hooking tips are important measures of im which reduces the risk of lodging and breaking caused by fierce winds and heavy snow but it also decreased the lai of the bamboo forest stand fang et al 1994 therefore the harvesting of old bamboo wood and hooking tips both decrease photosynthesis by reducing the onsite lai this reduces canopy photosynthesis and affects autotrophic and heterotrophic respiration both directly and indirectly for example huang 2015 reported a carbon emission increase of 7 72 tc hm 2yr 1 under im jensen et al 2017 showed that harvesting grass resulted in the reduction of nee in a grassland ecosystem by 338 gc m 2yr 1 which converted it from a carbon sink into a carbon source herbst et al 2013 showed that nee was half that before harvesting which could explain 50 of the change in total ecosystem nee 4 3 the influence of im on the npp of lei bamboo the simulation results based on the triplex flux model showed that the average npp of the lei bamboo forest at our study site was 518 74 gc m 2yr 1 and 583 31 gc m 2yr 1 under im and nim respectively under im the annual average npp onsite decreased by 27 20 the main reasons for this are as follows on the one hand clearcutting bamboo wood 4 years bamboo shoot harvesting and hooking tips led to a decrease in onsite biomass and photosynthesis which led directly to npp decreasing by 13 10 58 52 and 7 27 in winter spring and autumn respectively although npp increased by 2 50 because of irrigation and fertilization in summer 78 89 of the total npp was still transported offsite which was much higher than the increase in npp 2 50 on the other hand the clearcutting of undergrowth vegetation increased the yield of bamboo shoots but decreased the productivity of the herb and shrub layers therefore the total productivity of the bamboo forest ecosystem further declined onsite li et al 2013 zhou et al 2010 in conclusion the productivity of the lei bamboo forest was reduced by im 5 conclusions this study found that the triplex flux model is suitable for studying the carbon cycle in lei bamboo forests however the model failed to accurately reveal the nep patterns as there were certain deviations between some of the simulated nep peak and valley values the simulated nep values were underestimated in day and tended to be overestimated at night the sensitivity analysis results indicate that nep was remarkably sensitive to lai mr f n v m25 q 10 which caused an average percentage change of 9 41 22 86 in nep among the input meteorological variables used in the model nep was extremely sensitive to t s 5 c m co 2 and ppfd which could explain about 10 34 6 09 and 3 70 of the changes in nep respectively it is evident that im measures are the key factor affecting nep im measures undertaken in the lei bamboo forest resulted in a decrease in the average annual nep and npp by 27 20 and 13 72 respectively in spring the nep and npp of the forest were greatly reduced by the harvesting of old bamboo wood and new shoots by analyzing the influence of im practices across the different seasons we found that the effect of im measures on nep and npp in spring was the most significant harvesting old bamboo wood and removing new shoots caused a 27 71 and 58 52 reduction in nep and npp respectively im had little impact on nep 0 02 and npp 7 27 in autumn by analyzing the simulated uncertainty of the model we found that the influence of soil water content should be incorporated into the stomatal conductance model in future research to improve the simulation accuracy of triplex flux model however due to the lack of a model suitable for predicting meteorological variables at this site it would be impossible to predict the nep and npp in the future thus we recommend this direction of study for future research

24746,biological rotation length is a key parameter of even aged forest management future climate change is expected to affect forest growth and thus modify biological rotation age but knowledge about the effect of climate change on the rotation for both timber production and carbon storage remains limited from process based growth model the biological rotation age bra of larix olgensis plantations in china is technically set for 40 years according to the principle of maximizing timber production and it is necessary to further examine the bra with consideration of site quality differences and climate change on the basis of 164 sample plots from the national forest inventory across the jilin province northeast china we use the process based model 3 pgmix to simulate the change of the bra of larix olgensis plantations for timber production and carbon storage under climate change different climate scenarios are investigated across different site productivity levels under the current climate scenario the bras for timber production and carbon storage are approximately 23 8 41 5 years and 25 0 46 4 years respectively the bras are reduced by 2 9 years under rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 climate scenarios the bra modification by climate change was site dependent and stands with good productivity sites led to shorter bras than those with poor productivity sites the 3 pgmix model effectively simulates the dynamic change of stand volume and biomass for larch plantations future climate change with rising temperature increased precipitation and elevated co2 concertration is conducive to the growth of stand volume and carbon storage in the order of rcp 8 5 rcp 4 5 current results can provide scientific implications for adaptive management of larix olgensis plantations and shorter biological rotation is suggested for rotation modification under the future climate change in the region keywords climate change biological rotation carbon storage timber production 3 pgmix model 1 introduction impacts of climate change on forest ecosystems have been widely observed and projected such impacts include forest growth productivity mortality distribution and biodiversity through biological mechanisms for example the direct effect of co2 fertilization and indirect effect of temperature rise may affect plant growth and net primary productivity npp by modification of photosynthesis kumari et al 2019 in facing climate change adaptive forest management is considered as a predominant theme because forest managers need to know how to adapt forest management practices to keep forests productive and resilient based on biological parameters which are potentially modified by future climate change sousa silva et al 2018 vauhkonen and packalen 2018 jandl et al 2019 rotation length is a key parameter of even aged forest management which is the time span from the establishment of a forest stand to its final felling and it is dictated by specific management goals and biophysical factors traditionally in most even aged forest systems the goal is to maximize the economic benefits from timber production however in many parts of the world the variety of demands placed on forests and their needs to adapt to changing conditions e g climate and co2 are increasing forest management needs to consider an increasing range of biological and ecological values beyond traditional wood products such as biodiversity conservation and climate change mitigation nghiem 2014 jin et al 2017 dong et al 2020 the inclusion of climate change mitigation by carbon storage in the goals may modify the optimal rotation length hennigar et al 2008 asante and armstrong 2012 abedi et al 2018 dong et al 2020 the age of culmination of mean annual increment mai is often referred to as biological rotation age bra and is used to maximize volume production bettinger et al 2009 through increasing temperatures changes in water and disturbance regimes future climate change is expected to affect forest growth and thus bra this effect is also related to site condition gonzalez benecke et al 2017 etzold et al 2019 which increases the complexity of the climate change effect on bra prediction of bra for the growth of volume and carbon storage influenced by climate is crucial in the search for strategies to mitigate and adapt to global change however knowledge on the effect of climate change on the bra for both timber production and carbon storage remains limited process based models are important tools and widely used to simulate climate change impacts on forest growth forrester and tang 2016 mao et al 2016 reyer et al 2016 augustynczik et al 2017 palma et al 2018 but are seldom used for biological rotation simulation among of them 3 pg is one of the most widely used process based models which bridged the gap between traditional empirical and process based growth and yield models landsberg and waring 1997 gupta and sharma 2019 recently the 3 pg model has been modified into 3 pgmix for mixed species and deciduous species forrester and tang 2016 but the application is still limited larix olgensis is one of main deciduous coniferous tree species in northeast china and plays an important role in both timber production and ecological service according to the national forest management plan of china 2016 2050 released in 2016 forest management in the northeast region aims to become multifunctional with carbon as one important goal of ecological services forest productivity would accelerate from future climate change with rising temperature and increasing precipitation in the region shen et al 2015 zang et al 2016 liu et al 2019 the rotation age of larix olgensis plantations in china is technically set for 40 years according to the principle of maximizing timber production nevertheless the rotation age need further examination with consideration of site quality differences how future climate change would modify the bra for timber production brat and carbon storage brac of larch plantations remains unclear determining this knowledge is expected to guide decision making for adaptive management of larix olgensis plantations to climate change therefore the present study aims to simulate the impacts of future climate change on bra for larch plantations in northeast china using process based model 3 pgmix our hypothesises are 1 the rising temperature and the increasing precipitation and atmospheric concentration of co2 shortens the bras for timber production and carbon storage of larix olgensis plantations 2 the bras of stands in good sites are shorter than those in poor sites and 3 future climate change increases the stand carbon storage 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description the study area is located in jilin province northeast china the area is under the mid temperate zone and features a continental monsoon climate with a mean annual precipitation of 400 600 mm and mean annual temperature of 5 54 c as a main plantation in the region larix olgensis plots are distributed in the low hilly region of changbai mountains with an altitude range of 170 1190 m soil types are dark brown forest soil humic cambisols and brown soil alluvial cambisols iuss working group wrb 2014 2 2 data collection 2 2 1 sample plot data stand data were collected from permanent plots of the 6th 7th and 8th national forest inventory nfi in jilin province which were implemented in 1999 2004 and 2009 respectively nfi is based on a 4 km 8 km grid system with a sample plot size of 0 0667 ha a total of 164 rectangle sample plots of larix olgensis plantations were used and located in the range of 40 87 46 30 n and 121 63 131 32 e fig 1 among them there were 54 plots with thinning practice the longitude latitude elevation and soil depth stand mean height mean diameter at breast height dbh stand density stand volume and age of each plot were investigated the stand total biomass of the above and below ground portion was obtained by adopting tree biomass equations established for larix olgensis chen and zhu 1989 moreover stand carbon storage was calculated from stand total biomass according to the published carbon accounting parameters of larix olgensis zeng 2015 table 1 lists the descriptive statistics of the stand variables 2 2 2 climatic data the current climatic data for model calibration were provided by climateap climate asia pacific version 2 11 wang et al 2017 and china meteorological data network http data cma cn for 1921 2010 as an application for dynamic local downscaling of historical and future climate data in the asia pacific climateap produced scale free climate data and was successfully applied in climate change research wang et al 2016 zhang et al 2017 hu et al 2019 we used the ccsm4 model which was demonstrated to produce the best predictions of climate change for northeast china lei et al 2016 the present study used seven monthly variables including maximum and minimum temperature c vapor pressure deficit mbar precipitation mm solar radiation mj m 2 day 1 and the average number of days per month with rain and frost events these climatic variables were assigned to each sample plot according to geographic location and elevation for future climate change we assumed that co2 concentration temperature and precipitation are major climate variables representative concentration pathway rcp 8 5 high emission the radiation force caused by equivalent concentration in 2100 is greater than 8 5 w m 2 and rcp 4 5 moderate emission the radiation force is approximately

and well parameterized for many tree species the previous 3 pg model is mono specific and monthly time step stand level and process based landsberg and waring 1997 waring et al 1998 gupta and sharma 2019 the model is modified into 3 pgmix which is applicable for mixed species forests and deciduous species larix olgensis in this study for example with a new light submodel and different versions of water balance calculations and diameter distributions forrester and tang 2016 therefore the present study uses 3 pgmix because larch has no foliage in winter in the model npp is determined using light use efficiency which is affected by site and environmental factors through a series of climate dependent growth modifiers landsberg and waring 1997 the assimilates from npp submodel are allocated to foliage stem and root biomass furthermore stem volume was attained by allometric relationship appendix a as such the model could be used to simulate the impact of climate change on stand increments and thus biological rotation as 3 pgs the model 3 pgmix operates on a monthly time step climatic data of maximum and minimum temperature c vapor pressure deficit mbar precipitation mm solar radiation mj m 2 day 1 and average number of days per month with rain and frost events are required the weather module of the model is then used to obtain variables of vapor pressure deficit and solar radiation with available temperature and precipitation data amichev et al 2010 thomas et al 2017 initial values of site characteristics are also required such as soil texture class and upper and lower limits of available soil water mm stand data such as initial age initial density latitude of stand location and biomass in roots wr root biomass t ha 1 foliage wf foliage biomass t ha 1 and stem ws stem biomass t ha 1 are likewise necessary sands and landsberg 2002 almeida et al 2004 site fertility rating fr is an important variable for the 3 pgmix model as a site nutrition modifier to growth and it also affects biomass allocation however fr was the weakest feature of the 3 pg model landsberg and waring 1997 gupta and sharma 2019 due to the lack of a suitable soil fertility grading measurement method it could be attained based on experience or calibration sands 2004 we adopt the method proposed by subedi et al 2015 in the study which successfully derived fr values from site index si the si is a species specific measure of forest productivity and expressed by the mean height of dominant trees at a given base age a base age or reference age is used so that stands of different site quality can be compared and normally determined at the age when stand dominant height reaches its peak or tends to be stable 20 years for larch in our case here the relationship between si and stand volume for all plots is used to establish the final equation fr 0 0023 si 2 02121 r 2 0 99 with fr varying from 0 to 1 for larix olgensis plantations in northeast china in this study the parameterization of 3 pgmix model uses the following approaches field measurement analogy with other species especially same tree species larch default values parameter value assigned by iterative tuning to produce best

nfi data 328 observations are used for model calibration and the 8th nfi data 164 observations are used for model validation a linear regression between the observed and predicted data is established for 3 pgmix model validation the coefficient of determination r 2 mean absolute error mae mean relative error mre root mean square error rmse and relative root mean square error rrmse are calculated to evaluate the performance of 3 pgmix model 2 4 biological rotation ages for timber production and carbon storage under future climate change the problem of determining the optimum rotation is its common derivation from the maximum sustained yield of timber inside the bark olschewski and benítez 2010 traditionally rotation is determined by harvesting timber when the mean annual increment mai equals the periodic volume increment bettinger et al 2009 at this point mai was the maximum in the present study our concern is mostly bra for timber production and carbon storage the bra is determined at the peak point of the mai curve with maximum mai which was attained directly from 3 pgmix outputs to check the difference in bra modification by climate change at different sites the site index si of the plots is divided into four levels using the quartile method i 12 93m si 17 84m ii 10 24m si 12 93m iii 8 39m si 10 24m and iv 5 25m si 8 39m the 3 pgmix model is applied to simulate the growth of stand volume and biomass with varied site levels i ii iii iv under different climate scenarios current rcp 4 5 rcp 8 5 to investigate the pure effect of temperature precipitation and co2 concentration on bras in larch plantations growing at different site levels we generated climate scenarios with the rising monthly average temperature by 1 c 2 c the changed monthly average precipitation by 10 20 and the increased co2 concentration by 76ppm 203ppm borys et al 2016 tuchman et al 2003 respectively table 3 the input data for the model simulation includes climatic data site factors stand initialization and parameters we used multi site module of 3 pgmix for growth simulation of each sample plots therefore climatic and site data are specific to each plots for stand initialization stocking of 3300 trees ha was applied according to planting density in the region initial biomass accumulated on root stem and foliage was estimated from empirical observation no thinning was considered during the simulation parameter values can be found in appendix b the time scale for our simulation was 90 years 3 results 3 1 model calibration and validation the calibration data obtained from the 6th and 7th nfi in jilin province were used to obtain optimal parameter values the 3 pgmix model underestimated all variables except for wf with r 2 values that were higher than 0 80 fig 2 in general the estimation of stand volume was the best with r 2 0 94 rmse 15 95 m3 ha 1 and mae 11 51 m3 ha 1 the model also effectively estimated wf and wr with a r 2 higher than 0 89 and rrmse below 24 25 however ws was not sufficiently well predictedwith rrmse amounting to 37 82 in the validation phase the observed and simulated values for all stand variables had high correlations with r 2 values ranging between 0 82 0 95 the 3 pgmix model could effectively estimate the stand volume of larix olgensis plantations with r 2 0 95 and mre 1 18 the estimated values and ranges of all stand variables were similar to the observed with the same variation trend hence the 3 pgmix model could be used to simulate the growth of larix olgensis plantations 3 2 biological rotation age for timber production and carbon storage under climate change the average values of maximum mai of stand volume and brat under future climate change were determined according to the annual output from 3 pgmix model table 4 which were 3 68 7 60 m3 ha 1 a 1and 21 8 37 5 years respectively moreover the corresponding values under the current climate were 2 74 6 16m3 ha 1 a 1 and 23 8 41 5 years the mait values under future climate change were larger than those under current climate for the same site level according to the following trend i ii iii iv furthermore the brats were also shorter than those under current climate showing iv iii ii i for the same climate change scenario stands with good site quality showed faster growth than those with poor site quality large fluctuations in the values of brat and maximum mai were observed due to variations in site index and climate change for example the maximum mai and corresponding brat was 7 60 m3 ha 1 a 1 and 21 8 years under rcp 8 5and site level i which were far larger and shorter than those under current climate and site level iv mait 2 74 m3 ha 1 a 1 brat 41 5 years similar to bra for timber production we first simulated the dynamic of stand biomass at different site levels under three climate scenarios and converted biomass into carbon growth results indicated that brac varied with site index under different climate scenarios and were shorter by 2 9 years under rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 climate scenarios than those under current climate table 5 meantime brac at high site index was smaller than low site index the values of brac were larger than brat that is carbon maturity 22 6 46 4 years table 5 and were later than the maturity for timber production 21 8 41 5 years table 4 3 3 effects of climate change on carbon storage at different site levels the carbon storage of larix olgensis plantations at different site levels was annually simulated under climate change fig 3 the results showed that with the increase of stand age carbon storage increased rapidly at first and then gradually stabilized the changes in conditions were slowly introduced thus the differences between climate scenarios were not significant in the early stages of the period climate change was favorable to carbon storage accumulation in the order of rcp 8 5 rcp 4 5 current in addition carbon storage increased with increasing site quality under the given climate scenario that is stands with good sites had stronger responses to climate change than poor sites 3 4 separate effect of temperature precipitation and co2 on bras the brat and brac under baseline current climate were 23 37 years and 29 43 years respectively with the rising temperature brat was 25 39 years 1 c 26 41 years 2 c and brac was 31 45 years 1 c 33 47 years 2 c respectively figs 4 6 the increased precipitation resulted in brat as 23 37 years 10 23 37 years 20 and brac 29 43 years 10 29 43 years 20 respectively the decreased precipitation resulted in brat as 23 37 years 10 24 37 years 20 and brac 29 43 years 10 29 43 years 20 respectively the increased co2 resulted in brat as 20 33 years 76ppm 18 28years 203ppm and brac 25 38 years 76ppm 21 33 years 203ppm respectively therefore bra was negatively affected by rising temperature 2 5 years longer not significantly affected by increased or decreased precipitation and significantly positively affected by increasing co2 concentration 4 discussion 4 1 model performance with its easy accessibility flexibility and limited number of parameters the process based model 3 pg was successfully applied to various tree species across the world these locations include australia finland brazil canada spain new zealand china south africa and the united states gupta and sharma 2019 however applications were mainly even aged monoculture plantations forrester and tang 2016 modified the model into 3 pgmix which allows for mixed species stands and deciduous tree species with leafing out processes nevertheless the application of 3 pgmix model was still limited in the present study the process based 3 pgmix model was parameterized and calibrated for larix olgensis plantations in northeast china with consistent performance for calibration and validation the model appears well suited for modeling the stand volume and biomass in the region linear regression between predictions and observations for the validation dataset demonstrated a strong fit r 2 values from 0 83 to 0 95 and rrmse from 11 10 to 16 92 with the exception of ws r 2 0 82 but rrmse 39 95 the large bias for stem biomass was in line with our previous study using 3 pg xie et al 2017 the reasons for such a bias needed exploration given that stem biomass always had more accurate prediction than foliage in most studies we checked the database and found that some sample plots with large prediction errors may cause the bias since larch plantations are widely distributed the use of the same model parameter values for all sample plots may lead to unreliable predictions of ws due to the unknown systematic differences in physiological morphological and phenological characteristics of a species forrester et al 2017 generally the 3 pgmix model was applicable and produced good performance across a wide range of stand ages for larch plantations although predictions between 3 pg and 3 pgmix for monospecific cunninghamia lanceolate plantations showed slight differences as shown in forrester and tang 2016 3 pgmix generated more accurate predictions compared with 3 pg for larch plantations xie et al 2017 one main change for 3 pgmix was the new light absorption sub model which could work for mixed species forests or monospecific plantations with multiple canopy layers based on the lambert beer law and extinction coefficient forrester 2014 forrester and tang 2016 the other changes were two additional parameters leaf grow and leaf fall for deciduous species that proved suitable for larch plantations in the present study leaf grow and leaf fall in 3 pgmix were used to simulate the dormant stage of deciduous species when no productivity respiration transpiration or light absorption occured our findings on model performance were consistent with the previous study forrester et al 2017 that used 3 pgmix to examine mixing effects based on data of mixture and monocultures of fagus sylvatica and pinus sylvestris accross europe moreover the model efficiency was larger than 0 70 but had more variations for npp predictions and stem mass growth therefore these studies demonstrated that when appropriately calibrated for a species 3 pgmix provides accurate predictions of the time course of forest development parameters in process based models are important in determining the impact of climate change future climate change may alter the physiological process and biomass allocation mencuccini and grace 1995 medlyn et al 2011 dyderski et al 2018 and thus the parameters used for 3 pgmixmodel simulation such as sla wsx 1000 and parameters for stem height and volume equations in our case however these parameters increase the complexity and difficulty of model simulations because their uncertainties resulting from climate change are less understood therefore we assumed that future climate change would not affect model parametersin the study additionally several parameters including ah nhb nhn av nvb nvh nvn are attained using empirical fitting that was restricted by observed data these limitations required future study in the future since including parameter uncertainty into the model could further increase the accuracy of projections and the degree of impact reyer et al 2016 although 3 pgmix could reasonably simulate the growth of larch plantations in the study there are some potential improvements which may enhance model performance as an essential site specific input variable site fertility rating fr is a site nutrition modifier to growth and affects biomass allocation landsberg and waring 1997 however determining fr value is still a challengable task of the 3 pgmix model because of the insufficient soil inventory data especially at large scale and the lack of the knowledge on the quantitative relationship between soil nutrient and tree growth landsberg and waring 1997 gupta and sharma 2019 several solutions have been proposed such as the conversion from site index in this study subedi et al 2015 and the linkage between soil chemical characteristics and tree growth will be beneficial to the model performance climate change can have profound impacts on tree growth through modifying the phenology and the length of the growing season although the growing season is influenced by air temperatures frost days rainfall or daylight hours which were partial inputs for the model the process directly related with changes of the growing season still needed in addition the constant ratio npp gpp was questioned by some studies recently which indicated that the value of this ratio is influenced by environmental factors stand age and management mäkelä and valentine 2001 collalti and prentice 2019 therefore flexible ratio of npp gpp from more detailed mechanistic models should facilitate our understanding of production and respiration landsberg et al 2020 4 2 effects of climate change on biological rotation age at different site levels the 3 pgmix model could generate a number of stand characteristics of interest to foresters such as stem density standing volume and current and mean annual increment however this model was rarely used to determine bra in this study the bras for timber production and carbon storage of larix olgensis plantations at different site levels under different climatic scenarios were first determined using process based 3 pgmix model the results showed that climate change would shorten the bra in the order of rcp 8 5 rcp 4 5 current although the larch plantations were distributed across a broad altitude range the effects of climate change on brat and brac were the same i e shortening due to the acceleration of stem increment furthermore there were variations in the magnitude resulted from mait and maic under the current climate scenario mait ranged from 2 74 to 6 16 m3 ha 1 a 1 and were 3 68 7 27 m3 ha 1 a 1 and 3 73 7 60 m3 ha 1 a 1 under the rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 scenarios respectively similarly maic varied from 0 85 1 30 t ha 1 a 1 under the current climate scenario and were 1 17 1 56 t ha 1 a 1 and 1 18 1 58 t ha 1 a 1under the rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 scenarios respectively the brat and brac under the current climate were approximately 23 8 41 5 years and 25 0 46 4 years respectively with future climate change in the northeast china including increased temperature precipitation and co2 concentration the brat would be at an age of 22 1 37 5 years rcp 4 5 and 21 8 35 7 years rcp 8 5 meanwhile the brac would be 23 0 39 1 years rcp 4 5 and 22 6 37 4 years rcp 8 5 respectively future climate change would shorten bra for timber production and carbon storage with spatial heterogeneity which verified our first hypothesis previous studies indicated variable rotation ages for timber production of larch plantations liu and yu 1990 determined that bra was 38 years according to the maximum mai of larix olgensis the bra of larix olgensis plantations was 25 30 years zhao and jiang 1995 and 48 3 years yin et al 2008 according to stem analysis data wang and liu 1992 found that the bra for larix gmelinii stands was 31 41 years bra for carbon storage was also investigated which varied from 37 8 to 42 5 years for larix gmelinii stands in heilongjiang province jiang et al 2015 and was 48 7 years for larix olgensis plantations in liaoning province yin et al 2008 the bra was shorter at good sites than poor sites sheng et al 1991 ding 1998 2000 demiguel et al 2014 jin et al 2017 which may be caused by differences in climate and site conditions our results on bra were within the scope of previous studies and consistent with the site dependent difference but were generated from process based growth models historical observations also demonstrated rotation lengths change for other tree species brockerhoff et al 2008 found that the rotation age of new zealand s pinus radiata plantations changed from 40 50 years in the 1970s to 25 30 years in the 1990s in sweden the minimum rotation age varied depending on site productivity and geographic location roberge et al 2016 in addition the largest forest owner association in southern sweden recently recommended to shorten rotations in norway spruce picea abies by 10 15 years where typical rotations are 60 80 years to decrease the risk of storm and root rot subramanian et al 2015 modification of biological rotation by climate change was also found an increase or decrease in stand volume or carbon growth due to climate change would impact bra the rising temperature would accelerate the photosynthesis rate and stimulate plant growth which hastened the achievement of maximum mai in the future melillo et al 1993 bréda and brunette 2019 and led to an earlier maturity and reduced rotation lengths felton et al 2016 2017 stöckle et al 2018 however we found the separate effect of rising temperature was negative this is due to that increasing temperature generally increased evapotranspiration which could limit tree growth yang et al 2006 girardin et al 2016 hogg et al 2017 both the positive and negative effect of rising temperature on tree growth were found in literature shuman et al 2011 koprowski 2012 gonzalez benecke et al 2017 increasing or decreasing precipitation showed no obvious effect on the growth of larch plantations in spite of weak magnitude fig 5 the independent of the growth to precipitation indicated that sites are not very much water limited in the region however mai was significantly positively affected by increasing co2 concentration across site levels fig 6 linking the separate effect of rising temperature and changing precipitation and elevated co2 concerntration we derived that the interaction of temperature and precipitation and elevated co2 were the main drivers of accelerated growth for larch plantations in the study co2 fertilization effect was widely observed norby et al 2005 rising co2 has been associated with increased water use efficiency rollinson et al 2017 and more co2 could be sequestrated into soil as soil organic matter chen et al 2016 overall future climate change would accelerate stand growth and shorten the bra of larch plantations in northeast china the acceleration of stand growth of larch plantations under similar future climate change in northeast china was also reported lei et al 2016 xie et al 2020 kellomäki et al 1992 and väisänen et al 1994 showed that rotation length could be shorter under warmer climate climate change was favorable to stand carbon storage accumulation soil carbon not included in the order of rcp 8 5 rcp 4 5 current possibly due to the improved stand productivity from the rising temperature increasing precipitation and elevating co2 kurz et al 2008 forest carbon dynamics depend on biotic and abiotic factors and the carbon storage response to climate change is complicated canadell and raupach 2008 literature showed both increase and decrease of carbon storage in future climate change yen 2016 schimel et al 2000 and lewis et al 2009 suggested that increasing atmospheric co2 concentrations or co2 fertilization effect may cause the increase in carbon storage as several theories and models predict the ongoing climatic changes which included significant warming and doubling of precipitation increased carbon storage by altering the living environment composition structure and growth forms of larch devi et al 2008 however bioclimatic envelope models also predicted a decrease in tropical forest carbon stocks with climate change in madagascar due to a decrease in the average tree size and shifts in tree species distribution vieilledent et al 2016 in addition the uncertainty in climate change from different models has been widely discussed and some methods have been developed for lowering the uncertainty tebaldi and sansó 2009 we only tested climate change from ccsm4 model in the study and there were several sudden changes during the simulation periods which were resulted from an obvious change in climate variables resulted from climate change model which was also observed in previuos study lei et al 2016 optional climate model may modify the results from the 3 pgmix model multi model comparisons need to be investigated in future study our results also showed that bra modification by climate change varies with site condition the higher site index under a same climate scenario indicates an earlier bra the results are consistent with previous studies keyser and brown 2014 dudley et al 2015 site condition was one of the main factors affecting biomass accumulation and allocation higher site index would lead to better carbon utilization in the juvenile stage hirsch et al 2004 bontemps et al 2009 huang et al 2016 the response of trees to climate was modulated by site productivity more productive stands showed greater ability to maintain or increase growth at warmer temperatures under different precipitation levels martin benito et al 2011 and trees at more productive sites were more sensitive to climate leonelli et al 2008 two methods that determine the optimal rotation length in forest management include maximum sustained yield and maximum net economic benefits yang et al 2015 the present study focused on bra using the former without considering economic profits which were important for economic optimal rotation in forest management decisions paul et al 2013 ekholm 2016 the inclusion of economic profits may lead to different results for example peng et al 2018 found that the optimal rotation length of larix olgensis plantations in northeast china consisted of 55 61 years when the net present value of both wood production and carbon sequestration were simultaneously maximized however bréda and brunette 2019 suggested that immediate reduction of rotation length was associated with the best economic return followed by delayed adaptation and finally by the absence of adaptation when calculating optimal rotation length for carbon storage carbon storage in wood products need to be considered harvested trees were transformed into different products like sawn wood veneer and plywood mechanical mass products chemical mass products and bioenergy the processes of carbon releases are closely related to the end use of wood products with different life span therefore taper equations and diameter distribution models may be necessary to be combined with process based models for generating different wood products dong et al 2020 soil carbon storage is also a key component since soil largely influences the carbon balance of forest ecosystem in addition it is widely acknowledged that thinning affects stand growth roberge et al 2016 which will possibly modify the bra however the inclusion of both variable thinning regimes and climate change scenarios will make the study complicated xie et al 2020 these components were neglected in our study therefore further research is needed for generalizing economic rotation with multiple objectives and more carbon components under thinning regimes and climate scenariosin the future 4 3 implications for adaptive forest management anthropogenic climate change alters forests and thus forest management needs modifications silvicultural measures are advocated to consider future climate change subramanian et al 2015 sousa silva et al 2018 jandl et al 2019 motivated by the needs to adapt to its uncertainties and risks and to maximize their potential productivity capacity as part of global efforts a number of alternative adaptive actions to climate change impacts are discussed covering gene manipulation conversion of monocultures to mixed forests and silviculture management these actions include reducing the rotation lengths due to increased productivity hastening the stand replacement in vulnerable stands and other measures spittlehouse and stewart 2003 hemery 2008 spies et al 2010 kolström et al 2011 yousefpour et al 2017 reductions in rotation length decrease the time the crop tree is at risk limit the top height reached reduce windthrow risk and generally reduce uncertainty allowing other more suitable species to be replanted to a changing climate nabuurs et al 2008 schelhaas et al 2015 the present study showed no unique biological rotation through the application of 3 pgmix model and bra becomes short with high site index bra ranged from 23 8 46 4 years due to decreasing site quality under the current climate therefore the usual rotation age which is 40 years in northeast china needs to be modified according to site quality the 3 pgmix simulations also showed that the faster growth under future climate change would shorten biological rotation of larch plantations and the rotation modification was dependent on site quality the bra for timber production and carbon storage varied from 2 years good sites to 9 years poor sites earlier than the current value therefore shortening the rotation of larch plantations and implementing early thinning is suggested in the region adaptive management decision making is also suggested according to site quality stand with better site quality leads to shorter rotationand thus earlier thinning however detailed suggestions on thinning regimes start time frequency and intensity of thinning need further examination through model simulations with both climate change and thinning scenarios in addition different adaptive actions are dependent on the balance among ecosystem services timber production biodiversity conservation and site quality preservation fouqueray et al 2019 therefore careful decision making on rotation age should be derived from multi objective planning with the combination of 3 pgmix modeling 5 conclusion this study investigates the biological rotation age of larch plantations at different site levels under climate change considering timber production and carbon storage using 3 pgmix model the 3 pgmix model effectively simulates the dynamic change of stand volume and biomass partitioning for larch plantations the rotation age of larix olgensis plantations is expected to change over the coming century due to the potential effect of climate change and current trends from a biological point of view our results indicate that biological rotation shortens by 2 9 years with rising temperature increasing precipitation and elevating atmospheric co2 the modification of biological rotation age is site dependent a high site index shortens the biological rotation climate change is conducive to quickly achieving timber production and carbon storage of the stand which is reflected in rcp 8 5 rcp 4 5 current results of the climate sensitivity analysis indicate that rising temperature and increasing precipitation had negative and weak positive impact on bra furthermore larch plantations are particularly sensitive to rising co2 our results help address a previously neglected knowledge gap regarding future implications of climate change for biological rotation to ensure sustainable forest management in larix olgensis plantations declaration of

24746,biological rotation length is a key parameter of even aged forest management future climate change is expected to affect forest growth and thus modify biological rotation age but knowledge about the effect of climate change on the rotation for both timber production and carbon storage remains limited from process based growth model the biological rotation age bra of larix olgensis plantations in china is technically set for 40 years according to the principle of maximizing timber production and it is necessary to further examine the bra with consideration of site quality differences and climate change on the basis of 164 sample plots from the national forest inventory across the jilin province northeast china we use the process based model 3 pgmix to simulate the change of the bra of larix olgensis plantations for timber production and carbon storage under climate change different climate scenarios are investigated across different site productivity levels under the current climate scenario the bras for timber production and carbon storage are approximately 23 8 41 5 years and 25 0 46 4 years respectively the bras are reduced by 2 9 years under rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 climate scenarios the bra modification by climate change was site dependent and stands with good productivity sites led to shorter bras than those with poor productivity sites the 3 pgmix model effectively simulates the dynamic change of stand volume and biomass for larch plantations future climate change with rising temperature increased precipitation and elevated co2 concertration is conducive to the growth of stand volume and carbon storage in the order of rcp 8 5 rcp 4 5 current results can provide scientific implications for adaptive management of larix olgensis plantations and shorter biological rotation is suggested for rotation modification under the future climate change in the region keywords climate change biological rotation carbon storage timber production 3 pgmix model 1 introduction impacts of climate change on forest ecosystems have been widely observed and projected such impacts include forest growth productivity mortality distribution and biodiversity through biological mechanisms for example the direct effect of co2 fertilization and indirect effect of temperature rise may affect plant growth and net primary productivity npp by modification of photosynthesis kumari et al 2019 in facing climate change adaptive forest management is considered as a predominant theme because forest managers need to know how to adapt forest management practices to keep forests productive and resilient based on biological parameters which are potentially modified by future climate change sousa silva et al 2018 vauhkonen and packalen 2018 jandl et al 2019 rotation length is a key parameter of even aged forest management which is the time span from the establishment of a forest stand to its final felling and it is dictated by specific management goals and biophysical factors traditionally in most even aged forest systems the goal is to maximize the economic benefits from timber production however in many parts of the world the variety of demands placed on forests and their needs to adapt to changing conditions e g climate and co2 are increasing forest management needs to consider an increasing range of biological and ecological values beyond traditional wood products such as biodiversity conservation and climate change mitigation nghiem 2014 jin et al 2017 dong et al 2020 the inclusion of climate change mitigation by carbon storage in the goals may modify the optimal rotation length hennigar et al 2008 asante and armstrong 2012 abedi et al 2018 dong et al 2020 the age of culmination of mean annual increment mai is often referred to as biological rotation age bra and is used to maximize volume production bettinger et al 2009 through increasing temperatures changes in water and disturbance regimes future climate change is expected to affect forest growth and thus bra this effect is also related to site condition gonzalez benecke et al 2017 etzold et al 2019 which increases the complexity of the climate change effect on bra prediction of bra for the growth of volume and carbon storage influenced by climate is crucial in the search for strategies to mitigate and adapt to global change however knowledge on the effect of climate change on the bra for both timber production and carbon storage remains limited process based models are important tools and widely used to simulate climate change impacts on forest growth forrester and tang 2016 mao et al 2016 reyer et al 2016 augustynczik et al 2017 palma et al 2018 but are seldom used for biological rotation simulation among of them 3 pg is one of the most widely used process based models which bridged the gap between traditional empirical and process based growth and yield models landsberg and waring 1997 gupta and sharma 2019 recently the 3 pg model has been modified into 3 pgmix for mixed species and deciduous species forrester and tang 2016 but the application is still limited larix olgensis is one of main deciduous coniferous tree species in northeast china and plays an important role in both timber production and ecological service according to the national forest management plan of china 2016 2050 released in 2016 forest management in the northeast region aims to become multifunctional with carbon as one important goal of ecological services forest productivity would accelerate from future climate change with rising temperature and increasing precipitation in the region shen et al 2015 zang et al 2016 liu et al 2019 the rotation age of larix olgensis plantations in china is technically set for 40 years according to the principle of maximizing timber production nevertheless the rotation age need further examination with consideration of site quality differences how future climate change would modify the bra for timber production brat and carbon storage brac of larch plantations remains unclear determining this knowledge is expected to guide decision making for adaptive management of larix olgensis plantations to climate change therefore the present study aims to simulate the impacts of future climate change on bra for larch plantations in northeast china using process based model 3 pgmix our hypothesises are 1 the rising temperature and the increasing precipitation and atmospheric concentration of co2 shortens the bras for timber production and carbon storage of larix olgensis plantations 2 the bras of stands in good sites are shorter than those in poor sites and 3 future climate change increases the stand carbon storage 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description the study area is located in jilin province northeast china the area is under the mid temperate zone and features a continental monsoon climate with a mean annual precipitation of 400 600 mm and mean annual temperature of 5 54 c as a main plantation in the region larix olgensis plots are distributed in the low hilly region of changbai mountains with an altitude range of 170 1190 m soil types are dark brown forest soil humic cambisols and brown soil alluvial cambisols iuss working group wrb 2014 2 2 data collection 2 2 1 sample plot data stand data were collected from permanent plots of the 6th 7th and 8th national forest inventory nfi in jilin province which were implemented in 1999 2004 and 2009 respectively nfi is based on a 4 km 8 km grid system with a sample plot size of 0 0667 ha a total of 164 rectangle sample plots of larix olgensis plantations were used and located in the range of 40 87 46 30 n and 121 63 131 32 e fig 1 among them there were 54 plots with thinning practice the longitude latitude elevation and soil depth stand mean height mean diameter at breast height dbh stand density stand volume and age of each plot were investigated the stand total biomass of the above and below ground portion was obtained by adopting tree biomass equations established for larix olgensis chen and zhu 1989 moreover stand carbon storage was calculated from stand total biomass according to the published carbon accounting parameters of larix olgensis zeng 2015 table 1 lists the descriptive statistics of the stand variables 2 2 2 climatic data the current climatic data for model calibration were provided by climateap climate asia pacific version 2 11 wang et al 2017 and china meteorological data network http data cma cn for 1921 2010 as an application for dynamic local downscaling of historical and future climate data in the asia pacific climateap produced scale free climate data and was successfully applied in climate change research wang et al 2016 zhang et al 2017 hu et al 2019 we used the ccsm4 model which was demonstrated to produce the best predictions of climate change for northeast china lei et al 2016 the present study used seven monthly variables including maximum and minimum temperature c vapor pressure deficit mbar precipitation mm solar radiation mj m 2 day 1 and the average number of days per month with rain and frost events these climatic variables were assigned to each sample plot according to geographic location and elevation for future climate change we assumed that co2 concentration temperature and precipitation are major climate variables representative concentration pathway rcp 8 5 high emission the radiation force caused by equivalent concentration in 2100 is greater than 8 5 w m 2 and rcp 4 5 moderate emission the radiation force is approximately 4 5 w m 2 from the 5th assessment report of the ipcc were selected as the main future climate scenarios taylor et al 2012 future annual monthly climatic data for the time periods 2011 2100 were also downloaded from climateap dataset for model simulation co2 concentration was derived from the ipcc rcp database version 2 0 5 available at http www iiasa ac at table 2 showed the change of monthly air

and well parameterized for many tree species the previous 3 pg model is mono specific and monthly time step stand level and process based landsberg and waring 1997 waring et al 1998 gupta and sharma 2019 the model is modified into 3 pgmix which is applicable for mixed species forests and deciduous species larix olgensis in this study for example with a new light submodel and different versions of water balance calculations and diameter distributions forrester and tang 2016 therefore the present study uses 3 pgmix because larch has no foliage in winter in the model npp is determined using light use efficiency which is affected by site and environmental factors through a series of climate dependent growth modifiers landsberg and waring 1997 the assimilates from npp submodel are allocated to foliage stem and root biomass furthermore stem volume was attained by allometric relationship appendix a as such the model could be used to simulate the impact of climate change on stand increments and thus biological rotation as 3 pgs the model 3 pgmix operates on a monthly time step climatic data of maximum and minimum temperature c vapor pressure deficit mbar precipitation mm solar radiation mj m 2 day 1 and average number of days per month with rain and frost events are required the weather module of the model is then used to obtain variables of vapor pressure deficit and solar radiation with available temperature and precipitation data amichev et al 2010 thomas et al 2017 initial values of site characteristics are also required such as soil texture class and upper and lower limits of available soil water mm stand data such as initial age initial density latitude of stand location and biomass in roots wr root biomass t ha 1 foliage wf foliage biomass t ha 1 and stem ws stem biomass t ha 1 are likewise necessary sands and landsberg 2002 almeida et al 2004 site fertility rating fr is an important variable for the 3 pgmix model as a site nutrition modifier to growth and it also affects biomass allocation however fr was the weakest feature of the 3 pg model landsberg and waring 1997 gupta and sharma 2019 due to the lack of a suitable soil fertility grading measurement method it could be attained based on experience or calibration sands 2004 we adopt the method proposed by subedi et al 2015 in the study which successfully derived fr values from site index si the si is a species specific measure of forest productivity and expressed by the mean height of dominant trees at a given base age a base age or reference age is used so that stands of different site quality can be compared and normally determined at the age when stand dominant height reaches its peak or tends to be stable 20 years for larch in our case here the relationship between si and stand volume for all plots is used to establish the final equation fr 0 0023 si 2 02121 r 2 0 99 with fr varying from 0 to 1 for larix olgensis plantations in northeast china in this study the parameterization of 3 pgmix model uses the following approaches field measurement analogy with other species especially same tree species larch default values parameter value assigned by iterative tuning to produce best

nfi data 328 observations are used for model calibration and the 8th nfi data 164 observations are used for model validation a linear regression between the observed and predicted data is established for 3 pgmix model validation the coefficient of determination r 2 mean absolute error mae mean relative error mre root mean square error rmse and relative root mean square error rrmse are calculated to evaluate the performance of 3 pgmix model 2 4 biological rotation ages for timber production and carbon storage under future climate change the problem of determining the optimum rotation is its common derivation from the maximum sustained yield of timber inside the bark olschewski and benítez 2010 traditionally rotation is determined by harvesting timber when the mean annual increment mai equals the periodic volume increment bettinger et al 2009 at this point mai was the maximum in the present study our concern is mostly bra for timber production and carbon storage the bra is determined at the peak point of the mai curve with maximum mai which was attained directly from 3 pgmix outputs to check the difference in bra modification by climate change at different sites the site index si of the plots is divided into four levels using the quartile method i 12 93m si 17 84m ii 10 24m si 12 93m iii 8 39m si 10 24m and iv 5 25m si 8 39m the 3 pgmix model is applied to simulate the growth of stand volume and biomass with varied site levels i ii iii iv under different climate scenarios current rcp 4 5 rcp 8 5 to investigate the pure effect of temperature precipitation and co2 concentration on bras in larch plantations growing at different site levels we generated climate scenarios with the rising monthly average temperature by 1 c 2 c the changed monthly average precipitation by 10 20 and the increased co2 concentration by 76ppm 203ppm borys et al 2016 tuchman et al 2003 respectively table 3 the input data for the model simulation includes climatic data site factors stand initialization and parameters we used multi site module of 3 pgmix for growth simulation of each sample plots therefore climatic and site data are specific to each plots for stand initialization stocking of 3300 trees ha was applied according to planting density in the region initial biomass accumulated on root stem and foliage was estimated from empirical observation no thinning was considered during the simulation parameter values can be found in appendix b the time scale for our simulation was 90 years 3 results 3 1 model calibration and validation the calibration data obtained from the 6th and 7th nfi in jilin province were used to obtain optimal parameter values the 3 pgmix model underestimated all variables except for wf with r 2 values that were higher than 0 80 fig 2 in general the estimation of stand volume was the best with r 2 0 94 rmse 15 95 m3 ha 1 and mae 11 51 m3 ha 1 the model also effectively estimated wf and wr with a r 2 higher than 0 89 and rrmse below 24 25 however ws was not sufficiently well predictedwith rrmse amounting to 37 82 in the validation phase the observed and simulated values for all stand variables had high correlations with r 2 values ranging between 0 82 0 95 the 3 pgmix model could effectively estimate the stand volume of larix olgensis plantations with r 2 0 95 and mre 1 18 the estimated values and ranges of all stand variables were similar to the observed with the same variation trend hence the 3 pgmix model could be used to simulate the growth of larix olgensis plantations 3 2 biological rotation age for timber production and carbon storage under climate change the average values of maximum mai of stand volume and brat under future climate change were determined according to the annual output from 3 pgmix model table 4 which were 3 68 7 60 m3 ha 1 a 1and 21 8 37 5 years respectively moreover the corresponding values under the current climate were 2 74 6 16m3 ha 1 a 1 and 23 8 41 5 years the mait values under future climate change were larger than those under current climate for the same site level according to the following trend i ii iii iv furthermore the brats were also shorter than those under current climate showing iv iii ii i for the same climate change scenario stands with good site quality showed faster growth than those with poor site quality large fluctuations in the values of brat and maximum mai were observed due to variations in site index and climate change for example the maximum mai and corresponding brat was 7 60 m3 ha 1 a 1 and 21 8 years under rcp 8 5and site level i which were far larger and shorter than those under current climate and site level iv mait 2 74 m3 ha 1 a 1 brat 41 5 years similar to bra for timber production we first simulated the dynamic of stand biomass at different site levels under three climate scenarios and converted biomass into carbon growth results indicated that brac varied with site index under different climate scenarios and were shorter by 2 9 years under rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 climate scenarios than those under current climate table 5 meantime brac at high site index was smaller than low site index the values of brac were larger than brat that is carbon maturity 22 6 46 4 years table 5 and were later than the maturity for timber production 21 8 41 5 years table 4 3 3 effects of climate change on carbon storage at different site levels the carbon storage of larix olgensis plantations at different site levels was annually simulated under climate change fig 3 the results showed that with the increase of stand age carbon storage increased rapidly at first and then gradually stabilized the changes in conditions were slowly introduced thus the differences between climate scenarios were not significant in the early stages of the period climate change was favorable to carbon storage accumulation in the order of rcp 8 5 rcp 4 5 current in addition carbon storage increased with increasing site quality under the given climate scenario that is stands with good sites had stronger responses to climate change than poor sites 3 4 separate effect of temperature precipitation and co2 on bras the brat and brac under baseline current climate were 23 37 years and 29 43 years respectively with the rising temperature brat was 25 39 years 1 c 26 41 years 2 c and brac was 31 45 years 1 c 33 47 years 2 c respectively figs 4 6 the increased precipitation resulted in brat as 23 37 years 10 23 37 years 20 and brac 29 43 years 10 29 43 years 20 respectively the decreased precipitation resulted in brat as 23 37 years 10 24 37 years 20 and brac 29 43 years 10 29 43 years 20 respectively the increased co2 resulted in brat as 20 33 years 76ppm 18 28years 203ppm and brac 25 38 years 76ppm 21 33 years 203ppm respectively therefore bra was negatively affected by rising temperature 2 5 years longer not significantly affected by increased or decreased precipitation and significantly positively affected by increasing co2 concentration 4 discussion 4 1 model performance with its easy accessibility flexibility and limited number of parameters the process based model 3 pg was successfully applied to various tree species across the world these locations include australia finland brazil canada spain new zealand china south africa and the united states gupta and sharma 2019 however applications were mainly even aged monoculture plantations forrester and tang 2016 modified the model into 3 pgmix which allows for mixed species stands and deciduous tree species with leafing out processes nevertheless the application of 3 pgmix model was still limited in the present study the process based 3 pgmix model was parameterized and calibrated for larix olgensis plantations in northeast china with consistent performance for calibration and validation the model appears well suited for modeling the stand volume and biomass in the region linear regression between predictions and observations for the validation dataset demonstrated a strong fit r 2 values from 0 83 to 0 95 and rrmse from 11 10 to 16 92 with the exception of ws r 2 0 82 but rrmse 39 95 the large bias for stem biomass was in line with our previous study using 3 pg xie et al 2017 the reasons for such a bias needed exploration given that stem biomass always had more accurate prediction than foliage in most studies we checked the database and found that some sample plots with large prediction errors may cause the bias since larch plantations are widely distributed the use of the same model parameter values for all sample plots may lead to unreliable predictions of ws due to the unknown systematic differences in physiological morphological and phenological characteristics of a species forrester et al 2017 generally the 3 pgmix model was applicable and produced good performance across a wide range of stand ages for larch plantations although predictions between 3 pg and 3 pgmix for monospecific cunninghamia lanceolate plantations showed slight differences as shown in forrester and tang 2016 3 pgmix generated more accurate predictions compared with 3 pg for larch plantations xie et al 2017 one main change for 3 pgmix was the new light absorption sub model which could work for mixed species forests or monospecific plantations with multiple canopy layers based on the lambert beer law and extinction coefficient forrester 2014 forrester and tang 2016 the other changes were two additional parameters leaf grow and leaf fall for deciduous species that proved suitable for larch plantations in the present study leaf grow and leaf fall in 3 pgmix were used to simulate the dormant stage of deciduous species when no productivity respiration transpiration or light absorption occured our findings on model performance were consistent with the previous study forrester et al 2017 that used 3 pgmix to examine mixing effects based on data of mixture and monocultures of fagus sylvatica and pinus sylvestris accross europe moreover the model efficiency was larger than 0 70 but had more variations for npp predictions and stem mass growth therefore these studies demonstrated that when appropriately calibrated for a species 3 pgmix provides accurate predictions of the time course of forest development parameters in process based models are important in determining the impact of climate change future climate change may alter the physiological process and biomass allocation mencuccini and grace 1995 medlyn et al 2011 dyderski et al 2018 and thus the parameters used for 3 pgmixmodel simulation such as sla wsx 1000 and parameters for stem height and volume equations in our case however these parameters increase the complexity and difficulty of model simulations because their uncertainties resulting from climate change are less understood therefore we assumed that future climate change would not affect model parametersin the study additionally several parameters including ah nhb nhn av nvb nvh nvn are attained using empirical fitting that was restricted by observed data these limitations required future study in the future since including parameter uncertainty into the model could further increase the accuracy of projections and the degree of impact reyer et al 2016 although 3 pgmix could reasonably simulate the growth of larch plantations in the study there are some potential improvements which may enhance model performance as an essential site specific input variable site fertility rating fr is a site nutrition modifier to growth and affects biomass allocation landsberg and waring 1997 however determining fr value is still a challengable task of the 3 pgmix model because of the insufficient soil inventory data especially at large scale and the lack of the knowledge on the quantitative relationship between soil nutrient and tree growth landsberg and waring 1997 gupta and sharma 2019 several solutions have been proposed such as the conversion from site index in this study subedi et al 2015 and the linkage between soil chemical characteristics and tree growth will be beneficial to the model performance climate change can have profound impacts on tree growth through modifying the phenology and the length of the growing season although the growing season is influenced by air temperatures frost days rainfall or daylight hours which were partial inputs for the model the process directly related with changes of the growing season still needed in addition the constant ratio npp gpp was questioned by some studies recently which indicated that the value of this ratio is influenced by environmental factors stand age and management mäkelä and valentine 2001 collalti and prentice 2019 therefore flexible ratio of npp gpp from more detailed mechanistic models should facilitate our understanding of production and respiration landsberg et al 2020 4 2 effects of climate change on biological rotation age at different site levels the 3 pgmix model could generate a number of stand characteristics of interest to foresters such as stem density standing volume and current and mean annual increment however this model was rarely used to determine bra in this study the bras for timber production and carbon storage of larix olgensis plantations at different site levels under different climatic scenarios were first determined using process based 3 pgmix model the results showed that climate change would shorten the bra in the order of rcp 8 5 rcp 4 5 current although the larch plantations were distributed across a broad altitude range the effects of climate change on brat and brac were the same i e shortening due to the acceleration of stem increment furthermore there were variations in the magnitude resulted from mait and maic under the current climate scenario mait ranged from 2 74 to 6 16 m3 ha 1 a 1 and were 3 68 7 27 m3 ha 1 a 1 and 3 73 7 60 m3 ha 1 a 1 under the rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 scenarios respectively similarly maic varied from 0 85 1 30 t ha 1 a 1 under the current climate scenario and were 1 17 1 56 t ha 1 a 1 and 1 18 1 58 t ha 1 a 1under the rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 scenarios respectively the brat and brac under the current climate were approximately 23 8 41 5 years and 25 0 46 4 years respectively with future climate change in the northeast china including increased temperature precipitation and co2 concentration the brat would be at an age of 22 1 37 5 years rcp 4 5 and 21 8 35 7 years rcp 8 5 meanwhile the brac would be 23 0 39 1 years rcp 4 5 and 22 6 37 4 years rcp 8 5 respectively future climate change would shorten bra for timber production and carbon storage with spatial heterogeneity which verified our first hypothesis previous studies indicated variable rotation ages for timber production of larch plantations liu and yu 1990 determined that bra was 38 years according to the maximum mai of larix olgensis the bra of larix olgensis plantations was 25 30 years zhao and jiang 1995 and 48 3 years yin et al 2008 according to stem analysis data wang and liu 1992 found that the bra for larix gmelinii stands was 31 41 years bra for carbon storage was also investigated which varied from 37 8 to 42 5 years for larix gmelinii stands in heilongjiang province jiang et al 2015 and was 48 7 years for larix olgensis plantations in liaoning province yin et al 2008 the bra was shorter at good sites than poor sites sheng et al 1991 ding 1998 2000 demiguel et al 2014 jin et al 2017 which may be caused by differences in climate and site conditions our results on bra were within the scope of previous studies and consistent with the site dependent difference but were generated from process based growth models historical observations also demonstrated rotation lengths change for other tree species brockerhoff et al 2008 found that the rotation age of new zealand s pinus radiata plantations changed from 40 50 years in the 1970s to 25 30 years in the 1990s in sweden the minimum rotation age varied depending on site productivity and geographic location roberge et al 2016 in addition the largest forest owner association in southern sweden recently recommended to shorten rotations in norway spruce picea abies by 10 15 years where typical rotations are 60 80 years to decrease the risk of storm and root rot subramanian et al 2015 modification of biological rotation by climate change was also found an increase or decrease in stand volume or carbon growth due to climate change would impact bra the rising temperature would accelerate the photosynthesis rate and stimulate plant growth which hastened the achievement of maximum mai in the future melillo et al 1993 bréda and brunette 2019 and led to an earlier maturity and reduced rotation lengths felton et al 2016 2017 stöckle et al 2018 however we found the separate effect of rising temperature was negative this is due to that increasing temperature generally increased evapotranspiration which could limit tree growth yang et al 2006 girardin et al 2016 hogg et al 2017 both the positive and negative effect of rising temperature on tree growth were found in literature shuman et al 2011 koprowski 2012 gonzalez benecke et al 2017 increasing or decreasing precipitation showed no obvious effect on the growth of larch plantations in spite of weak magnitude fig 5 the independent of the growth to precipitation indicated that sites are not very much water limited in the region however mai was significantly positively affected by increasing co2 concentration across site levels fig 6 linking the separate effect of rising temperature and changing precipitation and elevated co2 concerntration we derived that the interaction of temperature and precipitation and elevated co2 were the main drivers of accelerated growth for larch plantations in the study co2 fertilization effect was widely observed norby et al 2005 rising co2 has been associated with increased water use efficiency rollinson et al 2017 and more co2 could be sequestrated into soil as soil organic matter chen et al 2016 overall future climate change would accelerate stand growth and shorten the bra of larch plantations in northeast china the acceleration of stand growth of larch plantations under similar future climate change in northeast china was also reported lei et al 2016 xie et al 2020 kellomäki et al 1992 and väisänen et al 1994 showed that rotation length could be shorter under warmer climate climate change was favorable to stand carbon storage accumulation soil carbon not included in the order of rcp 8 5 rcp 4 5 current possibly due to the improved stand productivity from the rising temperature increasing precipitation and elevating co2 kurz et al 2008 forest carbon dynamics depend on biotic and abiotic factors and the carbon storage response to climate change is complicated canadell and raupach 2008 literature showed both increase and decrease of carbon storage in future climate change yen 2016 schimel et al 2000 and lewis et al 2009 suggested that increasing atmospheric co2 concentrations or co2 fertilization effect may cause the increase in carbon storage as several theories and models predict the ongoing climatic changes which included significant warming and doubling of precipitation increased carbon storage by altering the living environment composition structure and growth forms of larch devi et al 2008 however bioclimatic envelope models also predicted a decrease in tropical forest carbon stocks with climate change in madagascar due to a decrease in the average tree size and shifts in tree species distribution vieilledent et al 2016 in addition the uncertainty in climate change from different models has been widely discussed and some methods have been developed for lowering the uncertainty tebaldi and sansó 2009 we only tested climate change from ccsm4 model in the study and there were several sudden changes during the simulation periods which were resulted from an obvious change in climate variables resulted from climate change model which was also observed in previuos study lei et al 2016 optional climate model may modify the results from the 3 pgmix model multi model comparisons need to be investigated in future study our results also showed that bra modification by climate change varies with site condition the higher site index under a same climate scenario indicates an earlier bra the results are consistent with previous studies keyser and brown 2014 dudley et al 2015 site condition was one of the main factors affecting biomass accumulation and allocation higher site index would lead to better carbon utilization in the juvenile stage hirsch et al 2004 bontemps et al 2009 huang et al 2016 the response of trees to climate was modulated by site productivity more productive stands showed greater ability to maintain or increase growth at warmer temperatures under different precipitation levels martin benito et al 2011 and trees at more productive sites were more sensitive to climate leonelli et al 2008 two methods that determine the optimal rotation length in forest management include maximum sustained yield and maximum net economic benefits yang et al 2015 the present study focused on bra using the former without considering economic profits which were important for economic optimal rotation in forest management decisions paul et al 2013 ekholm 2016 the inclusion of economic profits may lead to different results for example peng et al 2018 found that the optimal rotation length of larix olgensis plantations in northeast china consisted of 55 61 years when the net present value of both wood production and carbon sequestration were simultaneously maximized however bréda and brunette 2019 suggested that immediate reduction of rotation length was associated with the best economic return followed by delayed adaptation and finally by the absence of adaptation when calculating optimal rotation length for carbon storage carbon storage in wood products need to be considered harvested trees were transformed into different products like sawn wood veneer and plywood mechanical mass products chemical mass products and bioenergy the processes of carbon releases are closely related to the end use of wood products with different life span therefore taper equations and diameter distribution models may be necessary to be combined with process based models for generating different wood products dong et al 2020 soil carbon storage is also a key component since soil largely influences the carbon balance of forest ecosystem in addition it is widely acknowledged that thinning affects stand growth roberge et al 2016 which will possibly modify the bra however the inclusion of both variable thinning regimes and climate change scenarios will make the study complicated xie et al 2020 these components were neglected in our study therefore further research is needed for generalizing economic rotation with multiple objectives and more carbon components under thinning regimes and climate scenariosin the future 4 3 implications for adaptive forest management anthropogenic climate change alters forests and thus forest management needs modifications silvicultural measures are advocated to consider future climate change subramanian et al 2015 sousa silva et al 2018 jandl et al 2019 motivated by the needs to adapt to its uncertainties and risks and to maximize their potential productivity capacity as part of global efforts a number of alternative adaptive actions to climate change impacts are discussed covering gene manipulation conversion of monocultures to mixed forests and silviculture management these actions include reducing the rotation lengths due to increased productivity hastening the stand replacement in vulnerable stands and other measures spittlehouse and stewart 2003 hemery 2008 spies et al 2010 kolström et al 2011 yousefpour et al 2017 reductions in rotation length decrease the time the crop tree is at risk limit the top height reached reduce windthrow risk and generally reduce uncertainty allowing other more suitable species to be replanted to a changing climate nabuurs et al 2008 schelhaas et al 2015 the present study showed no unique biological rotation through the application of 3 pgmix model and bra becomes short with high site index bra ranged from 23 8 46 4 years due to decreasing site quality under the current climate therefore the usual rotation age which is 40 years in northeast china needs to be modified according to site quality the 3 pgmix simulations also showed that the faster growth under future climate change would shorten biological rotation of larch plantations and the rotation modification was dependent on site quality the bra for timber production and carbon storage varied from 2 years good sites to 9 years poor sites earlier than the current value therefore shortening the rotation of larch plantations and implementing early thinning is suggested in the region adaptive management decision making is also suggested according to site quality stand with better site quality leads to shorter rotationand thus earlier thinning however detailed suggestions on thinning regimes start time frequency and intensity of thinning need further examination through model simulations with both climate change and thinning scenarios in addition different adaptive actions are dependent on the balance among ecosystem services timber production biodiversity conservation and site quality preservation fouqueray et al 2019 therefore careful decision making on rotation age should be derived from multi objective planning with the combination of 3 pgmix modeling 5 conclusion this study investigates the biological rotation age of larch plantations at different site levels under climate change considering timber production and carbon storage using 3 pgmix model the 3 pgmix model effectively simulates the dynamic change of stand volume and biomass partitioning for larch plantations the rotation age of larix olgensis plantations is expected to change over the coming century due to the potential effect of climate change and current trends from a biological point of view our results indicate that biological rotation shortens by 2 9 years with rising temperature increasing precipitation and elevating atmospheric co2 the modification of biological rotation age is site dependent a high site index shortens the biological rotation climate change is conducive to quickly achieving timber production and carbon storage of the stand which is reflected in rcp 8 5 rcp 4 5 current results of the climate sensitivity analysis indicate that rising temperature and increasing precipitation had negative and weak positive impact on bra furthermore larch plantations are particularly sensitive to rising co2 our results help address a previously neglected knowledge gap regarding future implications of climate change for biological rotation to ensure sustainable forest management in larix olgensis plantations declaration of

24747,climate is a major factor determining the distribution of plant species correlative models are frequently used to model the relationships between species distributions and climatic drivers but increasingly their use for prediction in novel scenarios such as climate change is being questioned mechanistic models where processes limiting plant distribution are explicitly included are regarded as preferable but more challenging the availability of tools for simulating microclimates with high spatial and temporal definition has also opened new possibilities for simulating the limiting environmental stresses experienced by plants over their ontogeny however the field of mechanistic species distribution modelling is relatively new and the tools and theory for constructing these models are underdeveloped in this paper we explore the potential for using a dynamic energy budget model of organism growth integrated with microclimate and photosynthesis models we model the interactions of plant growth and microclimatic stressors over the life stages of plant growth and scale them up to demonstrate predictions of distribution at the continental scale we develop the model using julia a new language for scientific computing as a set of generic modelling packages these have a modular toolkit structure that has the potential to increase the efficiency and transparency of developing mechanistic sdms 1 introduction the relationship between the growth and distribution of plants and environmental drivers is a fundamental concern of ecology billings 1952 modern tools and datasets enable modelling of the dynamic interactions between organisms and the environment at the scale of the individual organism this capability can be used to develop insights and hypotheses about the mechanistic drivers of plant growth and stresses that limit the distribution of plant species the use of such a physiological approach may assist the prediction of species distributions in future climates or novel conditions bozinovic and pörtner 2015 kearney and porter 2009 species distribution models sdms are often developed using correlative techniques with coarse grained environmental predictors however there is a growing consensus that ecological models need to incorporate more structural realism grimm and berger 2016 for this reason process based mechanistic and hybrid models have been proposed as a more realistic alternative to correlative sdms connolly et al 2017 dormann et al 2012 kearney et al 2010 singer et al 2016 practically correlative and mechanistic models exist on a spectrum of increasing causal detail dormann et al 2012 where mechanistic models include explicit biophysical and physiological processes connolly et al 2017 however choosing mechanistic models over correlative models is not simply a question of theoretical value but also one of economy mechanistic models are more difficult to construct and more computationally intensive than correlative models dormann et al 2012 kearney et al 2020 improvements to mechanistic species distribution modelling require simultaneous development of theory and the practical tools for applying it efficiently briscoe et al 2019 1 1 mechanistic species distribution models for plants mechanistic sdms have become more common for animals kearney and porter 2009 although mechanistic modelling has a longer history in plant biology grimm and berger 2016 mechanistic sdms remain less well developed for plants we follow connolly et al 2017 and distinguish mechanistic models from process based models pbms ignoring those that include only dispersal processes without specifying the components of plant growth merow et al 2011 a range of mechanistic models have been used to predict plant species distributions these include phenological models that integrate environmental stress factors chapman et al 2014 chuine and beaubien 2001 morin et al 2008 and models of environmental interactions with growth processes based on tree growth rings sanchez salguero et al 2016 other models have incorporated plant growth and c n allocation in response to environmental drivers to produce maps of relative growth potential higgins et al 2012 higgins and richardson 2014 moncrieff et al 2016 nabout et al 2012 storkey et al 2014 mechanistic growth models provide the most scope for capturing the interactions between plant ontogeny and the environment as plant stresses can co occur in sequential patterns with different effects across plant ontogeny niinemets 2010 they can also provide a base model that can integrate phenological components or be used for truly mechanistic demographic and distribution models a key example of a mechanistic growth model used for sdms is the thornley transport resistance model ttr thornley 1972a that tracks carbon and nitrogen budgets for roots and shoots it has been used in hybrid mechanistic fitted plant sdms higgins et al 2012 higgins and richardson 2014 moncrieff et al 2016 additionally nabout et al 2012 applied the plantgro model to maize distribution which uses growth response curves tuned to monthly conditions stratonovitch et al 2012 and storkey et al 2014 used climatic data with daily time steps and incorporated ontogeny in a sophisticated plant sdm however the sirius model jamieson et al 1998 used in storkey et al 2014 is focused on agricultural plants and its formulation was not made available 1 2 plant growth and microclimate realism in growth models can be increased by modelling causal processes more explicitly it can also be improved by using finer gained environmental variables because the responses of organisms to changes at the macroclimate scale actually occur at the microclimate scale harwood et al 2014 animals usually exercise some choice over the microclimates they are exposed to but the life of a plant occurs in a fixed location they must tolerate all environmental conditions that occur there over their lifespan however at a finer scale plants grow through vertical climatic gradients over their ontogeny they experience different conditions at different life stages and these differences can be critical in growth process niinemets 2010 and in constraining the boundaries of their distribution smith et al 2009 to establish at a particular location plants must experience a favourable sequence of microclimatic conditions that match the needs of all life stages not simply favourable climatic averages growth based plant sdms have generally used long time steps i e monthly and climatic rather than microclimatic data higgins et al 2012 higgins and richardson 2014 moncrieff et al 2016 nabout et al 2012 a general plant model suitable for sdms that can simulate complete plant ontogeny with realistic combinations of environmental stresses remains to be demonstrated dynamic energy budget deb growth models coupled to mass and energy exchange between organisms and their microclimates have achieved this for animal sdms kearney 2012 kearney et al 2018 1 3 dynamic energy budget theory dynamic energy budget theory deb generalises growth processes for all organisms and symbioses kooijman 2010 it is frequently used to model the transition from juvenile to adult in animals and bacteria jager et al 2013 sará et al 2013 and can capture complete organismal ontogeny it has been used to model animal species distributions kearney 2012 kearney et al 2018 and has been suggested as an alternative growth model for plant sdms higgins et al 2012 deb theory simplifies the metabolism of organisms to material fluxes of substrates in processes of assimilation growth and dissipation lorena et al 2010 from simple rules and feedbacks it can capture complex growth dynamics while being explicit about matter energy and entropy balances sousa et al 2010 deb models focus on the interactions of different abstract categories of biomass namely structure v that is produced by the growth process and requires ongoing maintenance and reserve e that represents the pool into which assimilates flow and does not require maintenance an additional type is product p representing byproducts of the growth process in animals these are often excreted but in plants may be included in measured biomass as bark and heartwood the simplifying assumption of this framework is that each category has fixed proportion of chemical constituents this enables the closure of both mass and energy balances sousa et al 2010 for models with multiple reserve substrates such as separate carbon and nitrogen reserves synthesizing units sus are used to model enzyme dynamics for reserve combination giving smooth transitions between limiting resources kooijman 2010 ledder et al 2019 pp 99 105 synthesizing units bind multiple substrates to synthesize compounds depending on their availability using an su carbon and nitrogen pools can be combined into a general reserve to be used in growth and maintenance reserve mobilised in each simulation time step is calculated from the ratio of reserve to structure adjusting growth rates to match available resources a useful outcome of the reserve structure dynamics of a deb model that tracks nutrient state is the ability to model growth from embryo to mature organism by initially allocating high reserve structure ratios and small structural mass this can produce smooth transitions from the embryo phase dependent primarily on stored nutrients to later phases where nutrients are assimilated from the environment previous models of plant ontogeny often start with a seedling levy et al 2000 in deb models growth rates vary with temperature but also with the dynamics of the root and shoot reserves the growth rate being proportional to the density of the limiting reserve this captures transient dynamics that drive for example rapid growth of seedlings or rapid shoot growth after a sudden loss of biomass from e g grazing events or fire the intrinsic generality and modularity of deb theory means that in principle any number of structures can interact to exchange substrates allowing simulations of single celled heterotrophs complex autotrophs and even symbioses this ability allows us to construct a deb plant model where at least root and shoot structures must be considered explicitly to model asynchronous nutrient assimilation it also means that a deb model has the open ended potential to model more or less complex dynamics by adding or removing structures we could represent stems leaves and roots separately or include substrate exchange between fine roots and soil symbionts requiring few additional formulations or parameters 1 4 deb models for plants while the deb model was proposed as a framework for modelling all organisms the majority of published deb models have focused on heterotrophs the literature for autotrophs remains sparse kooijman 2010 kooijman et al 2004 lorena et al 2010 muller et al 2009 livanou et al 2018 and ledder et al 2019 are notable contributions a simple single structure microalgae model was presented in lorena et al 2010 contrasting with most animal models by tracking separate reserves for carbon and nitrogen to model temporally separated uptake dynamics the symbiosis of a simple heterotroph and photo autotroph was also modeled by muller et al 2009 modelling plants requires multiple structures to capture the additional spatial separation of nutrient and carbon uptake that occurs in roots and shoots kooijman 2010 pp 201 206 such a plant model was demonstrated by kooijman 2010 however it has not been widely tested or peer reviewed and uses a large number of parameters recently ledder et al 2019 explored the dynamics of a simplified two structured plant model proposing the local control theory of resource allocation in this formulation resource sharing between plant structures is similar to resource sharing in a holobiont roots and shoots only translocate unused metabolites without centralised coordination or fixed allocations to translocation this simple formulation achieves optimal growth rates while maintaining dynamic growth behaviour it also requires fewer parameters and causal processes than either globally optimised resource sharing or the fixed proportion local control used in kooijman 2010 and in the well known thornley transport resistance plant growth model ttr thornley 1972a there are some differences in the strategies used to track carbon nitrogen and general reserve state in deb autotroph models kooijman 2010 tracked carbon reserve c nitrogen reserve n and general reserve e while ledder et al 2019 did not track reserves at all instead generating general reserve from assimilated c and n for each time step lorena et al 2010 track c and n reserves despite structural differences these models invariably track reserve and structure as abstract but stoichiometrically fixed compounds measured in c moles and n moles 1 5 modelling microclimates improvements in climatic datasets and downscaling methods have enabled detailed modelling of microclimate at the scale of individual organisms in any location nichemapr kearney and porter 2017 and the microclimate datasets kearney 2018 generated by it are tools that make detailed site specific microclimates accessible over multiple decades with the hourly resolution for multiple heights and depths at reasonable accuracy they provide soil water potential kearney and maino 2018 soil temperature kearney et al 2014 incident radiation air temperature snow cover relative humidity and wind speed enabling the modelling of finely detailed organism environment interactions microclimate data are provided as hourly sequences of environmental variables in discrete spatial layers 1 6 connecting growth models and microclimates deb models do not represent organism growth spatially besides simple surface area mass relationships but microclimates are fundamentally spatial water availability and soil temperature both vary with depth while air temperature varies with height above ground this means that a spatially explicit model is required to integrate a deb growth model with microclimate data the interactions of plant growth and microclimate could be most accurately modelled with three dimensional models of root and shoot architecture vrugt et al 2001 however producing mapped species distributions imposes a number of practical constraints there are limits to computing power when models may run over 8000 times for a year of growth at a single point this can translate to the order of a billion runs to produce continent scale maps on decennial timescales further our ability to easily construct complex models and determine their parameters is limited by the availability of easily assembled modelling tools and data the dimensionality and accuracy of the spatial transformation used must be some compromise between these factors 1 7 realistic behaviour of a deb plant model there are a number of requirements for our plant growth model generally a plant model should to some extent balance the growth of roots and shoots to align with their relative needs for substrate assimilation to enable the modelling of growth throughout life stages it should capture growth trajectories from seed to plant switching smoothly between stored and assimilated resources 1 8 optimal partitioning optimal partitioning theory mccarthy and enquist 2007a thornley 1972a describes how resources are optimally allocated between plant organs depending on relative availability plants with adequate n supplies preferentially grow more shoots instead of roots this dynamic is a central component of many plant models cheeseman 1993 ledder et al 2019 although it is not without criticism lambers 1983 müller et al 2000 there are multiple methods for modelling optimal root shoot ratios two alternatives are central perrin 1992 and local cheeseman 1993 ledder et al 2019 control of translocation cheeseman 1993 showed that simple local rules can lead to the emergence of balancing at the scale of the whole plant without the need to invoke signalling or centralised control of allocation however they use fitted polynomial functions for growth rates rather than bottom up methods that could respond to hourly microclimate conditions ledder et al 2019 recently demonstrated a local control model in a context of dynamic growth using the synthesising units of a two substrate deb model where translocation of excess metabolites achieves optimal balanced growth shoots low in c translocate less or no excess to roots leading to more shoot growth than root growth until balance is achieved the inverse happens for n in roots with parallel complementary sus a proportion of each substrate is always translocated and effectively cycled between structures these dynamics can be fine tuned by using k family synthesizing units where the overall proportions of used and rejected metabolites can be adjusted ledder et al 2019 one difference between local control theory and functional balance theory is that root growth is not affected by low water availability in the version of local control presented in ledder et al 2019 optimisation of water uptake is not always supported by experimental results metcalfe et al 2008 mcconnaughay coleman and root shoot ratios may be unaffected by water availability mcconnaughay and coleman 1999b however other studies cite both water and nutrients as factors in optimal root shoot scaling mccarthy and enquist 2007b in local control theory ledder et al 2019 only substrate availability generally c and n affect root shoot ratios water shortages may have indirect effects by limiting assimilation 1 9 seed plant transitions modelling complete plant ontogeny and changes in relation to microclimatic stresses requires a smooth transition between seed and plant life stages however this transition is not commonly modelled seeds are largely composed of reserves such as carbohydrate and lipids and rapid initial growth can be driven by the high ratio of reserve to structural tissue deb theory is well suited to modelling these processes because the reserve concept links the embryo to the life cycle through the transition from use of initial reserve to assimilation of additional reserve kooijman 1986 periods of slowdown and readjustment of growth rates may occur in the transition between seed reserve and assimilated reserve when resources are limiting kitajima 2002 these can be captured by a deb model 1 10 aims in this paper we aim to explore the potential for modelling plant distributions based on limits to plant growth caused by the specific sequence of stresses a plant experiences during its ontogeny there are three components of this approach first developing practical modelling tools that support both our current aims and future research in the field second developing methods to a connect a mechanistic model of plant ontogeny to microclimate models and third assessing the behaviour of the model across plant ontogeny and varying environmental conditions and scenarios up to the scale of continental distribution ultimately these components are intended to collectively enable the parametrisation of species distribution models of plant species and functional groups to model plant ontogeny with fine spatial and temporal resolution we use a deb model and connect assimilation growth and maintenance processes to the microclimoz microclimate data set kearney 2018 using temperature response curves and a photosynthesis transpiration model we develop model components as separate libraries that enable future adaption for use in a wide variety of sdms and in ecological models more generally 2 methods we modelled a simple generalised c3 grass or herb like plant using a two structure two reserve deb model the deb model is based on the plant model provided in kooijman 2016 and kooijman 2010 with simplifications outlined by ledder et al 2019 and lorena et al 2010 while the plant model in kooijman 2016 specifies a photosynthesis component for c assimilation it does not integrate environmental variables stomatal conductance or the role of soil moisture in c uptake instead we use a farquhar von caemmerer berry photosynthesis stomatal conductance and soil moisture and model adapted from maespa duursma and medlyn 2012 we implemented the model in julia bezanson et al 2017 a programming language developed for scientific computing that enables the performance of c or fortran languages with the modularity and ease of use of python or r deb photosynthesis and microclimate integration packages were implemented as the standalone modular libraries dynamicenergybudgets jl https github com rafaqz dynamicenergybudgets jl photosynthesis jl https github com rafaqz photosynthesis jl and microclimate jl https github com rafaqz microclimate jl these provide generalised interfaces that facilitate adaptation for many modelling purposes including outside of sdms and ecology julia s type system and multiple dispatch paradigm allowed us to include most components and parameters as interchangeable or optional this improves interactive exploration allowing easy reduction of model parameter number but also addition of components for alternate formulations model components are compiled together by julia at run time to produce computational performance in the order of lower level languages like c or fortran 2 1 state variables tracking nutrient reserves allows modelling of seed reserve and scenarios with fluctuating assimilation rates as are common with variable environmental conditions to allow this we followed the approach of lorena et al 2010 tracking structure v with c and n reserves but calculating general reserve at each time step these three state variables for roots and shoots lead to a six state model consistent with traditional plant models such as ttr thornley 1972b and simple cheeseman 1993 the modular deb formulation allows for inclusion of additional state variables such as p production and m maturity p can track the production of growth byproducts such as leaf litter or bark and heartwood in woody plants while m can track reproductive maturity and seed set we allocate initial seed mass by assigning large c and n with small v table 1 if initial reserve masses assigned to shoot and root do not match the ratio of later assimilation rates balancing oscillations occurred between root and shoot growth until a stable assimilation ratio is reached these oscillations drove early model death in variable conditions we therefore used an initial reserve structure ratio that matches later shoot root ratio of 4 1 minimising early growth rate oscillations plants were simulated to grow for six months starting at monthly intervals over the six year period from january 2005 to december 2010 we use microclimates simulated from historical climatic data from 2005 to 2011 kearney 2018 covering the millennium drought dijk et al 2013 and the return of wetter conditions from late 2009 2 2 avoiding over parametrization the usefulness of complex over parameterised ecological models is debatable reichert and omlin 1997 the deb plant model in kooijman 2016 has 60 80 parameters depending on the use case and interpretation reflecting the potential biologically relevant complexity in a multi state model microclimate integration requires additional parameters while the maespa photosynthesis model itself has many parameters 20 40 this combination could result in a model that is over parametrized and difficult to reason about to explore and ultimately to parametrize however a deb plant model can be simplified in two ways amalgamation of parameters across structures and substrates and simplification of the formulation amalgamation of parameters is possible if we assume that there are common parameters shared between root and shoot structures and for rates of substrate turnover kooijman 2010 used three k parameters per structure for the turnover of each reserve lorena et al 2010 used only a single k parameter as mobilisation rates were deemed to be the same in algae practically this simplifies interactive control over whole plant turnover rates and reduces failure of simulations due to fluctuations induced by differences between k parameters for similar reasons we also amalgamated parameters for maintenance yield for conversion of reserve to structure and n c ratios of all reserve and structure state performing sensitivity analysis on model components and parameters is an obvious analytical approach to parameter reduction however it did not prove to be as easy as typical sensitivity analysis of ecological models the influence some parameters is highly dependent on microclimatic conditions sensitivity can be calculated for one particular microclimatic context but this may not be useful for understanding how the model behaves across a wider range of environments running sensitivity analysis across a dataset such as microclimoz is a potential solution but is computationally intensive and was not attempted here instead we focused on manual sensitivity analysis to facilitate this we developed a user interface that dynamically updates simulations as parameter values are changed the modular formulation also allowed us to swap or remove whole components from the interface to compare their behaviour in different environments formulation changes achieved using this method included simplification of growth rate calculations to use only two reserve substrates and removing proportional translocation following ledder et al 2019 additionally for plants without bark or heartwood product is not a component of measured biomass product is also inherently modular in deb as it is a proportion of otherwise lost reserves it could thus be ignored in our case the reproductive phase of the life cycle is of less interest and maturity and reproduction was also be ignored however to allow the optional use of maturity and the fixed translocation of the original model we redefined the fraction of available flux directed to growth κsoma as a function of the components of a structure s 1 κ s o m a s 1 κ m a t u r i t y s κ t r a n s l o c a t i o n s in our simplified formulation κsoma is equal to 1 for simplicity we also ignore the complexities of nitrogen assimilation and scale n uptake on the basis of root mass the minimum requirement to simulate root shoot balancing dynamics kooijman 2010 used parameters for germination size and switches that initiate c and n assimilation at some point after growth has begun this produces switching artefacts in early growth dynamics and requires a parameter for each structure in our formulation photosynthesis and nitrogen uptake began from the start of the simulation when the plant is still a seed the structural mass of a seed is small in proportion to the reserve mass and assimilation in early growth is not significant in comparison to reserve mobilisation fig 2 in combination these changes reduced deb model parameters from approximately 70 to 13 not including environment or photosynthesis components and reduced complexity without significant loss of dynamic capability this simplified exploration of the model s behaviour while allowing flexibility to increase complexity where necessary the final model configuration is demonstrated in fig 1 2 3 microclimate integration integrating a deb plant growth model with microclimate data requires connecting spatially implicit masses of the deb structures to the spatial distribution of environmental conditions in the microclimate in this section we describe how we used allometric equations to connect plant structures to microclimates and how temperature response and assimilation formulations were used to connect variables to growth processes we also describe a resorption formulation to balance available reserve and maintenance requirements in fluctuating microclimatic conditions 2 4 allometry for any given geographic location microclimoz data varies in only one vertical dimension at the microclimate scale if variation in shade cover is ignored we modelled only this vertical dimension calculating the depth of roots and the height shoots for a given structural mass to estimate these a simple allometric equation was used 2 β 1 m a s s β 0 α where β 0 is the intercept mass at the soil surface β 1 is a scalar and α the exponent β 0 was set to the initial seed mass for a seed close to the soil surface microclimate values used in the simulation are interpolated between available height depth layers 2 5 photosynthesis in deb models each reserve requires an assimilation process kooijman 2010 p 206 we defined assimilation processes as modular components external to the deb framework and used an external photosynthesis model to calculate c assimilation and modify shoot temperature the farquhar von caemmerer berry caemmerer and farquhar 1981 farquhar et al 1980 photosynthesis models are widely used in plant science and an obvious addition to a mechanistic plant model higgins et al 2012 developers of open source models such as maespa duursma and medlyn 2012 have put significant work into connecting farquhar photosynthesis and ball berry derived stomatal conductance to environmental drivers such as temperature and soil moisture however maespa was not written as a multi purpose photosynthesis library we adapted components of maespa into a modular general purpose library of photosynthesis stomatal conductance and plant heat balance formulations photosynthesis jl these formulations are extensive and will not be covered in this paper but are available in the source of photynthesis jl and covered in duursma and medlyn 2012 noting that canopy and spatial components are not included in photosynthesis jl our choice of photosynthesis model components and parameters is essentially arbitrary and purely for demonstration we used the simple ball berry stomatal conductance model modified by an exponential response to soil water potential we also used a non stomatal physiological response to soil water potential defined in zhou et al 2013 soil water potential was taken to be the maximum that the root system can access across its vertical extent this formulation resulted in a carbon starvation model of drought stress o grady et al 2013 2 6 temperature physiological processes in plants are reduced by temperatures above or below some optimum parent and tardieu 2012 the plant model in kooijman 2016 described 1 3 and 5 parameter temperature response models however the lower parameter models do not capture decreasing growth rates above an optimum temperature a simpler two parameter model can adequately represent this temperature response for plants and plant growth and maintenance processes are corrected by the formulation from parent and tardieu 2012 we used the provided parameter values for wheat root temperature was taken as equal to the soil temperature at the midpoint of root depth above ground microclimate variables were interpolated at the midpoint of shoot height to calculate shoot temperature we include the effects of air temperature relative humidity wind speed and soil water potential by iteratively solving the photosynthesis stomatal conductance model as in maespa for the present purpose we ignored plant behaviours like changes in leaf angle karban 2008 or leaf thermoregulation michaletz et al 2015 2 7 nutrient resorption plants regularly drop leaves and slough roots with some resorption of nutrients wright and westoby 2003 this may occur more rapidly in stressful conditions munné bosch and alegre 2004 with highly variable microclimate data simulations of a deb plant model frequently ended in plant death when growth rates fell below zero due to lack of reserves for structural maintenance the capability to shed excess structure appears to be both mechanistically realistic and a practical requirement of modelling dynamic plant growth in variable microclimates the shedding of structure due to stress can be simulated by removing a proportion of structural and reserve mass as a function of growth rate as growth rate is determined by resource availability after maintenance and temperature suitability it is a reasonable indicator of stress our formulation uses the simplified assumption that if a leaf or branch is dropped the reserve fraction is able to be reabsorbed simply remaining in the reserve state c and n but structural components are not recoverable and are subtracted from structural state v we used a half saturation point for metabolic rate that modulates the rate of resorption loss of mass is defined as 3 j v v 1 1 1 h r where v is structure j change in structure r is the growth rate and h is the rate where half of the current structural mass will be lost per day at h 0 no loss of structure will occur while at h all structure will be lost for any rate r the negative feedback induced by the dependency of the growth rate on the ratio of structure to reserve will mean r tends to remain significantly larger than h plants often have imperfect resorption and different rates of resorption for n and c vergutz et al 2012 a formulation with these properties is available in dynamicenergybudgets jl but has two additional parameters and was not used here 2 8 microclimatic scenarios for plotting simulations of plant ontogeny we used three microclimate scenarios along a latitudinal transect from the east coast of australia moving west table 3 we used the 8 layer datasets from microclimoz for soil temperature and soil water potential and two layer datasets for air temperature relative humidity and wind speed single layer data was used for incident solar radiation the datasets for zero percent shade were used for all simulations 2 9 simulation a numerical integration was used with a fixed hourly time step to include all available microclimate data it was performed for a six month period to model the ontogeny of an annual plant plant death occurred when either root or shoot growth rate dropped below zero we ran this six month simulation in each transect location over the six year period from 2005 to 2010 starting at the beginning of each month the model was then run for the entire grid of australian microclimate data starting at monthly intervals over the same six year period the maximum shoot mass registered during each simulation was stored and the mean taken from all simulations starting in each particular year initially we plotted selected simulations at the first transect location starting in august 2005 to demonstrate the dynamics of the model 3 results the model smoothly simulated the early stages or plant ontogeny against a background of microclimatic variation fig 2 transitioning from dependence on stored seed reserves to assimilated reserves a period of stalled growth and rebalancing was visible in mid september when seed reserves became depleted and low soil water potential limited assimilation and growth until late september as n uptake is not mediated by soil water potential in the model but c assimilation is n assimilation was higher than c assimilation in dry times this caused root growth to halt during water stress due to high availability of n plant growth rates were corrected for the effects of temperature above or below the optimum fig 2 for roots this quickly stabilised as they grew to deeper soil levels with more stable temperature regimes in contrast leaf temperature and consequently growth rate fluctuated strongly throughout plant ontogeny 3 1 temporal variation along a transect with increasing aridity moving inland along the transect between t1 and t3 the overall proportion of plants surviving decreased fig 3 the end of the millennium drought can be seen with improved recruitment rates in 2009 and 2010 at t2 a long sequence of high vapour pressure deficit and soil water potential combined with moderate soil temperature in 2010 this allowed simulations to accrue higher biomass than any simulations in t1 simulations at t3 had a similar spike in 2010 but overall growth was more constrained by environmental stresses than at either t1 or t2 3 2 projected australian distribution the patterns seen in the transect are reflected across eastern australia when simulated for the entire microclimoz dataset fig 4 significantly broader east coast distributions are visible in 2009 and 2010 with a marked inland shift in maximum growth rates as would be expected with the end of the millennium drought fig 4 also demonstrates that it is computationally tractable to produce distribution maps from this model using a consumer desktop computer 4 discussion in this paper we have demonstrated a proof of concept for a mechanistic ontogenetically explicit plant species distribution model a simple deb model of plant ontogeny coupled to microclimatic drivers can produce realistic plant growth dynamics from seed to maturity that respond to multiple environmental stresses and generate plausible spatial distributions fundamental to the development of this model was component based design methodology for mechanistic modelling we have defined modular components that allowed us to iteratively simplify the model and this should facilitate further development of mechanistic sdms and other applications in the life sciences however it remains to be demonstrated that this class of models can fitted to specific species or functional groups with more predictive success than correlative models or simpler process based models model fitting methods mechanistic growth scaling and microclimate plant interactions are avenues of further research 4 1 extensible modelling tools mechanistic species distribution models are more difficult to build and more processor intensive than correlative models cabral et al 2017 connolly et al 2017 the modelling packages that form the basis of this model outline a set of strategies for improving this situation we have demonstrated two distinct methods for extending the presented model extensible structure of the core deb model and interchangeable physiological and climatic components 4 2 modularity of structures and substrates in deb the number of structures and substrates of a deb model can be flexibly extended to suit the requirements of a problem allowing open ended exploration using the same theoretical framework and modelling tools this has been demonstrated for use in both single or two structured models with one or two substrates however models used in plant sdms storkey et al 2014 stratonovitch et al 2012 and other purposes falster et al 2016 use additional structures to model plant growth this is likely to be a common requirement despite the capacity for multiple structures in deb theory kooijman 2010 pp 180 188 a generalised computational framework for chaining more than two structures has been lacking chained structures require methods for partitioning translocation between both adjacent structures such as the case of stems translocating resources between leaves and roots additional reserve substrates such as phosphorus may also be added and tracked to model limitation of plant distribution by multiple nutrients again methods for merging more than two reserves are less well defined than the two substrate synthesizing units used in this model 4 3 process modularity the model presented in this paper is constructed from generic open source julia packages written for this task but not limited to it this demonstrates that a high performance mechanistic model can be composed from generic library components an approach that has a number of benefits common formulations and data sources can become well tested and canonical and easily re purposed for sdms and other uses the modular structure also means that varying levels of process complexity can be used to match the processes critical to a particular research question it can also resolve a criticism of fitted mechanistic models the assumption that formulations are inherently correct dormann et al 2012 these packages facilitate interactive and automated comparison of multiple formulation combinations instead of just a single model the design and interfaces of these modelling tools need to be tested in practical applications and a broader range of contexts the model as it stands may be useful for general models of the dynamics of vegetation where ontogenetically explicit environmental responses are frequently limiting but an obvious next step is to fit a plant model to specific species or functional types 4 4 fitting models to species and functional types fitting sdms for plant species of functional types is not without challenges there is a shortage of suitable data especially for rare species and lack of methods for connecting available data and model parameters to deal with data shortages it has been suggested that species distribution models should integrate both physiological and observation data into parameter fitting routines dormann et al 2012 fitting to observations has been demonstrated for mechanistic plant sdms higgins et al 2012 but methods for combining the uncertainties of observational data and physiological measurements need further work bayesian methods may be appropriate for this task dormann et al 2012 higgins et al 2012 another avenue of research involves fitting models to databases of traits and trait correlations to specify plant functional types model parameters such as rates of reserve turnover maintenance and resorption are likely to be correlated with traits reich 2014 such as specific leaf area sla leaf stem and seed traits have been demonstrated to be effective species level predictors of distributions in correlative models pollock et al 2012 mapping deb model parameters to well known trait correlations may simplify parameterisation of species specific models falster et al 2011 wright et al 2004 4 5 optional partitioning and scaling dynamics in this paper we have modelled the limitations to growth imposed by microclimatic stresses but plant growth is also self limited by changes in the ratio of mass to surface area and other structural dynamics that cause shifting rates of assimilation metabolism and translocation over plant ontogeny niklas and hammond 2019 the model presented here used a simple curved response to capture the combined effects of competitively imposed and internal scaling dynamics kooijman 2010 this is far from a mechanistic approach and has many problems and produces artefacts in root shoot balance when used over longer lifespans and varying conditions mechanistic scaling components such as those outlined in niklas and hammond 2019 may improve model behaviour by connecting size related growth dynamics to specific bottom up processes rather than top down formulations imposed by the model these additions could also include the effects of competition for resources such as light water and nutrients which are not addressed in the model presented here 4 6 soil water and microclimatic feedbacks the optimal partitioning dynamics in the model incorporated water availability in shoot assimilation via the stomatal conductance model but there was no water dependence for root growth this may be a critical addition to accurately model optimal root shoot partitioning for some plants mccarthy and enquist 2007a the carbon starvation model of drought stress o grady et al 2013 was a convenient approach as deb already tracks c reserves however mechanical responses such as hydraulic failure also contribute to plant mortality in extreme conditions they may kill a plant without the presence of carbon starvation martinez vilalta et al 2019 the interaction of both modes of drought driven failure may be required for modelling plant distributions constrained by drought stress in our model water uptake in photosynthesis and translocation did not strictly observe the conservation of matter soil water potential in the microclimate is not affected by plant water use there are multiple feedbacks between vegetation and environment billings 1952 d odorico et al 2013 but modelling them is difficult microclimate calculations can be processor intensive and introducing plant environment feedbacks may greatly increase model run time the maespa model duursma and medlyn 2012 has feedbacks between evapotranspiration and soil water potential and ultimately radiation temperature relative humidity and wind speed should also be influenced by vegetation extending microclimate packages like nichemapr to enable this flexibility while maintaining adequate performance is a challenge for future research 5 conclusions in this paper we have shown that integrating mechanistic plant growth models with fine grained microclimate data is a practical option for predicting environmentally forced plant growth dynamics and ultimately distributions we have demonstrated methods for connecting dynamic energy budget growth models to microclimate datasets across plant ontogeny this formulation can produce complex realistic growth dynamics in response to multiple environmental stresses and can be scaled up to produce mapped distributions using globally available microclimatic inputs kearney et al 2020 a set of practical modelling libraries has been developed that facilitate the open ended development of mechanistic species distribution models modelling libraries such as these have the potential to make the process of model development more comparable to the effort of producing statistical sdms credit authorship contribution statement rafael schouten conceptualization methodology software

24747,climate is a major factor determining the distribution of plant species correlative models are frequently used to model the relationships between species distributions and climatic drivers but increasingly their use for prediction in novel scenarios such as climate change is being questioned mechanistic models where processes limiting plant distribution are explicitly included are regarded as preferable but more challenging the availability of tools for simulating microclimates with high spatial and temporal definition has also opened new possibilities for simulating the limiting environmental stresses experienced by plants over their ontogeny however the field of mechanistic species distribution modelling is relatively new and the tools and theory for constructing these models are underdeveloped in this paper we explore the potential for using a dynamic energy budget model of organism growth integrated with microclimate and photosynthesis models we model the interactions of plant growth and microclimatic stressors over the life stages of plant growth and scale them up to demonstrate predictions of distribution at the continental scale we develop the model using julia a new language for scientific computing as a set of generic modelling packages these have a modular toolkit structure that has the potential to increase the efficiency and transparency of developing mechanistic sdms 1 introduction the relationship between the growth and distribution of plants and environmental drivers is a fundamental concern of ecology billings 1952 modern tools and datasets enable modelling of the dynamic interactions between organisms and the environment at the scale of the individual organism this capability can be used to develop insights and hypotheses about the mechanistic drivers of plant growth and stresses that limit the distribution of plant species the use of such a physiological approach may assist the prediction of species distributions in future climates or novel conditions bozinovic and pörtner 2015 kearney and porter 2009 species distribution models sdms are often developed using correlative techniques with coarse grained environmental predictors however there is a growing consensus that ecological models need to incorporate more structural realism grimm and berger 2016 for this reason process based mechanistic and hybrid models have been proposed as a more realistic alternative to correlative sdms connolly et al 2017 dormann et al 2012 kearney et al 2010 singer et al 2016 practically correlative and mechanistic models exist on a spectrum of increasing causal detail dormann et al 2012 where mechanistic models include explicit biophysical and physiological processes connolly et al 2017 however choosing mechanistic models over correlative models is not simply a question of theoretical value but also one of economy mechanistic models are more difficult to construct and more computationally intensive than correlative models dormann et al 2012 kearney et al 2020 improvements to mechanistic species distribution modelling require simultaneous development of theory and the practical tools for applying it efficiently briscoe et al 2019 1 1 mechanistic species distribution models for plants mechanistic sdms have become more common for animals kearney and porter 2009 although mechanistic modelling has a longer history in plant biology grimm and berger 2016 mechanistic sdms remain less well developed for plants we follow connolly et al 2017 and distinguish mechanistic models from process based models pbms ignoring those that include only dispersal processes without specifying the components of plant growth merow et al 2011 a range of mechanistic models have been used to predict plant species distributions these include phenological models that integrate environmental stress factors chapman et al 2014 chuine and beaubien 2001 morin et al 2008 and models of environmental interactions with growth processes based on tree growth rings sanchez salguero et al 2016 other models have incorporated plant growth and c n allocation in response to environmental drivers to produce maps of relative growth potential higgins et al 2012 higgins and richardson 2014 moncrieff et al 2016 nabout et al 2012 storkey et al 2014 mechanistic growth models provide the most scope for capturing the interactions between plant ontogeny and the environment as plant stresses can co occur in sequential patterns with different effects across plant ontogeny niinemets 2010 they can also provide a base model that can integrate phenological components or be used for truly mechanistic demographic and distribution models a key example of a mechanistic growth model used for sdms is the thornley transport resistance model ttr thornley 1972a that tracks carbon and nitrogen budgets for roots and shoots it has been used in hybrid mechanistic fitted plant sdms higgins et al 2012 higgins and richardson 2014 moncrieff et al 2016 additionally nabout et al 2012 applied the plantgro model to maize distribution which uses growth response curves tuned to monthly conditions stratonovitch et al 2012 and storkey et al 2014 used climatic data with daily time steps and incorporated ontogeny in a sophisticated plant sdm however the sirius model jamieson et al 1998 used in storkey et al 2014 is focused on agricultural plants and its formulation was not made available 1 2 plant growth and microclimate realism in growth models can be increased by modelling causal processes more explicitly it can also be improved by using finer gained environmental variables because the responses of organisms to changes at the macroclimate scale actually occur at the microclimate scale harwood et al 2014 animals usually exercise some choice over the microclimates they are exposed to but the life of a plant occurs in a fixed location they must tolerate all environmental conditions that occur there over their lifespan however at a finer scale plants grow through vertical climatic gradients over their ontogeny they experience different conditions at different life stages and these differences can be critical in growth process niinemets 2010 and in constraining the boundaries of their distribution smith et al 2009 to establish at a particular location plants must experience a favourable sequence of microclimatic conditions that match the needs of all life stages not simply favourable climatic averages growth based plant sdms have generally used long time steps i e monthly and climatic rather than microclimatic data higgins et al 2012 higgins and richardson 2014 moncrieff et al 2016 nabout et al 2012 a general plant model suitable for sdms that can simulate complete plant ontogeny with realistic combinations of environmental stresses remains to be demonstrated dynamic energy budget deb growth models coupled to mass and energy exchange between organisms and their microclimates have achieved this for animal sdms kearney 2012 kearney et al 2018 1 3 dynamic energy budget theory dynamic energy budget theory deb generalises growth processes for all organisms and symbioses kooijman 2010 it is frequently used to model the transition from juvenile to adult in animals and bacteria jager et al 2013 sará et al 2013 and can capture complete organismal ontogeny it has been used to model animal species distributions kearney 2012 kearney et al 2018 and has been suggested as an alternative growth model for plant sdms higgins et al 2012 deb theory simplifies the metabolism of organisms to material fluxes of substrates in processes of assimilation growth and dissipation lorena et al 2010 from simple rules and feedbacks it can capture complex growth dynamics while being explicit about matter energy and entropy balances sousa et al 2010 deb models focus on the interactions of different abstract categories of biomass namely structure v that is produced by the growth process and requires ongoing maintenance and reserve e that represents the pool into which assimilates flow and does not require maintenance an additional type is product p representing byproducts of the growth process in animals these are often excreted but in plants may be included in measured biomass as bark and heartwood the simplifying assumption of this framework is that each category has fixed proportion of chemical constituents this enables the closure of both mass and energy balances sousa et al 2010 for models with multiple reserve substrates such as separate carbon and nitrogen reserves synthesizing units sus are used to model enzyme dynamics for reserve combination giving smooth transitions between limiting resources kooijman 2010 ledder et al 2019 pp 99 105 synthesizing units bind multiple substrates to synthesize compounds depending on their availability using an su carbon and nitrogen pools can be combined into a general reserve to be used in growth and maintenance reserve mobilised in each simulation time step is calculated from the ratio of reserve to structure adjusting growth rates to match available resources a useful outcome of the reserve structure dynamics of a deb model that tracks nutrient state is the ability to model growth from embryo to mature organism by initially allocating high reserve structure ratios and small structural mass this can produce smooth transitions from the embryo phase dependent primarily on stored nutrients to later phases where nutrients are assimilated from the environment previous models of plant ontogeny often start with a seedling levy et al 2000 in deb models growth rates vary with temperature but also with the dynamics of the root and shoot reserves the growth rate being proportional to the density of the limiting reserve this captures transient dynamics that drive for example rapid growth of seedlings or rapid shoot growth after a sudden loss of biomass from e g grazing events or fire the intrinsic generality and modularity of deb theory means that in principle any number of structures can interact to exchange substrates allowing simulations of single celled heterotrophs complex autotrophs and even symbioses this ability allows us to construct a deb plant model where at least root and shoot structures must be considered explicitly to model asynchronous nutrient assimilation it also means that a deb model has the open ended potential to model more or less complex dynamics by adding or removing structures we could represent stems leaves and roots separately or include substrate exchange between fine roots and soil symbionts requiring few additional formulations or parameters 1 4 deb models for plants while the deb model was proposed as a framework for modelling all organisms the majority of published deb models have focused on heterotrophs the literature for autotrophs remains sparse kooijman 2010 kooijman et al 2004 lorena et al 2010 muller et al 2009 livanou et al 2018 and ledder et al 2019 are notable contributions a simple single structure microalgae model was presented in lorena et al 2010 contrasting with most animal models by tracking separate reserves for carbon and nitrogen to model temporally separated uptake dynamics the symbiosis of a simple heterotroph and photo autotroph was also modeled by muller et al 2009 modelling plants requires multiple structures to capture the additional spatial separation of nutrient and carbon uptake that occurs in roots and shoots kooijman 2010 pp 201 206 such a plant model was demonstrated by kooijman 2010 however it has not been widely tested or peer reviewed and uses a large number of parameters recently ledder et al 2019 explored the dynamics of a simplified two structured plant model proposing the local control theory of resource allocation in this formulation resource sharing between plant structures is similar to resource sharing in a holobiont roots and shoots only translocate unused metabolites without centralised coordination or fixed allocations to translocation this simple formulation achieves optimal growth rates while maintaining dynamic growth behaviour it also requires fewer parameters and causal processes than either globally optimised resource sharing or the fixed proportion local control used in kooijman 2010 and in the well known thornley transport resistance plant growth model ttr thornley 1972a there are some differences in the strategies used to track carbon nitrogen and general reserve state in deb autotroph models kooijman 2010 tracked carbon reserve c nitrogen reserve n and general reserve e while ledder et al 2019 did not track reserves at all instead generating general reserve from assimilated c and n for each time step lorena et al 2010 track c and n reserves despite structural differences these models invariably track reserve and structure as abstract but stoichiometrically fixed compounds measured in c moles and n moles 1 5 modelling microclimates improvements in climatic datasets and downscaling methods have enabled detailed modelling of microclimate at the scale of individual organisms in any location nichemapr kearney and porter 2017 and the microclimate datasets kearney 2018 generated by it are tools that make detailed site specific microclimates accessible over multiple decades with the hourly resolution for multiple heights and depths at reasonable accuracy they provide soil water potential kearney and maino 2018 soil temperature kearney et al 2014 incident radiation air temperature snow cover relative humidity and wind speed enabling the modelling of finely detailed organism environment interactions microclimate data are provided as hourly sequences of environmental variables in discrete spatial layers 1 6 connecting growth models and microclimates deb models do not represent organism growth spatially besides simple surface area mass relationships but microclimates are fundamentally spatial water availability and soil temperature both vary with depth while air temperature varies with height above ground this means that a spatially explicit model is required to integrate a deb growth model with microclimate data the interactions of plant growth and microclimate could be most accurately modelled with three dimensional models of root and shoot architecture vrugt et al 2001 however producing mapped species distributions imposes a number of practical constraints there are limits to computing power when models may run over 8000 times for a year of growth at a single point this can translate to the order of a billion runs to produce continent scale maps on decennial timescales further our ability to easily construct complex models and determine their parameters is limited by the availability of easily assembled modelling tools and data the dimensionality and accuracy of the spatial transformation used must be some compromise between these factors 1 7 realistic behaviour of a deb plant model there are a number of requirements for our plant growth model generally a plant model should to some extent balance the growth of roots and shoots to align with their relative needs for substrate assimilation to enable the modelling of growth throughout life stages it should capture growth trajectories from seed to plant switching smoothly between stored and assimilated resources 1 8 optimal partitioning optimal partitioning theory mccarthy and enquist 2007a thornley 1972a describes how resources are optimally allocated between plant organs depending on relative availability plants with adequate n supplies preferentially grow more shoots instead of roots this dynamic is a central component of many plant models cheeseman 1993 ledder et al 2019 although it is not without criticism lambers 1983 müller et al 2000 there are multiple methods for modelling optimal root shoot ratios two alternatives are central perrin 1992 and local cheeseman 1993 ledder et al 2019 control of translocation cheeseman 1993 showed that simple local rules can lead to the emergence of balancing at the scale of the whole plant without the need to invoke signalling or centralised control of allocation however they use fitted polynomial functions for growth rates rather than bottom up methods that could respond to hourly microclimate conditions ledder et al 2019 recently demonstrated a local control model in a context of dynamic growth using the synthesising units of a two substrate deb model where translocation of excess metabolites achieves optimal balanced growth shoots low in c translocate less or no excess to roots leading to more shoot growth than root growth until balance is achieved the inverse happens for n in roots with parallel complementary sus a proportion of each substrate is always translocated and effectively cycled between structures these dynamics can be fine tuned by using k family synthesizing units where the overall proportions of used and rejected metabolites can be adjusted ledder et al 2019 one difference between local control theory and functional balance theory is that root growth is not affected by low water availability in the version of local control presented in ledder et al 2019 optimisation of water uptake is not always supported by experimental results metcalfe et al 2008 mcconnaughay coleman and root shoot ratios may be unaffected by water availability mcconnaughay and coleman 1999b however other studies cite both water and nutrients as factors in optimal root shoot scaling mccarthy and enquist 2007b in local control theory ledder et al 2019 only substrate availability generally c and n affect root shoot ratios water shortages may have indirect effects by limiting assimilation 1 9 seed plant transitions modelling complete plant ontogeny and changes in relation to microclimatic stresses requires a smooth transition between seed and plant life stages however this transition is not commonly modelled seeds are largely composed of reserves such as carbohydrate and lipids and rapid initial growth can be driven by the high ratio of reserve to structural tissue deb theory is well suited to modelling these processes because the reserve concept links the embryo to the life cycle through the transition from use of initial reserve to assimilation of additional reserve kooijman 1986 periods of slowdown and readjustment of growth rates may occur in the transition between seed reserve and assimilated reserve when resources are limiting kitajima 2002 these can be captured by a deb model 1 10 aims in this paper we aim to explore the potential for modelling plant distributions based on limits to plant growth caused by the specific sequence of stresses a plant experiences during its ontogeny there are three components of this approach first developing practical modelling tools that support both our current aims and future research in the field second developing methods to a connect a mechanistic model of plant ontogeny to microclimate models and third assessing the behaviour of the model across plant ontogeny and varying environmental conditions and scenarios up to the scale of continental distribution ultimately these components are intended to collectively enable the parametrisation of species distribution models of plant species and functional groups to model plant ontogeny with fine spatial and temporal resolution we use a deb model and connect assimilation growth and maintenance processes to the microclimoz microclimate data set kearney 2018 using temperature response curves and a photosynthesis transpiration model we develop model components as separate libraries that enable future adaption for use in a wide variety of sdms and in ecological models more generally 2 methods we modelled a simple generalised c3 grass or herb like plant using a two structure two reserve deb model the deb model is based on the plant model provided in kooijman 2016 and kooijman 2010 with simplifications outlined by ledder et al 2019 and lorena et al 2010 while the plant model in kooijman 2016 specifies a photosynthesis component for c assimilation it does not integrate environmental variables stomatal conductance or the role of soil moisture in c uptake instead we use a farquhar von caemmerer berry photosynthesis stomatal conductance and soil moisture and model adapted from maespa duursma and medlyn 2012 we implemented the model in julia bezanson et al 2017 a programming language developed for scientific computing that enables the performance of c or fortran languages with the modularity and ease of use of python or r deb photosynthesis and microclimate integration packages were implemented as the standalone modular libraries dynamicenergybudgets jl https github com rafaqz dynamicenergybudgets jl photosynthesis jl https github com rafaqz photosynthesis jl and microclimate jl https github com rafaqz microclimate jl these provide generalised interfaces that facilitate adaptation for many modelling purposes including outside of sdms and ecology julia s type system and multiple dispatch paradigm allowed us to include most components and parameters as interchangeable or optional this improves interactive exploration allowing easy reduction of model parameter number but also addition of components for alternate formulations model components are compiled together by julia at run time to produce computational performance in the order of lower level languages like c or fortran 2 1 state variables tracking nutrient reserves allows modelling of seed reserve and scenarios with fluctuating assimilation rates as are common with variable environmental conditions to allow this we followed the approach of lorena et al 2010 tracking structure v with c and n reserves but calculating general reserve at each time step these three state variables for roots and shoots lead to a six state model consistent with traditional plant models such as ttr thornley 1972b and simple cheeseman 1993 the modular deb formulation allows for inclusion of additional state variables such as p production and m maturity p can track the production of growth byproducts such as leaf litter or bark and heartwood in woody plants while m can track reproductive maturity and seed set we allocate initial seed mass by assigning large c and n with small v table 1 if initial reserve masses assigned to shoot and root do not match the ratio of later assimilation rates balancing oscillations occurred between root and shoot growth until a stable assimilation ratio is reached these oscillations drove early model death in variable conditions we therefore used an initial reserve structure ratio that matches later shoot root ratio of 4 1 minimising early growth rate oscillations plants were simulated to grow for six months starting at monthly intervals over the six year period from january 2005 to december 2010 we use microclimates simulated from historical climatic data from 2005 to 2011 kearney 2018 covering the millennium drought dijk et al 2013 and the return of wetter conditions from late 2009 2 2 avoiding over parametrization the usefulness of complex over parameterised ecological models is debatable reichert and omlin 1997 the deb plant model in kooijman 2016 has 60 80 parameters depending on the use case and interpretation reflecting the potential biologically relevant complexity in a multi state model microclimate integration requires additional parameters while the maespa photosynthesis model itself has many parameters 20 40 this combination could result in a model that is over parametrized and difficult to reason about to explore and ultimately to parametrize however a deb plant model can be simplified in two ways amalgamation of parameters across structures and substrates and simplification of the formulation amalgamation of parameters is possible if we assume that there are common parameters shared between root and shoot structures and for rates of substrate turnover kooijman 2010 used three k parameters per structure for the turnover of each reserve lorena et al 2010 used only a single k parameter as mobilisation rates were deemed to be the same in algae practically this simplifies interactive control over whole plant turnover rates and reduces failure of simulations due to fluctuations induced by differences between k parameters for similar reasons we also amalgamated parameters for maintenance yield for conversion of reserve to structure and n c ratios of all reserve and structure state performing sensitivity analysis on model components and parameters is an obvious analytical approach to parameter reduction however it did not prove to be as easy as typical sensitivity analysis of ecological models the influence some parameters is highly dependent on microclimatic conditions sensitivity can be calculated for one particular microclimatic context but this may not be useful for understanding how the model behaves across a wider range of environments running sensitivity analysis across a dataset such as microclimoz is a potential solution but is computationally intensive and was not attempted here instead we focused on manual sensitivity analysis to facilitate this we developed a user interface that dynamically updates simulations as parameter values are changed the modular formulation also allowed us to swap or remove whole components from the interface to compare their behaviour in different environments formulation changes achieved using this method included simplification of growth rate calculations to use only two reserve substrates and removing proportional translocation following ledder et al 2019 additionally for plants without bark or heartwood product is not a component of measured biomass product is also inherently modular in deb as it is a proportion of otherwise lost reserves it could thus be ignored in our case the reproductive phase of the life cycle is of less interest and maturity and reproduction was also be ignored however to allow the optional use of maturity and the fixed translocation of the original model we redefined the fraction of available flux directed to growth κsoma as a function of the components of a structure s 1 κ s o m a s 1 κ m a t u r i t y s κ t r a n s l o c a t i o n s in our simplified formulation κsoma is equal to 1 for simplicity we also ignore the complexities of nitrogen assimilation and scale n uptake on the basis of root mass the minimum requirement to simulate root shoot balancing dynamics kooijman 2010 used parameters for germination size and switches that initiate c and n assimilation at some point after growth has begun this produces switching artefacts in early growth dynamics and requires a parameter for each structure in our formulation photosynthesis and nitrogen uptake began from the start of the simulation when the plant is still a seed the structural mass of a seed is small in proportion to the reserve mass and assimilation in early growth is not significant in comparison to reserve mobilisation fig 2 in combination these changes reduced deb model parameters from approximately 70 to 13 not including environment or photosynthesis components and reduced complexity without significant loss of dynamic capability this simplified exploration of the model s behaviour while allowing flexibility to increase complexity where necessary the final model configuration is demonstrated in fig 1 2 3 microclimate integration integrating a deb plant growth model with microclimate data requires connecting spatially implicit masses of the deb structures to the spatial distribution of environmental conditions in the microclimate in this section we describe how we used allometric equations to connect plant structures to microclimates and how temperature response and assimilation formulations were used to connect variables to growth processes we also describe a resorption formulation to balance available reserve and maintenance requirements in fluctuating microclimatic conditions 2 4 allometry for any given geographic location microclimoz data varies in only one vertical dimension at the microclimate scale if variation in shade cover is ignored we modelled only this vertical dimension calculating the depth of roots and the height shoots for a given structural mass to estimate these a simple allometric equation was used 2 β 1 m a s s β 0 α where β 0 is the intercept mass at the soil surface β 1 is a scalar and α the exponent β 0 was set to the initial seed mass for a seed close to the soil surface microclimate values used in the simulation are interpolated between available height depth layers 2 5 photosynthesis in deb models each reserve requires an assimilation process kooijman 2010 p 206 we defined assimilation processes as modular components external to the deb framework and used an external photosynthesis model to calculate c assimilation and modify shoot temperature the farquhar von caemmerer berry caemmerer and farquhar 1981 farquhar et al 1980 photosynthesis models are widely used in plant science and an obvious addition to a mechanistic plant model higgins et al 2012 developers of open source models such as maespa duursma and medlyn 2012 have put significant work into connecting farquhar photosynthesis and ball berry derived stomatal conductance to environmental drivers such as temperature and soil moisture however maespa was not written as a multi purpose photosynthesis library we adapted components of maespa into a modular general purpose library of photosynthesis stomatal conductance and plant heat balance formulations photosynthesis jl these formulations are extensive and will not be covered in this paper but are available in the source of photynthesis jl and covered in duursma and medlyn 2012 noting that canopy and spatial components are not included in photosynthesis jl our choice of photosynthesis model components and parameters is essentially arbitrary and purely for demonstration we used the simple ball berry stomatal conductance model modified by an exponential response to soil water potential we also used a non stomatal physiological response to soil water potential defined in zhou et al 2013 soil water potential was taken to be the maximum that the root system can access across its vertical extent this formulation resulted in a carbon starvation model of drought stress o grady et al 2013 2 6 temperature physiological processes in plants are reduced by temperatures above or below some optimum parent and tardieu 2012 the plant model in kooijman 2016 described 1 3 and 5 parameter temperature response models however the lower parameter models do not capture decreasing growth rates above an optimum temperature a simpler two parameter model can adequately represent this temperature response for plants and plant growth and maintenance processes are corrected by the formulation from parent and tardieu 2012 we used the provided parameter values for wheat root temperature was taken as equal to the soil temperature at the midpoint of root depth above ground microclimate variables were interpolated at the midpoint of shoot height to calculate shoot temperature we include the effects of air temperature relative humidity wind speed and soil water potential by iteratively solving the photosynthesis stomatal conductance model as in maespa for the present purpose we ignored plant behaviours like changes in leaf angle karban 2008 or leaf thermoregulation michaletz et al 2015 2 7 nutrient resorption plants regularly drop leaves and slough roots with some resorption of nutrients wright and westoby 2003 this may occur more rapidly in stressful conditions munné bosch and alegre 2004 with highly variable microclimate data simulations of a deb plant model frequently ended in plant death when growth rates fell below zero due to lack of reserves for structural maintenance the capability to shed excess structure appears to be both mechanistically realistic and a practical requirement of modelling dynamic plant growth in variable microclimates the shedding of structure due to stress can be simulated by removing a proportion of structural and reserve mass as a function of growth rate as growth rate is determined by resource availability after maintenance and temperature suitability it is a reasonable indicator of stress our formulation uses the simplified assumption that if a leaf or branch is dropped the reserve fraction is able to be reabsorbed simply remaining in the reserve state c and n but structural components are not recoverable and are subtracted from structural state v we used a half saturation point for metabolic rate that modulates the rate of resorption loss of mass is defined as 3 j v v 1 1 1 h r where v is structure j change in structure r is the growth rate and h is the rate where half of the current structural mass will be lost per day at h 0 no loss of structure will occur while at h all structure will be lost for any rate r the negative feedback induced by the dependency of the growth rate on the ratio of structure to reserve will mean r tends to remain significantly larger than h plants often have imperfect resorption and different rates of resorption for n and c vergutz et al 2012 a formulation with these properties is available in dynamicenergybudgets jl but has two additional parameters and was not used here 2 8 microclimatic scenarios for plotting simulations of plant ontogeny we used three microclimate scenarios along a latitudinal transect from the east coast of australia moving west table 3 we used the 8 layer datasets from microclimoz for soil temperature and soil water potential and two layer datasets for air temperature relative humidity and wind speed single layer data was used for incident solar radiation the datasets for zero percent shade were used for all simulations 2 9 simulation a numerical integration was used with a fixed hourly time step to include all available microclimate data it was performed for a six month period to model the ontogeny of an annual plant plant death occurred when either root or shoot growth rate dropped below zero we ran this six month simulation in each transect location over the six year period from 2005 to 2010 starting at the beginning of each month the model was then run for the entire grid of australian microclimate data starting at monthly intervals over the same six year period the maximum shoot mass registered during each simulation was stored and the mean taken from all simulations starting in each particular year initially we plotted selected simulations at the first transect location starting in august 2005 to demonstrate the dynamics of the model 3 results the model smoothly simulated the early stages or plant ontogeny against a background of microclimatic variation fig 2 transitioning from dependence on stored seed reserves to assimilated reserves a period of stalled growth and rebalancing was visible in mid september when seed reserves became depleted and low soil water potential limited assimilation and growth until late september as n uptake is not mediated by soil water potential in the model but c assimilation is n assimilation was higher than c assimilation in dry times this caused root growth to halt during water stress due to high availability of n plant growth rates were corrected for the effects of temperature above or below the optimum fig 2 for roots this quickly stabilised as they grew to deeper soil levels with more stable temperature regimes in contrast leaf temperature and consequently growth rate fluctuated strongly throughout plant ontogeny 3 1 temporal variation along a transect with increasing aridity moving inland along the transect between t1 and t3 the overall proportion of plants surviving decreased fig 3 the end of the millennium drought can be seen with improved recruitment rates in 2009 and 2010 at t2 a long sequence of high vapour pressure deficit and soil water potential combined with moderate soil temperature in 2010 this allowed simulations to accrue higher biomass than any simulations in t1 simulations at t3 had a similar spike in 2010 but overall growth was more constrained by environmental stresses than at either t1 or t2 3 2 projected australian distribution the patterns seen in the transect are reflected across eastern australia when simulated for the entire microclimoz dataset fig 4 significantly broader east coast distributions are visible in 2009 and 2010 with a marked inland shift in maximum growth rates as would be expected with the end of the millennium drought fig 4 also demonstrates that it is computationally tractable to produce distribution maps from this model using a consumer desktop computer 4 discussion in this paper we have demonstrated a proof of concept for a mechanistic ontogenetically explicit plant species distribution model a simple deb model of plant ontogeny coupled to microclimatic drivers can produce realistic plant growth dynamics from seed to maturity that respond to multiple environmental stresses and generate plausible spatial distributions fundamental to the development of this model was component based design methodology for mechanistic modelling we have defined modular components that allowed us to iteratively simplify the model and this should facilitate further development of mechanistic sdms and other applications in the life sciences however it remains to be demonstrated that this class of models can fitted to specific species or functional groups with more predictive success than correlative models or simpler process based models model fitting methods mechanistic growth scaling and microclimate plant interactions are avenues of further research 4 1 extensible modelling tools mechanistic species distribution models are more difficult to build and more processor intensive than correlative models cabral et al 2017 connolly et al 2017 the modelling packages that form the basis of this model outline a set of strategies for improving this situation we have demonstrated two distinct methods for extending the presented model extensible structure of the core deb model and interchangeable physiological and climatic components 4 2 modularity of structures and substrates in deb the number of structures and substrates of a deb model can be flexibly extended to suit the requirements of a problem allowing open ended exploration using the same theoretical framework and modelling tools this has been demonstrated for use in both single or two structured models with one or two substrates however models used in plant sdms storkey et al 2014 stratonovitch et al 2012 and other purposes falster et al 2016 use additional structures to model plant growth this is likely to be a common requirement despite the capacity for multiple structures in deb theory kooijman 2010 pp 180 188 a generalised computational framework for chaining more than two structures has been lacking chained structures require methods for partitioning translocation between both adjacent structures such as the case of stems translocating resources between leaves and roots additional reserve substrates such as phosphorus may also be added and tracked to model limitation of plant distribution by multiple nutrients again methods for merging more than two reserves are less well defined than the two substrate synthesizing units used in this model 4 3 process modularity the model presented in this paper is constructed from generic open source julia packages written for this task but not limited to it this demonstrates that a high performance mechanistic model can be composed from generic library components an approach that has a number of benefits common formulations and data sources can become well tested and canonical and easily re purposed for sdms and other uses the modular structure also means that varying levels of process complexity can be used to match the processes critical to a particular research question it can also resolve a criticism of fitted mechanistic models the assumption that formulations are inherently correct dormann et al 2012 these packages facilitate interactive and automated comparison of multiple formulation combinations instead of just a single model the design and interfaces of these modelling tools need to be tested in practical applications and a broader range of contexts the model as it stands may be useful for general models of the dynamics of vegetation where ontogenetically explicit environmental responses are frequently limiting but an obvious next step is to fit a plant model to specific species or functional types 4 4 fitting models to species and functional types fitting sdms for plant species of functional types is not without challenges there is a shortage of suitable data especially for rare species and lack of methods for connecting available data and model parameters to deal with data shortages it has been suggested that species distribution models should integrate both physiological and observation data into parameter fitting routines dormann et al 2012 fitting to observations has been demonstrated for mechanistic plant sdms higgins et al 2012 but methods for combining the uncertainties of observational data and physiological measurements need further work bayesian methods may be appropriate for this task dormann et al 2012 higgins et al 2012 another avenue of research involves fitting models to databases of traits and trait correlations to specify plant functional types model parameters such as rates of reserve turnover maintenance and resorption are likely to be correlated with traits reich 2014 such as specific leaf area sla leaf stem and seed traits have been demonstrated to be effective species level predictors of distributions in correlative models pollock et al 2012 mapping deb model parameters to well known trait correlations may simplify parameterisation of species specific models falster et al 2011 wright et al 2004 4 5 optional partitioning and scaling dynamics in this paper we have modelled the limitations to growth imposed by microclimatic stresses but plant growth is also self limited by changes in the ratio of mass to surface area and other structural dynamics that cause shifting rates of assimilation metabolism and translocation over plant ontogeny niklas and hammond 2019 the model presented here used a simple curved response to capture the combined effects of competitively imposed and internal scaling dynamics kooijman 2010 this is far from a mechanistic approach and has many problems and produces artefacts in root shoot balance when used over longer lifespans and varying conditions mechanistic scaling components such as those outlined in niklas and hammond 2019 may improve model behaviour by connecting size related growth dynamics to specific bottom up processes rather than top down formulations imposed by the model these additions could also include the effects of competition for resources such as light water and nutrients which are not addressed in the model presented here 4 6 soil water and microclimatic feedbacks the optimal partitioning dynamics in the model incorporated water availability in shoot assimilation via the stomatal conductance model but there was no water dependence for root growth this may be a critical addition to accurately model optimal root shoot partitioning for some plants mccarthy and enquist 2007a the carbon starvation model of drought stress o grady et al 2013 was a convenient approach as deb already tracks c reserves however mechanical responses such as hydraulic failure also contribute to plant mortality in extreme conditions they may kill a plant without the presence of carbon starvation martinez vilalta et al 2019 the interaction of both modes of drought driven failure may be required for modelling plant distributions constrained by drought stress in our model water uptake in photosynthesis and translocation did not strictly observe the conservation of matter soil water potential in the microclimate is not affected by plant water use there are multiple feedbacks between vegetation and environment billings 1952 d odorico et al 2013 but modelling them is difficult microclimate calculations can be processor intensive and introducing plant environment feedbacks may greatly increase model run time the maespa model duursma and medlyn 2012 has feedbacks between evapotranspiration and soil water potential and ultimately radiation temperature relative humidity and wind speed should also be influenced by vegetation extending microclimate packages like nichemapr to enable this flexibility while maintaining adequate performance is a challenge for future research 5 conclusions in this paper we have shown that integrating mechanistic plant growth models with fine grained microclimate data is a practical option for predicting environmentally forced plant growth dynamics and ultimately distributions we have demonstrated methods for connecting dynamic energy budget growth models to microclimate datasets across plant ontogeny this formulation can produce complex realistic growth dynamics in response to multiple environmental stresses and can be scaled up to produce mapped distributions using globally available microclimatic inputs kearney et al 2020 a set of practical modelling libraries has been developed that facilitate the open ended development of mechanistic species distribution models modelling libraries such as these have the potential to make the process of model development more comparable to the effort of producing statistical sdms credit authorship contribution statement rafael schouten conceptualization methodology software

24748,it remains a mystery why microbial community succession can violate the competitive exclusion principle to form high species diversity in nutrient deficient environments nde with low dose ionizing radiation ldir in this research artificial microbial communities containing three common strains downloaded from china tiangong 1 space station were cultivated in nde with and without ldir respectively by comparing their identities and differences in cellular phenotype extracellular ph intracellular triglycerides and population dynamics under the two circumstances a new hypothesis was put forward from observed phenomena and experimental data to expound new interspecific relationships and interactions induced by ldir to produce new dynamic mechanisms to drive microbial community succession with high species diversity a set of highly valid kinetic models was then developed from this hypothesis and finally the hypothesis proposed was verified through a large number of digital simulations the results show that induced by ldir specific feedback regulation of microbial populations by mutual promotion and restraint mechanisms might exist in microbial communities which can cause asynchronous convergent fluctuations of microbial populations these fluctuations remarkably alleviate interspecific competition and inhibit the emergence of dominant species leading to the formation and maintenance of higher species diversity the results can provide a theoretical basis for understanding the ecological effect of ldir on microbial communities in nde as well as its application for ecological engineering purposes keywords low dose ionizing radiation nutrient deficient environment microbial community succession mathematical modeling digital simulation glossary snc substrate niche construction nde nutrient deficient environments iss international space station epdm ethylene propylene diene monomer ldir low dose ionizing radiation ldires low dose radiation environment simulator 1 introduction hutchinson has proposed a fundamental question of why a large number of phytoplankton species competing for the same kinds of materials can coexist stably under nutrient deficient environments nde with limited resources namely the famous the paradox of plankton hutchinson 1961 roy and chattopadhyay 2007a this fact obviously violates the competitive exclusion principle in ecology and has no clear answer so far besides there is more and more evidence to show that microorganisms can proliferate rapidly with higher species diversity in nde with low dose ionizing radiation ldir while common ionizing radiation is currently applied for sterilization widely it was reported that 133 microbial species had been identified and isolated from the international space station iss they survived by corrosion and decomposition of only a few macromolecular polymers like cable coverings and organic coatings potentially threatening astronauts health and mission s safety since there are no more than 20 types of substrates available in iss which is much less than the kinds of microbial species hence iss can be considered as a specific nde sielaff et al 2019 similarly it is still unclear why a microbial version of the paradox of plankton can occur in iss as is known the outer metal shields of iss can protect against most harmful cosmic rays only a few high energy cosmic radiations such as x ray and γ ray can enter to ionize the air mainly o2 and ar to plasma which makes microorganisms inside the station always exposed to ldir casolino et al 2007 kalmykov et al 1975 by definition of dosimetry ldir refers to ionizing radiation whose dose or dose rate is lower than 200 msv or 0 1 msv min 1 respectively united nations scientific committee on the effects of atomic radiation 2010 it is not rare to notice that the paradox of plankton like phenomena also arise in nde within this dosage range of ionizing radiation on the ground a survey demonstrated that the microbial communities had higher species diversity near the saint laurent des eaux nuclear power station than those away from the station lair et al 1980 the fungal diversity significantly increased around the chernobyl nuclear power station after the nuclear accident czirják et al 2010 dadachova and casadevall 2008 also both fungal and bacterial diversity had significantly risen in the soils contaminated by nuclear radiation in xinjiang province china zhang et al 2018 2016 the microbial populations grow on substrates produced by corroding and degrading macromolecular polymers in the iss this adaptive behavior can be considered as substrate niche construction snc indicating microorganisms can modify their environment rather than mere passive entities selected by their adverse environment laland and boogert 2010 lampe et al 2017 odling smee et al 1996 niche construction is described as a process that organisms adjust their metabolic engineering behaviors such as burrows nests habitat selections dispersal and immigration it actively modifies abiotic and biotic features to enhance the fitness of organisms under adverse environments free and barton 2007 stolpovsky et al 2016 to sum up ldir and snc might play a crucial role in the formation and maintenance of microbial diversity in nde with ldir it is well known that high microbial diversity is essential for natural ecosystems and closed artificial ecosystems caes to maintain complicated structures and functions the caes are mainly composed of higher plants animals microorganisms and artificial environmental factors such as light temperature water gas minerals and are extensively used in facility agriculture and space controlled ecological life support systems celss high microbial diversity is critically beneficial to the promotion and stabilization of the material cycle and energy flow in the caes since waste disposal is an extremely pressing problem for the construction of successful cae prototypes highly diverse microbial communities can have a greater capacity to recover vitally critical chemical elements and compounds and to return these substances to ecological cycles by degrading and assimilating wastes however it is currently tricky to artificially form and maintain high biodiversity including microbial diversity in caes for microorganisms caes can also be considered as a specific nde the produced waste inside such as inedible plant biomass animal feces or kitchen wastes only provides limited types of substrates for microbial growth in this study a series of artificial microbial communities were cultivated in emulated nde without and with ldir respectively these microbial communities are composed of staphylococcus aureus bacillus subtilis and escherichia coli which are common species downloaded from china space station tiangong 1 a series of images and data were collected in the following biology experiments including phenotype observation of individuals variation characteristics of intracellular storage substances extracellular ph and population sizes then an original hypothesis was put forward to elucidate an alternative succession mechanism induced by ldir and emerged from the new relationships and interactions between microbial species and biotic abiotic environments subsequently a set of highly valid kinetic models have been developed by observed phenomena time series experimental data proposed hypothesis and system dynamics ogata 2004 these models can fully describe both internal structure and external behaviors of microbial community succession in nde with and without ldir finally a multitude of microbial species and substrates were computer generated through monte carlo experiments and plugged to the kinetic models a large number of computer simulations were carried out to test and verify the proposed hypothesis the results indisputably proved that the dynamic mechanisms put forward could drive the microbial community succession toward a climax community with high microbial diversity in nde with ldir this research can provide a new theoretical basis for understanding the mechanism of microbial community succession in nde with ldir and give another explanation of the paradox of plankton simultaneously the simulation results can also be applied for engineering purposes such as the practical measures that can be developed and adopted to inhibit microbial diversity in iss based on structure and parameter sensitivity and conversely promote it in caes 2 materials and methods 2 1 strains and cultures the ldir environment simulator ldires was built and applied for the cultivation of artificial microbial communities composed of staphylococcus aureus no cmcc b 26003 bacillus subtilis no atcc6633 and coli no atcc25922 the ldires was a closed metal chamber fig 1 designed to emulate the ldir environment by an x ray generator installed at the top to ionize the air inside to be plasma with the radiation dose rate setting from 10 6 gy h 1 to 1 gy h 1 casolino et al 2007 the microbial communities were cultivated in six petri dishes placed on a rotating device for exposure to homogeneous doses of ldir ethylene propylene diene monomer epdm was taken as the main carbon source which is a macromolecular polymer and can be degraded and utilized by microorganisms kanwal et al 2015 two identical ldires were applied for microbial cultivation in nde with ldir and without ldir respectively the activated strains were inoculated into the inorganic salt medium ism at a concentration of 10 v v and cultured at 37 c with and without ldir used as the ionized and non ionized strains respectively 2 2 electron microscopy confocal laser scanning microscopy morphological characteristics of microbial cells were obtained with a scanning electron microscope sem jsm 6700f japan electron optics laboratory co ltd samples with without ldir treatment

fluorescence after staining fda pi fluorescein diacetate propidium iodide xia et al 2011 2 3 measurement of intracellular lipids and extracellular ph intracellular lipids content and ph were measured after 48 h cultivation to contrast their differences under the circumstances of without and with ldir cultures were prepared at the concentration of 0 4 105 0 5 105 cfu per ml followed by centrifugation at 10 000 rpm for 10 min the supernatant was discarded then the cells were collected and resuspended by adding 1 ml 0 1 mol l 1 phosphate buffer solution the test solution was obtained after sonication and centrifuge the intracellular lipids content was measured using a triglycerides assay kit by gpo pap method henkel and stoltz 1982 and analyzed by an ultraviolet spectrophotometer at 420 nm 2 4 profiling of colony counts a mixed culture of the above three strains 10 v v was inoculated onto ism contained epdm and cultured at 37 c with and without ldir both of the two cultures were sampled 3 ml for each once per day in the following 30 days the samples were screened for counting using the corresponding selective medium mannitol salt agar msa for s aureus macconkey agar for e coli tryptone soy agar tsa for the mixed culture the counts were used to determine the population grow curves of three target strains in 30 days 2 5 hypothesis of microbial community succession mechanism in nde with ldir although experimental phenomena and data can be observed and obtained directly the underlying dynamic mechanisms driving the community succession generated by relationships and interactions between microbial species and their biotic abiotic environments cannot be identified straightforward at all which can only be elucidated by hypotheses derived from experimental phenomena and data and precisely described by kinetic models and sufficiently investigated by digital simulations holyoak and loreau 2006 kelsic et al 2015 according to the classic lotka volterra interspecific competition model when competition coefficients are invariant the competitive intensities between species are merely dependent on the product of species population sizes hence the process of competitive exclusion among microbial species for limited resources in nde can be conceived as follows at the beginning of microbial community succession all populations grow exponentially however their growth rates then slow down inevitably as niches are continuously filled up a turning point will appear sooner or later due to interspecific differences in intrinsic growth rates competition coefficients and carrying capacities some species will stop growing whereas other species will keep increasing and the latter will further exclude the former and make them extinct eventually hardin 1960 ives and carpenter 2007 it is worthy to think over what new dynamic mechanisms have emerged during the microbial community succession in nde with ldir based on readily observed phenomena a new hypothesis was tentatively proposed to interpret new relationships and interactions between microbial species and their biotic abiotic environments as follows all microbial species have snc capabilities to produce substrates for survival in nde without ldir however they have significantly different physiological and behavioral response characteristics to ldir induced by ldir some microbial species named facilitators get an enhanced snc capability to produce more substrates by corrosion of macromolecular polymer these substrates can be considered as the public goods that can directly be available to other microbial species nevertheless the other species named consumers have no or weak such response characteristics to ldir and might be more prone to utilizing ready made substrates to survive since more substrates than ever before can currently be produced by facilitators because the facilitators have to bear the high cost to produce substrates through snc consumers are unearned and therefore easy to win in the interspecific competition and eliminate facilitators however the substrates would necessarily reduce along with the facilitator population decrease which inexorably results in the fall of the consumer population once the facilitators are eradicated it is also the end of the consumers and the microbial diversity cannot be formed and maintained at all therefore it is supposed that the facilitators might not offer all substrates produced by their snc under the ldir environment and they would conserve a fraction in the form of intracellular energy substances like triglycerides to overcome adversity based on the previous hypothesis there might exist specific substrate based feedback regulation on populations sizes in microbial communities in a way of mutual promotion and restraint mechanisms hence a probable new microbial succession process in nde with ldir can be conjectured as follows step 1 as the facilitator populations increase for acclimation to ldir more substrates are produced and accumulated continuously the competition between the facilitators will be inevitably enhanced in the meantime the consumers also can grow on these substrates available and impose intense competitive exclusion on the facilitators which inhibits facilitator population from further increase and alleviates interspecific competitions between the facilitators step 2 as the consumer populations increase their interspecific competition intensity will inevitably increase however substrates amount will be less and less along with the facilitator populations decreases which limits further growth of the consumer populations and will undermine interspecific competitions between consumers as well as the competitive exclusion to facilitators step 3 the facilitator populations would rebound by taking advantage of intracellular energy substances used exclusively for themselves and succession process of microbial communities in nde with ldir seems to go back to step 1 once more the preceding process can make the populations of facilitators and consumers periodically stay at exponential growth or logarithmic phase without reaching the plateau phase leading to severe corrosion of macromolecular polymers or decomposition of substrates fox 2002 vasseur and fox 2009 such dynamic characteristics of microbial populations would weaken interspecific competitions and are beneficial to more species colonizing in nde with ldir by a strategy of trading species for quantity this is because the substrate based feedback regulation on microbial populations sizes by mutual promotion and restraint mechanisms can effectively prevent each microbial population from being dominant in the community as a result these dynamic characteristics of microbial populations are highly favorable to the formation and maintenance of high species richness and evenness namely microbial diversity 2 6 kinetic model derivation of microbial community succession in nde with ldir based on above hypothesis on dynamic mechanisms of microbial community succession in nde with ldir and without ldir a system dynamic model expressed by a set of ordinary differential equations has been developed to describe the relationships and interactions between microbial populations and their biotic abiotic environments and to predict the dynamic characteristics of microbial community succession in two circumstances through numerical simulations suppose that n1 kinds of facilitators and n2 kinds of consumers can be colonized in the nde with ldir and facilitators can produce n3 kinds of substrate satisfying n3 n1 n2 it is assumed that bacteria can be cultivated on all kinds of substrates produced by facilitators due to limited resources in nde therefore the state variables in the kinetic model are the ith facilitator population xi the j th consumer population yj the k th substrate amount sk produced by facilitators and as intracellular energy substance amount mi in the ith facilitator in nde without ldir the growth rate vci of the ith facilitator population can be defined as accumulative monod equation as follows hu et al 2012 1 v c i μ i x i k 1 n 3 s k z k i s k where μi is the specific growth rate of the ith facilitator population zki is the half saturation constant of the ith facilitator population growth on the k th substrate in nde with ldir however the growth rate vc i of the ith facilitator population eq 1 can be rewritten as follows 2 v c i μ i x i m a x k 1 n 3 s k z k i s k m i k i m i where ki denotes the half saturation constant of the ith facilitator population growth on intracellular energy substances the substrates diversity d sk is defined as the shannon weiner index as follows 3 d s k k 1 n 3 s k k 1 n 3 s k l n s k k 1 n 3 s k based on the competitive exclusion principle and in lotka volterra calibration equation the competition decrease rate vcci and vchi can be written as follows 4 v c c i j i n 1 c i j e d s k x i x j 5 v c h i j n 2 ρ i j e d s k x i y j where cij and ρij is a competition inhibition coefficient of the j th facilitator and consumer on the population growth rate of the ith facilitator respectively the metabolism rate of the ith facilitator population vcdi can be written as follows 6 v c d i d i x i where di is a metabolism coefficient of the ith facilitator according to the hypothesis the consumers do not have or have weak physiological and behavioral responses to ldir such as conducting snc and intracellular energy substances storage therefore the growth rate of the j th consumer population vhi in nde both with and without ldir can be written as follows 7 v h j r j y j k 1 n 3 s k m k j s k where rj is the specific growth rate of the j th consumer mkj is the half saturation constant of the j th consumer population growth on the k th substrate similarly the decrease rate of the ith consumer population due to competition inhibition by the j th consumer population vhij can be written as follows 8 v h i j j i n 2 q i j e d s k y i y j where qij is a competition inhibition coefficient of the j th consumer on the population growth rate of the ith consumer effect of competition of facilitators on the growth of consumers is negligible according to our hypothesis the metabolism rate of the j th consumer vhdi can be written as follows 9 v h d j δ j y j where δi is the metabolism coefficient of the j th consumer population the substrates quantity produced by the ith facilitator through their activities of snc nci with ldir can be written as follows kylafis and loreau 2008 10 n c i λ i e b i i i 2 i m i x i k λ i x i where i is ldir intensity and im is the optimum ldir intensity for facilitators growth λi is the intrinsic snc rate of the ith facilitator with half saturation constant k λi and ldir inhibition coefficient bi ldir can promote snc activities of facilitators within 0 and 2im while high dose ionizing radiations usually destroy snc activities petin and kapultcevich 2014 sun et al 2016 similarly the quantity of the substrate produced by the j th consumer through their activities of snc ncj can be written as follows 11 n c j τ j e c j i y j k τ j y j where τj is the intrinsic snc rate of the j th consumer with half saturation constant kγj and ldir inhibition coefficient cj and ldir always destroys snc activities of consumers based on the hypothesis the facilitators will reserve a fraction from substrates for their exclusive utilization hence the accumulation rate of intracellular energy substances of the i th facilitator vri can be written as follows 12 v r i φ i ε i n c i where εi is the proportion of exclusive part by the ith facilitator to total substrates produced and the φi is the conversion coefficient from substrates to intracellular energy substances therefore the production rate of the k th substrate vs k can be written as follows 13 v s k σ k i 1 n 1 1 ε i n c i j 1 n 2 n c j where σk is the proportion of the k th substrate to total substrates the i th facilitator produced in nde without ldir however the production rate of the k th substrate vsk become 14 v s k σ k i 1 n 1 n c i j 1 n 2 n c j the consumption rate of the k th substrate in the course of the population growth of i th facilitator vck and the j th consumer vhk can be defined as follows 15 v c k α i k v c i 16 v h k β j k v h j where αik and βjk denotes consumption coefficient of the ith facilitator and the j th consumer respectively in nde with ldir the facilitators can exploit both substrates and intracellular energy substances hence consumption rate of the k th substrate vc k and intracellular energy substances vcmi in the course of the facilitator population growth can be determined based on the following scenarios if k 1 n 3 s k z k i s k m i k i m i then v c k i 1 n 1 α i k v c i vcmi 0 17 else v c k 0 then v c m i γ i v c i where γi is consumption coefficient of intracellular energy substances based on the preceding analysis and modeling process a state space model with n1 n2 n3 first order nonlinear differential equations of microbial community succession in nde without and with ldir can be formulated in a top down manner on the following two scenarios scenario a without ldir referring to eq 1 eq 3 eq 6 the first order kinetic equation of facilitator populations can be written as follows 18 d x i d t v c i v c c i v c h i v c d i μ i x i k 1 n 3 s k z k i s k j i n 1 c i j e d s k x i x j j n 2 ρ i j e d s k x i y j

epdm with and without ldir and the microbial cells showed significant differences in morphological characteristics after 48 h cultivation fig 2 most of them were in the state of death without ldir but more of them were alive with ldir suggesting that ldir can have positive effects on the cell survival rate the further observations found that some cells of e coli cultivated with ldir became morphologically smaller and shrunk more fig 3 they might stay in a particular dormant state for retard of nutrient transport respiration rate or macromolecules synthesis kudryasheva et al 2017 kudryasheva and rozhko 2015 novikova et al 2011 oliver 2000 also the corrosion degree of epdm surface with ldir was considerably severe indicating faster microbial proliferation through snc fig 4 as illustrated in fig 5 a and b except for e coli there were no significant differences in intracellular triglycerides and extracellular ph of b subtilis and s aureus cultivated with and without ldir it is reported that the microbial species can only utilize the intracellular energy substances to grow independent of ambient substrates wilkinson 1963 the corrosion and degradation of the macromolecular polymer resulted directly from extracellular enzymes and organic acids secreted by some microbial species kip and van veen 2015 the lower extracellular ph the heavier macromolecular polymers are decomposed by microbial snc deutzmann et al 2015 in the mixed culture of s aureus e coli and b subtilis the microbial populations show that only e coli survived eventually s aureus and b subtilis were wiped out gradually without ldir due to physiological and behavioral variations induced by ldir however the new interspecific relationships and interactions generated new dynamic mechanisms of microbial communities causing the stable coexistence of e coli and s aureus with distinct asynchronous fluctuations of populations fig 5c 3 2 digital simulations on microbial community succession in nde with ldir judging from the variability of phenotypes intracellular triglycerides contents and extracellular ph e coli can be considered facilitators whereas s aureus and b subtilis can be considered consumers hence a kinetic model expressed by four differential equations including one facilitator two consumers and one substrate was developed based on eq 18 eq 23 moreover the corresponding simulation model was established by matlab simulink s function to conduct digital simulations for point estimation of parameters and model validation by use of time domain experimental data jorgensen 2016 mathworks 2017 the experimental data were divided into two parts one third for parameter identification the rest for model validation fig 6 as illustrated in fig 6 the kinetic models are highly valid and can be applied for hypothesis verification with more microbial species and substrates involvement where r and nse denote spearman rank correlation and nash sutcliffe efficiency respectively moriasi et al 2007 based on the parameter point estimation the jacobian matrix and the estimated covariance matrix the 70 confidence intervals of parameters were estimated for microbial species computer generated through monte carlo experiments which can cover the characteristics of most of the microbial species here a microbial species can be considered as a characteristic parameter vector obtained by uniformly and independently random sampling from these parameter intervals table 1 for example a characteristic parameter vector μi zki ki cij ρij di λi bi k λi εi φi αik γi can represent a facilitator species therefore 5 50 species of the facilitators that can produce 3 10 types of the substrates and 5 40 species of the consumers were computer generated and their characteristic parameter vectors were plugged into eq 18 eq 23 for theoretical investigation of microbial community succession in nde without and with ldir before digital simulations it is important to set simulation options table 2 appropriately according to the complexity accuracy convergence speed computational expense etc according to the kinetic model of microbial community succession in nde without ldir eq 18 eq 20 the corresponding digital simulation results show that only a few populations whose number of species is no more than types of substrates produced by facilitators snc can coexist fig 7 a and b however most of them go extinct due to competitive exclusion both microbial populations and substrates will asymptotically stabilize via transient responses in contrast according to the kinetic model of microbial community succession in nde with ldir eq 21 eq 23 the emerged general pattern showed in fig 7c and d indicates that most of the species can coexist even when their richness is far more than types of substrates produced by facilitators snc both microbial species populations and substrates appear periodical vibrations with shifted phases via unordered transient responses the microbial populations show asynchronously convergent fluctuations as one species population is at a relatively high level the other species populations might at relatively low levels due to phase differences according to classic lotka volterra equations these dynamic response characteristics can effectively reduce the interspecific competitions through minimization of interspecific competitive intensity that is mainly dependent on the product of microbial population sizes such a mechanism will drive the mixture of facilitators and consumers toward higher richness and evenness i e species diversity in nde with ldir it is worth mentioning that microbial community succession patterns in nde both without and with ldir fig 7 are general and universal because of the insensitivity of these simulation results to initial values of state variables and parameters in the kinetic models 3 3 discussion to reasonably resolve hutchinson s classic question a lot of possible mechanisms and mathematical models have been put forward and developed for the elucidation of formation and maintenance of biodiversity in the isotropic or unstructured environments cottenie 2005 jordan and mountney 2012 nogueira et al 2006 okuyama and holland 2008 sommer et al 1993 wilson 2011 for example hutchinson 1961 himself thought that the high biodiversity of biological community in nde was just a temporary phenomenon because it was influenced by environmental factors fluctuation with the season and could not reach a permanent equilibrium at all descamps julien and gonzalez 2005 agreed with this opinion and pointed out temperature fluctuations of an aquatic environment might ensure the coexistence of phytoplankton species some research focuses on the influence of physiological and life history on biodiversity such as biological behavior effects and physiological trade offs and proposes these factors can switch dynamic response characteristics between equilibrium and non equilibrium to form high biodiversity huisman et al 2001 in addition the spatiotemporally variable environments theory found on invasion analysis has been applied for the explanation of the mechanisms to maintain biodiversity chesson 2000a 2000b the allelopathic effect of toxic chemicals is also taken as an active contribution to formation and maintenance of biodiversity of phytoplankton that is some phytoplankton species can produce toxic or inhibitory compounds potentially overturning the possibility of competitive exclusion of those species for maintenance of species coexistence both in a deterministic and a stochastic environment roy and chattopadhyay 2007b furthermore the fluid flow field like coherent vortices in a turbulent environment is suggested to cause to strongly non uniform spatial planktonic patterns which might lead to prolonged survival in competition between phytoplankton species by preventing the less fit species from being driven out completely from the water in the nde bracco et al 2000 in the above research however the organisms were considered various passive entities and their physiological and behavioral responses are only determined by the surrounding environments besides most of the hypotheses and models have not adequately considered the active behaviors of the organisms like snc and the new interspecific relationships and interactions emerged from these adaptive response characteristics therefore in this research our hypothesis and models fundamentally focus on the physiological and behavioral responses resulting from microbial acclimation for ldir such as snc intracellular energy substances storage reproductive delay and the alternative community succession mechanisms underlying the new relationships and interactions between microbial species and their biotic abiotic environments although these microbial physiological and behavioral responses to ldir were indisputably found in our repeated experiments deeper generation mechanisms were currently not found in the published scientific literature therefore in depth investigations will be carried out to elucidate the mechanisms of microbial physiological and behavioral responses to ldir in the nde from biochemical and genetic levels in our future researches furthermore although ecosystems can behave chaotically along with the increased complexity and number of species they would strive toward a high utilization of the resources which means that they might operate at the edge of chaos they have much feedback to avoid falling into the chaos frequently in nature jørgensen 1995 in the article the crucial dynamic mechanisms we proposed to drive the microbial community succession in nde with ldir is the substrates based feedback regulation on the population size hence chaotic phenomena could hardly be observed due to this feedback regulation along with the number of species and complexity increase and the formation and maintenance mechanism of microbial diversity could not beyond the scope of explanation by kinetic models developed above conclusions in this paper a new hypothesis was first proposed to elucidate the formation and maintenance mechanisms of microbial diversity in nde with ldir based on phenomenal observation then a highly valid system dynamics model derived from this hypothesis was sufficiently validated by experimental data and finally the hypothesis has been thoroughly verified by digital simulations induced by ldir substrate based feedback regulation on microbial populations sizes by mutual promotion and restraint mechanisms existing in microbial communities could cause asynchronously convergent fluctuations of microbial populations in nde with ldir these fluctuations could remarkably alleviate interspecific competition and effectively inhibit the emergence of dominant species and form and maintain a higher microbial diversity by trading species for quantity the results can provide a theoretical basis for understanding the ecological effects of ldir on microbial communities in nde as well as the applications of ldir for ecological engineering purposes either microbial prevention and control in iss or microbial diversity promotion in caes they can even probably give a new perspective for the explanation of the ever green the paradox of plankton question credit authorship contribution statement xinbin yang

24748,it remains a mystery why microbial community succession can violate the competitive exclusion principle to form high species diversity in nutrient deficient environments nde with low dose ionizing radiation ldir in this research artificial microbial communities containing three common strains downloaded from china tiangong 1 space station were cultivated in nde with and without ldir respectively by comparing their identities and differences in cellular phenotype extracellular ph intracellular triglycerides and population dynamics under the two circumstances a new hypothesis was put forward from observed phenomena and experimental data to expound new interspecific relationships and interactions induced by ldir to produce new dynamic mechanisms to drive microbial community succession with high species diversity a set of highly valid kinetic models was then developed from this hypothesis and finally the hypothesis proposed was verified through a large number of digital simulations the results show that induced by ldir specific feedback regulation of microbial populations by mutual promotion and restraint mechanisms might exist in microbial communities which can cause asynchronous convergent fluctuations of microbial populations these fluctuations remarkably alleviate interspecific competition and inhibit the emergence of dominant species leading to the formation and maintenance of higher species diversity the results can provide a theoretical basis for understanding the ecological effect of ldir on microbial communities in nde as well as its

environment simulator 1 introduction hutchinson has proposed a fundamental question of why a large number of phytoplankton species competing for the same kinds of materials can coexist stably under nutrient deficient environments nde with limited resources namely the famous the paradox of plankton hutchinson 1961 roy and chattopadhyay 2007a this fact obviously violates the competitive exclusion principle in ecology and has no clear answer so far besides there is more and more evidence to show that microorganisms can proliferate rapidly with higher species diversity in nde with low dose ionizing radiation ldir while common ionizing radiation is currently applied for sterilization widely it was reported that 133 microbial species had been identified and isolated from the international space station iss they survived by corrosion and decomposition of only a few macromolecular polymers like cable coverings and organic coatings potentially threatening astronauts health and mission s safety since there are no more than 20 types of substrates available in iss which is much less than the kinds of microbial species hence iss can be considered as a specific nde sielaff et al 2019 similarly it is still unclear why a microbial version of the paradox of plankton can occur in iss as is known the outer metal shields of iss can protect against most harmful cosmic rays only a few high energy cosmic radiations such as x ray and γ ray can enter to ionize the air mainly o2 and ar to plasma which makes microorganisms inside the station always exposed to ldir casolino et al 2007 kalmykov et al 1975 by definition of dosimetry ldir refers to ionizing radiation whose dose or dose rate is lower than 200 msv or 0 1 msv min 1 respectively united nations scientific committee on the effects of atomic radiation 2010 it is not rare to notice that the paradox of plankton like phenomena also arise in nde within this dosage range of ionizing radiation on the ground a survey demonstrated that the microbial communities had higher species diversity near the saint laurent des eaux nuclear power station than those away from the station lair et al 1980 the fungal diversity significantly increased around the chernobyl nuclear power station after the nuclear accident czirják et al 2010 dadachova and casadevall 2008 also both fungal and bacterial diversity had significantly risen in the soils contaminated by nuclear radiation in xinjiang province china zhang et al 2018 2016 the microbial populations grow on substrates produced by corroding and degrading macromolecular polymers in the iss this adaptive behavior can be considered as substrate niche construction snc indicating microorganisms can modify their environment rather than mere passive entities selected by their adverse environment laland and boogert 2010 lampe et al 2017 odling smee et al 1996 niche construction is described as a process that organisms adjust their metabolic engineering behaviors such as burrows nests habitat selections dispersal and immigration it actively modifies abiotic and biotic features to enhance the fitness of organisms under adverse environments free and barton 2007 stolpovsky et al 2016 to sum up ldir and snc might play a crucial role in the formation and maintenance of microbial diversity in nde with ldir it is well known that high microbial diversity is essential for natural ecosystems and closed artificial ecosystems caes to maintain complicated structures and functions the caes are mainly composed of higher plants animals microorganisms and artificial environmental factors such as light temperature water gas minerals and are extensively used in facility agriculture and space controlled ecological life support systems celss high microbial diversity is critically beneficial to the promotion and stabilization of the material cycle and energy flow in the caes since waste disposal is an extremely pressing problem for the construction of successful cae prototypes highly diverse microbial communities can have a greater capacity to recover vitally critical chemical elements and compounds and to return these substances to ecological cycles by degrading and assimilating wastes however it is currently tricky to artificially form and maintain high biodiversity including microbial diversity in caes for microorganisms caes can also be considered as a specific nde the produced waste inside such as inedible plant biomass animal feces or kitchen wastes only provides limited types of substrates for microbial growth in this study a series of artificial microbial communities were cultivated in emulated nde without and with ldir respectively these microbial communities are composed of staphylococcus aureus bacillus subtilis and escherichia coli which are common species downloaded from china space station tiangong 1 a series of images and data were collected in the following biology experiments including phenotype observation of individuals variation characteristics of intracellular storage substances extracellular ph and population sizes then an original hypothesis was put forward to elucidate an alternative succession mechanism induced by ldir and emerged from the new relationships and interactions between microbial species and biotic abiotic environments subsequently a set of highly valid kinetic models have been developed by observed phenomena time series experimental data proposed hypothesis and system dynamics ogata 2004 these models can fully describe both internal structure and external behaviors of microbial community succession in nde with and without ldir finally a multitude of microbial species and substrates were computer generated through monte carlo experiments and plugged to the kinetic models a large number of computer simulations were carried out to test and verify the proposed hypothesis the results indisputably proved that the dynamic mechanisms put forward could drive the microbial community succession toward a climax community with high microbial diversity in nde with ldir this research can provide a new theoretical basis for understanding the mechanism of microbial community succession in nde with ldir and give another explanation of the paradox of plankton simultaneously the simulation results can also be applied for engineering purposes such as the practical measures that can be developed and adopted to inhibit microbial diversity in iss based on structure and parameter sensitivity and conversely promote it in caes 2 materials and methods 2 1 strains and cultures the ldir environment simulator ldires was built and applied for the cultivation of artificial microbial communities composed of staphylococcus aureus no cmcc b 26003 bacillus subtilis no atcc6633 and coli no atcc25922 the ldires was a closed metal chamber fig 1 designed to emulate the ldir environment by an x ray generator installed at the top to ionize the air inside to be plasma with the radiation dose rate setting from 10 6 gy h 1 to 1 gy h 1 casolino et al 2007 the microbial communities were cultivated in six petri dishes placed on a rotating device for exposure to homogeneous doses of ldir ethylene propylene diene monomer epdm was taken as the main carbon source which is a macromolecular polymer and can be degraded and utilized by microorganisms kanwal et al 2015 two identical ldires were applied for microbial cultivation in nde with ldir and without ldir respectively the activated strains were inoculated into the inorganic salt medium ism at a concentration of 10 v v and cultured at 37 c with and without ldir used as the ionized and non ionized strains respectively 2 2 electron microscopy confocal laser scanning microscopy morphological characteristics of microbial cells were obtained with a scanning electron microscope sem jsm 6700f japan electron optics laboratory co ltd samples with without ldir treatment were observed after 48 h incubation the sem also captured images of the substrate epdm degraded by microbial corrosion for 0 days and 35 days the ionized and non ionized e coli cells cultured for 48 h

fluorescence after staining fda pi fluorescein diacetate propidium iodide xia et al 2011 2 3 measurement of intracellular lipids and extracellular ph intracellular lipids content and ph were measured after 48 h cultivation to contrast their differences under the circumstances of without and with ldir cultures were prepared at the concentration of 0 4 105 0 5 105 cfu per ml followed by centrifugation at 10 000 rpm for 10 min the supernatant was discarded then the cells were collected and resuspended by adding 1 ml 0 1 mol l 1 phosphate buffer solution the test solution was obtained after sonication and centrifuge the intracellular lipids content was measured using a triglycerides assay kit by gpo pap method henkel and stoltz 1982 and analyzed by an ultraviolet spectrophotometer at 420 nm 2 4 profiling of colony counts a mixed culture of the above three strains 10 v v was inoculated onto ism contained epdm and cultured at 37 c with and without ldir both of the two cultures were sampled 3 ml for each once per day in the following 30 days the samples were screened for counting using the corresponding selective medium mannitol salt agar msa for s aureus macconkey agar for e coli tryptone soy agar tsa for the mixed culture the counts were used to determine the population grow curves of three target strains in 30 days 2 5 hypothesis of microbial community succession mechanism in nde with ldir although experimental phenomena and data can be observed and obtained directly the underlying dynamic mechanisms driving the community succession generated by relationships and interactions between microbial species and their biotic abiotic environments cannot be identified straightforward at all which can only be elucidated by hypotheses derived from experimental phenomena and data and precisely described by kinetic models and sufficiently investigated by digital simulations holyoak and loreau 2006 kelsic et al 2015 according to the classic lotka volterra interspecific competition model when competition coefficients are invariant the competitive intensities between species are merely dependent on the product of species population sizes hence the process of competitive exclusion among microbial species for limited resources in nde can be conceived as follows at the beginning of microbial community succession all populations grow exponentially however their growth rates then slow down inevitably as niches are continuously filled up a turning point will appear sooner or later due to interspecific differences in intrinsic growth rates competition coefficients and carrying capacities some species will stop growing whereas other species will keep increasing and the latter will further exclude the former and make them extinct eventually hardin 1960 ives and carpenter 2007 it is worthy to think over what new dynamic mechanisms have emerged during the microbial community succession in nde with ldir based on readily observed phenomena a new hypothesis was tentatively proposed to interpret new relationships and interactions between microbial species and their biotic abiotic environments as follows all microbial species have snc capabilities to produce substrates for survival in nde without ldir however they have significantly different physiological and behavioral response characteristics to ldir induced by ldir some microbial species named facilitators get an enhanced snc capability to produce more substrates by corrosion of macromolecular polymer these substrates can be considered as the public goods that can directly be available to other microbial species nevertheless the other species named consumers have no or weak such response characteristics to ldir and might be more prone to utilizing ready made substrates to survive since more substrates than ever before can currently be produced by facilitators because the facilitators have to bear the high cost to produce substrates through snc consumers are unearned and therefore easy to win in the interspecific competition and eliminate facilitators however the substrates would necessarily reduce along with the facilitator population decrease which inexorably results in the fall of the consumer population once the facilitators are eradicated it is also the end of the consumers and the microbial diversity cannot be formed and maintained at all therefore it is supposed that the facilitators might not offer all substrates produced by their snc under the ldir environment and they would conserve a fraction in the form of intracellular energy substances like triglycerides to overcome adversity based on the previous hypothesis there might exist specific substrate based feedback regulation on populations sizes in microbial communities in a way of mutual promotion and restraint mechanisms hence a probable new microbial succession process in nde with ldir can be conjectured as follows step 1 as the facilitator populations increase for acclimation to ldir more substrates are produced and accumulated continuously the competition between the facilitators will be inevitably enhanced in the meantime the consumers also can grow on these substrates available and impose intense competitive exclusion on the facilitators which inhibits facilitator population from further increase and alleviates interspecific competitions between the facilitators step 2 as the consumer populations increase their interspecific competition intensity will inevitably increase however substrates amount will be less and less along with the facilitator populations decreases which limits further growth of the consumer populations and will undermine interspecific competitions between consumers as well as the competitive exclusion to facilitators step 3 the facilitator populations would rebound by taking advantage of intracellular energy substances used exclusively for themselves and succession process of microbial communities in nde with ldir seems to go back to step 1 once more the preceding process can make the populations of facilitators and consumers periodically stay at exponential growth or logarithmic phase without reaching the plateau phase leading to severe corrosion of macromolecular polymers or decomposition of substrates fox 2002 vasseur and fox 2009 such dynamic characteristics of microbial populations would weaken interspecific competitions and are beneficial to more species colonizing in nde with ldir by a strategy of trading species for quantity this is because the substrate based feedback regulation on microbial populations sizes by mutual promotion and restraint mechanisms can effectively prevent each microbial population from being dominant in the community as a result these dynamic characteristics of microbial populations are highly favorable to the formation and maintenance of high species richness and evenness namely microbial diversity 2 6 kinetic model derivation of microbial community succession in nde with ldir based on above hypothesis on dynamic mechanisms of microbial community succession in nde with ldir and without ldir a system dynamic model expressed by a set of ordinary differential equations has been developed to describe the relationships and interactions between microbial populations and their biotic abiotic environments and to predict the dynamic characteristics of microbial community succession in two circumstances through numerical simulations suppose that n1 kinds of facilitators and n2 kinds of consumers can be colonized in the nde with ldir and facilitators can produce n3 kinds of substrate satisfying n3 n1 n2 it is assumed that bacteria can be cultivated on all kinds of substrates produced by facilitators due to limited resources in nde therefore the state variables in the kinetic model are the ith facilitator population xi the j th consumer population yj the k th substrate amount sk produced by facilitators and as intracellular energy substance amount mi in the ith facilitator in nde without ldir the growth rate vci of the ith facilitator population can be defined as accumulative monod equation as follows hu et al 2012 1 v c i μ i x i k 1 n 3 s k z k i s k where μi is the specific growth rate of the ith facilitator population zki is the half saturation constant of the ith facilitator population growth on the k th substrate in nde with ldir however the growth rate vc i of the ith facilitator population eq 1 can be rewritten as follows 2 v c i μ i x i m a x k 1 n 3 s k z k i s k m i k i m i where ki denotes the half saturation constant of the ith facilitator population growth on intracellular energy substances the substrates diversity d sk is defined as the shannon weiner index as follows 3 d s k k 1 n 3 s k k 1 n 3 s k l n s k k 1 n 3 s k based on the competitive exclusion principle and in lotka volterra calibration equation the competition decrease rate vcci and vchi can be written as follows 4 v c c i j i n 1 c i j e d s k x i x j 5 v c h i j n 2 ρ i j e d s k x i y j where cij and ρij is a competition inhibition coefficient of the j th facilitator and consumer on the population growth rate of the ith facilitator respectively the metabolism rate of the ith facilitator population vcdi can be written as follows 6 v c d i d i x i where di is a metabolism coefficient of the ith facilitator according to the hypothesis the consumers do not have or have weak physiological and behavioral responses to ldir such as conducting snc and intracellular energy substances storage therefore the growth rate of the j th consumer population vhi in nde both with and without ldir can be written as follows 7 v h j r j y j k 1 n 3 s k m k j s k where rj is the specific growth rate of the j th consumer mkj is the half saturation constant of the j th consumer population growth on the k th substrate similarly the decrease rate of the ith consumer population due to competition inhibition by the j th consumer population vhij can be written as follows 8 v h i j j i n 2 q i j e d s k y i y j where qij is a competition inhibition coefficient of the j th consumer on the population growth rate of the ith consumer effect of competition of facilitators on the growth of consumers is negligible according to our hypothesis the metabolism rate of the j th consumer vhdi can be written as follows 9 v h d j δ j y j where δi is the metabolism coefficient of the j th consumer population the substrates quantity produced by the ith facilitator through their activities of snc nci with ldir can be written as follows kylafis and loreau 2008 10 n c i λ i e b i i i 2 i m i x i k λ i x i where i is ldir intensity and im is the optimum ldir intensity for facilitators growth λi is the intrinsic snc rate of the ith facilitator with half saturation constant k λi and ldir inhibition coefficient bi ldir can promote snc activities of facilitators within 0 and 2im while high dose ionizing radiations usually destroy snc activities petin and kapultcevich 2014 sun et al 2016 similarly the quantity of the substrate produced by the j th consumer through their activities of snc ncj can be written as follows 11 n c j τ j e c j i y j k τ j y j where τj is the intrinsic snc rate of the j th consumer with half saturation constant kγj and ldir inhibition coefficient cj and ldir always destroys snc activities of consumers based on the hypothesis the facilitators will reserve a fraction from substrates for their exclusive utilization hence the accumulation rate of intracellular energy substances of the i th facilitator vri can be written as follows 12 v r i φ i ε i n c i where εi is the proportion of exclusive part by the ith facilitator to total substrates produced and the φi is the conversion coefficient from substrates to intracellular energy substances therefore the production rate of the k th substrate vs k can be written as follows 13 v s k σ k i 1 n 1 1 ε i n c i j 1 n 2 n c j where σk is the proportion of the k th substrate to total substrates the i th facilitator produced in nde without ldir however the production rate of the k th substrate vsk become 14 v s k σ k i 1 n 1 n c i j 1 n 2 n c j the consumption rate of the k th substrate in the course of the population growth of i th facilitator vck and the j th consumer vhk can be defined as follows 15 v c k α i k v c i 16 v h k β j k v h j where αik and βjk denotes consumption coefficient of the ith facilitator and the j th consumer respectively in nde with ldir the facilitators can exploit both substrates and intracellular energy substances hence consumption rate of the k th substrate vc k and intracellular energy substances vcmi in the course of the facilitator population growth can be determined based on the following scenarios if k 1 n 3 s k z k i s k m i k i m i then v c k i 1 n 1 α i k v c i vcmi 0 17 else v c k 0 then v c m i γ i v c i where γi is consumption coefficient of intracellular energy substances based on the preceding analysis and modeling process a state space model with n1 n2 n3 first order nonlinear differential equations of microbial community succession in nde without and with ldir can be formulated in a top down manner on the following two scenarios scenario a without ldir referring to eq 1 eq 3 eq 6 the first order

epdm with and without ldir and the microbial cells showed significant differences in morphological characteristics after 48 h cultivation fig 2 most of them were in the state of death without ldir but more of them were alive with ldir suggesting that ldir can have positive effects on the cell survival rate the further observations found that some cells of e coli cultivated with ldir became morphologically smaller and shrunk more fig 3 they might stay in a particular dormant state for retard of nutrient transport respiration rate or macromolecules synthesis kudryasheva et al 2017 kudryasheva and rozhko 2015 novikova et al 2011 oliver 2000 also the corrosion degree of epdm surface with ldir was considerably severe indicating faster microbial proliferation through snc fig 4 as illustrated in fig 5 a and b except for e coli there were no significant differences in intracellular triglycerides and extracellular ph of b subtilis and s aureus cultivated with and without ldir it is reported that the microbial species can only utilize the intracellular energy substances to grow independent of ambient substrates wilkinson 1963 the corrosion and degradation of the macromolecular polymer resulted directly from extracellular enzymes and organic acids secreted by some microbial species kip and van veen 2015 the lower extracellular ph the heavier macromolecular polymers are decomposed by microbial snc deutzmann et al 2015 in the mixed culture of s aureus e coli and b subtilis the microbial populations show that only e coli survived eventually s aureus and b subtilis were wiped out gradually without ldir due to physiological and behavioral variations induced by ldir however the new interspecific relationships and interactions generated new dynamic mechanisms of microbial communities causing the stable coexistence of e coli and s aureus with distinct asynchronous fluctuations of populations fig 5c 3 2 digital simulations on microbial community succession in nde with ldir judging from the variability of phenotypes intracellular triglycerides contents and extracellular ph e coli can be considered facilitators whereas s aureus and b subtilis can be considered consumers hence a kinetic model expressed by four differential equations including one facilitator two consumers and one substrate was developed based on eq 18 eq 23 moreover the corresponding simulation model was established by matlab simulink s function to conduct digital simulations for point estimation of parameters and model validation by use of time domain experimental data jorgensen 2016 mathworks 2017 the experimental data were divided into two parts one third for parameter identification the rest for model validation fig 6 as illustrated in fig 6 the kinetic models are highly valid and can be applied for hypothesis verification with more microbial species and substrates involvement where r and nse denote spearman rank correlation and nash sutcliffe efficiency respectively moriasi et al 2007 based on the parameter point estimation the jacobian matrix and the estimated covariance matrix the 70 confidence intervals of parameters were estimated for microbial species computer generated through monte carlo experiments which can cover the characteristics of most of the microbial species here a microbial species can be considered as a characteristic parameter vector obtained by uniformly and independently random sampling from these parameter intervals table 1 for example a characteristic parameter vector μi zki ki cij ρij di λi bi k λi εi φi αik γi can represent a facilitator species therefore 5 50 species of the facilitators that can produce 3 10 types of the substrates and 5 40 species of the consumers were computer generated and their characteristic parameter vectors were plugged into eq 18 eq 23 for theoretical investigation of microbial community succession in nde without and with ldir before digital simulations it is important to set simulation options table 2 appropriately according to the complexity accuracy convergence speed computational expense etc according to the kinetic model of microbial community succession in nde without ldir eq 18 eq 20 the corresponding digital simulation results show that only a few populations whose number of species is no more than types of substrates produced by facilitators snc can coexist fig 7 a and b however most of them go extinct due to competitive exclusion both microbial populations and substrates will asymptotically stabilize via transient responses in contrast according to the kinetic model of microbial community succession in nde with ldir eq 21 eq 23 the emerged general pattern showed in fig 7c and d indicates that most of the species can coexist even when their richness is far more than types of substrates produced by facilitators snc both microbial species populations and substrates appear periodical vibrations with shifted phases via unordered transient responses the microbial populations show asynchronously convergent fluctuations as one species population is at a relatively high level the other species populations might at relatively low levels due to phase differences according to classic lotka volterra equations these dynamic response characteristics can effectively reduce the interspecific competitions through minimization of interspecific competitive intensity that is mainly dependent on the product of microbial population sizes such a mechanism will drive the mixture of facilitators and consumers toward higher richness and evenness i e species diversity in nde with ldir it is worth mentioning that microbial community succession patterns in nde both without and with ldir fig 7 are general and universal because of the insensitivity of these simulation results to initial values of state variables and parameters in the kinetic models 3 3 discussion to reasonably resolve hutchinson s classic question a lot of possible mechanisms and mathematical models have been put forward and developed for the elucidation of formation and maintenance of biodiversity in the isotropic or unstructured environments cottenie 2005 jordan and mountney 2012 nogueira et al 2006 okuyama and holland 2008 sommer et al 1993 wilson 2011 for example hutchinson 1961 himself thought that the high biodiversity of biological community in nde was just a temporary phenomenon because it was influenced by environmental factors fluctuation with the season and could not reach a permanent equilibrium at all descamps julien and gonzalez 2005 agreed with this opinion and pointed out temperature fluctuations of an aquatic environment might ensure the coexistence of phytoplankton species some research focuses on the influence of physiological and life history on biodiversity such as biological behavior effects and physiological trade offs and proposes these factors can switch dynamic response characteristics between equilibrium and non equilibrium to form high biodiversity huisman et al 2001 in addition the spatiotemporally variable environments theory found on invasion analysis has been applied for the explanation of the mechanisms to maintain biodiversity chesson 2000a 2000b the allelopathic effect of toxic chemicals is also taken as an active contribution to formation and maintenance of biodiversity of phytoplankton that is some phytoplankton species can produce toxic or inhibitory compounds potentially overturning the possibility of competitive exclusion of those species for maintenance of species coexistence both in a deterministic and a stochastic environment roy and chattopadhyay 2007b furthermore the fluid flow field like coherent vortices in a turbulent environment is suggested to cause to strongly non uniform spatial planktonic patterns which might lead to prolonged survival in competition between phytoplankton species by preventing the less fit species from being driven out completely from the water in the nde bracco et al 2000 in the above research however the organisms were considered various passive entities and their physiological and behavioral responses are only determined by the surrounding environments besides most of the hypotheses and models have not adequately considered the active behaviors of the organisms like snc and the new interspecific relationships and interactions emerged from these adaptive response characteristics therefore in this research our hypothesis and models fundamentally focus on the physiological and behavioral responses resulting from microbial acclimation for ldir such as snc intracellular energy substances storage reproductive delay and the alternative community succession mechanisms underlying the new relationships and interactions between microbial species and their biotic abiotic environments although these microbial physiological and behavioral responses to ldir were indisputably found in our repeated experiments deeper generation mechanisms were currently not found in the published scientific literature therefore in depth investigations will be carried out to elucidate the mechanisms of microbial physiological and behavioral responses to ldir in the nde from biochemical and genetic levels in our future researches furthermore although ecosystems can behave chaotically along with the increased complexity and number of species they would strive toward a high utilization of the resources which means that they might operate at the edge of chaos they have much feedback to avoid falling into the chaos frequently in nature jørgensen 1995 in the article the crucial dynamic mechanisms we proposed to drive the microbial community succession in nde with ldir is the substrates based feedback regulation on the population size hence chaotic phenomena could hardly be observed due to this feedback regulation along with the number of species and complexity increase and the formation and maintenance mechanism of microbial diversity could not beyond the scope of explanation by kinetic models developed above conclusions in this paper a new hypothesis was first proposed to elucidate the formation and maintenance mechanisms of microbial diversity in nde with ldir based on phenomenal observation then a highly valid system dynamics model derived from this hypothesis was sufficiently validated by experimental data and finally the hypothesis has been thoroughly verified by digital simulations induced by ldir substrate based feedback regulation on microbial populations sizes by mutual promotion and restraint mechanisms existing in microbial communities could cause asynchronously convergent fluctuations of microbial populations in nde with ldir these fluctuations could remarkably alleviate interspecific competition and effectively inhibit the emergence of dominant species and form and maintain a higher microbial diversity by trading species for quantity the results can provide a theoretical basis for understanding the ecological effects of ldir on microbial communities in nde as well as the applications of ldir for ecological engineering purposes either microbial prevention and control in iss or microbial diversity promotion in caes they can even probably give a new perspective for the explanation of the ever green the paradox of plankton question credit authorship contribution statement xinbin yang

24749,despite their critical role as the main energy pathway between phytoplankton and fish the functional complexity of zooplankton is typically poorly resolved in marine ecosystem models trait based approaches where zooplankton are represented with functional traits such as body size could help improve the resolution of zooplankton in marine ecosystem models and their role in trophic transfer and carbon sequestration here we present the zooplankton model of size spectra version 2 zoomssv2 a functional size spectrum model that resolves nine major zooplankton functional groups heterotrophic flagellates heterotrophic ciliates larvaceans omnivorous copepods carnivorous copepods chaetognaths euphausiids salps and jellyfish each group is represented by the functional traits of body size size based feeding characteristics and carbon content the model is run globally at 5 resolution to steady state using long term average temperature and chlorophyll a for each grid cell zooplankton community composition emerges based on the relative fitness of the different groups emergent steady state patterns of global zooplankton abundance biomass and growth rates agree well with empirical data and the model is robust to changes in the boundary conditions of the zooplankton we use the model to consider the role of the zooplankton groups in supporting higher trophic levels by exploring the sensitivity of steady state fish biomass to the removal of individual zooplankton groups across the global ocean our model shows zooplankton play a key role in supporting fish biomass in the global ocean for example the removal of euphausiids or omnivorous copepods caused fish biomass to decrease by up to 80 by contrast the removal of carnivorous copepods caused fish biomass to increase by up to 75 our results suggest that including zooplankton complexity in ecosystem models could be key to better understanding the distribution of fish biomass and trophic efficiency across the global ocean keywords zooplankton functional traits size spectrum model marine ecosystem modelling 1 introduction marine ecosystem models are valuable tools for understanding marine ecosystem function structure and productivity under global change however the marine ecosystem is complex and there remains a lack of unified understanding of key physiological and ecological processes tittensor et al 2018 modellers address this uncertainty by making assumptions about which ecosystem processes to represent in their models depending on their objectives a common assumption across higher trophic level modelling frameworks is to represent zooplankton the main grazers of phytoplankton and bacteria and prey of small fish very simply everett et al 2017 there are two common approaches to representing zooplankton in marine models focussed on higher trophic levels first phytoplankton and zooplankton dynamics are driven externally by nutrient phytoplankton zooplankton detritus models maury 2010 woodworth jefcoats et al 2013 christensen et al 2015 carozza et al 2016 petrik et al 2019 and then this is used to drive higher trophic levels in an ecosystem model second phytoplankton and small zooplankton are lumped together as a resource for the smallest fish size classes in size spectrum models blanchard et al 2009 2012 law et al 2009 datta et al 2010 scott et al 2014 zhang et al 2015 2016 these simple representations of zooplankton together with the similar lower trophic level structure amongst models precludes a deeper understanding of the role of zooplankton in ecosystem functioning even with a simple representation of zooplankton many modelling studies suggest that the productivity and structure of higher trophic levels are sensitive to the representation of lower trophic levels friedland et al 2012 jennings and collingridge 2015 heneghan et al 2016 dam and baumman 2017 mitra et al 2014 demonstrated that in a modelled plankton food web trophic dynamics were sensitive to small changes in parameterisation of zooplankton feeding rates similarly fuchs and franks 2010 found that zooplankton with large predator prey mass ratios ppmr i e a predator is a lot larger than its prey gave rise to a flatter plankton abundance size spectra relatively more large organisms in comparison to zooplankton with small ppmrs which led to a steeper plankton size spectra moving beyond the plankton jennings and collingridge 2015 demonstrated that the productivity and total biomass of the global fish community was highly sensitive to how energy moved through the lower planktonic trophic levels from phytoplankton to zooplankton and beyond one of the main reasons that modellers choose to simplify zooplankton is because of their tremendous taxonomic diversity especially at the phylum level a typical zooplankton sample might contain organisms from 10 phyla or more each with different body sizes biochemical compositions growth rates feeding preferences and reproductive modes hansen et al 1994 1997 kiørboe et al 2011 mconville et al 2017 while it is not possible to include thousands of common plankton species in ecosystem models an alternative is to model organisms based on traits such as body size modelling the marine ecosystem using body size instead of species identity is rooted in over 50 years of observations that show a remarkable consistency in the distributions of organism abundance or biomass against body size size spectra across a range of marine ecosystems blanchard et al 2017 for zooplankton body size is strongly related to trophic position andersen et al 2016a and the size based feeding behaviour of different zooplankton groups has been suggested to structure the community across environmental gradients mitra and davis 2010 barton et al 2013 owing to their body size zooplankton are the primary grazers of phytoplankton which span nine orders of magnitude in body size from picoplankton 0 2 2 μm equivalent spherical diameter esd 10 14 5 10 11 5 g wet weight to microplankton 20 μm esd 10 8 4 g wet weight for zooplankton other traits such as predator prey mass ratio ppmr and body composition are also important since these factors also play a role in organism fitness mcgill et al 2006 litchman et al 2013 andersen et al 2016a mcconville et al 2017 for instance phytoplankton size structure changes across environmental gradients agawin et al 2000 brewin et al 2010 barnes et al 2011 changes in the phytoplankton have implications for the structuring of the zooplankton community which in turn affects how energy from primary production is transported to higher trophic levels this is because zooplankton exhibit vast diversity in their feeding behaviour with ppmrs varying 7 orders of magnitude across different functional groups from 10 for carnivorous copepods to 108 for salps and larvaceans bone 1997 wirtz 2012 another functional trait that varies strongly across zooplankton groups is body composition and this can have substantial effects on energy transfer to higher trophic levels carbon is the primary structural component of zooplankton kiørboe 2013 and zooplankton vary widely in their carbon content between gelatinous groups with low carbon density and non gelatinous groups with high carbon density kiørboe 2013 mcconville et al 2017 thus a zooplankton community dominated by more gelatinous groups offers less nutritional value and growth potential for higher trophic levels moreover changes in carbon content affects the relative fitness of different zooplankton groups since critical physiological and competitive processes such as metabolism search rate and average growth efficiency scale with carbon across zooplankton groups acuña et al 2011 kiørboe 2011 kiørboe and hirst 2014 mcconville et al 2017 the diversity of traits in the zooplankton means that global ecosystem modellers must consider more than just their body size if they are to improve the realism of zooplankton in their models in the past 15 years trait based modelling approaches have been applied to explain the distribution of phytoplankton groups follows et al 2007 edwards et al 2013 acevedo trejos et al 2015 and there is a growing literature applying the approach separately to zooplankton fuchs and franks 2010 brun et al 2016 heneghan et al 2016 schnedler meyer et al 2016 prowe et al 2018 and fish communities stuart smith et al 2013 blanchard et al 2014 van denderen et al 2017 petrik et al 2019 however to our knowledge there are no global marine ecosystem models resolving both higher and lower trophic levels that incorporate the diversity of traits in the zooplankton recently blanchard et al 2017 proposed unifying size spectrum ecosystem modelling which only resolves the body size distribution of organisms with trait based modelling in a new functional size spectrum framework this framework allows modellers to take advantage of the powerful role of body size in structuring the marine ecosystem as well as other functional traits that are important and offers a promising way forward for resolving the functional complexity of the zooplankton within a model of the entire marine ecosystem this is the approach we adopt here using functional traits such as body size and ppmr to resolve the diversity of the zooplankton in marine ecosystem models is not a new idea twenty five years ago hansen et al 1994 hypothesised that with knowledge of the size selectivity e g ppmr of different zooplankton groups it would be possible to construct a simple size based model of the pelagic food web more recently zooplankton feeding traits such as ppmr were incorporated in a functional size spectrum model heneghan et al 2016 which showed that fish biomass and ecosystem stability were sensitive to zooplankton feeding characteristics this model zooplankton model of size spectra zoomssv1 allowed a qualitative assessment of how zooplankton traits such as ppmr affected energy transfer from phytoplankton to fish and highlighted the significant implications of variations in zooplankton community traits for high trophic level biomass and ecosystem stability however it did not represent zooplankton community composition or food quality and so could not be used to explore how those factors might affect ecosystem structure and transfer efficiency in the global ocean here we follow the work of heneghan et al 2016 to present zoomssv2 referred to hereafter as zoomss the first functional size spectrum model of the marine ecosystem to resolve phytoplankton nine zooplankton functional groups heterotrophic flagellates and ciliates omnivorous and carnivorous copepods larvaceans euphausiids salps chaetognaths and jellyfish and three size based fish groups zooplankton functional groups are resolved using their body size ranges size based feeding characteristics and carbon content the model is run to steady state and the modelled zooplankton community emerges across global environmental gradients depending on the functional traits of the different groups the model is not fit to observational data rather parameter values for the model s functional trait are obtained from experimental results in the literature and the model s ability to reproduce observed patterns in zooplankton biomass abundance and growth is assessed the model is generally able to reproduce steady state global patterns of zooplankton biomass and abundance as well as empirical growth rates from flagellates to jellyfish what is more model output is robust to uncertainties in the boundary conditions of the smallest size class of each group by resolving zooplankton functional diversity the model allows us for the first time to examine the unique roles of different zooplankton groups in supporting higher trophic level biomass across the global ocean we finish by exploring the change in global fish biomass when different zooplankton groups are removed from the model as well as the change in biomass when the zooplankton are represented simplistically as a single functional group 2 methods we developed the zooplankton model of size spectra version 2 zoomss based on the prototype of heneghan et al 2016 zoomss uses the functional size spectrum framework blanchard et al 2017 to resolve the body size ranges size based feeding characteristics and carbon content of nine zooplankton groups and three fish groups parameter values for the functional traits are not fit to data here but are determined using published estimates available in the literature table 2 the model is run to steady state on 5 grid squares across the global ocean fig 1 for each region the model is forced with the long term mean satellite sea surface temperature and chlorophyll a from modis aqua scripts to run the model as well as global forcings for sea surface temperature and chlorophyll a are available for download at https github com mathmarecol zoopmodelsizespectra 2 1 zooplankton model of size spectra version 2 zoomss zoomss represents the marine ecosystem as three communities phytoplankton zooplankton and fish the zooplankton community consists of nine of the most abundant zooplankton groups and the fish community is made up of a small medium and large group fig 1 table 1 3 dynamics of the phytoplankton are not explicitly resolved in the model rather the size structure of the phytoplankton community is estimated directly from satellite chlorophyll a observations brewin et al 2010 barnes et al 2011 hirata et al 2011 abundances of the zooplankton and fish communities are driven by size dependant processes of growth and mortality and the abundances of each functional group governed by separate second order mckendrick von foerster equations e1 t n i w t w g i w t n i w t μ i w t n i w t 1 2 2 w 2 d i w t n i w t the density of individuals in group i of weight w at time t per m3 is given by ni w t individual processes in group i are given by growth gi w t mortality μi w t and diffusion rates di w t fig 2 we use the mckendrick von foerster equation to govern zooplankton and fish communities because it is a popular choice for modelling fish focused size spectrum models and it is similar to governing equations in plankton focused size based models baird and suthers 2007 fuchs and franks 2010 zhou et al 2010 ward et al 2012 cuesta et al 2018 looking ahead this means that future model developments that resolve the dynamics of the phytoplankton or more of the functional diversity of the zooplankton could be achieved with the same or similar governing equation used here from the perspective of a predator from group i the feeding rate f g yr 1 on prey group j depends on the search rate of group vi w m3 yr 1 e13 and the density of suitable prey g yr 1 e2 f i j w t v i w w p w ϕ i w w n j w t w d w where ϕi w w e11 table 1 all subsequent equations are also found in table 1 is the probability a predator of size w would consume an individual of size w and wp is the minimum size of phytoplankton the smallest body size in the system the growth rate of a predator from group i of size w at time t is fuelled by the consumption and conversion of prey biomass to new biomass g yr 1 e3 g i w t τ j e i j f i j w t where eij is the growth conversion efficiency for predators of group i eating prey from group j e14a b and τ is the effect of temperature on ingestion for group i e4 a drawback of the type 1 functional response used here for feeding is that it ignores the effect of satiation at high food densities this means that maximum growth rates of zooplankton and fish groups could be unrealistically fast in areas with high food availability i e high chlorophyll a concentration however the effect of fast growth rates would be similar across all functional groups and so would not affect their relative fitness further we will compare modelled growth rates at high chlorophyll concentrations with empirical data to assess whether the model s growth rates are reasonable the choice of functional response not only affect feeding rates at high or low food concentrations but can also lead to different temporal dynamics between predators and prey gentleman and neuheimer 2008 however our focus here is on long term steady state patterns in the composition of the global zooplankton community and not on the dynamics of the different groups through time nevertheless ecosystem dynamics have a real impact on marine ecosystems particularly for zooplankton which face seasonal fluctuations in prey abundance from phytoplankton blooms and busts the representation of zooplankton functional response will therefore be an important consideration for any future work exploring the temporal dynamics of the marine ecosystem across environmental gradients temperature effects are represented using a q 10 temperature coefficient e4 τ q 10 k k ref 10 where k and k ref are the temperatures in kelvin of each 5 grid square and the reference temperature where τ 1 respectively from the perspective of prey of size w the total mortality from predation by larger size classes μp w t yr 1 is given by e5 μ p w t τ j w w j ϕ j w w v j w n j w t d w where w j is the maximum size of a predator from group j since individuals grow over time an additional source of mortality from senescence was incorporated that increased with body size yr 1 e6 μ s i w t τ δ w w s i ρ where δ is the coefficient of senescence mortality ρ the exponent and w s i the body size after which senescence mortality rapidly increases for an individual from group i this senescence mortality term also acts as a closure term for the largest size classes by preventing a build up of large individuals who are not exposed to predation andersen et al 2016b for an individual of size w at time t from group i total mortality μi w t yr 1 is given by summing predation and senescence mortality

incorporate the diffusion term following the work of datta et al 2010 who demonstrated that stochastic variation in growth at the individual level something that the more commonly used first order mckendrick von foerster equation does not consider can be approximated at the functional group level by adding a diffusion term to the first order mckendrick von foerster equation incorporating a diffusion term means that the model incorporates both the advection of biomass from smaller to larger size classes through the processes of predation and growth gi w t e3 but also includes an approximation of the variability in the growth rates of each community from the stochastic variation in individual level growth rates through time di w t e8 as well as increasing model realism by approximating the functional group level effects of individual level variability datta et al 2011 demonstrated that the diffusion term improves the stability of the numerical approximation of real world predator prey interactions and individual growth trajectories in the presence of large destabilising predator prey mass ratios which have been shown to cause the community size spectra to develop travelling wave attractors law et al 2009 zhang et al 2013 heneghan et al 2016 this is especially important here given our model includes zooplankton predator prey mass ratios that are many orders of magnitude larger than predator prey size ratios used in fish focused size spectrum models that use the first order mckendrick von foerster equation see table 2 2 1 1 parameterizing the phytoplankton for each 5 region the density of phytoplankton np w of size w is given by e9 n p w a w b the slope a intercept b and maximum size of the static phytoplankton spectrum were derived from temporally and spatially averaged satellite chlorophyll a from modis aqua accessed via the giovanni portal https giovanni gsfc nasa gov giovanni using the synoptic model developed by brewin et al 2015 the brewin model gives an estimate of the percentage contribution of 3 phytoplankton size classes pico 0 2 2 μm esd nano 2 20 μm esd and microphytoplankton 20 μm esd to the total chlorophyll a concentration mg m 3 yr 1 picophytoplankton constitute up to 75 of the biomass in low chlorophyll a oligotrophic waters declining to 10 in high chlorophyll a eutrophic waters as micro phytoplankton increase from 10 in oligotrophic waters to 75 in eutrophic waters and nano phytoplankton increase from 20 in oligotrophic to 45 in mid chlorophyll a waters before declining to 15 in eutrophic waters fig 3 a the contribution of microphytoplankton and the maximum size of phytoplankton both increase with chlorophyll a concentration brewin et al 2010 hirata et al 2011 barnes et al 2011 we incorporated this change in the size range of the microphytoplankton with increasing chlorophyll a by linearly increasing its maximum size from 21 to 60 μm esd depending on the percentage contribution of the microphytoplankton group to total chlorophyll a we used 60 μm as the maximum esd for the phytoplankton following barnes et al s 2011 finding that 90 of phytoplankton are smaller than 55 65 μm across polar tropical and upwelling environments total chlorophyll a concentration for each of the 3 size classes was converted to grams wet weight assuming 1 g chlorophyll a 50 g c zhou et al 2010 and 1 g c 10 g wet weight hansen et al 1994 boudreau and dickie 1992 woodworth jefcoats et al 2013 and the three size ranges were also converted from esd to grams wet weight assuming 1 cm3 1 g wet weight boudreau and dickie 1992 finally slope and intercept were found analytically with e8 see supplementary material a1 phytoplankton slopes we derived ranged from 1 2 to 0 77 across the global ocean fig 3b which is similar to the range reported by previous empirical studies huete ortega et al 2012 marañón 2015 moreno ostos et al 2015 we use satellite chlorophyll a observations to drive the abundance and structure of the phytoplankton community in each grid cell observed chlorophyll a is an estimate of the surface phytoplankton biomass in a region given the processes of predation and nutrient cycling and regeneration thus by using observed satellite chlorophyll a our model is implicitly incorporating these important processes in the phytoplankton which is sufficient for our present objective of resolving steady state patterns of zooplankton biomass and composition across the global ocean given in situ phytoplankton biomass in global marine ecosystem models it is common practice to use satellite or earth system model estimates of phytoplankton biomass blanchard et al 2009 maury 2010 christensen et al 2015 petrik et al 2019 or primary production gascuel and pauly 2009 carozza et al 2016 jennings and collingridge 2015 as inputs to drive higher trophic level processes without feedback from predation or nutrient cycling we chose to use phytoplankton biomass calculated with chlorophyll a over primary production here because it is the most common measure of food for zooplankton richardson and verheye 1999 hirst and bunker 2003 2 1 2 incorporating functional traits we could parameterise many of the functional traits and key processes for different zooplankton groups because of the extensive experimental work carried out on zooplankton see table 2 2 1 2 1 body size and predator prey mass ratio for each zooplankton group we established body size ranges in wet weight using measurements and conversion equations from the literature see table 2 prey preference for predators of a certain size was represented using the ratio of a predator s body size to its preferred prey body size ppmr rather than specifying diet preferences table 2 fig 4 across zooplankton taxa ppmr increases with predator size due to the non isometric scaling of feeding related apparatus with body size wirtz 2012 we used the mechanistic formulation from wirtz 2012 to calculate the ppmr range for each zooplankton group except for salps and larvaceans wirtz 2012 links ppmr to a quantitative measure of the feeding mode raptorial active feeding is linked to a lower ppmr because predators eat prey closer to their own size by contrast passive suspension feeding yields a higher ppmr the ppmr of an individual from group i of size w βi w is given by e10 β i w exp 0 02 ln d w 2 m 1 832 3 where dw is an individual of size w s equivalent spherical diameter in μm and m is the quantitative measure of feeding mode a large positive m value is linked to a more carnivorous feeding strategy with a lower ppmr by contrast a large negative m value is associated with a larger ppmr and a filter feeding strategy of prey capture for filter feeders such as salps and larvaceans we follow wirtz s formulation that ppmr increases with body size but we assume that their filter mesh does not increase with body size this means that for salps and larvaceans individuals will capture the same size prey no matter their own size see bone et al 2003 in keeping with previous studies the ppmr for the fish communities was held constant at 100 across their size ranges blanchard et al 2009 hartvig et al 2011 rochet et al 2012 andersen et al 2016b the relatively small body sizes and high ppmrs of salps larvaceans and omnivorous copepods means that these groups feed exclusively on phytoplankton heterotrophic flagellates and heterotrophic ciliates fig 4 euphausiids also have high a ppmr range but their larger size means that their largest size classes can also access smaller copepods larvaceans and euphausiids consistent with their omnivorous diet in the oceans schmidt and atkinson 2016 the low ppmr ranges of carnivorous copepods chaetognaths and jellyfish coupled with their larger body size means that these groups are almost totally carnivorous we further restricted their diets so that they do not feed on phytoplankton at all which is consistent with most current understandings of their diets terazaki 2000 purcell and arai 2001 2 1 2 2 prey size selectivity the range of available prey sizes for an individual predator of body size w from group i is defined by a log normal feeding kernel this feeding kernel is centred on the predator s preferred predator prey mass ratio ppmr βi w with a standard deviation σi given by the kernel width parameter for that predator s group table 2 e11 ϕ i w w exp ln β i w w w 2 2 σ i 2 σ i 2 π a wider feeding kernel means a predator can feed over a larger prey size range for zooplankton feeding kernel width is positively correlated with ppmr hansen et al 1994 fuchs and franks 2010 kiørboe 2016 filter feeders such as larvaceans or salps with a large mean ppmr feed over a wider size range than carnivorous copepods or heterotopic flagellates with a smaller ppmr we used the empirical model developed by fuchs and franks 2010 to link the feeding kernel width of each zooplankton group σi to that group s mean ppmr β i e12 σ i 0 05 lo g 10 β i 0 33 the feeding kernel widths for the fish communities were held constant at 1 3 in keeping with previous studies andersen et al 2016b 2 1 2 3 growth conversion efficiency and carbon content previous size spectrum models have focused on fish and used a currency solely of wet mass rather than considering carbon largely because fish groups vary little in their carbon content however as zoomss resolves nine zooplankton prey groups and the carbon content of zooplankton varies by more than an order of magnitude amongst common zooplankton groups e g jellyfish 0 5 and copepods 12 we have included carbon content as a measure of food quality as straile 1997 found that mean growth conversion efficiency as a measure of prey carbon converted to predator carbon was 0 25 across a large range of zooplankton taxa we consider that prey groups with a comparatively higher carbon content e g copepods euphausiids contribute more to the wet weight growth of a predator compared with lower carbon more gelatinous groups such as jellyfish spitz et al 2010 kiørboe 2013 mitra et al 2014 in terms of wet weight the growth conversion efficiency of a predator of group i eij feeding on prey from group j prey is e14a e i j 2 5 c j where cj is the carbon wet weight ratio of group j table 2 as gelatinous filter feeders salps and larvaceans are the fastest growing metazoans and have growth rates an order of magnitude faster than other zooplankton of the same size hirst et al 2003 we included this in the model by modifying e14a for these groups e14b e i j 0 25 c j c i so that the growth conversion efficiency of predators that are salps and larvaceans is also related to their carbon content ci this means that these groups increase their wet weight by 5 10 more than other zooplankton of the same size when consuming a given prey for example according to e13a a copepod consuming heterotrophic flagellates that have a carbon wet weight ratio of 0 15 would have a gross growth efficiency of 0 375 but according to e13b a larvacean consuming the same flagellate would have a gross growth efficiency of 1 875 however as a corresponding trade off we made the assumption that for salps and larvaceans the additional wet weight in excess of what other zooplankton would gain is converted to detritus not into new biomass this is based on their unique physiology larvaceans grow and shed mucus houses multiple times each day bone 1997 and salps produce large faecal pellets that contribute disproportionately to carbon flux compared with other zooplankton henschke et al 2016 in the current implementation of the model we consider the faecal pellets and mucus houses to be detritus and lost from the system future versions of zoomss will track the detritus through the food web 2 2 numerical implementation of zoomss 2 2 1 boundary conditions for the size spectrum model we do not explicitly resolve reproduction for any zooplankton or fish group which affects how the boundary conditions of the smallest size class of each functional group is parameterised although reproduction in fish is a relatively simple process of production of eggs of roughly the same size 1 mg and being sexually fertilised neuheimer et al 2015 reproduction in the zooplankton is much more diverse from alternating generations of sexual and asexual reproduction in salps and jellyfish fautin 2002 daponte et al 2013 to the hermaphroditism of chaetognaths bone 1991 and intersexuality in copepods gusmão and mckinnon 2009 therefore for simplicity we assume constant recruitment for each zooplankton and fish group which keeps the abundance of their smallest size classes fixed at a proportion of the total abundance in those size classes from other groups for each zooplankton group the abundance of the smallest size class at time t ni wi t was fixed with respect to the total abundance of the other groups j in that size class e15 n i w i t p i j i n j w i t where pi is the relative abundance of group i in size class wi with respect to the total abundance of all other groups for the smallest zooplankton group heterotrophic flagellates the abundance of their smallest size class was fixed to be 10 of the abundance of the phytoplankton community in the same size class in keeping with zoomsv1 the smallest size class abundance for the total fish community was fixed at the total zooplankton abundance in that size class divided equally amongst the three fish groups for all other zooplankton groups except for salps and jellyfish pi was fixed at 0 1 salps and jellyfish are the two largest zooplankton groups and pi was set at 0 01 to prevent these groups from dominating the biomass of the zooplankton community 2 2 2 running zoomss abundances of the zooplankton and fish groups were modelled with separate second order mckendrick von foerster equations which we solved numerically using a second order semi implicit upwind finite difference scheme press et al 2007 for numerical implementation we discretised the zooplankton and fish community size ranges into equal 0 1 log10 size intervals the model is initialised with the same zooplankton community in each 5 grid cell and integrated forward through time for 1000 years with a half weekly time step after experimenting with smaller and larger interval widths we chose these values to discretise the weight and time intervals to ensure convergence in our numerical implementation whilst minimising the time required to run the simulation large ppmrs and narrow feeding kernels have been shown to cause travelling waves across the spectrum through time datta et al 2011 heneghan et al 2016 with the very high ppmrs of some of the zooplankton groups represented here we found that our model settles into repeating cycles of travelling waves of abundance from small to large body sizes through time therefore we average the last 500 years of abundance biomass and growth rates to obtain the long term average results presented here 2 3 model assessment 2 3 1 assessing the emergent global distribution of total zooplankton biomass we use two different estimates of the global distribution of zooplankton biomass to assess our model estimates the first is from strömberg et al 2009 who created a global map of zooplankton carbon biomass based on a theoretical trophic transfer model driven by net primary production and tuned to 4843 estimates of carbon biomass the second global map is derived from all available zooplankton biomass estimates in the copepod database supplementary figure a3 n 196 707 as these estimates were measured and collected in different ways we used a generalized additive model with zooplankton biomass as the response and a suite of predictors to standardize for measurement type and collection methods and included satellite chlorophyll a and sea surface temperature as environmental predictors see supplementary information section a2 for more details because this statistical model was driven by data we called this approach the empirical model both approaches have strengths and weaknesses the strömberg model is based on theory and relatively few observations whereas the empirical model is based on many more observations but had to account for differences in sampling methods and types of biomass measurements 2 3 2 assessing emergent global distributions of zooplankton abundance the global distribution of each zooplankton functional group emerges from the model based on their relative fitness in the environmental conditions of each grid cell to assess the emergent distributions of the individual functional groups against global patterns of empirical abundance we used general linear models to model the relationship between in situ sample data and environmental variables and sample equipment similar to our comparison of the model s biomass with the model from strömberg et al 2009 we compared the emergent distributions of abundance from zoomss with the empirical distributions from the generalised linear models using pearson s correlation coefficient and the root mean square error to build the generalised linear models of zooplankton abundance we compiled zooplankton taxonomic data from multiple sources to create a database of 640 184 observations of zooplankton matching 7 of the taxonomic groups in zoomss see figure a5 in supplementary information for maps of data distribution these groups were euphausiids omnivorous copepods carnivorous copepods larvaceans chaetognaths salps and jellyfish the database was compiled from the copepod database o brien 2014 the continuous plankton recorder richardson et al 2006 the integrated marine observing system eriksen et al 2019 imos 2019 the jellyfish database initiative condon et al 2014 and the warreen data baird et al 2011 data that did not match the 7 groups were discarded and remaining data were quality controlled to remove samples with missing or incorrect metadata e g time date gps location gebco bathymetry and satellite derived sea surface temperature and chlorophyll a climatologies from modis aqua was matched to each sample using this database of seven zooplankton groups we compiled we generated a linear model in r v3 5 3 r core team 2019 for each zooplankton group to quantify global patterns and compare with zoomss the same initial model was used for all groups predictors used in the initial model were environmental variables sea surface temperature sst c chlorophyll a mg m 3 bathymetry m day of year days sample depth m hour of the day h mesh size µm and device type net or cpr natural splines using the splines package were fit to bathymetry and sst and a harmonic function was fitted to cyclical variables of day of year and hour of the day day of year was standardised to the northern hemisphere so the middle of summer was the same day of year in both hemispheres non significant predictors were removed and model residual plots were inspected after viewing residual plots we log transformed the response for each zooplankton group abundance and chlorophyll a to improve assumptions of homogeneity of variance and normality we tested a model using the gamma family with a log link however the models did not converge we do not have the original sample volumes for all the datasets so we were unable to use counts as the response and volume as an offset in the model figures of the final statistical models for each of the seven functional groups can be found in the supplementary material a3 supplementary figures a6 a12 2 3 3 assessing modelled zooplankton growth rates energy transfer through the zooplankton from phytoplankton to fish is driven by growth rates of the different zooplankton functional groups to assess whether the model produced realistic rates of energy transfer through the zooplankton groups we compared modelled growth rates with empirical rates from hirst et al 2003 and kiørboe and hirst 2014 evaluating growth rates in the model also allows us to assess whether a simple type 1 functional response is a reasonable parameterisation of zooplankton feeding rates at this temporal and spatial scale 2 4 sensitivity analysis we conducted two sensitivity analyses first to assess the robustness of the model to our parameterisation of the abundances of the smallest zooplankton size classes we conducted a sensitivity analysis of the total biomass of the zooplankton community when pi was varied by 50 from chosen values second to assess the sensitivity of fish community biomass to the composition of the zooplankton we calculated the change in total fish biomass when each of the zooplankton functional groups excluding flagellates and ciliates were removed individually as part of this second analysis we also assessed the sensitivity of total fish biomass when zooplankton were represented as a single functional group with a fixed ppmr of 1000 kiørboe 2008 ward et al 2012 a carbon content of 10 pauly and christensen 1995 and a feeding kernel width of 1 3 andersen et al 2016b 3 results 3 1 model assessment 3 1 1 global zooplankton biomass there is reasonable agreement in the spatial pattern between the global zooplankton biomass map from zoomss and that from the strömberg and empirical models with correlation coefficients of 0 85 and 0 9 respectively and rmses of 0 88 and 0 86 respectively fig 5 zoomss captures the global scale patterns of total zooplankton biomass showing lowest levels of biomass in the oligotrophic ocean gyres and highest levels in upwelling regions and coastal shelves the distribution of global biomass in zoomss and the strömberg and empirical models is similar to that of satellite derived chlorophyll a at this scale when comparing values from the zoomss model global biomass with the strömberg model two data groups are evident fig 5c one above the line of best fit which mainly contains grid cells in zoomss in coastal and upwelling where zooplankton biomass is high and one below the line of best fit which has grid cells from oligotrophic regions where zooplankton biomass is low at this scale this variation between the biomass in zoomss and the strömberg model could be caused by the difference in underlying environmental drivers from the strömberg study which uses net primary production to drive zooplankton biomass and our study which uses chlorophyll a concentration or from differences in the structure of the two models in the comparison between the biomass from zoomss and the empirical model there were no similar groups obvious fig 5e in terms of absolute zooplankton biomass the biomass ranges in zoomss 3 300 mg c m 3 is generally higher than from the strömberg model 0 5 30 mg c m 3 fig 5b the strömberg zooplankton biomass is calculated from a simple trophic model where the total zooplankton biomass depends on the trophic transfer efficiency between phytoplankton and zooplankton and tuned to a relatively small dataset on zooplankton biomass n 4843 it appears that the zooplankton biomass estimates from zoomss are shifted vertically from the strömberg model evident in the relative position of the 1 1 line fig 5c by contrast the biomass range in zoomss 3 300 mg c m 3 is fairly close to that from the empirical model 50 300 mg c m 3 based on a much larger global dataset of biomass measurements n 196 707 than that of strömberg et al 2009 on the other hand because the minimum values in zoomss are much lower 3 mg c m 3 than from the empirical model 70 mg c m 3 zoomss might underestimate zooplankton biomass when zooplankton biomass is low i e in low chlorophyll a areas overall the large correlations and rmses between the pattern of global zooplankton biomass in zoomss and the strömberg and empirical models and the fact that zoomss absolute biomass range falls within estimates from the two models based on data is evidence that the model produces reasonable estimates of the distribution of global zooplankton biomass 3 1 2 global zooplankton functional group abundances the numerical model shows good agreement with the spatial pattern of abundance from the statistical models indicating that zoomss is capturing the broad patterns of zooplankton community composition fig 6 correlations were positive for six of the seven groups the best performing groups were jellyfish omnivorous copepods and euphausiids r 0 91 0 82 and 0 79 respectively followed by chaetognaths carnivorous copepods and larvaceans r 0 39 0 29 and 0 25 respectively salps were the only group that showed a negative correlation with zoomss this could be due to limitations in the statistical model rather than zoomss as we had fewer data than the other groups and the available data was clustered around australia and the southern ocean see figure a5 in supplementary information for all groups zoomss predicted that abundance increases with chlorophyll a concentration with highest abundances in coastal and upwelling grid cells and lowest abundances in oligotrophic open ocean grid cells where chlorophyll a is lowest the effect of temperature was secondary to chlorophyll a in zoomss and so emergent abundance distributions agree well with empirical distributions when empirical abundance is strongly driven by chlorophyll a such as for omnivorous copepods euphausiids and jellyfish however when a group s empirical distribution was strongly driven by temperature the model s distribution was poorly correlated or even negatively correlated in the case of salps although the model was generally able to capture patterns in the empirical distributions of abundance the reported absolute abundances from the model were much greater than those from the statistical models with the exception of jellyfish the root mean square errors rmse between abundances from zoomss and the statistical maps were all greater than 2 indicating that the average difference between the absolute abundances from zoomss and the statistical models was more than 2 orders of magnitude for jellyfish the rmse was 0 53 indicating over a three fold difference between the model jellyfish abundances and those reported from the statistical model 3 1 3 zooplankton growth the model s mass specific growth rates agree well with observed rates from hirst et al 2003 and kiørboe and hirst 2014 fig 7 for all groups modelled growth rates fell within the range of observed growth rates and with the exception of large flagellates fig 7a model growth rates do not exceed the empirical data for any functional group however modelled growth rates for ciliates larvaceans and jellyfish are slower than most of the empirical observations for those groups fig 7a b d these results indicate that overall our model is not overestimating growth rates and resulting energy flow through the zooplankton to higher trophic levels there were some differences between the scaling of growth and body size between the model and empirical observations with the exception of salps and larvaceans modelled growth rates decline less with body mass than observations do moreover changes in modelled growth rates with body size are linear for the model zooplankton groups with the exception of the carnivorous zooplankton which are more variable fig 7d 3 2 sensitivity analyses 3 2 1 model sensitivity to boundary conditions for each group zooplankton model biomass was robust to changes in the boundary conditions of all zooplankton groups total zooplankton biomass was altered by less than the change in pi for all of the zooplankton groups with total zooplankton biomass varying 15 for flagellates ciliates chaetognaths salps euphausiids and jellyfish and by 40 for all groups table 4 the median change in total zooplankton biomass was 5 when pi was changed by 50 for all groups with the exception of omnivorous copepods which saw a median increase of 12 in total zooplankton biomass when that group s pi was increased by 50 3 2 2 sensitivity of fish biomass to different zooplankton groups across the global ocean total fish biomass was sensitive to the presence of different zooplankton groups fig 8 removing omnivorous copepods or euphausiids caused declines of up to 80 in total fish biomass with median global declines of 59 3 for omnivorous copepods and 46 5 for euphausiids fig 8b e when larvaceans were removed fish biomass declined by up to 50 however the median global decline in the absence of larvaceans was limited to 4 5 as the regions that had declines in fish biomass were balanced by the 50 of grid squares that had little change or a slight increase in fish biomass fig 8a removing carnivorous copepods saw the greatest median increase in global fish biomass of 18 5 with some grid squares recording increases in fish biomass of over 70 fig 8c the removal of chaetognaths salps and jellyfish caused changes in total fish biomass across the global ocean of over 25 fig 8d f g however for each of these three groups there was little change in total fish biomass for at least 35 of the global ocean when they were removed and the global median change in fish biomass was at most 1 4 discussion here we described the zooplankton model of size spectra version 2 zoomss the first functional size spectrum model of the global marine ecosystem that includes the body size carbon content and size based feeding characteristics of nine major zooplankton groups the model requires only sea surface temperature and chlorophyll a concentration as inputs and the spatial variation of the zooplankton community biomass and structure emerges based on the functional traits of the zooplankton groups our model strongly suggests that zooplankton play a key role in regulating the biomass of fish in the ocean and demonstrates how various zooplankton groups support energy transfer to higher trophic levels the ability of zoomss to reproduce empirically derived spatial patterns of global zooplankton biomass and abundance as well as growth rates gives confidence that the model provides a reasonable framework for further exploration of the role of zooplankton in the ocean 4 1 importance of resolving zooplankton groups for higher trophic levels accounting for functional diversity in marine models is important to better understand the unique role of zooplankton in mediating energy from phytoplankton to fish across the global ocean mitra et al 2014 in current global marine models focussed on higher trophic levels the functional diversity of zooplankton is typically ignored with zooplankton usually grouped together with phytoplankton as a single resource for small fish e g blanchard et al 2009 2012 law et al 2009 datta et al 2010 or taken as external inputs from nutrient phytoplankton zooplankton detritus models e g maury 2010 christensen et al 2015 petrik et al 2019 in marine models focussed on lower trophic levels more progress has been made in resolving the functional traits of different plankton groups e g ward et al 2012 2014 prowe et al 2018 however these models do not resolve higher trophic levels such as fish because they are not built to assess the unique and dynamic role of zooplankton in mediating energy from phytoplankton to higher trophic levels by resolving the functional traits of nine major zooplankton groups our model has the unique ability to explore the impact of shifts in the phytoplankton and zooplankton community on higher trophic levels across global environmental gradients our results from the sensitivity analysis where we removed each zooplankton group one at a time indicate that not all zooplankton groups are equal and that their role in mediating energy from phytoplankton to higher trophic levels depends on their body size carbon content and size based feeding behaviour when omnivorous zooplankton omnivorous copepods and euphausiids were removed from the model it reduced fish biomass by up to 80 omnivorous zooplankton are thus important for promoting fish biomass a likely consequence of their high ppmr wide range of body sizes and high carbon content which means they efficiently transfer carbon to higher trophic levels by contrast when carnivorous zooplankton carnivorous copepods chaetognaths and jellyfish were removed from the model it increased fish biomass by up to 20 carnivorous zooplankton thus reduce fish biomass a likely effect of their very low ppmr and diet of other zooplankton which cause longer and more inefficient food chains where these groups dominate when filter feeding zooplankton larvaceans and salps were removed from the model there were small declines by up to 5 in fish biomass larvaceans and salps share similar body size ranges with omnivorous copepods and euphausiids but have much larger predator prey mass ratios meaning they can also access picophytoplankton for food these groups are a direct energy pathway from picophytoplankton to higher trophic levels and so could be important for the productivity and efficiency of oligotrophic waters where picophytoplankton dominate brewin et al 2010 on the other hand these groups are gelatinous meaning they are a less nutritious energy source for higher trophic levels and is part of the reason why median global fish biomass did not decline as much when these groups were removed from our model compared to omnivorous copepods and euphausiids increasing functional complexity in models is important for improving our understanding of key ecosystem processes in the marine environment for instance trait diversity in phytoplankton has a key role in ocean biogeochemistry fuhrman 2009 productivity chen et al 2019 and carbon export guidi et al 2009 and there are a growing number of models that demonstrate the importance of trait diversity in structuring the phytoplankton community across environmental gradients acevedo trejos et al 2015 2018 basu and mackey 2018 dutkiewicz et al 2019 similarly we have shown here that resolving zooplankton functional complexity is important to better understand how ecosystem efficiency is affected by shifts in phytoplankton community structure from oligotrophic ocean gyres to eutrophic coastal and upwelling systems hansen et al 1994 boyce et al 2015 4 2 model evaluation to evaluate the performance of zoomss we focussed on comparing emergent properties of the model s zooplankton with empirical observations of total zooplankton biomass across the global ocean as well as the distributions of abundance for seven of the zooplankton groups and empirical growth rates for all zooplankton groups across the three approaches the model performed well reproducing the global distribution of zooplankton biomass and most of the zooplankton functional group abundances as well as producing growth rates that were within the range of empirical observation for all zooplankton groups the global distribution of total zooplankton biomass from zoomss was strongly correlated with the empirical estimate from strömberg et al 2009 our estimate from the copepod database see supplementary information and also agrees with other model predictions of the distribution of zooplankton and fish biomass jennings et al 2008 ward et al 2012 harfoot et al 2014 petrik et al 2019 what is more total zooplankton biomass from zoomss falls within the range of the two empirical estimates the emergent distributions of abundance for six of the seven zooplankton groups that were assessed had a positive correlation with distributions that were derived from data however there was a difference in the ranges of absolute zooplankton biomass and abundance between the model and the empirical estimates with zoomss projecting higher abundances than the empirical estimates this would be explained first by the fact that parameters for zoomss were selected from the literature and were not tuned to estimates of abundance and biomass from the sample data moreover there is a significant difference between sample data used to derive the empirical distributions and how biomass and abundance are calculated from the zoomss the empirical models were constructed using sample data taken with dozens of different gears and mesh sizes over the past 60 years however there are many mesh sizes and gear types not suitable to capture smaller zooplankton biasing sampled abundances and biomass to larger zooplankton everett et al 2017 at the same time large zooplankton can actively avoid sample nets and avoid detection thus leading to samples that underestimate the number of large zooplankton richardson et al 2006 this means that the samples and therefore the distributions predicted by the empirical models are only capturing a fraction of the actual total zooplankton by contrast biomass and abundance from zoomss was obtained by summing all zooplankton this means we are counting 100 of the zooplankton from the size spectrum model while the sampled distributions from the empirical models only capture some fraction of total zooplankton mass specific growth rates from zoomss agreed well with observed rates from hirst et al 2003 and kiørboe and hirst 2013 however there were two main discrepancies the first is that for zooplankton groups other than salps and larvaceans modelled growth rates decline less with body size compared to observations the reason for this discrepancy could be in the difference between how growth rates are calculated for salps and larvaceans and the rest of the zooplankton groups the prey size range for salps and larvaceans is fixed no matter the predator body size meaning that growth rates for these groups scale with body size based on search volume only which has a mass specific scaling that is less than zero by contrast the other zooplankton groups have prey size ranges that shift with increasing predator size prey get larger as predators get larger and this could be offsetting the lower search rate for larger predators as well as the lower abundance of larger prey the second discrepancy was that for carnivorous groups the model had non linear variation in growth rates with body size that was not evident in the empirical data this variation in specific growth rates with body size for carnivores is caused by the variability in the density of their prey microzooplankton filter feeders and omnivorous zooplankton all primarily eat phytoplankton which is modelled as a static resource across time and body size so their growth rates are largely driven by predator search volume and size selectivity not variability in their prey however carnivorous zooplankton only eat other zooplankton which have varying abundance with time and body size so variation in their growth rates is caused not only by search volume and size selectivity but also by changes in their prey through time 4 3 caveats and next steps 4 3 1 spatial and temporal dynamics the spatial and temporal resolution of zoomss means that the model is designed to explore steady state conditions of the marine ecosystem across global environmental gradients for this reason we focused on traits such as body size predator prey mass ratio and carbon content because at this spatial and temporal scale these traits are important for how energy moves through the marine food web hansen et al 1994 jennings et al 2001 woodward et al 2005 andersen et al 2016a mcconville et al 2017 however this also means that we have made simplifying assumptions about dynamic processes such as reproduction and movement this is in contrast to other fish focussed global models which although they resolve zooplankton simplistically do resolve explicit reproduction blanchard et al 2011 carozza et al 2016 petrik et al 2019 or movement cheung et al 2011 maury 2010 by fixing abundances of the smallest size classes for all functional groups we assume constant recruitment which means we are not explicitly resolving reproduction this could have a stabilising effect on the dynamics of the model and our sensitivity analysis of total zooplankton biomass to changes in the boundary conditions of each zooplankton group indicates that our results are reasonably robust to the implicit parameterisation of reproduction as constant recruitment zooplankton reproductive strategies are extremely complex however a first step toward resolving reproduction in the zooplankton would be to follow the formulation of the community size spectrum model framework andersen et al 2016b where reproductive complexity is ignored for each functional group recruitment could then be represented as a fraction of assimilated energy flowing from mature size classes to the smallest size class for that group finally the spatial resolution of our model 5 is coarser than other global marine ecosystem models which tend to use a 1 resolution tittensor et al 2018 we use a 5 resolution because it allowed us to run the model quickly while still being able to assess the emergent patterns of zooplankton biomass and abundance across the global ocean similar to most global fish focused models run with a 1 or less resolution but see maury 2010 each 5 grid cell is run independently which means we do not take into account the movement of plankton or fish between adjacent grid squares this could introduce a possible bias due to movement of plankton by currents in some regions or apex predators by active transport which in the real world could cause discrepancies between plankton and fish abundance in certain areas however given the coarse resolution of our model output we expect this to have a minor impact since most zooplankton are short lived less than a few weeks and are unlikely to move outside of the large grid cells over their lifespan further we have not included fish species in the model but only used three broad size based groups to represent all epipelagic fish which precludes a good understanding of how fish might move amongst grid cells during large scale movements and seasonal migrations the 5 cells also mean that many fish would remain within a single grid cell during their life particularly for the small and medium fish communities in future models passive movement by currents and active movement due to behaviour of fish could be implemented using existing advection and diffusion algorithms maury 2010 castle et al 2011 watson et al 2014 4 3 2 phytoplankton production and dynamics similar to existing global marine ecosystem models blanchard et al 2009 maury 2010 christensen et al 2015 jennings and collingridge 2015 carozza et al 2016 petrik et al 2019 zoomss does not incorporate phytoplankton dynamics instead representing primary producers as a static abundance spectrum with slope intercept and maximum size determined by annual average chlorophyll a concentration satellite chlorophyll a represents in situ phytoplankton biomass and so in a sense implicitly incorporates the processes of nutrient cycling and predation on the phytoplankton moreover since zoomss was able to reproduce global zooplankton biomass and growth rates in the range of empirical estimates we believe a static resource for zooplankton that does not explicitly resolve phytoplankton dynamics and nutrient cycling in each grid cell is a reasonable compromise between realism and model complexity at this stage looking forward resolving phytoplankton dynamics and the feedbacks between phytoplankton and zooplankton is critical to better resolving zooplankton in marine ecosystem models in any region primary production sets the limits to growth for higher trophic levels limited primary production also induces competition amongst zooplankton competing for a finite resource this competition would have implications for the stability of different zooplankton groups from oligotrophic to eutrophic regions that are not resolved in the current model in any region primary production depends on nutrient supply in coastal and upwelling regions a high supply of new nutrients from ocean mixing sustain productive systems while in the open ocean nutrient recycling from zooplankton back to phytoplankton through the microbial loop plays a key role in nutrient supply for primary production azam et al 1983 finally seasonal cycles of boom and bust in the phytoplankton is a major driver of variation of zooplankton reproduction as many zooplankton groups time their reproduction to coincide with phytoplankton blooms falkowski et al 1988 atkinson et al 1996 these linkages and feedbacks between nutrient cycles phytoplankton dynamics and zooplankton need to be considered if we wish to move beyond the current static representation of the plankton in this model processes of nutrient uptake growth and mortality are strongly size structured in the phytoplankton and these size based relationships have been used to resolve the dynamics of the phytoplankton over large spatial scales follows et al 2007 fuchs and franks 2010 ward et al 2012 2014 cuesta et al 2018 future model developments could focus on resolving the size structured functional traits of phytoplankton nutrient uptake growth and mortality or alternatively to shift from using unlimited phytoplankton biomass to limited primary production to fuel higher trophic levels 4 3 3 fitting the model to data emergent patterns of biomass and abundance from the model generally agree with empirical patterns and the zoomss model estimate of absolute global zooplankton biomass falls within the range of two empirical estimates however zoomss s absolute abundances are up to several orders of magnitude higher than empirical estimates part of this discrepancy is because the sample data used to fit empirical abundance estimates are obtained with methods that are not able to capture all zooplankton richardson et al 2006 whereas reported numbers from the model include all individuals across the entire size range of zooplankton however the magnitude of the difference between the model s abundance estimates and the empirical estimates highlights that the model s parameters were not tuned to sample data rather the functional traits incorporated into zoomss were parameterized using values from the literature this is in contrast to other global marine ecosystem models which calibrate their parameter values so that their reported values are in the range of empirical estimates christensen et al 2015 carozza et al 2017 for zooplankton that kind of calibration presents unique challenges given the homogeneity of sampling methods used to obtain empirical estimates of biomass and abundance however empirical maps of zooplankton abundance fit with sample data have been useful for constraining and assessing previous ecosystem model estimates everett et al 2017 which means that the statistical models developed here could also be useful to constrain zooplankton abundance in future iterations of zoomss in the meantime reported absolute abundances from this model should be read with these uncertainties in mind 4 3 4 temperature effects of sea surface temperature were incorporated in the model as a multiplier on growth mortality and diffusion terms with the same temperature scaling q10 used for all functional groups we made this assumption because despite studies elucidating temperature scaling for different zooplankton species hansen et al 1997 kiørboe and hirst 2014 we are unaware of any meta analyses for temperature dependence of different processes for the broader taxonomic groups we use here however this means that changes in chlorophyll a and the resulting shifts in the size structure of the phytoplankton community was the main driver of biomass and abundance for all zooplankton groups and so the model does not capture the unique temperature response of different functional groups this is highlighted in the contrast between the empirically derived abundance distributions and the emergent distributions from zoomss the emergent distributions of abundance from the model are driven by chlorophyll a with more zooplankton abundance in high chlorophyll a waters and less in oligotrophic waters emergent abundance distributions agree well with empirical distributions when empirical abundance is strongly driven by chlorophyll a however when a group s empirical distribution was more strongly affected by temperature the model s distribution was poorly correlated this highlights the pressing need for greater synthesis of the extensive experimental zooplankton data on the rate of life processes at different temperatures to inform modelling efforts 4 4 concluding remarks zoomss is the first functional size spectrum model of the global marine ecosystem to resolve the functional traits of multiple zooplankton functional groups using body size ranges size based feeding behaviour and carbon content of nine of the most abundant zooplankton groups zoomss is capable of replicating global patterns in total zooplankton biomass and abundance and resolving growth rates for different zooplankton groups by showing how unique zooplankton groups have different impacts on fish biomass across the ocean zoomss provides new insights into the role of different zooplankton in supporting higher trophic level biomass and is a first step towards better resolution of zooplankton in marine ecosystem models using the functional size spectrum framework in an era of environmental change and given the pivotal role zooplankton play in food webs improving the representation of zooplankton in ecosystem models will be critical to predict fisheries productivity and carbon cycling in the future ocean code availability zoomss was written in r version 3 5

24749,despite their critical role as the main energy pathway between phytoplankton and fish the functional complexity of zooplankton is typically poorly resolved in marine ecosystem models trait based approaches where zooplankton are represented with functional traits such as body size could help improve the resolution of zooplankton in marine ecosystem models and their role in trophic transfer and carbon sequestration here we present the zooplankton model of size spectra version 2 zoomssv2 a functional size spectrum model that resolves nine major zooplankton functional groups heterotrophic flagellates heterotrophic ciliates larvaceans omnivorous copepods carnivorous copepods chaetognaths euphausiids salps and jellyfish each group is represented by the functional traits of body size size based feeding characteristics and carbon content the model is run globally at 5 resolution to steady state using long term average temperature and chlorophyll a for each grid cell zooplankton community composition emerges based on the relative fitness of the different groups emergent steady state patterns of global zooplankton abundance biomass and growth rates agree well with empirical data and the model is robust to changes in the boundary conditions of the zooplankton we use the model to consider the role of the zooplankton groups in supporting higher trophic levels by exploring the sensitivity of steady state fish biomass to the removal of individual zooplankton groups across the global ocean our model shows zooplankton play a key role in supporting fish biomass in the global ocean for example the removal of euphausiids or omnivorous copepods caused fish biomass to decrease by up to 80 by contrast the removal of carnivorous copepods caused fish biomass to increase by up to 75 our results suggest that including zooplankton complexity in ecosystem models could be key to better understanding the distribution of fish biomass and trophic efficiency across the global ocean keywords zooplankton functional traits size spectrum model marine ecosystem modelling 1 introduction marine ecosystem models are valuable tools for understanding marine ecosystem function structure and productivity under global change however the marine ecosystem is complex and there remains a lack of unified understanding of key physiological and ecological processes tittensor et al 2018 modellers address this uncertainty by making assumptions about which ecosystem processes to represent in their models depending on their objectives a common assumption across higher trophic level modelling frameworks is to represent zooplankton the main grazers of phytoplankton and bacteria and prey of small fish very simply everett et al 2017 there are two common approaches to representing zooplankton in marine models focussed on higher trophic levels first phytoplankton and zooplankton dynamics are driven externally by nutrient phytoplankton zooplankton detritus models maury 2010 woodworth jefcoats et al 2013 christensen et al 2015 carozza et al 2016 petrik et al 2019 and then this is used to drive higher trophic levels in an ecosystem model second phytoplankton and small zooplankton are lumped together as a resource for the smallest fish size classes in size spectrum models blanchard et al 2009 2012 law et al 2009 datta et al 2010 scott et al 2014 zhang et al 2015 2016 these simple representations of zooplankton together with the similar lower trophic level structure amongst models precludes a deeper understanding of the role of zooplankton in ecosystem functioning even with a simple representation of zooplankton many modelling studies suggest that the productivity and structure of higher trophic levels are sensitive to the representation of lower trophic levels friedland et al 2012 jennings and collingridge 2015 heneghan et al 2016 dam and baumman 2017 mitra et al 2014 demonstrated that in a modelled plankton food web trophic dynamics were sensitive to small changes in parameterisation of zooplankton feeding rates similarly fuchs and franks 2010 found that zooplankton with large predator prey mass ratios ppmr i e a predator is a lot larger than its prey gave rise to a flatter plankton abundance size spectra relatively more large organisms in comparison to zooplankton with small ppmrs which led to a steeper plankton size spectra moving beyond the plankton jennings and collingridge 2015 demonstrated that the productivity and total biomass of the global fish community was highly sensitive to how energy moved through the lower planktonic trophic levels from phytoplankton to zooplankton and beyond one of the main reasons that modellers choose to simplify zooplankton is because of their tremendous taxonomic diversity especially at the phylum level a typical zooplankton sample might contain organisms from 10 phyla or more each with different body sizes biochemical compositions growth rates feeding preferences and reproductive modes hansen et al 1994 1997 kiørboe et al 2011 mconville et al 2017 while it is not possible to include thousands of common plankton species in ecosystem models an alternative is to model organisms based on traits such as body size modelling the marine ecosystem using body size instead of species identity is rooted in over 50 years of observations that show a remarkable consistency in the distributions of organism abundance or biomass against body size size spectra across a range of marine ecosystems blanchard et al 2017 for zooplankton body size is strongly related to trophic position andersen et al 2016a and the size based feeding behaviour of different zooplankton groups has been suggested to structure the community across environmental gradients mitra and davis 2010 barton et al 2013 owing to their body size zooplankton are the primary grazers of phytoplankton which span nine orders of magnitude in body size from picoplankton 0 2 2 μm equivalent spherical diameter esd 10 14 5 10 11 5 g wet weight to microplankton 20 μm esd 10 8 4 g wet weight for zooplankton other traits such as predator prey mass ratio ppmr and body composition are also important since these factors also play a role in organism fitness mcgill et al 2006 litchman et al 2013 andersen et al 2016a mcconville et al 2017 for instance phytoplankton size structure changes across environmental gradients agawin et al 2000 brewin et al 2010 barnes et al 2011 changes in the phytoplankton have implications for the structuring of the zooplankton community which in turn affects how energy from primary production is transported to higher trophic levels this is because zooplankton exhibit vast diversity in their feeding behaviour with ppmrs varying 7 orders of magnitude across different functional groups from 10 for carnivorous copepods to 108 for salps and larvaceans bone 1997 wirtz 2012 another functional trait that varies strongly across zooplankton groups is body composition and this can have substantial effects on energy transfer to higher trophic levels carbon is the primary structural component of zooplankton kiørboe 2013 and zooplankton vary widely in their carbon content between gelatinous groups with low carbon density and non gelatinous groups with high carbon density kiørboe 2013 mcconville et al 2017 thus a zooplankton community dominated by more gelatinous groups offers less nutritional value and growth potential for higher trophic levels moreover changes in carbon content affects the relative fitness of different zooplankton groups since critical physiological and competitive processes such as metabolism search rate and average growth efficiency scale with carbon across zooplankton groups acuña et al 2011 kiørboe 2011 kiørboe and hirst 2014 mcconville et al 2017 the diversity of traits in the zooplankton means that global ecosystem modellers must consider more than just their body size if they are to improve the realism of zooplankton in their models in the past 15 years trait based modelling approaches have been applied to explain the distribution of phytoplankton groups follows et al 2007 edwards et al 2013 acevedo trejos et al 2015 and there is a growing literature applying the approach separately to zooplankton fuchs and franks 2010 brun et al 2016 heneghan et al 2016 schnedler meyer et al 2016 prowe et al 2018 and fish communities stuart smith et al 2013 blanchard et al 2014 van denderen et al 2017 petrik et al 2019 however to our knowledge there are no global marine ecosystem models resolving both higher and lower trophic levels that incorporate the diversity of traits in the zooplankton recently blanchard et al 2017 proposed unifying size spectrum ecosystem modelling which only resolves the body size distribution of organisms with trait based modelling in a new functional size spectrum framework this framework allows modellers to take advantage of the powerful role of body size in structuring the marine ecosystem as well as other functional traits that are important and offers a promising way forward for resolving the functional complexity of the zooplankton within a model of the entire marine ecosystem this is the approach we adopt here using functional traits such as body size and ppmr to resolve the diversity of the zooplankton in marine ecosystem models is not a new idea twenty five years ago hansen et al 1994 hypothesised that with knowledge of the size selectivity e g ppmr of different zooplankton groups it would be possible to construct a simple size based model of the pelagic food web more recently zooplankton feeding traits such as ppmr were incorporated in a functional size spectrum model heneghan et al 2016 which showed that fish biomass and ecosystem stability were sensitive to zooplankton feeding characteristics this model zooplankton model of size spectra zoomssv1 allowed a qualitative assessment of how zooplankton traits such as ppmr affected energy transfer from phytoplankton to fish and highlighted the significant implications of variations in zooplankton community traits for high trophic level biomass and ecosystem stability however it did not represent zooplankton community composition or food quality and so could not be used to explore how those factors might affect ecosystem structure and transfer efficiency in the global ocean here we follow the work of heneghan et al 2016 to present zoomssv2 referred to hereafter as zoomss the first functional size spectrum model of the marine ecosystem to resolve phytoplankton nine zooplankton functional groups heterotrophic flagellates and ciliates omnivorous and carnivorous copepods larvaceans euphausiids salps chaetognaths and jellyfish and three size based fish groups zooplankton functional groups are resolved using their body size ranges size based feeding characteristics and carbon content the model is run to steady state and the modelled zooplankton community emerges across global environmental gradients depending on the functional traits of the different groups the model is not fit to observational data rather parameter values for the model s functional trait are obtained from experimental results in the literature and the model s ability to reproduce observed patterns in zooplankton biomass abundance and growth is assessed the model is generally able to reproduce steady state global patterns of zooplankton biomass and abundance as well as empirical growth rates from flagellates to jellyfish what is more model output is robust to uncertainties in the boundary conditions of the smallest size class of each group by resolving zooplankton functional diversity the model allows us for the first time to examine the unique roles of different zooplankton groups in supporting higher trophic level biomass across the global ocean we finish by exploring the change in global fish biomass when different zooplankton groups are removed from the model as well as the change in biomass when the zooplankton are represented simplistically as a single functional group 2 methods we developed the zooplankton model of size spectra version 2 zoomss based on the prototype of heneghan et al 2016 zoomss uses the functional size spectrum framework blanchard et al 2017 to resolve the body size ranges size based feeding characteristics and carbon content of nine zooplankton groups and three fish groups parameter values for the functional traits are not fit to data here but are determined using published estimates available in the literature table 2 the model is run to steady state on 5 grid squares across the global ocean fig 1 for each region the model is forced with the long term mean satellite sea surface temperature and chlorophyll a from modis aqua scripts to run the model as well as global forcings for sea surface temperature and chlorophyll a are available for download at https github com mathmarecol zoopmodelsizespectra 2 1 zooplankton model of size spectra version 2 zoomss zoomss represents the marine ecosystem as three communities phytoplankton zooplankton and fish the zooplankton community consists of nine of the most abundant zooplankton groups and the fish community is made up of a small medium and large group fig 1 table 1 3 dynamics of the phytoplankton are not explicitly resolved in the model rather the size structure of the phytoplankton community is estimated directly from satellite chlorophyll a observations brewin et al 2010 barnes et al 2011 hirata et al 2011 abundances of the zooplankton and fish communities are driven by size dependant processes of growth and mortality and the abundances of each functional group governed by separate second order mckendrick von foerster equations e1 t n i w t w g i w t n i w t μ i w t n i w t 1 2 2 w 2 d i w t n i w t the density of individuals in group i of weight w at time t per m3 is given by ni w t individual processes in group i are given by growth gi w t mortality μi w t and diffusion rates di w t fig 2 we use the mckendrick von foerster equation to govern zooplankton and fish communities because it is a popular choice for modelling fish focused size spectrum models and it is similar to governing equations in plankton focused size based models baird and suthers 2007 fuchs and franks 2010 zhou et al 2010 ward et al 2012 cuesta et al 2018 looking ahead this means that future model developments that resolve the dynamics of the phytoplankton or more of the functional diversity of the zooplankton could be achieved with the same or similar governing equation used here from the perspective of a predator from group i the feeding rate f g yr 1 on prey group j depends on the search rate of group vi w m3 yr 1 e13 and the density of suitable prey g yr 1 e2 f i j w t v i w w p w ϕ i w w n j w t w d w where ϕi w w e11 table 1 all subsequent equations are also found in table 1 is the probability a predator of size w would consume an individual of size w and wp is the minimum size of phytoplankton the smallest body size in the system the growth rate of a predator from group i of size w at time t is fuelled by the consumption and conversion of prey biomass to new biomass g yr 1 e3 g i w t τ j e i j f i j w t where eij is the growth conversion efficiency for predators of group i eating prey from group j e14a b and τ is the effect of temperature on ingestion for group i e4 a drawback of the type 1 functional response used here for feeding is that it ignores the effect of satiation at high food densities this means that maximum growth rates of zooplankton and fish groups could be unrealistically fast in areas with high food availability i e high chlorophyll a concentration however the effect of fast growth rates would be similar across all functional groups and so would not affect their relative fitness further we will compare modelled growth rates at high chlorophyll concentrations with empirical data to assess whether the model s growth rates are reasonable the choice of functional response not only affect feeding rates at high or low food concentrations but can also lead to different temporal dynamics between predators and prey gentleman and neuheimer 2008 however our focus here is on long term steady state patterns in the composition of the global zooplankton community and not on the dynamics of the different groups through time nevertheless ecosystem dynamics have a real impact on marine ecosystems particularly for zooplankton which face seasonal fluctuations in prey abundance from phytoplankton blooms and busts the representation of zooplankton functional response will therefore be an important consideration for any future work exploring the temporal dynamics of the marine ecosystem across environmental gradients temperature effects are represented using a q 10 temperature coefficient e4 τ q 10 k k ref 10 where k and k ref are the temperatures in kelvin of each 5 grid square and the reference temperature where τ 1 respectively from the perspective of prey of size w the total mortality from predation by larger size classes μp w t yr 1 is given by e5 μ p w t τ j w w j ϕ j w w v j w n j w t d w where w j is the maximum size of a predator from group j since individuals grow over time an additional source of mortality from senescence was incorporated that increased with body size yr 1 e6 μ s i w t τ δ w w s i ρ where δ is the coefficient of senescence mortality ρ the exponent and w s i the body size after which senescence mortality rapidly increases for an individual from group i this senescence mortality term also acts as a closure term for the largest size classes by preventing a build up of large individuals who are not exposed to predation andersen et al 2016b for an individual of size w at time t from group i total mortality μi w t yr 1 is given by summing predation and senescence mortality yr 1 e7 μ i w t μ p w t μ s i w t finally the second order diffusion term for an individual from group i of size w at time t is g2 yr 1 e8 d i w t v i w j τ e i j 2 w p w w 2 ϕ i w w n j w t d w we incorporate the diffusion term following the work of datta et al 2010 who demonstrated that stochastic variation in growth at the individual level something that the more commonly used first order mckendrick von foerster equation does not consider can be approximated at the functional group level by adding a diffusion term to the first order mckendrick von foerster equation incorporating a diffusion term means that the model incorporates both the advection of biomass from smaller to larger size classes through the processes of predation and growth gi w t e3 but also includes an approximation of the variability in the growth rates of each community from the stochastic variation in individual level growth rates through time di w t e8 as well as increasing model realism by approximating the functional group level effects of individual level variability datta et al 2011 demonstrated that the diffusion term improves the stability of the numerical approximation of real world predator prey interactions and individual growth trajectories in the presence of large destabilising predator prey mass ratios which have been shown to cause the community size spectra to develop travelling wave attractors law et al 2009 zhang et al 2013 heneghan et al 2016 this is especially important here given our model includes zooplankton predator prey mass ratios that are many orders of magnitude larger than predator prey size ratios used in fish focused size spectrum models that use the first order mckendrick von foerster equation see table 2 2 1 1 parameterizing the phytoplankton for each 5 region the density of phytoplankton np w of size w is given by e9 n p w a w b the slope a intercept b and maximum size of the static phytoplankton spectrum were derived from temporally and spatially averaged satellite chlorophyll a from modis aqua accessed via the giovanni portal https giovanni gsfc nasa gov giovanni using the synoptic model developed by brewin et al 2015 the brewin model gives an estimate of the percentage contribution of 3 phytoplankton size classes pico 0 2 2 μm esd nano 2 20 μm esd and microphytoplankton 20 μm esd to the total chlorophyll a concentration mg m 3 yr 1 picophytoplankton constitute up to 75 of the biomass in low chlorophyll a oligotrophic waters declining to 10 in high chlorophyll a eutrophic waters as micro phytoplankton increase from 10 in oligotrophic waters to 75 in eutrophic waters and nano phytoplankton increase from 20 in oligotrophic to 45 in mid chlorophyll a waters before declining to 15 in eutrophic waters fig 3 a the contribution of microphytoplankton and the maximum size of phytoplankton both increase with chlorophyll a concentration brewin et al 2010 hirata et al 2011 barnes et al 2011 we incorporated this change in the size range of the microphytoplankton with increasing chlorophyll a by linearly increasing its maximum size from 21 to 60 μm esd depending on the percentage contribution of the microphytoplankton group to total chlorophyll a we used 60 μm as the maximum esd for the phytoplankton following barnes et al s 2011 finding that 90 of phytoplankton are smaller than 55 65 μm across polar tropical and upwelling environments total chlorophyll a concentration for each of the 3 size classes was converted to grams wet weight assuming 1 g chlorophyll a 50 g c zhou et al 2010 and 1 g c 10 g wet weight hansen et al 1994 boudreau and dickie 1992 woodworth jefcoats et al 2013 and the three size ranges were also converted from esd to grams wet weight assuming 1 cm3 1 g wet weight boudreau and dickie 1992 finally slope and intercept were found analytically with e8 see supplementary material a1 phytoplankton slopes we derived ranged from 1 2 to 0 77 across the global ocean fig 3b which is similar to the range reported by previous empirical studies huete ortega et al 2012 marañón 2015 moreno ostos et al 2015 we use satellite chlorophyll a observations to drive the abundance and structure of the phytoplankton community in each grid cell observed chlorophyll a is an estimate of the surface phytoplankton biomass in a region given the processes of predation and nutrient cycling and regeneration thus by using observed satellite chlorophyll a our model is implicitly incorporating these important processes in the phytoplankton which is sufficient for our present objective of resolving steady state patterns of zooplankton biomass and composition across the global ocean given in situ phytoplankton biomass in global marine ecosystem models it is common practice to use satellite or earth system model estimates of phytoplankton biomass blanchard et al 2009 maury 2010 christensen et al 2015 petrik et al 2019 or primary production gascuel and pauly 2009 carozza et al 2016 jennings and collingridge 2015 as inputs to drive higher trophic level processes without feedback from predation or nutrient cycling we chose to use phytoplankton biomass calculated with chlorophyll a over primary production here because it is the most common measure of food for zooplankton richardson and verheye 1999 hirst and bunker 2003 2 1 2 incorporating functional traits we could parameterise many of the functional traits and key processes for different zooplankton groups because of the extensive experimental work carried out on zooplankton see table 2 2 1 2 1 body size and predator prey mass ratio for each zooplankton group we established body size ranges in wet weight using measurements and conversion equations from the literature see table 2 prey preference for predators of a certain size was represented using the ratio of a predator s body size to its preferred prey body size ppmr rather than specifying diet preferences table 2 fig 4 across zooplankton taxa ppmr increases with predator size due to the non isometric scaling of feeding related apparatus with body size wirtz 2012 we used the mechanistic formulation from wirtz 2012 to calculate the ppmr range for each zooplankton group except for salps and larvaceans wirtz 2012 links ppmr to a quantitative measure of the feeding mode raptorial active feeding is linked to a lower ppmr because predators eat prey closer to their own size by contrast passive suspension feeding yields a higher ppmr the ppmr of an individual from group i of size w βi w is given by e10 β i w exp 0 02 ln d w 2 m 1 832 3 where dw is an individual of size w s equivalent spherical diameter in μm and m is the quantitative measure of feeding mode a large positive m value is linked to a more carnivorous feeding strategy with a lower ppmr by contrast a large negative m value is associated with a larger ppmr and a filter feeding strategy of prey capture for filter feeders such as salps and larvaceans we follow wirtz s formulation that ppmr increases with body size but we assume that their filter mesh does not increase with body size this means that for salps and larvaceans individuals will capture the same size prey no matter their own size see bone et al 2003 in keeping with previous studies the ppmr for the fish communities was held constant at 100 across their size ranges blanchard et al 2009 hartvig et al 2011 rochet et al 2012 andersen et al 2016b the relatively small body sizes and high ppmrs of salps larvaceans and omnivorous copepods means that these groups feed exclusively on phytoplankton heterotrophic flagellates and heterotrophic ciliates fig 4 euphausiids also have high a ppmr range but their larger size means that their largest size classes can also access smaller copepods larvaceans and euphausiids consistent with their omnivorous diet in the oceans schmidt and atkinson 2016 the low ppmr ranges of carnivorous copepods chaetognaths and jellyfish coupled with their larger body size means that these groups are almost totally carnivorous we further restricted their diets so that they do not feed on phytoplankton at all which is consistent with most current understandings of their diets terazaki 2000 purcell and arai 2001 2 1 2 2 prey size selectivity the range of available prey sizes for an individual predator of body size w from group i is defined by a log normal feeding kernel this feeding kernel is centred on the predator s preferred predator prey mass ratio ppmr βi w with a standard deviation σi given by the kernel width parameter for that predator s group table 2 e11 ϕ i w w exp ln β i w w w 2 2 σ i 2 σ i 2 π a wider feeding kernel means a predator can feed over a larger prey size range for zooplankton feeding kernel width is positively correlated with ppmr hansen et al 1994 fuchs and franks 2010 kiørboe 2016 filter feeders such as larvaceans or salps with a large mean ppmr feed over a wider size range than carnivorous copepods or heterotopic flagellates with a smaller ppmr we used the empirical model developed by fuchs and franks 2010 to link the feeding kernel width of each zooplankton group σi to that group s mean ppmr β i e12 σ i 0 05 lo g 10 β i 0 33 the feeding kernel widths for the fish communities were held constant at 1 3 in keeping with previous studies andersen et al 2016b 2 1 2 3 growth conversion efficiency and carbon content previous size spectrum models have focused on fish and used a currency solely of wet mass rather than considering carbon largely because fish groups vary little in their carbon content however as zoomss resolves nine zooplankton prey groups and the carbon content of zooplankton varies by more than an order of magnitude amongst common zooplankton groups e g jellyfish 0 5 and copepods 12 we have included carbon content as a measure of food quality as straile 1997 found that mean growth conversion efficiency as a measure of prey carbon converted to predator carbon was 0 25 across a large range of zooplankton taxa we consider that prey groups with a comparatively higher carbon content e g copepods euphausiids contribute more to the wet weight growth of a predator compared with lower carbon more gelatinous groups such as jellyfish spitz et al 2010 kiørboe 2013 mitra et al 2014 in terms of wet weight the growth conversion efficiency of a predator of group i eij feeding on prey from group j prey is e14a e i j 2 5 c j where cj is the carbon wet weight ratio of group j table 2 as gelatinous filter feeders salps and larvaceans are the fastest growing metazoans and have growth rates an order of magnitude faster than other zooplankton of the same size hirst et al 2003 we included this in the model by modifying e14a for these groups e14b e i j 0 25 c j c i so that the growth conversion efficiency of predators that are salps and larvaceans is also related to their carbon content ci this means that these groups increase their wet weight by 5 10 more than other zooplankton of the same size when consuming a given prey for example according to e13a a copepod consuming heterotrophic flagellates that have a carbon wet weight ratio of 0 15 would have a gross growth efficiency of 0 375 but according to e13b a larvacean consuming the same flagellate would have a gross growth efficiency of 1 875 however as a corresponding trade off we made the assumption that for salps and larvaceans the additional wet weight in excess of what other zooplankton would gain is converted to detritus not into new biomass this is based on their unique physiology larvaceans grow and shed mucus houses multiple times each day bone 1997 and salps produce large faecal pellets that contribute disproportionately to carbon flux compared with other zooplankton henschke et al 2016 in the current implementation of the model we consider the faecal pellets and mucus houses to be detritus and lost from the system future versions of zoomss will track the detritus through the food web 2 2 numerical implementation of zoomss 2 2 1 boundary conditions for the size spectrum model we do not explicitly resolve reproduction for any zooplankton or fish group which affects how the boundary conditions of the smallest size class of each functional group is parameterised although reproduction in fish is a relatively simple process of production of eggs of roughly the same size 1 mg and being sexually fertilised neuheimer et al 2015 reproduction in the zooplankton is much more diverse from alternating generations of sexual and asexual reproduction in salps and jellyfish fautin 2002 daponte et al 2013 to the hermaphroditism of chaetognaths bone 1991 and intersexuality in copepods gusmão and mckinnon 2009 therefore for simplicity we assume constant recruitment for each zooplankton and fish group which keeps the abundance of their smallest size classes fixed at a proportion of the total abundance in those size classes from other groups for each zooplankton group the abundance of the smallest size class at time t ni wi t was fixed with respect to the total abundance of the other groups j in that size class e15 n i w i t p i j i n j w i t where pi is the relative abundance of group i in size class wi with respect to the total abundance of all other groups for the smallest zooplankton group heterotrophic flagellates the abundance of their smallest size class was fixed to be 10 of the abundance of the phytoplankton community in the same size class in keeping with zoomsv1 the smallest size class abundance for the total fish community was fixed at the total zooplankton abundance in that size class divided equally amongst the three fish groups for all other zooplankton groups except for salps and jellyfish pi was fixed at 0 1 salps and jellyfish are the two largest zooplankton groups and pi was set at 0 01 to prevent these groups from dominating the biomass of the zooplankton community 2 2 2 running zoomss abundances of the zooplankton and fish groups were modelled with separate second order mckendrick von foerster equations which we solved numerically using a second order semi implicit upwind finite difference scheme press et al 2007 for numerical implementation we discretised the zooplankton and fish community size ranges into equal 0 1 log10 size intervals the model is initialised with the same zooplankton community in each 5 grid cell and integrated forward through time for 1000 years with a half weekly time step after experimenting with smaller and larger interval widths we chose these values to discretise the weight and time intervals to ensure convergence in our numerical implementation whilst minimising the time required to run the simulation large ppmrs and narrow feeding kernels have been shown to cause travelling waves across the spectrum through time datta et al 2011 heneghan et al 2016 with the very high ppmrs of some of the zooplankton groups represented here we found that our model settles into repeating cycles of travelling waves of abundance from small to large body sizes through time therefore we average the last 500 years of abundance biomass and growth rates to obtain the long term average results presented here 2 3 model assessment 2 3 1 assessing the emergent global distribution of total zooplankton biomass we use two different estimates of the global distribution of zooplankton biomass to assess our model estimates the first is from strömberg et al 2009 who created a global map of zooplankton carbon biomass based on a theoretical trophic transfer model driven by net primary production and tuned to 4843 estimates of carbon biomass the second global map is derived from all available zooplankton biomass estimates in the copepod database supplementary figure a3 n 196 707 as these estimates were measured and collected in different ways we used a generalized additive model with zooplankton biomass as the response and a suite of predictors to standardize for measurement type and collection methods and included satellite chlorophyll a and sea surface temperature as environmental predictors see supplementary information section a2 for more details because this statistical model was driven by data we called this approach the empirical model both approaches have strengths and weaknesses the strömberg model is based on theory and relatively few observations whereas the empirical model is based on many more observations but had to account for differences in sampling methods and types of biomass measurements 2 3 2 assessing emergent global distributions of zooplankton abundance the global distribution of each zooplankton functional group emerges from the model based on their relative fitness in the environmental conditions of each grid cell to assess the emergent distributions of the individual functional groups against global patterns of empirical abundance we used general linear models to model the relationship between in situ sample data and environmental variables and sample equipment similar to our comparison of the model s biomass with the model from strömberg et al 2009 we compared the emergent distributions of abundance from zoomss with the empirical distributions from the generalised linear models using pearson s correlation coefficient and the root mean square error to build the generalised linear models of zooplankton abundance we compiled zooplankton taxonomic data from multiple sources to create a database of 640 184 observations of zooplankton matching 7 of the taxonomic groups in zoomss see figure a5 in supplementary information for maps of data distribution these groups were euphausiids omnivorous copepods carnivorous copepods larvaceans chaetognaths salps and jellyfish the database was compiled from the copepod database o brien 2014 the continuous plankton recorder richardson et al 2006 the integrated marine observing system eriksen et al 2019 imos 2019 the jellyfish database initiative condon et al 2014 and the warreen data baird et al 2011 data that did not match the 7 groups were discarded and remaining data were quality controlled to remove samples with missing or incorrect metadata e g time date gps location gebco bathymetry and satellite derived sea surface temperature and chlorophyll a climatologies from modis aqua was matched to each sample using this database of seven zooplankton groups we compiled we generated a linear model in r v3 5 3 r core team 2019 for each zooplankton group to quantify global patterns and compare with zoomss the same initial model was used for all groups predictors used in the initial model were environmental variables sea surface temperature sst c chlorophyll a mg m 3 bathymetry m day of year days sample depth m hour of the day h mesh size µm and device type net or cpr natural splines using the splines package were fit to bathymetry and sst and a harmonic function was fitted to cyclical variables of day of year and hour of the day day of year was standardised to the northern hemisphere so the middle of summer was the same day of year in both hemispheres non significant predictors were removed and model residual plots were inspected after viewing residual plots we log transformed the response for each zooplankton group abundance and chlorophyll a to improve assumptions of homogeneity of variance and normality we tested a model using the gamma family with a log link however the models did not converge we do not have the original sample volumes for all the datasets so we were unable to use counts as the response and volume as an offset in the model figures of the final statistical models for each of the seven functional groups can be found in the supplementary material a3 supplementary figures a6 a12 2 3 3 assessing modelled zooplankton growth rates energy transfer through the zooplankton from phytoplankton to fish is driven by growth rates of the different zooplankton functional groups to assess whether the model produced realistic rates of energy transfer through the zooplankton groups we compared modelled growth rates with empirical rates from hirst et al 2003 and kiørboe and hirst 2014 evaluating growth rates in the model also allows us to assess whether a simple type 1 functional response is a reasonable parameterisation of zooplankton feeding rates at this temporal and spatial scale 2 4 sensitivity analysis we conducted two sensitivity analyses first to assess the robustness of the model to our parameterisation of the abundances of the smallest zooplankton size classes we conducted a sensitivity analysis of the total biomass of the zooplankton community when pi was varied by 50 from chosen values second to assess the sensitivity of fish community biomass to the composition of the zooplankton we calculated the change in total fish biomass when each of the zooplankton functional groups excluding flagellates and ciliates were removed individually as part of this second analysis we also assessed the sensitivity of total fish biomass when zooplankton were represented as a single functional group with a fixed ppmr of 1000 kiørboe 2008 ward et al 2012 a carbon content of 10 pauly and christensen 1995 and a feeding kernel width of 1 3 andersen et al 2016b 3 results 3 1 model assessment 3 1 1 global zooplankton biomass there is reasonable agreement in the spatial pattern between the global zooplankton biomass map from zoomss and that from the strömberg and empirical models with correlation coefficients of 0 85 and 0 9 respectively and rmses of 0 88 and 0 86 respectively fig 5 zoomss captures the global scale patterns of total zooplankton biomass showing lowest levels of biomass in the oligotrophic ocean gyres and highest levels in upwelling regions and coastal shelves the distribution of global biomass in zoomss and the strömberg and empirical models is similar to that of satellite derived chlorophyll a at this scale when comparing values from the zoomss model global biomass with the strömberg model two data groups are evident fig 5c one above the line of best fit which mainly contains grid cells in zoomss in coastal and upwelling where zooplankton biomass is high and one below the line of best fit which has grid cells from oligotrophic regions where zooplankton biomass is low at this scale this variation between the biomass in zoomss and the strömberg model could be caused by the difference in underlying environmental drivers from the strömberg study which uses net primary production to drive zooplankton biomass and our study which uses chlorophyll a concentration or from differences in the structure of the two models in the comparison between the biomass from zoomss and the empirical model there were no similar groups obvious fig 5e in terms of absolute zooplankton biomass the biomass ranges in zoomss 3 300 mg c m 3 is generally higher than from the strömberg model 0 5 30 mg c m 3 fig 5b the strömberg zooplankton biomass is calculated from a simple trophic model where the total zooplankton biomass depends on the trophic transfer efficiency between phytoplankton and zooplankton and tuned to a relatively small dataset on zooplankton biomass n 4843 it appears that the zooplankton biomass estimates from zoomss are shifted vertically from the strömberg model evident in the relative position of the 1 1 line fig 5c by contrast the biomass range in zoomss 3 300 mg c m 3 is fairly close to that from the empirical model 50 300 mg c m 3 based on a much larger global dataset of biomass measurements n 196 707 than that of strömberg et al 2009 on the other hand because the minimum values in zoomss are much lower 3 mg c m 3 than from the empirical model 70 mg c m 3 zoomss might underestimate zooplankton biomass when zooplankton biomass is low i e in low chlorophyll a areas overall the large correlations and rmses between the pattern of global zooplankton biomass in zoomss and the strömberg and empirical models and the fact that zoomss absolute biomass range falls within estimates from the two models based on data is evidence that the model produces reasonable estimates of the distribution of global zooplankton biomass 3 1 2 global zooplankton functional group abundances the numerical model shows good agreement with the spatial pattern of abundance from the statistical models indicating that zoomss is capturing the broad patterns of zooplankton community composition fig 6 correlations were positive for six of the seven groups the best performing groups were jellyfish omnivorous copepods and euphausiids r 0 91 0 82 and 0 79 respectively followed by chaetognaths carnivorous copepods and larvaceans r 0 39 0 29 and 0 25 respectively salps were the only group that showed a negative correlation with zoomss this could be due to limitations in the statistical model rather than zoomss as we had fewer data than the other groups and the available data was clustered around australia and the southern ocean see figure a5 in supplementary information for all groups zoomss predicted that abundance increases with chlorophyll a concentration with highest abundances in coastal and upwelling grid cells and lowest abundances in oligotrophic open ocean grid cells where chlorophyll a is lowest the effect of temperature was secondary to chlorophyll a in zoomss and so emergent abundance distributions agree well with empirical distributions when empirical abundance is strongly driven by chlorophyll a such as for omnivorous copepods euphausiids and jellyfish however when a group s empirical distribution was strongly driven by temperature the model s distribution was poorly correlated or even negatively correlated in the case of salps although the model was generally able to capture patterns in the empirical distributions of abundance the reported absolute abundances from the model were much greater than those from the statistical models with the exception of jellyfish the root mean square errors rmse between abundances from zoomss and the statistical maps were all greater than 2 indicating that the average difference between the absolute abundances from zoomss and the statistical models was more than 2 orders of magnitude for jellyfish the rmse was 0 53 indicating over a three fold difference between the model jellyfish abundances and those reported from the statistical model 3 1 3 zooplankton growth the model s mass specific growth rates agree well with observed rates from hirst et al 2003 and kiørboe and hirst 2014 fig 7 for all groups modelled growth rates fell within the range of observed growth rates and with the exception of large flagellates fig 7a model growth rates do not exceed the empirical data for any functional group however modelled growth rates for ciliates larvaceans and jellyfish are slower than most of the empirical observations for those groups fig 7a b d these results indicate that overall our model is not overestimating growth rates and resulting energy flow through the zooplankton to higher trophic levels there were some differences between the scaling of growth and body size between the model and empirical observations with the exception of salps and larvaceans modelled growth rates decline less with body mass than observations do moreover changes in modelled growth rates with body size are linear for the model zooplankton groups with the exception of the carnivorous zooplankton which are more variable fig 7d 3 2 sensitivity analyses 3 2 1 model sensitivity to boundary conditions for each group zooplankton model biomass was robust to changes in the boundary conditions of all zooplankton groups total zooplankton biomass was altered by less than the change in pi for all of the zooplankton groups with total zooplankton biomass varying 15 for flagellates ciliates chaetognaths salps euphausiids and jellyfish and by 40 for all groups table 4 the median change in total zooplankton biomass was 5 when pi was changed by 50 for all groups with the exception of omnivorous copepods which saw a median increase of 12 in total zooplankton biomass when that group s pi was increased by 50 3 2 2 sensitivity of fish biomass to different zooplankton groups across the global ocean total fish biomass was sensitive to the presence of different zooplankton groups fig 8 removing omnivorous copepods or euphausiids caused declines of up to 80 in total fish biomass with median global declines of 59 3 for omnivorous copepods and 46 5 for euphausiids fig 8b e when larvaceans were removed fish biomass declined by up to 50 however the median global decline in the absence of larvaceans was limited to 4 5 as the regions that had declines in fish biomass were balanced by the 50 of grid squares that had little change or a slight increase in fish biomass fig 8a removing carnivorous copepods saw the greatest median increase in global fish biomass of 18 5 with some grid squares recording increases in fish biomass of over 70 fig 8c the removal of chaetognaths salps and jellyfish caused changes in total fish biomass across the global ocean of over 25 fig 8d f g however for each of these three groups there was little change in total fish biomass for at least 35 of the global ocean when they were removed and the global median change in fish biomass was at most 1 4 discussion here we described the zooplankton model of size spectra version 2 zoomss the first functional size spectrum model of the global marine ecosystem that includes the body size carbon content and size based feeding characteristics of nine major zooplankton groups the model requires only sea surface temperature and chlorophyll a concentration as inputs and the spatial variation of the zooplankton community biomass and structure emerges based on the functional traits of the zooplankton groups our model strongly suggests that zooplankton play a key role in regulating the biomass of fish in the ocean and demonstrates how various zooplankton groups support energy transfer to higher trophic levels the ability of zoomss to reproduce empirically derived spatial patterns of global zooplankton biomass and abundance as well as growth rates gives confidence that the model provides a reasonable framework for further exploration of the role of zooplankton in the ocean 4 1 importance of resolving zooplankton groups for higher trophic levels accounting for functional diversity in marine models is important to better understand the unique role of zooplankton in mediating energy from phytoplankton to fish across the global ocean mitra et al 2014 in current global marine models focussed on higher trophic levels the functional diversity of zooplankton is typically ignored with zooplankton usually grouped together with phytoplankton as a single resource for small fish e g blanchard et al 2009 2012 law et al 2009 datta et al 2010 or taken as external inputs from nutrient phytoplankton zooplankton detritus models e g maury 2010 christensen et al 2015 petrik et al 2019 in marine models focussed on lower trophic levels more progress has been made in resolving the functional traits of different plankton groups e g ward et al 2012 2014 prowe et al 2018 however these models do not resolve higher trophic levels such as fish because they are not built to assess the unique and dynamic role of zooplankton in mediating energy from phytoplankton to higher trophic levels by resolving the functional traits of nine major zooplankton groups our model has the unique ability to explore the impact of shifts in the phytoplankton and zooplankton community on higher trophic levels across global environmental gradients our results from the sensitivity analysis where we removed each zooplankton group one at a time indicate that not all zooplankton groups are equal and that their role in mediating energy from phytoplankton to higher trophic levels depends on their body size carbon content and size based feeding behaviour when omnivorous zooplankton omnivorous copepods and euphausiids were removed from the model it reduced fish biomass by up to 80 omnivorous zooplankton are thus important for promoting fish biomass a likely consequence of their high ppmr wide range of body sizes and high carbon content which means they efficiently transfer carbon to higher trophic levels by contrast when carnivorous zooplankton carnivorous copepods chaetognaths and jellyfish were removed from the model it increased fish biomass by up to 20 carnivorous zooplankton thus reduce fish biomass a likely effect of their very low ppmr and diet of other zooplankton which cause longer and more inefficient food chains where these groups dominate when filter feeding zooplankton larvaceans and salps were removed from the model there were small declines by up to 5 in fish biomass larvaceans and salps share similar body size ranges with omnivorous copepods and euphausiids but have much larger predator prey mass ratios meaning they can also access picophytoplankton for food these groups are a direct energy pathway from picophytoplankton to higher trophic levels and so could be important for the productivity and efficiency of oligotrophic waters where picophytoplankton dominate brewin et al 2010 on the other hand these groups are gelatinous meaning they are a less nutritious energy source for higher trophic levels and is part of the reason why median global fish biomass did not decline as much when these groups were removed from our model compared to omnivorous copepods and euphausiids increasing functional complexity in models is important for improving our understanding of key ecosystem processes in the marine environment for instance trait diversity in phytoplankton has a key role in ocean biogeochemistry fuhrman 2009 productivity chen et al 2019 and carbon export guidi et al 2009 and there are a growing number of models that demonstrate the importance of trait diversity in structuring the phytoplankton community across environmental gradients acevedo trejos et al 2015 2018 basu and mackey 2018 dutkiewicz et al 2019 similarly we have shown here that resolving zooplankton functional complexity is important to better understand how ecosystem efficiency is affected by shifts in phytoplankton community structure from oligotrophic ocean gyres to eutrophic coastal and upwelling systems hansen et al 1994 boyce et al 2015 4 2 model evaluation to evaluate the performance of zoomss we focussed on comparing emergent properties of the model s zooplankton with empirical observations of total zooplankton biomass across the global ocean as well as the distributions of abundance for seven of the zooplankton groups and empirical growth rates for all zooplankton groups across the three approaches the model performed well reproducing the global distribution of zooplankton biomass and most of the zooplankton functional group abundances as well as producing growth rates that were within the range of empirical observation for all zooplankton groups the global distribution of total zooplankton biomass from zoomss was strongly correlated with the empirical estimate from strömberg et al 2009 our estimate from the copepod database see supplementary information and also agrees with other model predictions of the distribution of zooplankton and fish biomass jennings et al 2008 ward et al 2012 harfoot et al 2014 petrik et al 2019 what is more total zooplankton biomass from zoomss falls within the range of the two empirical estimates the emergent distributions of abundance for six of the seven zooplankton groups that were assessed had a positive correlation with distributions that were derived from data however there was a difference in the ranges of absolute zooplankton biomass and abundance between the model and the empirical estimates with zoomss projecting higher abundances than the empirical estimates this would be explained first by the fact that parameters for zoomss were selected from the literature and were not tuned to estimates of abundance and biomass from the sample data moreover there is a significant difference between sample data used to derive the empirical distributions and how biomass and abundance are calculated from the zoomss the empirical models were constructed using sample data taken with dozens of different gears and mesh sizes over the past 60 years however there are many mesh sizes and gear types not suitable to capture smaller zooplankton biasing sampled abundances and biomass to larger zooplankton everett et al 2017 at the same time large zooplankton can actively avoid sample nets and avoid detection thus leading to samples that underestimate the number of large zooplankton richardson et al 2006 this means that the samples and therefore the distributions predicted by the empirical models are only capturing a fraction of the actual total zooplankton by contrast biomass and abundance from zoomss was obtained by summing all zooplankton this means we are counting 100 of the zooplankton from the size spectrum model while the sampled distributions from the empirical models only capture some fraction of total zooplankton mass specific growth rates from zoomss agreed well with observed rates from hirst et al 2003 and kiørboe and hirst 2013 however there were two main discrepancies the first is that for zooplankton groups other than salps and larvaceans modelled growth rates decline less with body size compared to observations the reason for this discrepancy could be in the difference between how growth rates are calculated for salps and larvaceans and the rest of the zooplankton groups the prey size range for salps and larvaceans is fixed no matter the predator body size meaning that growth rates for these groups scale with body size based on search volume only which has a mass specific scaling that is less than zero by contrast the other zooplankton groups have prey size ranges that shift with increasing predator size prey get larger as predators get larger and this could be offsetting the lower search rate for larger predators as well as the lower abundance of larger prey the second discrepancy was that for carnivorous groups the model had non linear variation in growth rates with body size that was not evident in the empirical data this variation in specific growth rates with body size for carnivores is caused by the variability in the density of their prey microzooplankton filter feeders and omnivorous zooplankton all primarily eat phytoplankton which is modelled as a static resource across time and body size so their growth rates are largely driven by predator search volume and size selectivity not variability in their prey however carnivorous zooplankton only eat other zooplankton which have varying abundance with time and body size so variation in their growth rates is caused not only by search volume and size selectivity but also by changes in their prey through time 4 3 caveats and next steps 4 3 1 spatial and temporal dynamics the spatial and temporal resolution of zoomss means that the model is designed to explore steady state conditions of the marine ecosystem across global environmental gradients for this reason we focused on traits such as body size predator prey mass ratio and carbon content because at this spatial and temporal scale these traits are important for how energy moves through the marine food web hansen et al 1994 jennings et al 2001 woodward et al 2005 andersen et al 2016a mcconville et al 2017 however this also means that we have made simplifying assumptions about dynamic processes such as reproduction and movement this is in contrast to other fish focussed global models which although they resolve zooplankton simplistically do resolve explicit reproduction blanchard et al 2011 carozza et al 2016 petrik et al 2019 or movement cheung et al 2011 maury 2010 by fixing abundances of the smallest size classes for all functional groups we assume constant recruitment which means we are not explicitly resolving reproduction this could have a stabilising effect on the dynamics of the model and our sensitivity analysis of total zooplankton biomass to changes in the boundary conditions of each zooplankton group indicates that our results are reasonably robust to the implicit parameterisation of reproduction as constant recruitment zooplankton reproductive strategies are extremely complex however a first step toward resolving reproduction in the zooplankton would be to follow the formulation of the community size spectrum model framework andersen et al 2016b where reproductive complexity is ignored for each functional group recruitment could then be represented as a fraction of assimilated energy flowing from mature size classes to the smallest size class for that group finally the spatial resolution of our model 5 is coarser than other global marine ecosystem models which tend to use a 1 resolution tittensor et al 2018 we use a 5 resolution because it allowed us to run the model quickly while still being able to assess the emergent patterns of zooplankton biomass and abundance across the global ocean similar to most global fish focused models run with a 1 or less resolution but see maury 2010 each 5 grid cell is run independently which means we do not take into account the movement of plankton or fish between adjacent grid squares this could introduce a possible bias due to movement of plankton by currents in some regions or apex predators by active transport which in the real world could cause discrepancies between plankton and fish abundance in certain areas however given the coarse resolution of our model output we expect this to have a minor impact since most zooplankton are short lived less than a few weeks and are unlikely to move outside of the large grid cells over their lifespan further we have not included fish species in the model but only used three broad size based groups to represent all epipelagic fish which precludes a good understanding of how fish might move amongst grid cells during large scale movements and seasonal migrations the 5 cells also mean that many fish would remain within a single grid cell during their life particularly for the small and medium fish communities in future models passive movement by currents and active movement due to behaviour of fish could be implemented using existing advection and diffusion algorithms maury 2010 castle et al 2011 watson et al 2014 4 3 2 phytoplankton production and dynamics similar to existing global marine ecosystem models blanchard et al 2009 maury 2010 christensen et al 2015 jennings and collingridge 2015 carozza et al 2016 petrik et al 2019 zoomss does not incorporate phytoplankton dynamics instead representing primary producers as a static abundance spectrum with slope intercept and maximum size determined by annual average chlorophyll a concentration satellite chlorophyll a represents in situ phytoplankton biomass and so in a sense implicitly incorporates the processes of nutrient cycling and predation on the phytoplankton moreover since zoomss was able to reproduce global zooplankton biomass and growth rates in the range of empirical estimates we believe a static resource for zooplankton that does not explicitly resolve phytoplankton dynamics and nutrient cycling in each grid cell is a reasonable compromise between realism and model complexity at this stage looking forward resolving phytoplankton dynamics and the feedbacks between phytoplankton and zooplankton is critical to better resolving zooplankton in marine ecosystem models in any region primary production sets the limits to growth for higher trophic levels limited primary production also induces competition amongst zooplankton competing for a finite resource this competition would have implications for the stability of different zooplankton groups from oligotrophic to eutrophic regions that are not resolved in the current model in any region primary production depends on nutrient supply in coastal and upwelling regions a high supply of new nutrients from ocean mixing sustain productive systems while in the open ocean nutrient recycling from zooplankton back to phytoplankton through the microbial loop plays a key role in nutrient supply for primary production azam et al 1983 finally seasonal cycles of boom and bust in the phytoplankton is a major driver of variation of zooplankton reproduction as many zooplankton groups time their reproduction to coincide with phytoplankton blooms falkowski et al 1988 atkinson et al 1996 these linkages and feedbacks between nutrient cycles phytoplankton dynamics and zooplankton need to be considered if we wish to move beyond the current static representation of the plankton in this model processes of nutrient uptake growth and mortality are strongly size structured in the phytoplankton and these size based relationships have been used to resolve the dynamics of the phytoplankton over large spatial scales follows et al 2007 fuchs and franks 2010 ward et al 2012 2014 cuesta et al 2018 future model developments could focus on resolving the size structured functional traits of phytoplankton nutrient uptake growth and mortality or alternatively to shift from using unlimited phytoplankton biomass to limited primary production to fuel higher trophic levels 4 3 3 fitting the model to data emergent patterns of biomass and abundance from the model generally agree with empirical patterns and the zoomss model estimate of absolute global zooplankton biomass falls within the range of two empirical estimates however zoomss s absolute abundances are up to several orders of magnitude higher than empirical estimates part of this discrepancy is because the sample data used to fit empirical abundance estimates are obtained with methods that are not able to capture all zooplankton richardson et al 2006 whereas reported numbers from the model include all individuals across the entire size range of zooplankton however the magnitude of the difference between the model s abundance estimates and the empirical estimates highlights that the model s parameters were not tuned to sample data rather the functional traits incorporated into zoomss were parameterized using values from the literature this is in contrast to other global marine ecosystem models which calibrate their parameter values so that their reported values are in the range of empirical estimates christensen et al 2015 carozza et al 2017 for zooplankton that kind of calibration presents unique challenges given the homogeneity of sampling methods used to obtain empirical estimates of biomass and abundance however empirical maps of zooplankton abundance fit with sample data have been useful for constraining and assessing previous ecosystem model estimates everett et al 2017 which means that the statistical models developed here could also be useful to constrain zooplankton abundance in future iterations of zoomss in the meantime reported absolute abundances from this model should be read with these uncertainties in mind 4 3 4 temperature effects of sea surface temperature were incorporated in the model as a multiplier on growth mortality and diffusion terms with the same temperature scaling q10 used for all functional groups we made this assumption because despite studies elucidating temperature scaling for different zooplankton species hansen et al 1997 kiørboe and hirst 2014 we are unaware of any meta analyses for temperature dependence of different processes for the broader taxonomic groups we use here however this means that changes in chlorophyll a and the resulting shifts in the size structure of the phytoplankton community was the main driver of biomass and abundance for all zooplankton groups and so the model does not capture the unique temperature response of different functional groups this is highlighted in the contrast between the empirically derived abundance distributions and the emergent distributions from zoomss the emergent distributions of abundance from the model are driven by chlorophyll a with more zooplankton abundance in high chlorophyll a waters and less in oligotrophic waters emergent abundance distributions agree well with empirical distributions when empirical abundance is strongly driven by chlorophyll a however when a group s empirical distribution was more strongly affected by temperature the model s distribution was poorly correlated this highlights the pressing need for greater synthesis of the extensive experimental zooplankton data on the rate of life processes at different temperatures to inform modelling efforts 4 4 concluding remarks zoomss is the first functional size spectrum model of the global marine ecosystem to resolve the functional traits of multiple zooplankton functional groups using body size ranges size based feeding behaviour and carbon content of nine of the most abundant zooplankton groups zoomss is capable of replicating global patterns in total zooplankton biomass and abundance and resolving growth rates for different zooplankton groups by showing how unique zooplankton groups have different impacts on fish biomass across the ocean zoomss provides new insights into the role of different zooplankton in supporting higher trophic level biomass and is a first step towards better resolution of zooplankton in marine ecosystem models using the functional size spectrum framework in an era of environmental change and given the pivotal role zooplankton play in food webs improving the representation of zooplankton in ecosystem models will be critical to predict fisheries productivity and carbon cycling in the future ocean code availability zoomss was written in r version 3 5
