24665,metapopulation structure emerges from the dispersal of individuals among spatially distinct patches across a low quality matrix while dispersing agents are typically modeled as functionally identical with limited linear and non directional dispersal field studies argue for the incorporation of intraspecific trait variation such as behavioral into the modeling of dispersal individual personality is of growing interest as a trait that affects dispersal metrics yet remains understudied at large field relevant spatial scales here we used an individual based model to investigate the influence of sociability a personality type known to be linked to density dependent dispersal decisions on a metapopulation at the individual local and regional scales as personality dependent dispersal is temporally dependent we also examined how emergent properties of the metapopulation varied across two dispersal scenarios long and short dispersal windows overall our results support the growing evidence that individual personalities can significantly structure metapopulations in both space and time through negative relationships between sociability and dispersal distance and positive relationships between sociability and patch density however we also demonstrate the effects of personality are limited by environmental factors at the larger spatial scales of our model patch density as a function of distance from source and proportion of the landscape occupied were more strongly influenced by the dispersal window than by the personality using these results we derive hypotheses to be examined in future empirical research as the climate continues to shift and dispersal models are updated to reflect ever changing conditions these results suggest individual personality types and the personality type by environment interaction should be considered to accurately reflect dispersal and manage valuable metasystems keywords personality dependent dispersal sociability personality type metapopulation dispersal 1 introduction metapopulation structure emerges from the dispersal of propagules among spatially distinct patches across a low quality matrix determining metapopulation stability and persistence hanski and gilpin 1991 pulliam et al 1992 the rate at which these propagules disperse gotelli 1991 the pathways they use altermatt et al 2011 baguette and van dyck 2007 and their use of environmental information while dispersing proulx et al 2013 have been foci of research on the spatial structuring of metapopulations yet a key assumption of much of this work is that individual propagules are functional equivalents within the metapopulation and thus the dispersal of propagules has been assumed to be limited linear non directional and importantly traditionally modeled as a single parameter with no variance hanski and gilpin 1991 wang and altermatt 2019 but see bani et al 2019 however it is now clear that intraspecific trait variation particularly for dispersal associated physiological morphological and behavioral traits can influence emergent metapopulation structure hawkes 2009 sutherland et al 2014 among these traits personality types pt are now recognized as particularly influential dispersal related traits affecting the spatial structuring of metapopulations conrad et al 2011 dhellemmes et al 2020 spiegel et al 2017 a pt also referred to as behavioral type is defined as the within and between individual consistent behavior observed across time and or ecological context in response to a given stimulus sih et al 2012 pt have been shown to influence key metapopulation dynamics including propagule dispersal tendencies cote et al 2010a duckworth and badyaev 2007 myles gonzalez et al 2015 speeds maes et al 2013 distances cote et al 2010b competitive abilities capelle et al 2015 groen et al 2012 physiological states myles gonzalez et al 2015 parental care duckworth and badyaev 2007 home range size schirmer et al 2019 and colonization behaviors duckworth 2008 groen et al 2012 in order to influence metapopulation structure through dispersal a pt must at minimum affect both the spatial e g distance and temporal e g rate components of dispersal at ecologically relevant scales among other behaviors that characterize an individual s pt sociability or the propensity of an individual to associate with conspecifics cote and clobert 2007 has been suggested to influence both of these aspects of dispersal by mediating emigration and immigration probabilities as well as dispersal rates and distances cote et al 2010a cote et al 2010b and thus should be a strong determinant of metacommunity dynamics yet its role remains understudied sociability s potential influence on metapopulation structure stems from how local density dependence at the patch scale interacts with an individual s sociability to influence dispersal decisions as conceptualized and reviewed by cote et al 2010a asocial individuals i e those who prefer low conspecific densities disperse away from high density patches in search of preferable conditions patch density decreases as they disperse encouraging emigration of social individuals who seek higher density conditions through multiple iterations of this sequential stepwise dispersal process high and low density patches are established and go extinct over time and space the emergent structure of the metapopulation then becomes dependent on the members sociability distribution cote et al 2010a rehage et al 2016 some evidence exists for this at small spatial scales cote et al 2010b showed a negative relationship between sociability and individual dispersal distances in a fish mesocosm with asocial individuals having the largest dispersal distances similarly in a reptile macrocosm social individuals tended to disperse away from low density patches more readily than those starting in high density areas while the reverse was true of less social individuals cote and clobert 2007 however there is still a lack of information regarding how this translates to large spatial scales 10s 100 s of km and field settings and how sociability interacts with temporally varying environmental conditions that may influence dispersal ancillary evidence at larger scales exists such as the tendency of burrowing owls to disperse further from low conspecific density patches relative to high density patches moiron et al 2020 and more bold likely asocial bank voles tend to move the most schirmer et al 2019 but no field scale assessments of the role of sociability have been conducted nor modeled in this study we ask how does personality dependent dispersal pdd particularly sociability influence metapopulation structure in both space and time to do this we built a behavioral individual based model ibm parameterized with information from a real world metapopulation using this ibm we experimentally manipulated the sociability of individuals to test hypotheses on how variation in the personality composition of the metapopulation affected the dispersal of individuals and both local patch scale and regional across patches attributes of the metapopulation table 1 the premise of our model is that personality interacts with patch density as per cote et al 2010a s hypothesis both responding to and influencing it to determine emigration out of patches and thus affect metapopulation structure the goal of our model is to examine the consequences of this interaction of personality and patch density to determine individual patch and regional metapopulation attributes we hypothesized that the distance individuals traveled would be negatively related to their sociability as per cote et al 2010b at the patch scale patch sociability was expected to positively correlate with patch density as asocial individuals would actively seek to establish low density patches while social individuals would actively seek to congregate in high density patches finally at the regional scale we expected to observe a negative relationship between population sociability and the proportion of the landscape occupied as individuals in asocially skewed populations were expected to travel further from the source to achieve low densities and thus colonize more of the landscape understanding the effect of pdd on metapopulation structure is a particularly pressing need in aquatic systems while many aquatic habitats are temporally stable with functionally unlimited dispersal windows or periods of time suitable for dispersal and colonization of new habitat patches dispersal can be limited in other ephemeral landscapes for instance in rainfall driven pulsing systems the extent of marsh inundation and thus habitat connectivity among habitat patches varies seasonally and yearly with drought severity davis et al 2017 davis et al 2017 in an analysis of an ephemeral wetland metacommunity showed that precipitation and the presence of fishes closely tied to the rain induced flood levels were strong predictors of amphibian colonization during a multiyear period of severe climatic variability thus in addition to testing hypotheses about the role of pdd on individual dispersal inter and intra patch dynamics we tested a long vs a short dispersal window scenario table 1 at the individual level we hypothesize that a shorter dispersal window would lessen differences in the dispersal behavior of social vs asocial individuals resulting in a weaker relationship between individual sociability and distance traveled patch density was used both for model calibration and for testing a priori hypotheses as the mechanism being investigated enforces a positive relationship between patch density and sociability this pattern was used for model calibration how this pattern changes with dispersal windows however was not an enforced pattern with that said we did not anticipate a significant effect of dispersal window length on the association between population sociability and patch density at the regional scale we anticipated a weakening of the relationship between population sociability and the proportion of the landscape occupied at longer dispersal windows as these would allow for full exploration and thus possible saturation of the model environment resulting in all patches being occupied regardless of sociability 2 materials and methods 2 1 model overview our ibm was built to simulate the structuring of a metapopulation as a function of intraspecific variation in sociability and two dispersal window scenarios using netlogo v 5 3 1 wilensky 1999 the model simulated the departure of fish out of a source population their movement across a habitat matrix in search of suitable patches and their settlement upon encountering a suitable patch we varied the presence and skewness of sociability in this population of dispersing propagules in order to quantify their effects on metapopulation structure a core premise of the model incorporated in pattern calibration is that both departure and settlement decisions are governed by the interaction of local patch density and sociability cote et al 2010a which ultimately determines patch suitability e g dispersing asocial agents seek low densities while socials seek high density patches model details following grimm et al 2006 are provided in supplemental material 1 while results of sensitivity analyses are included in supplemental material 2 for parameters that were not empirically derived we used sensitivity analyses to evaluate their influence on model performance and selected parameter values based on these results while we did not strive to accurately represent the complexity of a real world metapopulation with our ibm our goal was to simulate realistic movement rules and patch densities at realistic spatiotemporal scales to do this the ibm was parameterized with data from an ephemeral wetland metapopulation and calibrated to produce an empirically derived cote et al 2010b positive relationship between sociability and patch density specifically our model design and rules were inspired by the rocky glades rg region of everglades national park enp this system was chosen since it is a spatially structured habitat with seasonal recolonization that is affected by the size of dispersal windows it has clearly defined patch boundaries and a source of dispersal propagules and at least one species sufficiently studied to parameterize the model agents blanchard 2018 davis et al 2005 goss et al 2014 kline et al 2014 rehage et al 2014 2009 sokol et al 2014 additionally the rg s ephemeral nature limits the confounding effects of prior knowledge knowledge of the environment from previous dispersal bouts i e mueller and fagan 2008 clobert et al 2009 and priority effects effects of existing colonists on potential new immigrants i e drake 1990 dibble et al 2014 on observable colonization processes however it is important to note that while this landscape was used as a source of parameters and rules the model is not meant as a fully accurate representation of the rocky glades ecosystem instead our goal is to examine the influence of biases in the proportion of social vs asocial individuals on dispersal and recolonization dynamics and thus to be extrapolated to other systems to facilitate this extrapolation further use and expansion of this work the final version of this model can be found on the netlogo modelling commons at http modelingcommons org browse one model 6581 blanchard 2021 2 2 modeled system the rg are a short hydroperiod karstic marsh covering an approximate area of 700 km2 with a maximum width of approximately 20 km flanking the northeastern region of enp mcvoy et al 2011 in our model the region was emulated with a 200 100 cell bounded rectangle with each cell representing 100m2 for a total world size of 20 10 km the rg are characterized by a large number of depressions in the exposed limestone matrix or solution holes typically ranging from less than 1 m2 to more than 8 m2 blanchard 2018 representing the deepest habitats in the landscape and distributed throughout graminoid marshes that are only seasonally connected loftus et al 1992 mcvoy et al 2011 rehage et al 2014 in the wet season these solution holes are part of a contiguous flooded landscape allowing for the dispersal of aquatic organisms in the dry season as water levels recede these solution holes are the only flooded habitats and serve as discrete patches and dry season refugia for aquatic organism loftus et al 1992 kobza et al 2004 rehage et al 2014 goss et al 2014 since the spatial distribution of solution holes has not yet been mapped for this model 50 cells were designated as solution holes and their locations were randomly generated once and fixed to coordinates fig 1 to control for the effect of patch distribution which is known to influence many ecological properties tscharntke et al 2012 allowing for model tenability and broad applicability to other systems under post drainage conditions of the modern everglades a typical fish dispersal window which is determined by the length of the wet season when the marsh matrix is flooded and fish are able to disperse among solution holes or from longer hydroperiod source populations is approximately four to six months long with severe droughts reducing this to less than one month kotun and renshaw 2014 loftus et al 1992 mcvoy et al 2011 under these drier conditions typically 90 100 of solution hole colonists fishes and macroinvertebrates such as crayfish and grass shrimp die annually as a result of solution holes drying before they can reflood with the onset of the wet season rehage et al 2014 limiting the potential of priority effects and prior knowledge in dispersal dynamics and effectively resetting colonization processes yearly the next wet season upon flooding as the solution holes and the surrounding short hydroperiod marsh become connected creating a dispersal window the area is recolonized from longer hydroperiod marshes in the periphery of the rg namely shark river slough which do not dry annually and are considered permanent habitat and the major source population for solution holes goss et al 2014 rehage et al 2014 accordingly in the model we created a single source of propagules along one boundary of the 200 km2 modeling world this source area was arbitrarily limited to 5 patches wide for the sake of model tenability and because movement within the source habitat was beyond the scope of this model yet allowed for stochasticity in initial conditions between model runs in addition we simulated two dispersal windows a 200 day period hereafter referred to as the long dispersal window to represent average hydrological conditions and a 20 days or short dispersal window to represent drought conditions 2 3 model agents agent design was inspired by the eastern mosquitofish gambusia holbrooki this is the most common fish inhabiting the rg kobza et al 2004 blanchard 2018 and is a congener of the western mosquitofish gambusia affinis used in previous sociability studies e g cote et al 2013 cote et al 2010a cote et al 2010b rehage et al 2005 this globally invasive genus deacon et al 2011 is also known to exhibit significant intraspecific variation in behavioral traits rehage et al 2016 at the onset of each model run 1000 agents were generated in the source habitat with the sociability of these individuals being randomly drawn from one of three focal distributions asocially skewed normal and socially skewed and from fourth treatment a no personality np control which lacked any influence of sociability fig 1 for the purposes of the model sociability was bound between 0 and 1 with higher values representing higher sociability each distribution was derived from beta distributions with the parameters asocial α 2 β 10 social α 10 β 2 and normal α 2 β 2 these are skewed left middle and skewed right respectively skewed distributions were chosen to investigate the effects of biased pt distributions relative to a normal trait distribution and the absence of personality selective forces founders effects and human induced change are expected to skew behavioral distributions in natural populations with important implications for both ecological and evolutionary processes conrad et al 2011 sih et al 2012 cote et al 2013 diaz pauli and sih 2017 2 4 model operation departure of agents from source habitat dispersal typically involves three stages departure from a living area moving between areas transience and settlement in a new area clobert et al 2009 in our model we simulated the dispersal of agents departing from a single fringe source population moving through the habitat matrix to encounter randomly placed habitat patches and making settlement decisions at each patch fig 1 departure movement and colonization decisions were made on a daily time step over the two dispersal windows 20 vs 200 days departure and settlement were influenced by the personality of the agent agent departure from the source habitat was determined by bottom up ranked sociability with asocial individuals moving first in accordance with cote et al 2010a if two agents had the same sociability score the tie was handled through random selection to determine which agent would move first if they choose to move at all for the no personality control order of departure was determined by using a random number generator 2 5 model operation transience of agents among patches when searching for patches the distance an agent moved daily was randomly chosen between 0 and 3 km shown to be a reasonable maximum daily movement distance for eastern mosquitofish this distance is approximately 15 of a maximum swimming speed of 22 cm s over 24 h gatto and trexler 2020 approximately 52 of the speeds observed by rehage and sih 2004 and is a reasonable estimate for a fish of this size compared to others videler and wardle 1991 during dispersal each agent used an area restricted search procedure an empirically supported search pattern used in previous behavioral ibms e g spiegel et al 2017 coupled with a random walk fagan and calabrese 2014 to find viable patches in the landscape in short this search procedure involved intensively searching local areas for some time then adaptively broadening the search after a certain amount of time has passed without finding a new patch the model accomplishes this with a small turn angle of 90 for intensive searching which is then expanded to a large turn angle of 225 after 30 of the dispersal window period has passed the values of these arbitrarily small and large turn angles as well as the critical amount of time required before switching between them henceforth referred to as panic time were chosen using sensitivity analyses the model was insensitive to the large turn angle while the panic time and small turn angle values were chosen as the smallest values after which sensitivity to changes was not observed supplemental materials 2 in order to make settlement decisions as agents moved each agent was afforded complete knowledge of the area within 750 m of the agent 25 of the 3 km maximum linear dispersal distance at the end of the day this knowledge in our model emulates the prospecting behavior individuals are known to engage in before settling e g valone 2007 davies and white 2018 the range of knowledge was assessed with a series of sensitivity analyses which indicated a high sensitivity to variation in this parameter supplementary materials 2 as the size of the prospected area increased so too did mean patch density and survivorship while the distance individuals traveled decreased within the range tested the 25 value used here provided sufficient survivorship to assess focal hypotheses table 1 without providing agents with excessive perfect knowledge 2 6 model operation settlement of agents in habitat patches once a patch was found by the agent the viability of a patch was assessed daily as a function of conspecific density for the duration of the dispersal window we used a maximum acceptable patch density of 40 conspecifics per patch which is one standard deviation above the mean density of eastern mosquitofish observed in rg solution holes blanchard 2018 if local conspecific density was acceptable the agent settled in the patch and stayed until conditions changed which were assessed daily as this model assumes that agents prefer a patch even one of poor quality to the matrix if the density was unacceptable then the agent still colonized but re evaluated and decided each day if it should wait for conditions to improve or emigrate from the patch each agent s acceptable density was defined as acceptable density individual sociability 40 this was a pattern oriented formula not empirically derived that is it produced the requisite positive relationship preferred density and individual sociability as per the source hypothesis from cote et al 2010a b future works should seek to derive a more empirically supported equation for acceptable density the agent s acceptable density was then broadened to include 25 of the calculated value the model s sensitivity to this arbitrary wiggle room around the acceptable density was assessed with a sensitivity analysis which showed that this parameter had little effect on model outcomes supplemental material 2 further as it is highly unlikely that fish in nature know the exact density of conspecifics in an area while settling we believe this provided a more realistic rule for settlement additionally this formulation of the wiggle room parameter produces less tolerance of net deviations from preferred densities in asocial individuals who prefer lower densities as compared to socials sociability has been linked to boldness a personality trait typically assessed as the probability of dispersing in unfamiliar territory myles gonzalez et al 2015 more asocial individuals tend to be more bold and thus more likely to disperse than asocials conrad et al 2011 myles gonzalez et al 2015 similarly the asocial tendency to disperse first cote et al 2010a could be interpreted as a lower tolerance threshold for unacceptable conditions this model emulates this pattern if the agent was waiting for conditions to improve at a patch we calculated the agent s hang out time h as where hmax is the maximum amount of time any individual will stay in an unacceptable density patch if a randomly drawn real number between 0 and hmax was h then the agent emigrated from the patch if not then the agent stayed for another day stayers experienced a decay in h for each day with an unacceptable patch density which acted to reduce their probability of staying h was included as an animal s perception of local conditions does not immediately switch in a binary fashion from acceptable to not sih 1992 a sensitivity analysis was performed to evaluate the impact of hmax as it was not empirically derived the model was not found to be sensitive to variation in this parameter above three days so a fixed value of three days was used for hmax supplemental materials 2 the rate of decay of h henceforth referred to as hang out decay was also evaluated with a sensitivity analysis which determined the model was sensitive to changes in this parameter at all levels but was most sensitive at values greater than 70 therefore a hang out decay of 70 was used supplemental materials 2 last the model assumed that agents remembered the last patch it evaluated and did not return to it until a new one had been found and evaluated a core assumption of the model is that animals are seeking different more favorable conditions when dispersing rehage et al 2016 and thus would not immediately return to a previously unacceptable patch less they become stuck without dispersing in other words the agent repeatedly returns to the same patch as without memory of it being unacceptable it met all the criteria needed for the agent to immigrate search parameters were functionally identical in the no personality np scenario except that agents had no basis for evaluating patches so they settled into any newly detected patch for these agents the probability of staying in the patch was purely random drawing a random integer between 1 and 101 emigrate if 50 and stay another day if 50 as with departure from the source agent movement out order when leaving a patch was determined by bottom up ranked sociability with asocial individuals moving first in accordance with cote et al 2010a if two agents had the same sociability score the tie was handled by random draw if any agent was not in a habitat patch solution hole at the end of the run dispersal window they died 2 7 statistical analyses at the individual scale differences in individual travel distances between socially informed asocially skewed socially skewed and neutral and uninformed populations np were evaluated with a kruskal wallace test followed by multiple comparison tests following zar 1999 using kruskal test and kruskalmc in the stats and pgirmess packages respectively in r r core 2012 relationships between distance traveled and individual sociability across the low and high dispersal window scenarios were evaluated with linear models using lm from stats the slopes of these models were compared with an analysis of covariance ancova using the aov function from the stats package at the local scale mean patch densities of all socially informed and uninformed populations were compared within and across the two dispersal windows using kruskal wallace and associated multiple comparisons tests to evaluate the relationship between patch density and population sociability we used a kendall s tau correlation using the mean population s sociability asocial 0 16 normal 0 5 social 0 83 as categorical ranked x values table 2 for each dispersal window and using cor test in the stats package the slopes of these relationships were compared using an ancova at the regional scale the proportion of the landscape occupied by socially informed and uninformed populations across dispersal windows were compared with kruskal wallace and subsequent multiple comparisons tests where appropriate on arcsine square root transformed proportions relationships between population sociability and the proportion of the landscape occupied were evaluated using a kendall s tau correlation using mean population sociability as the ranked x categorical value last to evaluate the relationship between mean patch sociability and distance from the source as well as mean patch density and distance from source we focused on the normally distributed distribution as it was the only scenario with all sociabilities present and np populations only these relationships were evaluated using linear models which were compared with ancovas distance from the source area was calculated as the x coordinate on a cartesian plane with the source boundary being x 5 mean patch sociability was calculated as the mean sociability of individuals within occupied patches at the end of the run either 200 or 20 days depending on length of dispersal window similarly mean patch density was calculated as the mean density of occupied patches at the end of the run 3 results 3 1 individual scale as predicted socially skewed populations traveled less across the model environment than asocials the distance traveled by agents was

harrison et al 1988 gotelli 1991 govindan et al 2015 deans and chalcraft 2017 while environmental factors and interspecific interactions are known to be influential bond et al 2015 pringle 2003 individual personalities can also significantly contribute to the structuring of metapopulations through personality dependent dispersal pdd e g cote and clobert 2007 cote et al 2010a cote et al 2010b spiegel et al 2015 however few studies to date have observed the concept of pdd at realistic spatiotemporal scales and none have done so using sociability in this study we have demonstrated that individual sociability can have a significant structuring influence on assembling ephemeral metapopulations at multiple scales individual local and regional and that these influences vary depending on the length of the dispersal limitation resulting from variation in dispersal windows in the following sections we discuss four key findings from this model 1 the total distance a propagule dispersed was negatively related to their sociability a relationship which became stronger as the length of the dispersal window increased 2 patch density was positively associated with the sociability of the source population the strength of this relationship and mean patch densities increased as dispersal window length increased 3 the proportion of the landscape occupied was positively correlated with sociability though the slopes were so shallow that they may not be functionally relevant in nature and they did not vary with dispersal window length 4 mean patch sociability was negatively related to the distance from the source mirroring patch density distance decays typical of socially uniformed populations with shorter dispersal windows producing steeper slopes below we discuss the implications of these results at each scale and refine suggested hypotheses to be tested in future field studies 4 1 individual dispersal distance and sociability with our model we have shown that an individual s sociability can be negatively related to the distance they disperse at the modeled landscape scales as hypothesized by cote et al 2010a and that this relationship is temporally dependent fig 2 the temporal dependence could be seen as conceptually simple i e longer dispersal windows allow more time for individual differences to become accentuated however this is worth noting as it suggests that short dispersal windows could mask the relationship between sociability and dispersal in studies or under environmental contexts that do not permit enough time for differentiation to manifest among individuals in this model the dispersal windows were 20 days and 200 days however while exploring the sensitivity to dispersal window length we did investigate a broader range of dispersal windows the strength of this relationship increases with dispersal window length beyond the bounds of the presented data supplementary materials 2 figure 8 a key consequence of the negative relationship between individual sociability and travel distance is that it suggests a greater metabolic cost for asocially skewed populations as more energy would be spent on dispersal by this pt with possible metabolic and fitness consequences in round gobies neogobius melanostomus for example the most dispersive boldest individuals have higher resting metabolic rates are more aggressive and allocate less energy to reproductive efforts during dispersal myles gonzalez et al 2015 while this allows invasive round gobies to establish new populations quickly reproductive success is limited in these bold dominated populations until less bold more reproductive individuals immigrate they also offset the fitness consequences of their dispersive phenotype by re allocating energy back toward reproductive pathways when not dispersing in the absence of such compensatory mechanisms asociality would be maladaptive in stable environments assuming no added benefits to dispersal such as inbreeding avoidance territoriality or resource competition bonte et al 2012 conversely dynamic environments such as ephemeral wetlands may favor more dispersive phenotypes through stochastic extirpations of high density areas in such a case population resilience requires frequent establishment of satellite populations likely consisting of the more dispersive asocial individuals cote et al 2010a to recolonize extirpated patches i e the rescue effect gotelli 1991 depending on the frequency and severity of these selective disturbance events this could result in asocially skewed or normally distributed sociabilities by disproportionately removing non dispersing social individuals similarly it has been recently demonstrated that sociality can carry an increased predation risk for some taxa while dispersing due to the attractive effect of large groups to predators despite dilution and other shoal benefits botham et al 2005 brodin et al 2019 given this we hypothesize that metapopulations in stable environments will be socially skewed while those in dynamic environments will have asocially skewed or normally distributed sociabilities these hypothesized multigenerational patterns could be tested with an extension of our ibm that incorporates individual fitness multigenerational population dynamics and different degrees of environmental stochasticity similar to the more complex insalmo ibm i e railsback et al 2013 4 2 patch density and sociability our model demonstrated a positive association between patch density and population sociability fig 3 while this is an empirically supported pattern observed in fish cote et al 2010b and reptiles cote and clobert 2007 it was an imposed feature of the model however the significantly reduced densities under shorter dispersal windows are emergent from pdd this pattern was a function of individuals running out of time to search for optimal densities under the shorter dispersal windows resulting in low density patches with large numbers of agents dying at the end of the dispersal window while in the longer dispersal window they had more time to find patches and aggregate in more preferable densities while intuitive this provides another mechanism by which certain phenotypes may be maladaptive in environments with short dispersal windows the high densities observed in long dispersal windows may result in density dependent increases in stress levels especially among asocial individuals conversely the low densities typical of short dispersal windows may be stressful for social individuals while we are unaware of studies observing density dependent effects across a sociability gradient density dependent fitness is well documented in fish for example damselfish larvae preferentially settle in to higher density groups thus enhancing their daily survival probability while slowing the rate at which they mature in covariance with social status booth 1995 which has been shown to alter density dependent fitness via stress see baker et al 2013 for a review of stress in wildlife when chronic stress can have a wide array of physiological effects ranging from increased aggression to reduced fitness and degradation of organ systems baker et al 2013 mcewen and wingfield 2003 romero 2004 therefore following density dependent effects we hypothesize that consistent long dispersal windows in ephemeral habitats will select for social skewness whereas short or dynamic windows select for asocially skewed populations 4 3 landscape occupation and sociability the role of personality types in landscape occupancy is of interest to invasion ecologists as it is a key factor in assessing invader impact and the rate of spread of invasive species brownscombe and fox 2012 ricciardi et al 2013 it has long been hypothesized that more dispersive personalities in invading populations would result in faster landscape occupation see sih et al 2012 for discussion however we found very weak evidence for the hypothesized relationship between population sociability and landscape occupancy while some populations did differ significantly and the correlations were significantly different from zero the effect size is likely not functional in nature the lack of a strong relationship between sociability and landscape occupancy may be a function of two features of this model which are likely acting in concert first we note that under the short dispersal window the landscape has little saturation less than 30 while under the long dispersal window the landscape is nearly entirely saturated more than 98 in most runs but with a large number of lower end outliers the observed pattern may be a function of the length of the world or the amount of time permitted to explore i e the dispersal window such that a larger environment or intermediate dispersal window lengths may produce different patterns however the ecosystem size used in this model was based on a real system length the rocky glades as were the dispersal window scenarios so the observed patterns are worth consideration here with that said density distance traveled and survivorship were all found to be sensitive to intermediate dispersal window values supplementary materials 2 second the short exploration times interacting with the random walks used by our agents may also arbitrarily influence this pattern random walks are widely used in ibms as they have been demonstrated to approximate animal movement patterns proulx et al 2013 fagan and calabrese 2014 they do however assume a total lack of directional bias and an absence of prior knowledge this results in a tendency to heavily explore an area before making random long dispersal movements even with the area restricted search procedure used in this study and others i e spiegel et al 2017 recent laboratory experiments have suggested the addition of directional biases and conditional switches to dispersal tendencies i e only willing to disperse under certain conditions may more accurately reflect gambusia spp movement hoch et al 2019 however gambusia spp our model taxa are known to colonize the rocky glades immediately following re flood start of the dispersal window and have been observed moving in all directions lacking a directional bias throughout most of the dispersal window in the field goss et al 2014 thus future field and simulation studies should further evaluate the hypothesis that landscape occupancy is related to population sociability using different movement processes or species specific dispersal capabilities 4 4 sociability over space in the cote et al 2010a hypothesis asocial individuals traveled further into the landscape establishing low density patches at larger distances from source populations while not explicitly discussed by cote et al 2010a the net result of this mechanism would be negative relationships between mean patch sociability and distance from the source as well as density and distance from the source as more social individuals lagged behind the asocial individuals dominating the dispersal front our model generated both such patterns as a function of differences in individual sociability lower population densities at greater distances from sources reflect the density distance decay function typically imposed by neutral models of species assembly hubbell 2001 here we show that a population density distance decay relationship can emerge from variation in behavioral types in other words metapopulations structured through the niche process of pdd produce the same negative relationships between distance from the source and patch density as neutrally structured metapopulations this novel mechanism for producing a classic pattern may shed additional light into one of ecology s longest running debates niche vs neutrality see adler et al 2007 alonso et al 2006 mutshinda and o hara 2011 we suggest a behaviorally based re evaluation of seemingly neutrally structured metasystems i e metapopulations metacommunities metaecosystems as there may be cryptic niche structuring mechanisms at work in the case of managed metasystems such as our model system it is of interest to know how these cryptic niche mechanisms interact with shifting climatic parameters that may affect dispersal opportunities 4 5 scaling up the study of sociability we have uncovered two key considerations for sociability at landscape scales and under environmental heterogeneity first individual personalities can structure metasystems as a cryptic form of niche structuring thus pdd can be integrated into ecological theory via niche theories see adler et al 2007 and mutshinda and o hara 2011 for discussions on integrating niche and neutral theories for metasystem assembly specifically our data support the inclusion of individual personalities in calculations of dispersal rates cote et al 2011 cote et al 2010a probability of patch occupancy estimates of patch density over space and the individual consequences of dispersal second the effects of sociability can be masked and dampened by environmental factors as pdd is temporally dependent any environmental influence on the length of the dispersal window e g changes to season length will result in alterations to the structuring influence of pdd if the dispersal window is too short pdd effects may not materialize if it is particularly long then most effects will be accentuated studies into the effect of pdd will need to carefully consider the temporal component of their study design based on these points here we refine our initial hypotheses table 1 with the hope of inspiring field based evaluations of the integration of personality dependent dispersal and metasystem theory table 2 each of these hypotheses could and should be evaluated in a long term field based metapopulation study where individual animals are assayed for sociability see cote et al 2013 and cote et al 2010a for methodology and tracked in real time e g acoustic telemetry dhellemmes et al 2020 with regular patch density surveys 5 conclusions overall our results support the growing evidence that individual personalities are particularly important in the field of metasystem ecology as they influence dispersal rates and density dependent processes in agreement with past studies we demonstrate here that individual personalities can influence metapopulation properties it follows that similar effects exist at other metasystem scales i e metacommunity and metaecosystem as well future works should seek to evaluate the hypotheses we propose table 2 and fig 6 as well as the broader influences of individual personalities at each metasystem scale for us to better understand how these cryptic niche determining traits form the patterns we observe in nature through this personality based ibms such as presented here can be used to inform effective adaptive management strategies and behaviorally influenced sampling techniques

24665,metapopulation structure emerges from the dispersal of individuals among spatially distinct patches across a low quality matrix while dispersing agents are typically modeled as functionally identical with limited linear and non directional dispersal field studies argue for the incorporation of intraspecific trait variation such as behavioral into the modeling of dispersal individual personality is of growing interest as a trait that affects dispersal metrics yet remains understudied at large field relevant spatial scales here we used an individual based model to investigate the influence of sociability a personality type known to be linked to density dependent dispersal decisions on a metapopulation at the individual local and regional scales as personality dependent dispersal is temporally dependent we also examined how emergent properties of the metapopulation varied across two dispersal scenarios long and short dispersal windows overall our results support the growing evidence that individual personalities can significantly structure metapopulations in both space and time through negative relationships between sociability and dispersal distance and positive relationships between sociability and patch density however we also demonstrate the effects of personality are limited by environmental factors at the larger spatial scales of our model patch density as a function of distance from source and proportion of the landscape occupied were more strongly influenced by the dispersal window than by the personality using these results we derive hypotheses to be examined in future empirical research as the climate continues to shift and dispersal models are updated to reflect ever changing conditions these results suggest individual personality types and the personality type by environment interaction should be considered to accurately reflect dispersal and manage valuable metasystems keywords personality dependent dispersal sociability personality type metapopulation dispersal 1 introduction metapopulation structure emerges from the dispersal of propagules among spatially distinct patches across a low quality matrix determining metapopulation stability and persistence hanski and gilpin 1991 pulliam et al 1992 the rate at which these propagules disperse gotelli 1991 the pathways they use altermatt et al 2011 baguette and van dyck 2007 and their use of environmental information while dispersing proulx et al 2013 have been foci of research on the spatial structuring of metapopulations yet a key assumption of much of this work is that individual propagules are functional equivalents within the metapopulation and thus the dispersal of propagules has been assumed to be limited linear non directional and importantly traditionally modeled as a single parameter with no variance hanski and gilpin 1991 wang and altermatt 2019 but see bani et al 2019 however it is now clear that intraspecific trait variation particularly for dispersal associated physiological morphological and behavioral traits can influence emergent metapopulation structure hawkes 2009 sutherland et al 2014 among these traits personality types pt are now recognized as particularly influential dispersal related traits affecting the spatial structuring of metapopulations conrad et al 2011 dhellemmes et al 2020 spiegel et al 2017 a pt also referred to as behavioral type is defined as the within and between individual consistent behavior observed across time and or ecological context in response to a given stimulus sih et al 2012 pt have been shown to influence key metapopulation dynamics including propagule dispersal tendencies cote et al 2010a duckworth and badyaev 2007 myles gonzalez et al 2015 speeds maes et al 2013 distances cote et al 2010b competitive abilities capelle et al 2015 groen et al 2012 physiological states myles gonzalez et al 2015 parental care duckworth and badyaev 2007 home range size schirmer et al 2019 and colonization behaviors duckworth 2008 groen et al 2012 in order to influence metapopulation structure through dispersal a pt must at minimum affect both the spatial e g distance and temporal e g rate components of dispersal at ecologically relevant scales among other behaviors that characterize an individual s pt sociability or the propensity of an individual to associate with conspecifics cote and clobert 2007 has been suggested to influence both of these aspects of dispersal by mediating emigration and immigration probabilities as well as dispersal rates and distances cote et al 2010a cote et al 2010b and thus should be a strong determinant of metacommunity dynamics yet its role remains understudied sociability s potential influence on metapopulation structure stems from how local density dependence at the patch scale interacts with an individual s sociability to influence dispersal decisions as conceptualized and reviewed by cote et al 2010a asocial individuals i e those who prefer low conspecific densities disperse away from high density patches in search of preferable conditions patch density decreases as they disperse encouraging emigration of social individuals who seek higher density conditions through multiple iterations of this sequential stepwise dispersal process high and low density patches are established and go extinct over time and space the emergent structure of the metapopulation then becomes dependent on the members sociability distribution cote et al 2010a rehage et al 2016 some evidence exists for this at small spatial scales cote et al 2010b showed a negative relationship between sociability and individual dispersal distances in a fish mesocosm with asocial individuals having the largest dispersal distances similarly in a reptile macrocosm social individuals tended to disperse away from low density patches more readily than those starting in high density areas while the reverse was true of less social individuals cote and clobert 2007 however there is still a lack of information regarding how this translates to large spatial scales 10s 100 s of km and field settings and how sociability interacts with temporally varying environmental conditions that may influence dispersal ancillary evidence at larger scales exists such as the tendency of burrowing owls to disperse further from low conspecific density patches relative to high density patches moiron et al 2020 and more bold likely asocial bank voles tend to move the most schirmer et al 2019 but no field scale assessments of the role of sociability have been conducted nor modeled in this study we ask how does personality dependent dispersal pdd particularly sociability influence metapopulation structure in both space and time to do this we built a behavioral individual based model ibm parameterized with information from a real world metapopulation using this ibm we experimentally manipulated the sociability of individuals to test hypotheses on how variation in the personality composition of the metapopulation affected the dispersal of individuals and both local patch scale and regional across patches attributes of the metapopulation table 1 the premise of our model is that personality interacts with patch density as per cote et al 2010a s hypothesis both responding to and influencing it to determine emigration out of patches and thus affect metapopulation structure the goal of our model is to examine the consequences of this interaction of personality and patch density to determine individual patch and regional metapopulation attributes we hypothesized that the distance individuals traveled would be negatively related to their sociability as per cote et al 2010b at the patch scale patch sociability was expected to positively correlate with patch density as asocial individuals would actively seek to establish low density patches while social individuals would actively seek to congregate in high density patches finally at the regional scale we expected to observe a negative relationship between population sociability and the proportion of the landscape occupied as individuals in asocially skewed populations were expected to travel further from the source to achieve low densities and thus colonize more of the landscape understanding the effect of pdd on metapopulation structure is a particularly pressing need in aquatic systems while many aquatic habitats are temporally stable with functionally unlimited dispersal windows or periods of time suitable for dispersal and colonization of new habitat patches dispersal can be limited in other ephemeral landscapes for instance in rainfall driven pulsing systems the extent of marsh inundation and thus habitat connectivity among habitat patches varies seasonally and yearly with drought severity davis et al 2017 davis et al 2017 in an analysis of an ephemeral wetland metacommunity showed that precipitation and the presence of fishes closely tied to the rain induced flood levels were strong predictors of amphibian colonization during a multiyear period of severe climatic variability thus in addition to testing hypotheses about the role of pdd on individual dispersal inter and intra patch dynamics we tested a long vs a short dispersal window scenario table 1 at the individual level we hypothesize that a shorter dispersal window would lessen differences in the dispersal behavior of social vs asocial individuals resulting in a weaker relationship between individual sociability and distance traveled patch density was used both for model calibration and for testing a priori hypotheses as the mechanism being investigated enforces a positive relationship between patch density and sociability this pattern was used for model calibration how this pattern changes with dispersal windows however was not an enforced pattern with that said we did not anticipate a significant effect of dispersal window length on the association between population sociability and patch density at the regional scale we anticipated a weakening of the relationship between population sociability and the proportion of the landscape occupied at longer dispersal windows as these would allow for full exploration and thus possible saturation of the model environment resulting in all patches being occupied regardless of sociability 2 materials and methods 2 1 model overview our ibm was built to simulate the structuring of a metapopulation as a function of intraspecific variation in sociability and two dispersal window scenarios using netlogo v 5 3 1 wilensky 1999 the model simulated the departure of fish out of a source population their movement across a habitat matrix in search of suitable patches and their settlement upon encountering a suitable patch we varied the presence and skewness of sociability in this population of dispersing propagules in order to quantify their effects on metapopulation structure a core premise of the model incorporated in pattern calibration is that both departure and settlement decisions are governed by the interaction of local patch density and sociability cote et al 2010a which ultimately determines patch suitability e g dispersing asocial agents seek low densities while socials seek high density patches model details following grimm et al 2006 are provided in supplemental material 1 while results of sensitivity analyses are included in supplemental material 2 for parameters that were not empirically derived we used sensitivity analyses to evaluate their influence on model performance and selected parameter values based on these results while we did not strive to accurately represent the complexity of a real world metapopulation with our ibm our goal was to simulate realistic movement rules and patch densities at realistic spatiotemporal scales to do this the ibm was parameterized with data from an ephemeral wetland metapopulation and calibrated to produce an empirically derived cote et al 2010b positive relationship between sociability and patch density specifically our model design and rules were inspired by the rocky glades rg region of everglades national park enp this system was chosen since it is a spatially structured habitat with seasonal recolonization that is affected by the size of dispersal windows it has clearly defined patch boundaries and a source of dispersal propagules and at least one species sufficiently studied to parameterize the model agents blanchard 2018 davis et al 2005 goss et al 2014 kline et al 2014 rehage et al 2014 2009 sokol et al 2014 additionally the rg s ephemeral nature limits the confounding effects of prior knowledge knowledge of the environment from previous dispersal bouts i e mueller and fagan 2008 clobert et al 2009 and priority effects effects of existing colonists on potential new immigrants i e drake 1990 dibble et al 2014 on observable colonization processes however it is important to note that while this landscape was used as a source of parameters and rules the model is not meant as a fully accurate representation of the rocky glades ecosystem instead our goal is to examine the influence of biases in the proportion of social vs asocial individuals on dispersal and recolonization dynamics and thus to be extrapolated to other systems to facilitate this extrapolation further use and expansion of this work the final version of this model can be found on the netlogo modelling commons at http modelingcommons org browse one model 6581 blanchard 2021 2 2 modeled system the rg are a short hydroperiod karstic marsh covering an approximate area of 700 km2 with a maximum width of approximately 20 km flanking the northeastern region of enp mcvoy et al 2011 in our model the region was emulated with a 200 100 cell bounded rectangle with each cell representing 100m2 for a total world size of 20 10 km the rg are characterized by a large number of depressions in the exposed limestone matrix or solution holes typically ranging from less than 1 m2 to more than 8 m2 blanchard 2018 representing the deepest habitats in the landscape and distributed throughout graminoid marshes that are only seasonally connected loftus et al 1992 mcvoy et al 2011 rehage et al 2014 in the wet season these solution holes are part of a contiguous flooded landscape allowing for the dispersal of aquatic organisms in the dry season as water levels recede these solution holes are the only flooded habitats and serve as discrete patches and dry season refugia for aquatic organism loftus et al 1992 kobza et al 2004 rehage et al 2014 goss et al 2014 since the spatial distribution of solution holes has not yet been mapped for this model 50 cells were designated as solution holes and their locations were randomly generated once and fixed to coordinates fig 1 to control for the effect of patch distribution which is known to influence many ecological properties tscharntke et al 2012 allowing for model tenability and broad applicability to other systems under post drainage conditions of the modern everglades a typical fish dispersal window which is determined by the length of the wet season when the marsh matrix is flooded and fish are able to disperse among solution holes or from longer hydroperiod source populations is approximately four to six months long with severe droughts reducing this to less than one month kotun and renshaw 2014 loftus et al 1992 mcvoy et al 2011 under these drier conditions typically 90 100 of solution hole colonists fishes and macroinvertebrates such as crayfish and grass shrimp die annually as a result of solution holes drying before they can reflood with the onset of the wet season rehage et al 2014 limiting the potential of priority effects and prior knowledge in dispersal dynamics and effectively resetting colonization processes yearly the next wet season upon flooding as the solution holes and the surrounding short hydroperiod marsh become connected creating a dispersal window the area is recolonized from longer hydroperiod marshes in the periphery of the rg namely shark river slough which do not dry annually and are considered permanent habitat and the major source population for solution holes goss et al 2014 rehage et al 2014 accordingly in the model we created a single source of propagules along one boundary of the 200 km2 modeling world this source area was arbitrarily limited to 5 patches wide for the sake of model tenability and because movement within the source habitat was beyond the scope of this model yet allowed for stochasticity in initial conditions between model runs in addition we simulated two dispersal windows a 200 day period hereafter referred to as the long dispersal window to represent average hydrological conditions and a 20 days or short dispersal window to represent drought conditions 2 3 model agents agent design was inspired by the eastern mosquitofish gambusia holbrooki this is the most common fish inhabiting the rg kobza et al 2004 blanchard 2018 and is a congener of the western mosquitofish gambusia affinis used in previous sociability studies e g cote et al 2013 cote et al 2010a cote et al 2010b rehage et al 2005 this globally invasive genus deacon et al 2011 is also known to exhibit significant intraspecific variation in behavioral traits rehage et al 2016 at the onset of each model run 1000 agents were generated in the source habitat with the sociability of these individuals being randomly drawn from one of three focal distributions asocially skewed normal and socially skewed and from fourth treatment a no personality np control which lacked any influence of sociability fig 1 for the purposes of the model sociability was bound between 0 and 1 with higher values representing higher sociability each distribution was derived from beta distributions with the parameters asocial α 2 β 10 social α 10 β 2 and normal α 2 β 2 these are skewed left middle and skewed right respectively skewed distributions were chosen to investigate the effects of biased pt distributions relative to a normal trait distribution and the absence of personality selective forces founders effects and human induced change are expected to skew behavioral distributions in natural populations with important implications for both ecological and evolutionary processes conrad et al 2011 sih et al 2012 cote et al 2013 diaz pauli and sih 2017 2 4 model operation departure of agents from source habitat dispersal typically involves three stages departure from a living area moving between areas transience and settlement in a new area clobert et al 2009 in our model we simulated the dispersal of agents departing from a single fringe source population moving through the habitat matrix to encounter randomly placed habitat patches and making settlement decisions at each patch fig 1 departure movement and colonization decisions were made on a daily time step over the two dispersal windows 20 vs 200 days departure and settlement were influenced by the personality of the agent agent departure from the source habitat was determined by bottom up ranked sociability with asocial individuals moving first in accordance with cote et al 2010a if two agents had the same sociability score the tie was handled through random selection to determine which agent would move first if they choose to move at all for the no personality control order of departure was determined by using a random number generator 2 5 model operation transience of agents among patches when searching for patches the distance an agent moved daily was randomly chosen between 0 and 3 km shown to be a reasonable maximum daily movement distance for eastern mosquitofish this distance is approximately 15 of a maximum swimming speed of 22 cm s over 24 h gatto and trexler 2020 approximately 52 of the speeds observed by rehage and sih 2004 and is a reasonable estimate for a fish of this size compared to others videler and wardle 1991 during dispersal each agent used an area restricted search procedure an empirically supported search pattern used in previous behavioral ibms e g spiegel et al 2017 coupled with a random walk fagan and calabrese 2014 to find viable patches in the landscape in short this search procedure involved intensively searching local areas for some time then adaptively broadening the search after a certain amount of time has passed without finding a new patch the model accomplishes this with a small turn angle of 90 for intensive searching which is then expanded to a large turn angle of 225 after 30 of the dispersal window period has passed the values of these arbitrarily small and large turn angles as well as the critical amount of time required before switching between them henceforth referred to as panic time were chosen using sensitivity analyses the model was insensitive to the large turn angle while the panic time and small turn angle values were chosen as the smallest values after which sensitivity to changes was not observed supplemental materials 2 in order to make settlement decisions as agents moved each agent was afforded complete knowledge of the area within 750 m of the agent 25 of the 3 km maximum linear dispersal distance at the end of the day this knowledge in our model emulates the prospecting behavior individuals are known to engage in before settling e g valone 2007 davies and white 2018 the range of knowledge was assessed with a series of sensitivity analyses which indicated a high sensitivity to variation in this parameter supplementary materials 2 as the size of the prospected area increased so too did mean patch density and survivorship while the distance individuals traveled decreased within the range tested the 25 value used here provided sufficient survivorship to assess focal hypotheses table 1 without providing agents with excessive perfect knowledge 2 6 model operation settlement of agents in habitat patches once a patch was found by the agent the viability of a patch was assessed daily as a function of conspecific density for the duration of the dispersal window we used a maximum acceptable patch density of 40 conspecifics per patch which is one standard deviation above the mean density of eastern mosquitofish observed in rg solution holes blanchard 2018 if local conspecific density was acceptable the agent settled in the patch and stayed until conditions changed which were assessed daily as this model assumes that agents prefer a patch even one of poor quality to the matrix if the density was unacceptable then the agent still colonized but re evaluated and decided each day if it should wait for conditions to improve or emigrate from the patch each agent s acceptable density was defined as acceptable density individual sociability 40 this was a pattern oriented formula not empirically derived that is it produced the requisite positive relationship preferred density and individual sociability as per the source hypothesis from cote et al 2010a b future works should seek to derive a more empirically supported equation for acceptable density the agent s acceptable density was then broadened to include 25 of the calculated value the model s sensitivity to this arbitrary wiggle room around the acceptable density was assessed with a sensitivity analysis which showed that this parameter had little effect on model outcomes supplemental material 2 further as it is highly unlikely that fish in nature know the exact density of conspecifics in an area while settling we believe this provided a more realistic rule for settlement additionally this formulation of the wiggle room parameter produces less tolerance of net deviations from preferred densities in asocial individuals who prefer lower densities as compared to socials sociability has been linked to boldness a personality trait typically assessed as the probability of dispersing in unfamiliar territory myles gonzalez et al 2015 more asocial individuals tend to be more bold and thus more likely to disperse than asocials conrad et al 2011 myles gonzalez et al 2015 similarly the asocial tendency to disperse first cote et al 2010a could be interpreted as a lower tolerance threshold for unacceptable conditions this model emulates this pattern if the agent was waiting for conditions to improve at a patch we calculated the agent s hang out time h as where hmax is the maximum amount of time any individual will stay in an unacceptable density patch if a randomly drawn real number between 0 and hmax was h then the agent emigrated from the patch if not then the agent stayed for another day stayers experienced a decay in h for each day with an unacceptable patch density which acted to reduce their probability of staying h was included as an animal s perception of local conditions does not immediately switch in a binary fashion from acceptable to not sih 1992 a sensitivity analysis was performed to evaluate the impact of hmax as it was not empirically derived the model was not found to be sensitive to variation in this parameter above three days so a fixed value of three days was used for hmax supplemental materials 2 the rate of decay of h henceforth referred to as hang out decay was also evaluated with a sensitivity analysis which determined the model was sensitive to changes in this parameter at all levels but was most sensitive at values greater than 70 therefore a hang out decay of 70 was used supplemental materials 2 last the model assumed that agents remembered the last patch it evaluated and did not return to it until a new one had been found and evaluated a core assumption of the model is that animals are seeking different more favorable conditions when dispersing rehage et al 2016 and thus would not immediately return to a previously unacceptable patch less they become stuck without dispersing in other words the agent repeatedly returns to the same patch as without memory of it being unacceptable it met all the criteria needed for the agent to immigrate search parameters were functionally identical in the no personality np scenario except that agents had no basis for evaluating patches so they settled into any newly detected patch for these agents the probability of staying in the patch was purely random drawing a random integer between 1 and 101 emigrate if 50 and stay another day if 50 as with departure from the source agent movement out order when leaving a patch was determined by bottom up ranked sociability with asocial individuals moving first in accordance with cote et al 2010a if two agents had the same sociability score the tie was handled by random draw if any agent was not in a habitat patch solution hole at the end of the run dispersal window they died 2 7 statistical analyses at the individual scale differences in individual travel distances between socially informed asocially skewed socially skewed and neutral and uninformed populations np were evaluated with a kruskal wallace test followed by multiple comparison tests following zar 1999 using kruskal test and kruskalmc in the stats and pgirmess packages respectively in r r core 2012 relationships between distance traveled and individual sociability across the low and high dispersal window scenarios were evaluated with linear models using lm from stats the slopes of these models were compared with an analysis of covariance ancova using the aov function from the stats package at the local scale mean patch densities of all socially informed and uninformed populations were compared within and across the two dispersal windows using kruskal wallace and associated multiple comparisons tests to evaluate the relationship between patch density and population sociability we used a kendall s tau correlation using the mean population s sociability asocial 0 16 normal 0 5 social 0 83 as categorical ranked x values table 2 for each dispersal window and using cor test in the stats package the slopes of these relationships were compared using an ancova at the regional scale the proportion of the landscape occupied by socially informed and uninformed populations across dispersal windows were compared with kruskal wallace and subsequent multiple comparisons tests where appropriate on arcsine square root transformed proportions relationships between population sociability and the proportion of the landscape occupied were evaluated using a kendall s tau correlation using mean population sociability as the ranked x categorical value last to evaluate the relationship between mean patch sociability and distance from the source as well as mean patch density and distance from source we focused on the normally distributed distribution as it was the only scenario with all sociabilities present and np populations only these relationships were evaluated using linear models which were compared with ancovas distance from the source area was calculated as the x coordinate on a cartesian plane with the source boundary being x 5 mean patch sociability was calculated as the mean sociability of individuals within occupied patches at the end of the run either 200 or 20 days depending on length of dispersal window similarly mean patch density was calculated as the mean density of occupied patches at the end of the run 3 results 3 1 individual scale as predicted socially skewed populations traveled less across the model environment than asocials the distance traveled by agents was negatively related to their sociability under both long f 3 265 001 t 1807 r2 adj 0 45 p 0 001 and short dispersal windows f 170 370 t 412 8 r2 adj 0 04 p 0 001 but the slope was significantly steeper for the longer dispersal window f 2 599 566 p 0 001 indicating how shorter dispersal windows limit dispersal and the effect of personality fig 2 a with the longer dispersal window the disparity in distance traveled between asocially and socially skewed populations is greater such that with no dispersal limitation asocially skewed populations deviate more from the np populations across all

harrison et al 1988 gotelli 1991 govindan et al 2015 deans and chalcraft 2017 while environmental factors and interspecific interactions are known to be influential bond et al 2015 pringle 2003 individual personalities can also significantly contribute to the structuring of metapopulations through personality dependent dispersal pdd e g cote and clobert 2007 cote et al 2010a cote et al 2010b spiegel et al 2015 however few studies to date have observed the concept of pdd at realistic spatiotemporal scales and none have done so using sociability in this study we have demonstrated that individual sociability can have a significant structuring influence on assembling ephemeral metapopulations at multiple scales individual local and regional and that these influences vary depending on the length of the dispersal limitation resulting from variation in dispersal windows in the following sections we discuss four key findings from this model 1 the total distance a propagule dispersed was negatively related to their sociability a relationship which became stronger as the length of the dispersal window increased 2 patch density was positively associated with the sociability of the source population the strength of this relationship and mean patch densities increased as dispersal window length increased 3 the proportion of the landscape occupied was positively correlated with sociability though the slopes were so shallow that they may not be functionally relevant in nature and they did not vary with dispersal window length 4 mean patch sociability was negatively related to the distance from the source mirroring patch density distance decays typical of socially uniformed populations with shorter dispersal windows producing steeper slopes below we discuss the implications of these results at each scale and refine suggested hypotheses to be tested in future field studies 4 1 individual dispersal distance and sociability with our model we have shown that an individual s sociability can be negatively related to the distance they disperse at the modeled landscape scales as hypothesized by cote et al 2010a and that this relationship is temporally dependent fig 2 the temporal dependence could be seen as conceptually simple i e longer dispersal windows allow more time for individual differences to become accentuated however this is worth noting as it suggests that short dispersal windows could mask the relationship between sociability and dispersal in studies or under environmental contexts that do not permit enough time for differentiation to manifest among individuals in this model the dispersal windows were 20 days and 200 days however while exploring the sensitivity to dispersal window length we did investigate a broader range of dispersal windows the strength of this relationship increases with dispersal window length beyond the bounds of the presented data supplementary materials 2 figure 8 a key consequence of the negative relationship between individual sociability and travel distance is that it suggests a greater metabolic cost for asocially skewed populations as more energy would be spent on dispersal by this pt with possible metabolic and fitness consequences in round gobies neogobius melanostomus for example the most dispersive boldest individuals have higher resting metabolic rates are more aggressive and allocate less energy to reproductive efforts during dispersal myles gonzalez et al 2015 while this allows invasive round gobies to establish new populations quickly reproductive success is limited in these bold dominated populations until less bold more reproductive individuals immigrate they also offset the fitness consequences of their dispersive phenotype by re allocating energy back toward reproductive pathways when not dispersing in the absence of such compensatory mechanisms asociality would be maladaptive in stable environments assuming no added benefits to dispersal such as inbreeding avoidance territoriality or resource competition bonte et al 2012 conversely dynamic environments such as ephemeral wetlands may favor more dispersive phenotypes through stochastic extirpations of high density areas in such a case population resilience requires frequent establishment of satellite populations likely consisting of the more dispersive asocial individuals cote et al 2010a to recolonize extirpated patches i e the rescue effect gotelli 1991 depending on the frequency and severity of these selective disturbance events this could result in asocially skewed or normally distributed sociabilities by disproportionately removing non dispersing social individuals similarly it has been recently demonstrated that sociality can carry an increased predation risk for some taxa while dispersing due to the attractive effect of large groups to predators despite dilution and other shoal benefits botham et al 2005 brodin et al 2019 given this we hypothesize that metapopulations in stable environments will be socially skewed while those in dynamic environments will have asocially skewed or normally distributed sociabilities these hypothesized multigenerational patterns could be tested with an extension of our ibm that incorporates individual fitness multigenerational population dynamics and different degrees of environmental stochasticity similar to the more complex insalmo ibm i e railsback et al 2013 4 2 patch density and sociability our model demonstrated a positive association between patch density and population sociability fig 3 while this is an empirically supported pattern observed in fish cote et al 2010b and reptiles cote and clobert 2007 it was an imposed feature of the model however the significantly reduced densities under shorter dispersal windows are emergent from pdd this pattern was a function of individuals running out of time to search for optimal densities under the shorter dispersal windows resulting in low density patches with large numbers of agents dying at the end of the dispersal window while in the longer dispersal window they had more time to find patches and aggregate in more preferable densities while intuitive this provides another mechanism by which certain phenotypes may be maladaptive in environments with short dispersal windows the high densities observed in long dispersal windows may result in density dependent increases in stress levels especially among asocial individuals conversely the low densities typical of short dispersal windows may be stressful for social individuals while we are unaware of studies observing density dependent effects across a sociability gradient density dependent fitness is well documented in fish for example damselfish larvae preferentially settle in to higher density groups thus enhancing their daily survival probability while slowing the rate at which they mature in covariance with social status booth 1995 which has been shown to alter density dependent fitness via stress see baker et al 2013 for a review of stress in wildlife when chronic stress can have a wide array of physiological effects ranging from increased aggression to reduced fitness and degradation of organ systems baker et al 2013 mcewen and wingfield 2003 romero 2004 therefore following density dependent effects we hypothesize that consistent long dispersal windows in ephemeral habitats will select for social skewness whereas short or dynamic windows select for asocially skewed populations 4 3 landscape occupation and sociability the role of personality types in landscape occupancy is of interest to invasion ecologists as it is a key factor in assessing invader impact and the rate of spread of invasive species brownscombe and fox 2012 ricciardi et al 2013 it has long been hypothesized that more dispersive personalities in invading populations would result in faster landscape occupation see sih et al 2012 for discussion however we found very weak evidence for the hypothesized relationship between population sociability and landscape occupancy while some populations did differ significantly and the correlations were significantly different from zero the effect size is likely not functional in nature the lack of a strong relationship between sociability and landscape occupancy may be a function of two features of this model which are likely acting in concert first we note that under the short dispersal window the landscape has little saturation less than 30 while under the long dispersal window the landscape is nearly entirely saturated more than 98 in most runs but with a large number of lower end outliers the observed pattern may be a function of the length of the world or the amount of time permitted to explore i e the dispersal window such that a larger environment or intermediate dispersal window lengths may produce different patterns however the ecosystem size used in this model was based on a real system length the rocky glades as were the dispersal window scenarios so the observed patterns are worth consideration here with that said density distance traveled and survivorship were all found to be sensitive to intermediate dispersal window values supplementary materials 2 second the short exploration times interacting with the random walks used by our agents may also arbitrarily influence this pattern random walks are widely used in ibms as they have been demonstrated to approximate animal movement patterns proulx et al 2013 fagan and calabrese 2014 they do however assume a total lack of directional bias and an absence of prior knowledge this results in a tendency to heavily explore an area before making random long dispersal movements even with the area restricted search procedure used in this study and others i e spiegel et al 2017 recent laboratory experiments have suggested the addition of directional biases and conditional switches to dispersal tendencies i e only willing to disperse under certain conditions may more accurately reflect gambusia spp movement hoch et al 2019 however gambusia spp our model taxa are known to colonize the rocky glades immediately following re flood start of the dispersal window and have been observed moving in all directions lacking a directional bias throughout most of the dispersal window in the field goss et al 2014 thus future field and simulation studies should further evaluate the hypothesis that landscape occupancy is related to population sociability using different movement processes or species specific dispersal capabilities 4 4 sociability over space in the cote et al 2010a hypothesis asocial individuals traveled further into the landscape establishing low density patches at larger distances from source populations while not explicitly discussed by cote et al 2010a the net result of this mechanism would be negative relationships between mean patch sociability and distance from the source as well as density and distance from the source as more social individuals lagged behind the asocial individuals dominating the dispersal front our model generated both such patterns as a function of differences in individual sociability lower population densities at greater distances from sources reflect the density distance decay function typically imposed by neutral models of species assembly hubbell 2001 here we show that a population density distance decay relationship can emerge from variation in behavioral types in other words metapopulations structured through the niche process of pdd produce the same negative relationships between distance from the source and patch density as neutrally structured metapopulations this novel mechanism for producing a classic pattern may shed additional light into one of ecology s longest running debates niche vs neutrality see adler et al 2007 alonso et al 2006 mutshinda and o hara 2011 we suggest a behaviorally based re evaluation of seemingly neutrally structured metasystems i e metapopulations metacommunities metaecosystems as there may be cryptic niche structuring mechanisms at work in the case of managed metasystems such as our model system it is of interest to know how these cryptic niche mechanisms interact with shifting climatic parameters that may affect dispersal opportunities 4 5 scaling up the study of sociability we have uncovered two key considerations for sociability at landscape scales and under environmental heterogeneity first individual personalities can structure metasystems as a cryptic form of niche structuring thus pdd can be integrated into ecological theory via niche theories see adler et al 2007 and mutshinda and o hara 2011 for discussions on integrating niche and neutral theories for metasystem assembly specifically our data support the inclusion of individual personalities in calculations of dispersal rates cote et al 2011 cote et al 2010a probability of patch occupancy estimates of patch density over space and the individual consequences of dispersal second the effects of sociability can be masked and dampened by environmental factors as pdd is temporally dependent any environmental influence on the length of the dispersal window e g changes to season length will result in alterations to the structuring influence of pdd if the dispersal window is too short pdd effects may not materialize if it is particularly long then most effects will be accentuated studies into the effect of pdd will need to carefully consider the temporal component of their study design based on these points here we refine our initial hypotheses table 1 with the hope of inspiring field based evaluations of the integration of personality dependent dispersal and metasystem theory table 2 each of these hypotheses could and should be evaluated in a long term field based metapopulation study where individual animals are assayed for sociability see cote et al 2013 and cote et al 2010a for methodology and tracked in real time e g acoustic telemetry dhellemmes et al 2020 with regular patch density surveys 5 conclusions overall our results support the growing evidence that individual personalities are particularly important in the field of metasystem ecology as they influence dispersal rates and density dependent processes in agreement with past studies we demonstrate here that individual personalities can influence metapopulation properties it follows that similar effects exist at other metasystem scales i e metacommunity and metaecosystem as well future works should seek to evaluate the hypotheses we propose table 2 and fig 6 as well as the broader influences of individual personalities at each metasystem scale for us to better understand how these cryptic niche determining traits form the patterns we observe in nature through this personality based ibms such as presented here can be used to inform effective adaptive management strategies and behaviorally influenced sampling techniques

plant and farm scales they also involved numerous parameters 33 in case of the rodríguez et al 2011 s model and more than 100 for the caf2007 and dynacof models making their application at larger spatial scales i e regional or provincial scale very challenging furthermore the few studies that dealt with robusta coffee focused mainly on the impacts of climate change and variability on coffee productivity and distribution land suitability e g davis et al 2012 bunn et al 2015 craparo et al 2015 in this study we aimed at building and evaluating the performance of a simple process based biophysical model hereafter referred to as a robusta model for predicting robusta coffee yield at the regional scale in vietnam the model was built based on the main phenological processes represented in the more complex models cited previously the caf2007 rodríguez et al 2011 s and dynacof models but in a much simpler manner the model was calibrated and validated using field data collected during a 10 year 2008 2017 survey and official provincial coffee yield and climate station data for the major robusta coffee producing provinces in vietnam with an overarching goal of developing a process based model for long term studies of the impacts of climate variability on coffee yield and productivity at the regional scale the performance of the robusta model was further assessed using remote sensing satellite and model based gridded climate data which are typically used as alternative in these regions when long term climate stations data are not available 2 materials and methods 2 1 description of the robusta model the robusta model is a simplified process based biophysical model that simulates the potential growth and development of coffee plants on a daily time step based on weather data minimum and maximum temperature solar radiation and rainfall and information from the previous growing season i e harvest date and yield the model is inspired by a prior model by van oijen et al 2010b which was developed to estimate the potential productivity of arabica coffee agroforestry systems the main output of the robusta model at the end of the simulation period is the yield at the regional scale three main processes are involved during the simulation 1 radiation interception by leaves according to the beer lambert s law swinehart 1962 2 conversion of the intercepted radiation into biomass based on the radiation use efficiency rue and 3 accumulation of crop biomass and allocation to the different plant organs according to source sink rules specific to coffee plants damatta et al 2007 van oijen et al 2010b an overview of the model is illustrated in fig 1 no disease or pest impacts on yield are considered as such the predicted yield value corresponds to a potential value in the following sub sections we describe the main equations used for simulating biomass production and assimilates partitioning into the different plant organs 2 1 1 biomass production active growth the phenology of robusta coffee trees includes two stages the vegetative phase occurring before flowering and the reproductive phase or cherry development between flowering and harvest phenology is driven by the accumulation of growing degree days the daily biomass production is simulated in two steps first the light interception is calculated using the beer lambert law

interception efficiency photosynthetically active fraction of solar radiation and extinction coefficient respectively unitless then the intercepted solar radiation is converted into biomass as follows 2 δ b i o m e b p a r i c o s t r e s p i b i o m v e g s t r e s s where δ b i o m is the daily increment in biomass g m 2 eb is the light energy conversion efficiency g mj 1 c o s t r e s p i refers

applied to the daily biomass production based on water stress levels details are provided in sections 2 1 5 and 2 3 prior to flowering newly produced biomass is allocated as vegetative biomass wood and leaves a factor related to pruning is considered during this phase following van oijen et al 2010b the equations are as follows 3 b i o m w o o d 1 k p r n w o o d b i o m w o o d 4 b i o m l e a

pruning of the wood biomass and leaves biomasses set according to the average cultural practices of pruning both are unitless 2 1 2 biomass partitioning the onset of flowering was modelled as the first day of the year exceeding a threshold of cumulative growing degree days since robusta coffee farmers in vietnam do irrigate their crops to break buds dormancy and enable synchronous flowering events as much as possible given fruit production is the strongest carbohydrates sink in coffee cannell 1976 1985 vaast et al 2005 damatta et al 2007 2008 from flowering onwards the newly produced biomass is allocated in priority to cherry growth i e fruit demand fruit demand is related to the number of fruits and is assumed proportional to the wood biomass grown after the last flowering and the potential of fruit growth it is calculated as follows 5 b i o m f r u i t d e m u n i t f r u i t d e m n f where nf is the number of fruits number per m2 and u n i t f r u i t d e m corresponds to the potential of fruit growth u n i t f r u i t d e m follows a sigmoidal function according to cannell 1985 eq 6 unitfruitdem and nf are calculated as follows 6 u n i t f r u i t d e m δ s t t 1 s

st is sum of temperature above the base temperature c temprec is the sum of degree days between flowering and harvest degree days and cfruit is the maximum fruit biomass unitless if the fruit demand is not satisfied by the newly produced biomass we assumed that a proportion of leaf biomass is remobilized although we referred for the assumption to previously reported results on the decline of foliar non structural carbohydrates and starch in arabica coffee chaves et al 2012 marias et al 2017 future research would help elucidate such a remobilization process in case of robusta coffee the formula of leaf biomass remobilization in the robusta model is as follows 8 p o t r e m l e a f k r e m b i o m l e a v e s where potremleaf is the potential remobilization of biomass from leaves g m 2 and krem is the maximum rate of remobilization unitless 2 1 3 biomass reallocation into leaves and woody parts of the tree passive growth the elaboration of bean yield is based primarily on the determination of the potential number of fruits according to the wood newly formed each coffee cherry acts as a priority sink of newly produced assimilates vaast et al 2005 damatta et al 2007 when the fruit demand is satisfied the newly produced assimilates are reallocated to the vegetative growth the daily proportion of assimilates δ b i o m v e g is thus allocated to leaves δ b i o m l e a v e s and wood δ b i o m w o o d as follows 9 δ b i o m l e a v e s δ b i o m v e g l p e r c e n t b i o m l e a v e s t s e n e r e m l e a f 10 δ b i o m w o o d 1 l p e r c e n t δ b i o m v e g where δ

biomass in the newly formed biomass unitless tsene is the senescence rate of leaves and remleaf is the biomass of leaves that was removed to supply the demand from fruits g m 2 2 1 4 initialization of the wood and leaves biomass at the start of the simulation we assumed that the coffee tree has already started producing fruits at the start of each simulation i e date of the harvest in simulation

practices on farms damatta et al 2007 silva et al 2009 costa et al 2019 we assumed that the initial wood biomass and lai values are proportional to the bean yields from the previous season thus in this study we estimated the initial lai value as l a i i n i t k l a i y i e l d r e f i l a i where klai and ilai are two coefficients related to the above ground biomass and yield after the previous harvest both unitless 2 1 5 water stress factors based on crop water requirements water stress can affect coffee growth differently depending on the phenological stage it is therefore important to consider water stress factors accordingly to account for crop water requirement cwr according to the phenological stages we considered three main periods november december january april and may october for characterizing the coffee growth period across the study provinces cwr is defined here as the depth of water needed to meet the water loss through evapotranspiration etc of a disease free

are normally above 24 c on average the average monthly solar radiation across the provinces ranges from 430 to 700 mj m 2 official yield data 2001 2017 sourced from the general statistics office of vietnam gsov 2017 as well as farm data collected during the 2008 2017 surveys byrareddy et al 2019 2020 were used details about the methodology of data collection during the surveys can be found in byrareddy et al 2019 and byrareddy et al 2020 coffee yield data from 2005 onwards were considered for dak lak and dak nong because dak nong was officially created in 2004 thus dak lak data over 2001 2004 used to include those of dak nong in the calibration and model testing steps given the absence of official yield data in 2006 for all the provinces the corresponding missing yield data were replaced by the average of observed yields over the entire period note that robusta coffee accounts for 95 96 of the reported coffee production in vietnam arabica coffee representing the remaining proportion usda 2019 since no detailed information about the annual production of the two coffee varieties were available at the provincial scale from the official statistics and because robusta is dominant in the central highlands arabica is mainly grown in the northern regions of the country we attributed the reported yield value in each year to robusta coffee observed daily climate data for the 2000 2014 period and gridded daily climate data for the 2000 2017 period were used in this study these climate data included maximum and minimum temperatures solar radiation and rainfall the spatial distribution of grids across the study regions is presented in fig 2 for each of the study provinces up to four grids were considered based upon the closeness of the centroid of the grid to the robusta cultivation areas table 1 observed climate data were sourced from the national centre for hydro meteorological forecasting of vietnam nchmf 2014 gridded data were retrieved from the nasa power website https power larc nasa gov the observed climate data for 2000 2014 were available for dak lak gia lai and lam dong they were used for model calibration and first validation the gridded data were used for further evaluation of the robusta model 2 3 calculations of coffee water requirements and determination of coefficients for water stress levels cwrs were calculated following the formula cwr e t 0 k c where et0 is the reference evapotranspiration and kc is the crop coefficient the crop coefficients used for the calculations were retrieved from amarasinghe et al 2015 and byrareddy et al 2020 table 2 cwrs were computed under standard conditions i e disease free non limiting nutrient and soil water conditions and as such corresponds to the potential crop evapotranspiration et0 was calculated using the hargreaves and samani hs equation hargreaves and samani 1985 hargreaves and allen 2003 12 e t 0 0 408 0 0023 r a t m a x t m i n 2 17 8 t m a x t m i n 0 5 where ra is the extra terrestrial radiation mj m 2 day 1 tmax and tmin are the daily maximum and minimum temperatures respectively c et0 is expressed in mm day 1 the hs method was chosen because of its simplicity and the variables required the extra terrestrial radiation can be calculated for any day and location only maximum and minimum temperatures are required nonetheless it should be noted that the hs method can result in et0 overestimation in high humidity conditions or et0 underestimation when high speed winds conditions prevail allen et al 1998 droogers and allen 2002 depending on the phenological stage and water stress levels expressed through the number of days with daily rainfall below cwr different coefficients of biomass reduction were applied table 3 the values of these coefficients were derived from information collected during the 2008 2017 surveys byrareddy et al 2020 and expert knowledge i e experienced agronomists and crop physiologists expert knowledge was necessary for defining the percentage of daily biomass reduction according to the phenological stage and water stress level under the environmental conditions in vietnam we also checked the literature for such relationships in other coffee producing regions e g carr 2001 damatta 2004 nguyen 2005 wang et al 2015 2 4 calibration and validation of the robusta model 2 4 1 robusta coffee calendar in vietnam the robusta coffee calendar in vietnam can be divided into five periods the flower bud initiation and blossoming occurring during january to march the fruit setting during april the cherry development during may to august the maturation stage during september and october and the ripening harvest occurring during october to december these periods are indicative and were used for the modelling purpose thus even though farmers applied irrigation for synchronous blossoming the actual growth stages and durations may vary across a given province and from one province to another 2 4 2 model calibration initial parameter values were derived from the caf2007 model van oijen et al 2010b ovalle rivera et al 2020 for the model calibration the majority of the parameters table 4 were varied individually within a range of plausible values these ranges were based on published studies undertaken across the study regions in vietnam e g d haeze et al 2003 marsh 2007 or elsewhere in a robusta coffee producing country e g marin et al 2005 damatta et al 2007 van oijen et al 2010b 2010a rodríguez et al 2011 ovalle rivera et al 2020 or from field experimental data from the centro agronómico tropical de investigación y enseñanza catie research station costa rica thus the calibration was carried by adjusting model parameters so that the predicted yields satisfactorily compared with the official provincial yields that is at each variation of a given parameter value the predicted yields were compared to the observed ones until the best combination i e the model which outputs resulted in fewer errors was found the root mean square error rmse and mean absolute percentage error mape were used as statistical indicators their respective formulas are provided in section 2 4 3 additionally a visual assessment was also carried out to verify how well the model simulates observed interannual yield variability in this study the calibration of the robusta model was performed using the observed climate and yield data for lam dong for the 2001 2014 period to simulate coffee growth using the robusta model the start date of each season was set at 1 november of the previous calendar year and the simulations were carried out up to 31 october of the following year the list of model parameters and their values after calibration is presented in table 4 2 4 3 model evaluations two model evaluation steps were carried out in this study first the model was validated using the observed climate data and official provincial coffee yield data for the 2000 2014 period for dak lak and gia lai these data were not used in the calibration step the second model evaluation involved the use of gridded climate data for this performance assessment we hypothesized that the robusta model can achieve a performance similar to that resulting from using climate station data since observed climate data are either scarce or not readily available in these coffee producing regions freely available satellite and model based gridded climate data are used as an alternative such an evaluation is also justified given the increased reliance on these climate data for studies at larger spatial scales because up to four grids were selected amongst the grid falling within a given province table 1 fig 2 we explored two options of gridded climate data aggregation and use within the robusta model the first option consisted in simulating separately the coffee yield for all the selected grids falling within the province in such cases the historical provincial yield was used as reference yield for each of the grids the predicted yield at the province scale was calculated as the average of all grid level predicted yields the second option consisted in running the robusta model using the average values of grid level climate data as inputs resulting in a unique predicted yield for the province 2 4 4 assessment of model performance predicted yields were compared against official reported yields to assess the performance of the robusta model three statistical indicators were used for this purpose rmse mape and the willmott s index of agreement wi willmott et al 2012 their respective equations are as follows 13 r m s e 1 n i 1 n y i m y i p 2 14 m a p e 1 n t 1 n y i m y i p y i m 15 w i 1 i 1 n y i m y i p i 1 n y i p y m y i m y m 2 where n is the number of sample years y i m is the ith observed value y m is the mean observed value and y i p is the ith predicted value the rmse gives the weighted variations in errors residual between the predicted and observed yields mape is an accuracy measure of the forecast quality it is a better index than absolute error measures in comparing model performance amongst different regions given the likely differences in their average historical yields chipanshi et al 2015 the lesser value of mape or rmse the better the model performs wi is a descriptive measure related to the ratio between the model error magnitudes and to the magnitudes of the perfect model deviation and observed deviation willmott et al 2012 wi ranges from 1 to 1 the closer the wi is to 1 the better the model predictions are all data and statistical analyses were performed using r version 4 0 0 r core team 2020 nasa power climate data were retrieved using the r package nasapower sparks 2018 3 results 3 1 calibration and validation of the robusta model the calibration and validation of the robusta model using observed climate data for lam dong dak lak and gia lai resulted in acceptable model performance overall the mape in the calibration step was 10 with a rmse of 0 24 t ha 1 and wi 0 740 fig 3 the validation of the model using independent datasets from the provinces of dak lak and gia lai showed a slight increase in prediction errors compared to those obtained in the calibration step rmse 0 33 and 0 31 t ha 1 respectively with corresponding mape of 14 and 13 fig 3 the narrow variability of reported coffee yield in dak lak observed yields during 2005 2014 varied generally between 2 1 and 2 5 t ha 1 fig 3 could explain the relatively low value of wi 0 184 for this province an example of the simulation of wood leaves and fruit dry matter using the robusta model along with the daily variation of potential crop water stress for the province gia lai is shown in fig 4 in gia lai the period spanning mid november 2009 to may 2010 was generally dry with the first three months of 2010 recording no rain fig 4b such dry weather conditions affected negatively the overall biomass production wood and leaves and in lesser proportion fruit setting fruit setting was at its earlier stages fig 4a 3 2 model performance according to the data aggregation methods two options of climate data aggregation were tested with the robusta model to further assess the model performance when using gridded climate data running the model under two different options of data aggregation did not result in substantial differences in the outcomes overall the robusta model performed well in both cases with mape 12 table 5 for dak lak dak nong gia lai and lam dong similar model performance was obtained for both aggregation methods 10 dak lak and gia lai and 11 lam dong prediction errors in both cases of data aggregation with corresponding rmse of 0 26 and 0 28 t ha 1 table 5 though the prediction errors slightly increased for dak nong when the average of climate data of the selected grids was considered as model inputs mape from 9 to 10 table 5 the relatively highest prediction errors when using gridded climate data were found for kon tum where only one grid was considered mape 12 and rmse 0 29 t ha 1 table 5 in this province particularly the robusta model tended to underestimate the reported coffee yields figs 5 and 6 for the remainder of provinces the scatterplots showed fairly good distribution around the 1 1 line figs 5 and 6 the agreements between predicted and observed yields based on wi values were higher for gia lai kon tum and lam dong wi 0 700 table 5 confirming the good capabilities of the robusta model for predicting coffee yield in these provinces for provinces with relatively low inter annual yield variability dak lak and dak nong fig s1 such agreements between predicted and observed yields were less obvious wi the error magnitudes in predictions did not capture very well deviations in observed yields figs 5 and 6 4 discussion 4 1 the robusta model as a tool for investigating the impacts of climate variability on coffee production coffee yields in dak lak dak nong gia lai kon tum and lam dong have seen a sharp increase over the past 10 years compared to their levels in the early 2000s fig s1 such change can be explained by a combination of factors including infrastructure investment in irrigation and strong reliance on irrigation in coffee farms the affordability of fertilizer and the increasing adoption of new management techniques i e grafting in provinces such as lam dong marsh 2007 byrareddy et al 2019 2020 the central highlands is a drought prone region nguyen 2005 vu et al 2015 given the projected changes in climate patterns in vietnam ipcc 2014 which could potentially affect negatively agricultural productions and the livelihoods of millions of farmers it is important to investigate the impacts of climate variability on yield and production for crops like robusta coffee the robusta model is specifically designed to simulate and predict robusta coffee potential yield at the regional scale it involves the main growth and development processes altered by climate in this study results show that the model was able to predict satisfactorily the robusta coffee yield for dak lak dak nong gia lai kon tum and lam dong thus the robusta model provides a solid basis for assessing the impacts of rainfall or temperature variability on coffee yields at the provincial level and can be an important tool for regional impacts studies in vietnam or other coffee growing regions or countries with the characterization of water stress days throughout the coffee season and the likely impacts these stresses can have on biomass production and yield one can simulate the potential water required to alleviate the stress and improve crop performance such a feature can be strengthened to explore the potential impact of irrigation on coffee yield this will require nevertheless further research work to make the model suitable for such tasks it is expected to develop a complete integrated scf robusta coffee yield forecasting system which will use categorical indicators of climate drivers e g oceanic niño index southern oscillation index tropical pacific sea surface temperatures and simulated coffee yields to provide probabilistic yield forecasts this will allow for examining probabilistic yield anomalies likelihood of exceeding the long term median or average associated with the prevailing climate pattern in the year of forecast throughout the coffee season at the provincial scale 4 3 limitations and future directions in spite of the encouraging performance of the robusta model some limitations were found in this study that indicates a need for further research there were no detailed data about the annual productions of robusta coffee from the official statistics used in this study the reported yields included production data of both robusta and arabica coffees even though robusta coffee production is largely dominant approximately 95 96 of the total production usda 2019 we did not derive its production from the reported statistics to avoid any additional uncertainties in the modelling approach detailed robusta coffee yield production information could potentially be sourced from local coffee industry stakeholders such as agricultural commodities trading companies or the vietnam coffee and cocoa association vicofa the availability of such data would help further assess the performance and improve the robusta model the model does not simulate the response of coffee growth to fertilizer rates byrareddy et al 2019 showed that fertilizer management practices were largely homogenous between years at each of the surveyed farms in dak lak dak nong gia lai and lam dong one can assume that the reported official yield at the regional scale reflects at least partly such fertilizer use long term experimental studies involving wider ranges of fertilizer rates across the study provinces are needed to provide further insights into the impacts of varying fertilizer rates on robusta coffee yields and enable the inclusion of such aspects in the model with the aim of keeping the structure of the model as simple as possible neither pests and diseases impacts nor soil nitrogen processes were considered the integration of such aspects can also be explored further to reduce prediction errors and broaden the capabilities of the model or to explore this model where fertilization practices are not so homogeneous the alternation of years with high and low bean production known as biennial growth was not considered in our model at the provincial scale such biennial pattern is masked since coffee growing areas encompass a range of farms with different ages of trees and pruning practices moreover the biennial production cycle could potentially be off set by irrigation as this is a typical management practice in robusta coffee farms in vietnam byrareddy et al 2020 assessing the biennial production cycle at the regional scale in vietnam using satellite remote sensing data bernardes et al 2012 and implementing such patterns within the robusta model can be investigated in future research given the difficulty of determining accurate lai values we used modelled empirical coefficient values based on the yield of the previous season because of the exhaustiveness of methods proposed and the fact destructive sampling of trees is often required costa et al 2019 the determination of lai in coffee farms can be challenging coltri et al 2015 proposed an empirical relationship for calculating the above ground biomass and lai in arabica coffee using simple field measurements and agrometeorological data in brazil although substantial seasonal variations were found in their study their approach can be investigated in the case of vietnam and help define more accurately the initial values of the aboveground biomass and lai in the model remotely sensed lai data at the start of the season or at critical phenological stages can be explored as an alternative as well the effect of canopy architecture and heterogeneity on light interception and photosynthesis was not considered in the robusta model canopy architecture influences light interception and distribution transpiration and the whole plant gas exchange in coffee melke and fetene 2014 rodrigues et al 2016 charbonnier et al 2017 a good understanding of the relationships between canopy architecture and light interception or the effects of cultural practices on irradiance interception and canopy photosynthesis in robusta coffee farms in vietnam would help improve the overall model accuracy given the variability of cropping techniques e g pruning and environmental conditions which can affect coffee crown architecture and canopy photosynthesis damatta 2004 damatta et al 2007 investigating such relationships remains an interesting open question for future research in this study the definition of parameter and coefficient values table 2 was based on expert knowledge and empirical relationships although the model parameters were varied within the reported plausible ranges a reparameterization along with updated coefficient values for water stress may be required for using the robusta model in different environments i e a different country nevertheless the modelling approach used in this study could be readily adapted to a different robusta coffee producing region providing the relevant data are available 5 conclusions we presented a dynamic biophysical model the robusta model which processes climate data and information from the previous coffee season to simulate robusta coffee growth and predict yields at the regional scale evaluating the performance of the robusta model indicated good agreements between predicted and official reported coffee yields for the five major coffee producing in vietnam the model presented in this paper is one of the first to deal with robusta coffee yield at the regional scale it was kept simple because of the lack of quantitative information at the regional scale to build a parameter rich model the simplicity of the model does not imply that it could not be responsive to the key climate factors driving coffee growth and development the robusta model was designed as such to be ultimately used within a scf crop production forecasting system to support decision making throughout the robusta coffee supply chain while managing climate risks despite the satisfactory model performance obtained for most of the vietnamese coffee producing provinces there are aspects that need to be addressed for future improvements of the present robusta model for its application in different coffee producing regions or countries which will require long term datasets on the phenological

1 and 9 to 14 respectively willmott s index of agreement wi was greater than or equal to 0 710 in model evaluation steps for three out of five provinces the relatively low values of wi were found for provinces with relatively low inter annual yield variability i e dak lak and dak nong moreover the model was successfully tested using remote sensing satellite and model based gridded climate data

population model of gutierrez et al 1998 amongst the specificities of the rodríguez et al 2011 s model are the incorporation of both the vegetative and the reproductive demands to predict the photosynthetic rate and incorporation of the dynamics of cohorts of reproductive organs and reserve compartment van oijen et al 2010b proposed a plot scale dynamic model for coffee agroforestry systems caf2007 which simulates the processes underlying berry production under shaded or unshaded conditions the model allows for investigating the impacts on coffee berry production of cultural practices such as pruning spacing thinning and fertilising along with shade tree species management the caf2007 was recently modified to improve the calculation of flowering date and the modelling of biennial production patterns and was tested successfully in different coffee growing regions of nicaragua and costa rica van oijen et al 2010b ovalle rivera et al 2020 it was also applied in east

in coffee agroforestry systems according to shade tree species and management all the aforementioned models were developed initially for arabica coffee and most often have been applied to studies at plant and farm scales they also involved numerous parameters 33 in case of the rodríguez et al 2011 s model and more than 100 for the caf2007 and dynacof models making their application at larger spatial scales i e regional or provincial scale very challenging furthermore the few studies that dealt with robusta coffee focused mainly on the impacts of climate change and variability on coffee productivity and distribution land suitability e g davis et al 2012 bunn et al 2015 craparo et al 2015 in this study we aimed at building and evaluating the performance of a simple process based biophysical model hereafter referred to as a robusta model for predicting robusta coffee yield at the regional scale in vietnam the model was built based on the main phenological processes represented in the more complex models cited previously the caf2007 rodríguez et al 2011 s and dynacof models but in a much simpler manner the model was calibrated and validated using field data collected during a 10 year 2008 2017 survey and official provincial coffee yield and climate station data for the major robusta coffee producing provinces in vietnam with an overarching goal of developing a process based model for long term studies of the impacts of climate variability on coffee yield and productivity at the regional scale the performance of the robusta model was further assessed using remote sensing satellite and model based gridded climate data which are typically used as alternative in these regions when long term climate stations data are not available 2 materials and methods 2 1 description of the robusta model the robusta model is a simplified process based biophysical model that simulates the potential growth and development of coffee plants on a daily time step based on weather data minimum and maximum temperature solar radiation and rainfall and information from the previous growing season i e harvest date and yield the model is inspired by a prior model by van oijen et al 2010b which was developed to estimate the potential productivity of arabica coffee agroforestry systems the main output of the robusta model at the end of the simulation period is the yield at the regional scale three main processes are involved during the simulation 1 radiation interception by leaves according to the beer lambert s law swinehart 1962 2 conversion of the intercepted radiation into biomass based on the radiation use efficiency rue and 3 accumulation of crop biomass and allocation to the different plant organs according to source sink rules specific to coffee plants damatta et al 2007 van oijen et al 2010b an overview of the model is illustrated in fig 1 no disease or pest impacts on yield are considered as such the predicted yield value corresponds to a potential value in the following sub sections we describe the main equations used for simulating biomass production and assimilates partitioning into the different plant organs 2 1 1 biomass production active growth the phenology of robusta coffee trees includes two stages the vegetative phase occurring before flowering and the reproductive phase or cherry development between flowering and harvest phenology is driven by the accumulation of growing degree days the daily biomass production is simulated in two steps first the light interception is calculated using the beer lambert law

interception efficiency photosynthetically active fraction of solar radiation and extinction coefficient respectively unitless then the intercepted solar radiation is converted into biomass as follows

applied to the daily biomass production based on water stress levels details are provided in sections 2 1 5 and 2 3 prior to flowering newly produced biomass is allocated as vegetative biomass wood and leaves a factor related to pruning is considered during this phase following van oijen et al 2010b the equations are as follows 3 b i o m w o o d 1 k p r n w o o d b i o m w o o d 4 b i o m l e a v e s 1 k p r n l e a v e s b i o m l e a v e s where biomwood and biomleaves are wood and leaves biomasses respectively both expressed in g m 2 kprn wood and kprn leaves are the average percentage of pruning of the wood biomass and leaves biomasses set according to the average cultural practices of pruning both are unitless 2 1 2 biomass partitioning the onset of flowering was modelled as the first day of the year exceeding a threshold of cumulative growing degree days since robusta coffee farmers in vietnam do irrigate their crops to break buds dormancy and enable synchronous flowering events as much as possible given fruit production is the strongest carbohydrates sink in coffee cannell 1976 1985 vaast et al 2005 damatta et al 2007 2008 from flowering onwards the newly produced biomass is allocated in priority to cherry growth i e fruit demand fruit demand is related to the number of fruits and is assumed proportional to the wood biomass grown after the last flowering and the potential of fruit growth it is calculated as follows 5 b i o m f r u i t d e m u n i t f r u i t d e m n f where nf is the number of fruits number per m2 and u n i t f r u i t d e m corresponds

st is sum of temperature above the base temperature c temprec is the sum of degree days between flowering and harvest degree days and cfruit is the maximum fruit biomass unitless if the fruit demand is not satisfied by the newly produced biomass we assumed that a proportion of leaf biomass is remobilized although we referred for the assumption to previously reported results on the decline of foliar non structural carbohydrates and starch in arabica coffee chaves et al 2012 marias et al 2017 future research would help elucidate such a remobilization process in case of robusta coffee the formula of leaf biomass remobilization in the robusta model is as follows 8 p o t r e m l e a f k r e m b i o m l e a v e s where potremleaf is the potential remobilization of biomass from leaves g m 2 and krem is the maximum rate of remobilization unitless 2 1 3 biomass reallocation into leaves and woody parts of the tree passive growth the elaboration of bean yield is based primarily on the determination of the potential number of fruits according to the wood newly formed each coffee cherry acts as a priority sink of newly produced assimilates vaast et al 2005 damatta et al 2007 when the

practices on farms damatta et al 2007 silva et al 2009 costa et al 2019 we assumed that the initial wood biomass and lai values are proportional to the bean yields from the previous season thus in

consider water stress factors accordingly to account for crop water requirement cwr according to the phenological stages we considered three main periods november december january april and may october for characterizing the coffee growth period across the study provinces cwr is defined here as the depth of water needed to meet the water loss through evapotranspiration etc of a disease free crop growing in large fields under non restricting soil conditions including soil water and fertility and achieving full production potential under the given growing environment doorenbos and pruitt 1992 the details of the calculations are provided in section 2 3 2 2 study area and data data for the five robusta coffee producing provinces in the central highlands region of vietnam dak lak dak nong gia lai kon tum and lam dong were used in this study the central highlands is dominated by a humid tropical climate the total annual rainfall varies between 1800 and 2900 mm maximum temperatures are normally above 24 c on average the average monthly solar radiation across the provinces ranges from 430 to 700 mj m 2 official yield data 2001 2017 sourced from the general statistics office of vietnam gsov 2017 as well as farm data collected during the 2008 2017 surveys byrareddy et al 2019 2020 were used details about the methodology of data collection during the surveys can be found in byrareddy et al 2019 and byrareddy et al 2020 coffee yield data from 2005 onwards were considered for dak lak and dak nong because dak nong was officially created in 2004 thus dak lak data over 2001 2004 used to include those of dak nong in the calibration and model testing steps given the absence of official yield data in 2006 for all the provinces the corresponding missing yield data were replaced by the average of observed yields over the entire period note that robusta coffee accounts for 95 96 of the reported coffee production in vietnam arabica coffee representing the remaining proportion usda 2019 since no detailed information about the annual production of the two coffee varieties were available at the provincial scale from the official statistics and because robusta is dominant in the central highlands arabica is mainly grown in the northern regions of the country we attributed the reported yield value in each year to robusta coffee observed daily climate data for the 2000 2014 period and gridded daily climate data for the 2000 2017 period were used in this study these climate data included maximum and minimum temperatures solar radiation and rainfall the spatial distribution of grids across the study regions is presented in fig 2 for each of the study provinces up to four grids were considered based upon the closeness of the centroid of the grid to the robusta cultivation areas table 1 observed climate data were sourced from the national centre for hydro meteorological forecasting of vietnam nchmf 2014 gridded data were retrieved from the nasa power website https power larc nasa gov the observed climate data for 2000 2014 were available for dak lak gia lai and lam dong they were used for model calibration and first validation the gridded data were used for further evaluation of the robusta model 2 3 calculations of coffee water requirements and determination of coefficients for water stress levels cwrs were calculated following the formula cwr e t 0 k c where et0 is the reference evapotranspiration and kc is the crop coefficient the crop coefficients used for the calculations were retrieved from amarasinghe et al 2015 and byrareddy et al 2020 table 2 cwrs were computed under standard conditions i e disease free non limiting nutrient and soil water conditions and as such corresponds to the potential crop evapotranspiration et0 was calculated using the hargreaves and samani hs equation hargreaves and samani 1985 hargreaves and allen 2003 12 e t 0 0 408 0 0023 r a t m a x t m i n 2 17 8 t m a x t m i n 0 5 where ra is the extra terrestrial radiation mj m 2 day 1 tmax and tmin are the daily maximum and minimum temperatures respectively c et0 is expressed in mm day 1 the hs method was chosen because of its simplicity and the variables required the extra terrestrial radiation can be calculated for any day and location only maximum and minimum temperatures are required nonetheless it should be noted that the hs method can result in et0 overestimation in high humidity conditions or et0 underestimation when high speed winds conditions prevail allen et al 1998 droogers and allen 2002 depending on the phenological stage and water stress levels expressed through the number of days with daily rainfall below cwr different coefficients of biomass reduction were applied table 3 the values of these coefficients were derived from information collected during the 2008 2017 surveys byrareddy et al 2020 and expert knowledge i e experienced agronomists and crop physiologists expert knowledge was necessary for defining the percentage of daily biomass reduction according to the phenological stage and water stress level under the environmental conditions in vietnam we also checked the literature for such relationships in other coffee producing regions e g carr 2001 damatta 2004 nguyen 2005 wang et al 2015 2 4 calibration and validation of the robusta model 2 4 1 robusta coffee calendar in vietnam the robusta coffee calendar in vietnam can be divided into five periods the flower bud initiation and blossoming occurring during january to march the fruit setting during april the cherry development during may to august the maturation stage during september and october and the ripening harvest occurring during october to december these periods are indicative and were used for the modelling purpose thus even though farmers applied irrigation for synchronous blossoming the actual growth stages and durations may vary across a given province and from one province to another 2 4 2 model calibration initial parameter values were derived from the caf2007 model van oijen et al 2010b ovalle rivera et al 2020 for the model calibration the majority of the parameters table 4 were varied individually within a range of plausible values these ranges were based on published studies undertaken across the study regions in vietnam e g d haeze et al 2003 marsh 2007 or elsewhere in a robusta coffee producing country e g marin et al 2005 damatta et al 2007 van oijen et al 2010b 2010a rodríguez et al 2011 ovalle rivera et al 2020 or from field experimental data from the centro agronómico tropical de investigación y enseñanza catie research station costa rica thus the calibration was carried by adjusting model parameters so that the predicted yields satisfactorily compared with the official provincial yields that is at each variation of a given parameter value the predicted yields were compared to the observed ones until the best combination i e the model which outputs resulted in fewer errors was found the root mean square error rmse and mean absolute percentage error mape were used as statistical indicators their respective formulas are provided in section 2 4 3 additionally a visual assessment was also carried out to verify how well the model simulates observed interannual yield variability in this study the calibration of the robusta model was performed using the observed climate and yield data for lam dong for the 2001 2014 period to simulate coffee growth using the robusta model the start date of each season was set at 1 november of the previous calendar year and the simulations were carried out up to 31 october of the following year the list of model parameters and their values after calibration is presented in table 4 2 4 3 model evaluations two model evaluation steps were carried out in this study first the model was validated using the observed climate data and official provincial coffee yield data for the 2000 2014 period for dak lak and gia lai these data were not used in the calibration step the second model evaluation involved the use of gridded climate data for this performance assessment we hypothesized that the robusta model can achieve a performance similar to that resulting from using climate station data since observed climate data are either scarce or not readily available in these coffee producing regions freely available satellite and model based gridded climate data are used as an alternative such an evaluation is also justified given the increased reliance on these climate data for studies at larger spatial scales because up to four grids were selected amongst the grid falling within a given province table 1 fig 2 we explored two options of gridded climate data aggregation and use within the robusta model the first option consisted in simulating separately the coffee yield for all the selected grids falling within the province in such cases the historical provincial yield was used as reference yield for each of the grids the predicted yield at the province scale was calculated as the average of all grid level predicted yields the second option consisted in running the robusta model using the average values of grid level climate data as inputs resulting in a unique predicted yield for the province 2 4 4 assessment of model performance predicted yields were compared against official reported yields to assess the performance of the robusta model three statistical indicators were used for this purpose rmse mape and the willmott s index of agreement wi willmott et al 2012 their respective equations are as follows 13 r m s e 1 n i 1 n y i m y i p 2 14 m a p e 1 n t 1 n y i m y i p y i m 15 w i 1 i 1 n y i m y i p i 1 n y i p y m y i m y m 2 where n is the number of sample years y i m is the ith observed value y m is the mean observed value and y i p is the ith predicted value the rmse gives the weighted variations in errors residual between the predicted and observed yields mape is an accuracy measure of the forecast quality it is a better index than absolute error measures in comparing model performance amongst different regions given the likely differences in their average historical yields chipanshi et al 2015 the lesser value of mape or rmse the better the model performs wi is a descriptive measure related to the ratio between the model error magnitudes and to the magnitudes of the perfect model deviation and observed deviation willmott et al 2012 wi ranges from 1 to 1 the closer the wi is to 1 the better the model predictions are all data and statistical analyses were performed using r version 4 0 0 r core team 2020 nasa power climate data were retrieved using the r package nasapower sparks 2018 3 results 3 1 calibration and validation of the robusta model the calibration and validation of the robusta model using observed climate data for lam dong dak lak and gia lai resulted in acceptable model performance overall the mape in the calibration step was 10 with a rmse of 0 24 t ha 1 and wi 0 740 fig 3 the validation of the model using independent datasets from the provinces of dak lak and gia lai showed a slight increase in prediction errors compared to those obtained in the calibration step rmse 0 33 and 0 31 t ha 1 respectively with corresponding mape of 14 and 13 fig 3 the narrow variability of reported coffee yield in dak lak observed yields during 2005 2014 varied generally between 2 1 and 2 5 t ha 1 fig 3 could explain the relatively low value of wi 0 184 for this province an example of the simulation of wood leaves and fruit dry matter using the robusta model along with the daily variation of potential crop water stress for the province gia lai is shown in fig 4 in gia lai the period spanning mid november 2009 to may 2010 was generally dry with the first three months of 2010 recording no rain fig 4b such dry weather conditions affected negatively the overall biomass production wood and leaves and in lesser proportion fruit setting fruit setting was at its earlier stages fig 4a 3 2 model performance according to the data aggregation methods two options of climate data aggregation were tested with the robusta model to further assess the model performance when using gridded climate data running the model under two different options of data aggregation did not result in substantial differences in the outcomes overall the robusta model performed well in both cases with mape 12 table 5 for dak lak dak nong gia lai and lam dong similar model performance was obtained for both aggregation methods 10 dak lak and gia lai and 11 lam dong prediction errors in both cases of data aggregation with corresponding rmse of 0 26 and 0 28 t ha 1 table 5 though the prediction errors slightly increased for dak nong when the average of climate data of the selected grids was considered as model inputs mape from 9 to 10 table 5 the relatively highest prediction errors when using gridded climate data were found for kon tum where only one grid was considered mape 12 and rmse 0 29 t ha 1 table 5 in this province particularly the robusta model tended to underestimate the reported coffee yields figs 5 and 6 for the remainder of provinces the scatterplots showed fairly good distribution around the 1 1 line figs 5 and 6 the agreements between predicted and observed yields based on wi values were higher for gia lai kon tum and lam dong wi 0 700 table 5 confirming the good capabilities of the robusta model for predicting coffee yield in these provinces for provinces with relatively low inter annual yield variability dak lak and dak nong fig s1 such agreements between predicted and observed yields were less obvious wi the error magnitudes in predictions did not capture very well deviations in observed yields figs 5 and 6 4 discussion 4 1 the robusta model as a tool for investigating the impacts of climate variability on coffee production coffee yields in dak lak dak nong gia lai kon tum and lam dong have seen a sharp increase over the past 10 years compared to their levels in the early 2000s fig s1 such change can be explained by a combination of factors including infrastructure investment in irrigation and strong reliance on irrigation in coffee farms the affordability of fertilizer and the increasing adoption of new management techniques i e grafting in provinces such as lam dong marsh 2007 byrareddy et al 2019 2020 the central highlands is a drought prone region nguyen 2005 vu et al 2015 given the projected changes in climate patterns in vietnam ipcc 2014 which could potentially affect negatively agricultural productions and the livelihoods of millions of farmers it is important to investigate the impacts of climate variability on yield and production for crops like robusta coffee the robusta model is specifically designed to simulate and predict robusta coffee potential yield at the regional scale it involves the main growth and development processes altered by climate in this study results show that the model was able to predict satisfactorily the robusta coffee yield for dak lak dak nong gia lai kon tum and lam dong thus the robusta model provides a solid basis for assessing the impacts of rainfall or temperature variability on coffee yields at the provincial level and can be an important tool for regional impacts studies in vietnam or other coffee growing regions or countries with the characterization of water stress days throughout the coffee season and the likely impacts these stresses can have on biomass production and yield one can simulate the potential water required to alleviate the stress and improve crop performance such a feature can be strengthened to explore the potential impact of irrigation on coffee yield this will require nevertheless further research work to make the model suitable for such tasks it is expected to develop a complete integrated scf robusta coffee yield forecasting system which will use categorical indicators of climate drivers e g oceanic niño index southern oscillation index tropical pacific sea surface temperatures and simulated coffee yields to provide probabilistic yield forecasts this will allow for examining probabilistic yield anomalies likelihood of exceeding the long term median or average associated with the prevailing climate pattern in the year of forecast throughout the coffee season at the provincial scale 4 3 limitations and future directions in spite of the encouraging performance of the robusta model some limitations were found in this study that indicates a need for further research there were no detailed data about the annual productions of robusta coffee from the official statistics used in this study the reported yields included production data of both robusta and arabica coffees even though robusta coffee production is largely dominant approximately 95 96 of the total production usda 2019 we did not derive its production from the reported statistics to avoid any additional uncertainties in the modelling approach detailed robusta coffee yield production information could potentially be sourced from local coffee industry stakeholders such as agricultural commodities trading companies or the vietnam coffee and cocoa association vicofa the availability of such data would help further assess the performance and improve the robusta model the model does not simulate the response of coffee growth to fertilizer rates byrareddy et al 2019 showed that fertilizer management practices were largely homogenous between years at each of the surveyed farms in dak lak dak nong gia lai and lam dong one can assume that the reported official yield at the regional scale reflects at least partly such fertilizer use long term experimental studies involving wider ranges of fertilizer rates across the study provinces are needed to provide further insights into the impacts of varying fertilizer rates on robusta coffee yields and enable the inclusion of such aspects in the model with the aim of keeping the structure of the model as simple as possible neither pests and diseases impacts nor soil nitrogen processes were considered the integration of such aspects can also be explored further to reduce prediction errors and broaden the capabilities of the model or to explore this model where fertilization practices are not so homogeneous the alternation of years with high and low bean production known as biennial growth was not considered in our model at the provincial scale such biennial pattern is masked since coffee growing areas encompass a range of farms with different ages of trees and pruning practices moreover the biennial production cycle could potentially be off set by irrigation as this is a typical management practice in robusta coffee farms in vietnam byrareddy et al 2020 assessing the biennial production cycle at the regional scale in vietnam using satellite remote sensing data bernardes et al 2012 and implementing such patterns within the robusta model can be investigated in future research given the difficulty of determining accurate lai values we used modelled empirical coefficient values based on the yield of the previous season because of the exhaustiveness of methods proposed and the fact destructive sampling of trees is often required costa et al 2019 the determination of lai in coffee farms can be challenging coltri et al 2015 proposed an empirical relationship for calculating the above ground biomass and lai in arabica coffee using simple field measurements and agrometeorological data in brazil although substantial seasonal variations were found in their study their approach can be investigated in the case of vietnam and help define more accurately the initial values of the aboveground biomass and lai in the model remotely sensed lai data at the start of the season or at critical phenological stages can be explored as an alternative as well the effect of canopy architecture and heterogeneity on light interception and photosynthesis was not considered in the robusta model canopy architecture influences light interception and distribution transpiration and the whole plant gas exchange in coffee melke and fetene 2014 rodrigues et al 2016 charbonnier et al 2017 a good understanding of the relationships between canopy architecture and light interception or the effects of cultural practices on irradiance interception and canopy photosynthesis in robusta coffee farms in vietnam would help improve the overall model accuracy given the variability of cropping techniques e g pruning and environmental conditions which can affect coffee crown architecture and canopy photosynthesis damatta 2004 damatta et al 2007 investigating such relationships remains an interesting open question for future research in this study the definition of parameter and coefficient values table 2 was based on expert knowledge and empirical relationships although the model parameters were varied within the reported plausible ranges a reparameterization along with updated coefficient values for water stress may be required for using the robusta model in different environments i e a different country nevertheless the modelling approach used in this study could be readily adapted to a different robusta coffee producing region providing the relevant data are available 5 conclusions we presented a dynamic biophysical model the robusta model which processes climate data and information from the previous coffee season to simulate robusta coffee growth and predict yields at the regional scale evaluating the performance of the robusta model indicated good agreements between predicted and official reported coffee yields for the five major coffee producing in vietnam the model presented in this paper is one of the first to deal with robusta coffee yield at the regional scale it was kept simple because of the lack of quantitative information at the regional scale to build a parameter rich model the simplicity of the model does not imply that it could not be responsive to the key climate factors driving coffee growth and development the robusta model was designed as such to be ultimately used within a scf crop production forecasting system to support decision making throughout the robusta coffee supply chain while managing climate risks despite the satisfactory model performance obtained for most of the vietnamese coffee producing provinces there are aspects that need to be addressed for future improvements of the present robusta model for its application in different coffee producing regions or countries which will require long term datasets on the phenological

24667,multi species conservation is of critical concern in ecosystem management science in this context modeling the effect of strategic threats on decision making is a challenging problem that has not been sufficiently addressed using a security game approach this paper investigates the optimal conservation of a food web against a strategic threat the model builds upon the non cooperative stackelberg game wherein conservator defender and adversary attacker play as leader and follower respectively the objective of the defender is to preventively maximize the entire web reliability under financial and ecological constraints the defender optimally manipulates the populations of an optimal subset of species to achieve this in contrast the attacker attempts to maximize web unreliability by decreasing the population of selected species using limited resources a meta heuristic algorithm is developed to compute the equilibrium strategy and the model is validated through numerical examples additionally in a scenario based approach it is examined how the defense and attack strategies as well as food web reliability change as the population of keystone species change the results also show that the combinational use of mathematical optimization and food web specific conservation prioritization indices yields a practical tool for food web conservation prioritization the results specifically yield theoretical insights into how to optimally control trophic cascade effects due to changing keystone species populations a step wise methodology is proposed to implement the model keywords food web conservation security game system reliability budget ecological constraints bi level nested genetic algorithm 1 introduction single species management in isolation may be harmful to other species within an ecosystem tylianakis et al 2010 for instance a tri trophic cascade occurred in the yellowstone national park ecosystem due to a wolf reintroduction program implemented in the 1990s despite the program aiming to counteract the seven decade trophic cascade effect of wolf removal from the ecosystem ripple 2011 the yellowstone trophic cascade caused a set of reactions down through a food pyramid starting with gray wolves canis lupus at the top elk cervus elaphus in the middle and plant species such as cottonwoods populus spp at the base this trophic cascade thus led to an increase in plants caused by the decrease in the elk population in turn caused by the reintroduction of wolves ripple and beschta 2012 the recovery of the california condor gymnogyps californianus is another instance of a single species conservation program led by the usfws 1 1 u s fish and wildlife service http www fws gov conrad 2018 over three decades millions of dollars were spent to recover and release the california condor raising the world population size from 22 in the 1980s to more than 400 by 2017 usfws 2017 although the achievements of the project should not be ignored scientists believe that the dollars spent on the condor conservation program could possibly have ensured the persistence of several less endangered species if they had been invested in a multi species conservation program wilson et al 2009 scientists now state that native biodiversity is not an à la carte menu where certain desirable species can be protected while others are neglected perlman and

management considering significant species and their relations within ecosystems meffe et al 2002 in the context of multi species management finding the optimal set of management actions is not a straightforward task conserving a large number of species is subject to multiple complex constraints including managerial ecological and financial joseph et al 2008 the current biodiversity crisis highlights the failures of existing conservation programs as well as helping identify future challenges in designing and implementing appropriate conservation priorities harvey et al 2017 in order to prioritize conservation actions various indices have been proposed for assessing species importance however testing their performance in guiding to ecosystem management has not yielded proper results fedor and vasas 2009 mcdonald madden et al 2016 recently to overcome this challenge mathematical optimization techniques have been applied in related literature in this regard billionnet 2013 investigated key strategies to conserve biodiversity optimally while modeling the conservation prioritization problem under budgetary constraints however ecological interactions between species were not considered mcdonald madden et al 2016 proposed a budget constrained model to optimize the management prioritization of multiple interacting species their study established a mathematical model for optimal food web management aiming to maximize species survivability within small to medium sized food webs bayesian belief networks bbns were employed in the modeling which was extended to investigate the propagation effects of management choices throughout the web since a network approach usefully describes the structural and dynamic features of multi species communities ecological network conservation has been strongly proposed by conservation scientists and researchers borrett et al 2018 harvey et al 2017 schaubroeck et al 2012 within ecological network analysis the food web provides a powerful tool for investigating ecological interactions between predator and prey species jørgensen and fath 2011 due to their recognized capability to ecosystem modeling food webs are widely used to investigate the web effects of alternative management actions over ecosystems lim et al 2018 mcdonald madden et al 2016 with regard to conserving biodiversity assets against criminal threats the main challenge is determining the optimal allocation of limited resources to enhance security basak et al 2016 these limited security resources must be intelligently assigned taking into account differences in the respective priorities of the targets targets are prioritized based on their security coverage requirements attacker responses and potential uncertainties in terms of attacker capabilities knowledge and preferences jain et al 2013 among a variety of approaches addressing security resource allocation problems game theory has been widely used jain et al 2013 game theory models interactions between decision makers as players who interact with each other according to a set of rules each player has a set of actions and can then determine action preferences with potential rewards specified by a payoff function all players payoffs are affected by other players actions i e not only their own actions osborne 2004 tadelis 2013 players who know the rules of the game and make decisions based on this knowledge are termed intelligent in a security game approach the defender and the attacker are two players such that the defender seeks to allocate the limited resources to defend key targets and the attacker seeks to find the appropriate target to attack wilczyński et al 2016 a literature review by hausken and levitin 2012 shows that researchers could significantly benefit from a combination of reliability and game theory techniques in security resource allocation problems this work has been extended by rao et al 2016 hausken 2017a hausken 2017b and hausken 2019 who have generally focused on the optimal allocation of defensive resources within infrastructural systems against strategic adversaries most of the problems have been modeled as non constraint games in which the defender seeks to maximize the system survivability or reliability and the attacker attempts to maximize the system unreliability or probability of failure both without any constraint payoff functions have been formulated through system reliability engineering concepts principles and techniques system reliability or probability of survival is defined as the probability that a system performs the required function satisfactorily under given conditions during a stated period of time kuo and zuo 2003 reliability engineering thus provides an engineering framework for studying the reliability of an item component subsystem or system including measurement and analysis of failure as well as repair of the item in order to improve its use kiran 2017 naeem and li 1997 and naeem 1998 introduced reliability engineering concepts into ecosystem literature ecosystem reliability has been defined as the probability that the ecosystem will function in a specified environment during a given unit of time the ecosystem functioning refers to the flow of material and processing of energy or the ecosystem s biogeochemical processes the trophic levels in an ecosystem are linked in series and thus the ecosystem functions as a whole only if all the trophic levels function individually naeem 1998 however naeem 1998 also considered a potential parallel configuration for species with identical bio geochemical attributes at a trophic level with such a parallel configuration of species the extinction of a species does not lead to the failure of the trophic level and consequently to the failure of the ecosystem in recent years due to the success of game theory in addressing the challenges of allocating security resources to infrastructure systems researchers have begun to concentrate on the application of game theory within the green security domain basak et al 2016 focusing on environmental crime green security games can be applied to protecting forests against unauthorised exploitation conserving endangered animal species against hunters and protecting marine species from illegal fishing for example johnson et al 2012 and mccarthy et al 2016 applied game theory to determine optimal patrol strategies to protect forests against illegal extraction maximally yang et al 2014 and nguyen et al 2016 used game theory to generate an optimal ranger patrol allocation strategy to protect wildlife against poachers problems in green security are often modeled on the development of a stackelberg security game using various algorithms fang and nguyen 2016 a stackelberg security game models the interaction between a defender and an attacker as a leader follower game the defender as leader chooses to play a particular defensive strategy by considering all possible attacker responses the attacker as follower observes the defender s strategy and then selects the best response strategy hence a computational tool is provided to optimize the defender s payoff based on possible attacker responses an and tambe 2017 casorrán amilburu 2017 an overview of the literature on the green security game shows that most papers address opportunistic attacks these opportunistic attackers seek opportunities for attacking rather than strategically planning attacks in advance they are rationally bounded and exhibit limited pre attack surveillance in other words they have limited observation of the defense s chosen strategy thereby select their attack strategy based on limited information and computation this may lead to sub optimal strategic choices abbasi 2016 an example of real world opportunistic attackers in conservation situations can be seen in poachers who are not able to observe the complete ranger patrol strategy before choosing their attack basak et al 2016 a strategic attacker will adapt an optimal attacking strategy based on their observation of defense levels thus becoming less incentivized to attack more highly defended targets hao et al 2009 indeed the attacker is assumed to be a goal oriented human who adapts the actions to achieve a predefined goal this goal is determined based on conducting careful surveillance not on arising opportunities hausken 2014 in the context of conservation threats such strategic attacks fall within the scope of harmful anthropogenic actions involving the illegal exploitation and manipulation of natural resources an example is eco sabotage that refers to the deliberate destruction or damage of an ecosystem for environmental political reasons alpas et al 2011 applying the security game this paper investigates optimal multi species conservation against a strategic attacker hereafter the conservator and the strategic attacker are termed defender and attacker respectively accordingly the effect of the attacker s strategy is analyzed in relation to the defender s managerial decision making within a multi species conservation situation the present study considers species as nodes of an ecological food web system allowing for an analysis of players interactions on the food web in the present model the defender aims to optimize food web reliability from an ecological network analysis point of view an ecosystem consists of species linked in various configurations not only in parallel for this reason in some cases the removal of a species such as a keystone species may cause the failure of an ecosystem to capture this structural feature of an ecosystem a computational framework is provided to calculate food web reliability while remaining consistent with the definition of ecosystem reliability provided by naeem 1998 a parallel redundancy configuration is thus considered for the individuals of the population of each species accordingly a species is considered present or functions if at least one of its individuals is present or functions considering the web species configuration system reliability engineering techniques are then used for calculating the reliability of the food web system to the best of the authors knowledge no similar study has been conducted previously the two main research questions are thus 1 how can the interactions between food web defender and attacker be modeled and 2 how does the reliability of food web change as defense and attack strategies change 2 materials and methods 2 1 assumptions and prerequisites our model is established based on the following assumptions assumption 1 ignoring other intentional and non intentional factors of ecosystem destruction this study concentrates solely on strategic threats as an external intentional attack assumption 2 the model is built on a non cooperative stackelberg game between two strategic players defender and attacker a non cooperative game models conflict situations in which each player makes decisions independently without forming any coalition with other players the game is assumed to be one shot i e played once the game is determined by four components 1 players 2 the structure of players interactions including how they move as well as their knowledge when moving 3 players strategies or decisions that they can make and any constraints imposed on the choice of strategies and 4 their objective in choosing a strategy the payoff function which they try to optimize maximize or minimize fujiwara greve 2015 as a stackelberg game the model is a bi level program as generally formulated in eqs 1 4 1 min y y z z f y z 2 s t g y z 0 3 min z f y z 4 s t g y z 0 eqs 1 and 2 and eqs 3 and 4 demonstrate the defender leader problem and the attacker follower problem respectively y and z are the set of strategies for the defender and attacker respectively while g and g are the constraints imposed on the defender and attacker strategies respectively f and f are the defender and attacker objectives respectively which they attempt to minimize colson et al 2007 furthermore it is assumed that all parameters of the game are deterministic and are fully known for both players in advance assumption 3 it is assumed that the payoff value of each species is the same for both players the keystone index k i is employed to characterize the importance of species i in a food web system the keystone index quantifies the significance of a species at the mesoscale mcdonald madden et al 2016 this means that the keystone index incorporates interactions across the entire web but only those mediated by trophic links jordan et al 1999 this index helps set priorities in ecosystem management jordán 2009 mcdonald madden et al 2016 due to their structural significance keystone species play a crucial role in the ecosystems changes in keystone species populations may considerably alter the ecosystem function libralato et al 2006 and thus the ecosystem reliability naeem 1998 the keystone index considers bottom up and top down interactions fedor and vasas 2009 and embodies the location of a species in the food web indeed the keystone index for species i gives the number of species which experience secondary extinction due to species i removal for the keystone index the deletion probabilities are considered equal for each graph node accordingly a keystone species affects the food web reliability due to its position in the web graph and its deletion probability has no effect on web reliability jordan et al 1999 the calculation of the keystone index is briefly set out in appendix b assumption 4 the reliability or presence probability per individual of each species or individual survival probability is estimated as a function of the various mortality risks such as predation rate over a specified time period gervasi et al 2012 for simplicity similar to jordán and molnár 1999 the survival probability is assumed to be equally constant for all individuals of each species and that individuals fail or survive independently of one another however relaxing the time independency and operation independency assumptions and developing to further models is possible e g markov reliability models in rausand and høyland 2003 furthermore the food web is considered as a reliability system and food web reliability is calculated using system reliability engineering methods consistent with naeem 1998 food web reliability is defined as the probability that it will function in a specified environment and during a given unit of time the food web functioning refers to the flow of material and energy across the web the method used for computing system reliability depends on the reliability wise configuration of the subsystems components therefore to compute system reliability the reliability wise configuration of its components subsystems should be determined beforehand a reliability block diagram is a diagrammatic analysis method for modeling this configuration there are several reliability wise configurations including series parallel combined series and parallel and complex in a system with components in a series configuration the failure of any component will cause the failure of the entire system accordingly in the case of operationally independent components the reliability of a system with series components is equal to the product of its components reliabilities birolini 2007 hence in related literature a series network is referred to as a weakest link network and is successfully defended if the defender successfully defends all the targets components within the network kovenock and roberson 2012 in a system with all components arranged reliability wise in parallel the system fails only if all of its components fail components in parallel are also referred to as redundant components birolini 2007 consequently a parallel network is referred to as a best shot network this network successfully defended if at least one target component within the network is successfully defended kovenock and roberson 2012 in the case of series parallel configuration the system fails if at least one of its series subsystems fails an example of a reliability block diagram of a series parallel system is given in fig 4 two hypothetical three component systems series and parallel are also illustrated in fig 1 for a simple configuration the corresponding reliability block diagram is derived and then the reliability of each component is calculated the entire system reliability function is then calculated a simple configuration is that for which there exists a reliability block diagram which can be reduced to a series parallel configuration with independent components for more details see birolini 2007 and kuo and zuo 2003 assumption 5 predator prey interactions involving direct transfers of matter between species are employed feeding loops and cannibalism are not included in the model furthermore the model assumes small sized food webs that are configured with only one trophic pyramid to model the magnitude of energy flow between species energy flow descriptions of the food web are utilized the energy flow description depicts the transfer of energy or matter from prey to the predator moore and de ruiter 2012 additionally the food web attributes are expressed in terms of matter on a dry weight basis per unit area begon et al 2006 the matter is also estimated on the basis of population size in units of biomass bellingeri and bodini 2013 therefore the flow rate or flow intensity is conceptualized as a predator prey biomass ratio nilsson and mccann 2016 the flow rate indicates the amount of transferred energy or matter over a specified time period moore and de ruiter 2012 it should be noted that the model does not consider the dynamics of species populations i e variations of species abundances over time species population density is thus only expressed in units of biomass per area in the following the prerequisites for modeling are described sets and indices t of indices of species type i j indices of species type s i j species j is the prey of species i predator parameters n number of species types n 2 a i the available population size of species i a i the new population size of species i r i

attacking strategy for decreasing the population size of the n species food web note that in the following variables and parameters marked with an asterisk e g t t i n and a represent equilibrium values 2 2 the model formulation consider a n 2 species predator prey food web which the defender aims to conserve under certain financial and ecological constraints by considering all possible rational strategies that the attacker can select this interaction between defender and attacker is modeled as a non cooperative stackelberg game the objectives of the players are exactly the opposite the defender moves first and looks for the best preventive strategy t i n t d c which maximizes food web reliability through manipulating species population size this optimal defensive strategy determines the optimal subset of species the type increase decrease and the amount magnitude of increase decrease of effort that should be allocated to each species following this the attacker as a follower observes the defense s chosen strategy then strives to find the best attacking strategy t which maximizes food web unreliability within a budgetary constraint the best attacking strategy determines the optimal subset of species that should be attacked and the amount magnitude of decrease of effort which should be assigned to each species the interaction described over a hypothetical three species predator prey food web is schematically demonstrated in fig 2 in this food web system the species are the components of the system each component has a population size which means a group of individuals of a single species perlman and milder 2004 a parallel redundancy configuration is considered for individuals within the population of each species consequently according to the redundancy concept birolini 2007 each species fails or becomes absent if all of its individuals fail or become absent following naeem 1998 the reliability of a species is defined as its probability of presence in an ecosystem over time therefore the reliability of a species depends on the size of the population number of individuals according to assumption 4 the reliability of all individuals of species i is assumed to be equally constant r i i e time independent and operationally independent thus consistent with the reliability engineering principle of parallel system reliability birolini 2007 the reliability of species i r i is calculated according to eq 5 5 r i 1 i 1 p i 1 r i where p i denotes the population size of species i consequently based on the web configuration of n species the reliability of a given food web system r is obtained as a function f of n species reliabilities as shown in eq 6 6 r f r 1 r 2 r n the formulation of function f supports the system reliability theory the defender seeks to determine a set of efforts required to balance species populations as much as possible to maximize food web reliability under resource and ecological constraints according to the ecological principles of extinction threshold and carrying capacity the equilibrium population size of species i should be between the specified survival lower and upper boundaries bellingeri and bodini 2013 billionnet 2013 schmitz 2007 an extinction threshold is a population size below which extinction risk increases beyond critical values becoming so high that it is considered unacceptable hildenbrandt et al 2006 the ecological carrying capacity is defined as the maximum population size of a species that can be held by the ecosystem under existing conditions wang 2010 let a i be the available population size of species i considering the definitions in subsection 2 1 the increase and decrease in the population size of species i caused by defender effort are analogously obtained by d i i n t i i n and d i d c t i d c respectively following the same logic the measure of the decrease in the population size of species i caused by attacker effort is calculated as d i t i therefore assuming a i is the available population size the new population size of species i a i is calculated according to eq 7 7 a i a i d i i n t i i n d i d c t i d c d i t i it should be noted that as in the real world the population size of species i can be either increased or decreased therefore at any given time at least one of two efforts t i i n and t i d c should take a zero value eq 8 expresses this rule mathematically 8 t i i n t i d c 0 i i let l i be the threshold for the survival of species i i e extinction threshold and u i be its upper survival boundary i e carrying capacity thus aiming for reliability maximization the new population size must be between the specified intervals l i u i 9 a i l i u i i i 1 2 n each species requires a minimum level of energy to survive bellingeri and bodini 2013 in other words the incoming energy to a species should not be lower than a certain threshold l i j as a result the higher the energy threshold the higher the vulnerability level of the food web thierry et al 2011 based on the carrying capacity concept the amount of input energy is also limited to an upper boundary u i j which is interpreted as the maximum population density allowed by the prey species hussain and tschirhart 2013 according to assumption 5 the mathematical expression of this limitation states that the ratio of the new predator population size to the new prey population size must lie within a specific range as shown in constraint 10 10 l i j a i a j u i j i j s i j species j is the prey of species i predator it should be noted that these boundaries imposed on quantity or fraction are determined by conservation researchers such as studies carried out by hayward et al 2007 byron et al 2011 liao et al 2013 and lyons et al 2018 as expressed in assumption 5 population biomass is used as a helpful unit of measurement instead of population number in reply to the defender s strategy the attacker under a budgetary constraint seeks to minimize the food web reliability by disrupting the equilibrium population of species hence extending upon the general formulation given in eqs 1 4 the proposed stackelberg model is presented as a bi level program with a budget and ecological constraints this is shown in eqs 11 19 11 max t i n t d c r t i n t d c t f 1 i 1 a 1 k 1 m 1 1 r 1 1 i 1 a 2 k 2 m 2 1 r 2 1 i 1 a n k n m n 1 r n subject to 12 i 1 n h i i n t i i n h i d c t i d c b d 13 l i a i u i i i 14 l i j a i a j u i j i j s 15 t i i n t i d c 0 i i 16 t i i n t i d c 0 i i 17 max t 1 r t i n t d c t subject to 18 i 1 n h i t i b a 19 t i 0 i i eqs 11 16 demonstrate the first level defender model formulation derived from eqs 5 and 6 the defender maximizes the reliability of the food web by the objective function eq 11 as a law of nature when transferring from a lower to a higher trophic level much energy is wasted as heat the available energy is higher at lower trophic levels begon et al 2006 pimm 2002 considering this natural law as laid out in eq 11 the new population size of species i a i is divided by the available energy at the respective trophic level m i this normalizes the species populations at different trophic levels moreover species with higher keystone indices make network flows less reliable jordan et al 1999 therefore they should be ranked higher in terms of priorities for resource allocation in adhering to this principle the inverse of the keystone index k i is incorporated into the model as multiplied by the new population statement a i in the objective function accordingly the number of components of species i is equal to a i k i m i thereby consistent with eq 5 the reliability of species i is calculated as 1 i 1 a i k i m i 1 r i according to the reliability wise configuration of the web the entire web reliability is thus determined through the function f of its species reliabilities this remains consistent with eq 6 for example if the species are in series the food web reliability is equal to the product of its species reliabilities constraint 12 enforces the budget constraint of the defender and states that the cost of the efforts must be less than or equal to the total budget constraints 13 and 14 denote the above defined ecological constraints 9 and 10 respectively in ecological modeling conservation principles are often used as modeling constraints jørgensen and fath 2011 built on eq 8 constraint 15 ensures that both defensive efforts of t i i n and t i d c do not take a nonzero value simultaneously constraint 16 indicates that the decision variables of the upper level problem are non negative integers eqs 17 19 describe the second level attacker problem formulation composed of the objective function budget constraint and non negativity nature of integer decision variable respectively both upper level and lower level programs are mixed integer non linear programs minlp therefore the model is a non linear bi level programming with integer variables minlbp which is an np hard problem ma 2016 due to their complexity bi level optimization problems are mostly solved by approaches that involve meta heuristics or involve a model reformulation to an optimization problem talbi 2013 since the decision variables are discrete traditional reformulation methods such as karush kuhn tucker kkt conditions cannot be used to solve the model bazaraa et al 2006 when the lower level problem is regular and convex a popular reformulation approach of a bi level optimization problem is to include the kkt conditions of the lower level problem as constraints into the upper level problem colson et al 2007 hence a meta heuristic algorithm is developed to solve this model 2 3 solution approach a bi level nested genetic algorithm adopted from recent studies ma 2016 talbi 2013 was improved to solve the present np hard problem a distinctive characteristic of the applied algorithm is its capability to consider the nonlinearity non convexity and non differentiability of the problem as a novel innovation specifically mathematical repair procedures were used to generate feasible solutions avoiding the use of penalty functions supplementary details about the solution are provided in appendix a 2 4 implementation methodology to implement the model a methodology is proposed in five main steps as illustrated in fig 3 in the first step the reliability configuration and subsequently the reliability function of the food web are determined using system reliability engineering concepts and techniques in the second step the requisite ecological information is gathered regarding the available population size extinction threshold and carrying capacity for each species as well as the boundaries necessary for energy flow between connected species the potential threat is identified in the third step in the fourth step the optimal conservation strategy is found by solving the proposed model in equations 11 19 sensitivity analysis is performed to characterize the response of the equilibrium solution to variations of model parameters in this way it is possible to identify the most influential model parameters on the equilibrium strategy finally the conservation strategy is implemented and the results are recorded after a specific duration once this fifth step is completed the process is repeated from the second step 2 5 model application to verify the model and to illustrate some of its notable features a hypothetical three species food web system is considered in a specific geographical area the web structure is shown in fig 4 this predator prey web comprises an omnivorous predator species and two prey species where the omnivore feeds on both of the other two prey species each species separately belongs to a level of three level trophic community as shown in fig 4 consistent with system reliability rules birolini 2007 the food web has a series parallel configuration as its reliability block diagram illustrates in fig 4 according to this configuration the predator is in series with the subsystem consisting of prey i and prey ii in parallel consistent with series parallel configuration and using eq 11 the reliability function of the hypothetical food web is formulated in eq 20 20 r r 1 1 1 r 2 1 r 3 1 1 r 1 a 1 k 1 m 1 1 1 r 2 a 2 k 2 m 2 1 r 3 a 3 k 3 m 3 where index 1 indicates the predator as species 1 and prey i and prey ii are denoted as species 2 and species 3 respectively the parameters also follow predefined parameters in subsection 0 according to the assumed hypothetical food web characteristics numerical example parameter values are generated and provided in table 1 according to assumption 3 the value of each species is equal to its keystone index which is the same for both defender and attacker as shown in table 1 the keystone index of predator is 2 which is higher than the equal value i e 0 5 of the two prey species jordan et al 1999 note that according to assumption 5 it is assumed that the population size is continuous however rescaling to discrete measures such as individuals per unit area is simple three scenarios are formulated to test the behavior of the proposed model and to quantify the equilibrium population of the multi species hypothetical food web the scenarios differ in the population of the omnivorous predator information about the scenarios is presented in table 2 recall that r in table 2 represents the food web reliability before the game as calculated by eq 20 for zero efforts scenario 1 examines a situation in which the available population of the predator is below the extinction threshold consequently the available population of both prey species is just below carrying capacity due to a trophic cascade effect the available population of the predator in scenario 2 is above the carrying capacity consequently the available population of both prey species is just above the extinction threshold because of a trophic cascade effect therefore in the two scenarios the equilibrium of the hypothetical food web is disrupted in scenario 3 the available population of all three species lies near the middle values of the determined intervals the optimal decisions in scenarios which are obtained by running the algorithm provided in subsection 0 are presented in table 3 r in table 3 represents the food web reliability after the game i e the defender s payoff for the equilibrium solution for running the algorithm the maximal generation was empirically set at 100 and 200 and the population size at 50 and 100 for lower level ga and upper level ga respectively the remaining four parameters of the algorithm were tuned by taguchi experiment implementation via minitab 19 0 comprised of crossover rate and mutation rate of upper level ga and lower level ga in this regard three levels were set for each parameter based on the levels defined minitab proposed orthogonal array l9 for the experiment number the model was executed three times and the mean of solutions was utilized based on the experiment output the mutation rate and crossover rate of upper level ga are set at 0 3 and 0 6 the mutation rate and crossover rate of lower level ga are set at 0 2 and 0 7 to evaluate the performance of the algorithm used the convergence of solutions to stackelberg equilibrium in scenario 1 is depicted in fig 5 it can be observed that after around 24 iterations both objective functions reach the equilibrium value 3 results sequential decision making processes by players in scenario 1 are schematically presented in fig 6 in scenario 1 the available population size of the predator is below the extinction threshold as depicted in the left hand side of fig 6 the defender thus allocates a considerable amount of effort to increase the predator population towards the equilibrium population according to the related reliability block diagram the predator is in series with other species so its removal will cause entire web failure in addition to being a keystone species the defender also manipulates the populations of both prey species such that the web reliability maximizes while simultaneously the web reaches equilibrium considering the sequential nature of the game the optimal defensive strategy is proposed by taking into consideration the best possible response of the attacker as schematically shown in the right hand side of fig 6 the attacker in return prefers only to attack prey i and prey ii this attacking strategy is the best response to the defensive action and causes the greatest reduction in web reliability consistent with the risk deflection feature of intentional threats xiaofeng and shifei 2012 this result confirms that the attackers are likely to refrain from attacking high value targets and instead select high vulnerable targets the attacker avoids spending a greater budget because he she is not able to increase his her payoff unlike the defender who uses as much of the total defense budget as possible therefore any trophic cascade effect either due to predator extinction or due to predator population exceeding carrying capacity may be controlled by employing the proposed overarching conservation strategy moreover despite the limitations and threats overall food web reliability may be improved significantly by choosing the proposed preventive approach according to suggested defensive strategies in both scenarios 2 and 3 the defender chooses the overarching conservation strategy in contrast the attacker effectively has to withdraw selecting zero attack efforts because extra efforts will not increase their payoff furthermore as the results illustrate despite the keystone index the model does not necessarily rank both prey i and prey ii at the same level due to other determinative prioritization factors besides the keystone index the sequential decision making processes of players in scenarios 2 and 3 are schematically presented in fig a 3 and fig a 4 respectively 4 discussion the present study is related to work by mcdonald madden et al 2016 the essential distinctions between the two papers are summarized in table 4 mcdonald madden et al 2016 developed a budget constraint mathematical optimization model to find the optimal subset of species to manage in order to maximize the survival of the multiple interacting species for a small to medium sized food web the goal of the present paper is the same but the model decision structure is different because the present paper considers the effect of strategic threats on food web management according to the essence and structure of decision making a security game approach was selected for modeling the problem and a meta heuristic solution method was used to tackle its complexity this paper presents an innovative approach to modeling ecological food web studies energy flows are incorporated by considering the food web as a reliability system where its functioning refers to the flow of material and energy across the web certain other ecological constraints are also considered in the model energy is the most essential ecosystem currency moving through food webs from plants to herbivores predators and decomposers perlman and milder 2004 to overcome the challenge of weak performing prioritization indices mcdonald madden et al 2016 proposed a mathematical optimization model as a substitution tool however the present study uses a combination of food web specific conservation prioritization indices and mathematical optimization techniques to develop an appropriate tool for food web conservation prioritization mcdonald madden et al 2016 focused on the optimal subgroup of species that should be conserved in addition to determining the priority of species conservation the present model also determines the type and amount of effort to be allocated to any species while incorporating financial and ecological limitations therefore the model can be useful in answering one of the most important contemporary conservation questions how can exploited ecosystems be optimally managed for promoting biodiversity under economic constraints braunisch et al 2012 since there is currently insufficient information to develop full realistic model parameterization a hypothetical numerical example of a small sized food web was generated to validate the proposed model common sense values were used by referring to corresponding cases in the literature and expert opinions however the required data to parameterize a real world model especially ecological data are difficult to gather thus the derivation of realistic model parameters must be discussed in depth prior to applying the model in the field likewise any conclusions must be evaluated with realistic parameter values for a wide range of cases and environments the model has also been simplified with a number of assumptions while ecological features such as species populations material energy flow rate and food web reliability or survivability are dynamic the model was constructed as static nevertheless this study demonstrated the potential benefits of the model in studying dynamic food web models since it allows inter species material energy flow rates to be modeled across the food web regarding the security game domain it was assumed that the parameters of the model are fully known for both players without considering uncertainty uncertainties in features of players were not taken into account including player knowledge and capabilities both players were assumed to have complete information on their own strategies and payoff or utility functions as well as those of the opposing player however this assumption could be simplistic in the real world green security domain an and tambe 2017 recently diverse innovative approaches have been proposed to address these uncertainty challenges for example the challenge of uncertainty in game parameters could be addressed by robust optimization techniques using innovative concepts such as maximin robustness in the face of an attacker whose utility is unknown i e attacker preferences are unknown to the defender the literature proposes an innovative learning approach here the optimal defensive strategy is learned by repeatedly implementing the selected strategies in an intelligent manner sinha et al 2018 additionally the survival of a food web may be simultaneously threatened by several factors both intentional and non intentional only a single strategic threat was investigated in the present paper to address this challenge the problem could be modeled as a multi player game wu et al 2019 the results show how defense and attack strategies as well as the food web reliability change as the population of keystone species change therefore although the model is simplified with various assumptions it can provide theoretical insight into strategic planning to conserve food webs containing endangered or threatened species a particularly important use of this model would be in controlling and preventing trophic cascade effects 5 conclusions this paper mathematically investigated how to optimally conserve a food web against a strategic threat with this aim the model concentrated on a security game between a food web defender leader and a strategic human attacker follower the best defensive strategy determines the optimal subset of species that should be protected as well as the type and amount of conservation effort that should be allocated to the selected species a scenario based examination specifically demonstrated that by employing the proposed preventive strategy it is possible to deter the attacker from attacking or to mitigate the food web unreliability caused by the attack output analysis for various realistic food webs may therefore provide managerial insights into strategic planning to conserve food webs a comparison with a previous study mcdonald madden et al 2016 demonstrated certain improvements in ecological food web modeling in terms of model structure and modeling tool which provide potential benefits in studying dynamic food web models additionally a step wise methodology is presented to implement the model the model can be extended to incorporate the dynamic nature of ecological parameters as well as various uncertainty features of the security domain furthermore a natural research extension would be to consider the simultaneous effect of various intentional and non intentional factors threatening food web survival 6 author statement this paper has been accomplished on the basis of a ph d research project by ms zohreh s gatmiry supervised by dr ashkan

appendix a supplementary details about the solution as seen in fig a 1 the main steps of the applied algorithm are described in the pseudo code computations were conducted in matlab software on an intel core i7 2 7 ghz and 8gb ram personal computer similar to well known techniques for conventional ga operators were implemented as below encoding consistent with the bi level problem a value encoding strategy was used which assigns discrete variable values to ordered arrays kumar 2013 the player decision variables were encoded into two types of chromosomes for the upper level and second level as shown in fig a 2 the upper level chromosome represents the defender strategies t i n and t d c respectively from left to right its length equals twice the number of species in the food web the first n gen for strategy t i n and the second n gen for strategy t d c beginning from the left the i th gen of chromosomes t i n and t d c represents the amount of effort which is allocated to increase and decrease the population of species i respectively in the same manner the lower level chromosome represents the attacker strategy t which the nature per gen is similar to the abovementioned definition that is the i th gen is dedicated to attacker effort which is allocated to decrease the population of species i the length of the lower level chromosome is also equal to the number of species in the food web selection the roulette wheel method was used as the selection operator crossover the flat crossover technique was used which applies uniform distribution to randomly produce offspring between the genes of the parents lim et al 2017 the crossover rate was fixed mutation the mutation is performed by the greep mutation operator in which a randomly chosen value among specified lower and upper bound is added to the value of a randomly selected gene soni and kumar 2014 the mutation rate is also fixed termination criterion applied ga is terminated after a

the keystone index reflects the role of species in the food web flow network accordingly the role of species is determined only based on its position in the food web graph which represents only

24667,multi species conservation is of critical concern in ecosystem management science in this context modeling the effect of strategic threats on decision making is a challenging problem that has not been sufficiently addressed using a security game approach this paper investigates the optimal conservation of a food web against a strategic threat the model builds upon the non cooperative stackelberg game wherein conservator defender and adversary attacker play as leader and follower respectively the objective of the defender is to preventively maximize the entire web reliability under financial and ecological constraints the defender optimally manipulates the populations of an optimal subset of species to achieve this in contrast the attacker attempts to maximize web unreliability by decreasing the population of selected species using limited resources a meta heuristic algorithm is developed to compute the equilibrium strategy and the model is validated through numerical examples additionally in a scenario based approach it is examined how the defense and attack strategies as well as food web reliability change as the population of keystone species change the results also show that the combinational use of mathematical optimization and food web specific conservation prioritization indices yields a practical tool for food web conservation prioritization the results specifically yield theoretical insights into how to optimally control trophic cascade effects due to changing keystone species populations a step wise methodology is proposed to implement the model keywords food web conservation security game system reliability budget ecological constraints bi level nested genetic algorithm 1 introduction single species management in isolation may be harmful to other species within an ecosystem tylianakis et al 2010 for instance a tri trophic cascade occurred in the yellowstone national park ecosystem due to a wolf reintroduction program implemented in the 1990s despite the program aiming to counteract the seven decade trophic cascade effect of wolf removal from the ecosystem ripple 2011 the yellowstone trophic cascade caused a set of reactions down through a food pyramid starting with gray wolves canis lupus at the top elk cervus elaphus in the middle and plant species such as cottonwoods populus spp at the base this trophic cascade thus led to an increase in plants caused by the decrease in the elk population in turn caused by the reintroduction of wolves ripple and beschta 2012 the recovery of the california condor gymnogyps californianus is another instance of a single species conservation program led by the usfws 1 1 u s fish and wildlife service http www fws gov conrad 2018 over three decades millions of dollars were spent to recover and release the california condor raising the world population size from 22 in the 1980s to more than 400 by 2017 usfws 2017 although the achievements of the project should not be ignored scientists believe that the dollars spent on the condor conservation program could possibly have ensured the persistence of several less endangered species if they had been invested in a multi species conservation program wilson et al 2009 scientists now state that native biodiversity is not an à la carte menu where certain desirable species can be protected while others are neglected perlman and milder 2004 small populations of highly endangered species still draw much attention examples include iucn 2 2 international union for conservation of nature http www iucn org s red listing of threatened plant and animal species and cites 3 3 convention on international trade in endangered species of wild fauna and flora http www cites org listing of animal and plant species protected against over exploitation through international trade however many conservation agencies and governmental institutions now concentrate on native ecosystem conservation projects the 50 year san diego multiple species conservation program mscp and the m species habitat conservation plan of riverside county mshcp are two extensive efforts to conserve ecosystems and their related species mscp was adopted in 1997 and mshcp began in 2004 county of san diego 2019 ouellette and landry 2015 nowadays in addition to single species considerations ecosystem management also acknowledges multi species management considering significant species and their relations within ecosystems meffe et al 2002 in the context of multi species management finding the optimal set of management actions is not a straightforward task conserving a large number of species is subject to multiple complex constraints including managerial ecological and financial joseph et al 2008 the current biodiversity crisis highlights the failures of existing conservation programs as well as helping identify future challenges in designing and implementing appropriate conservation priorities harvey et al 2017 in order to prioritize conservation actions various indices have been proposed for assessing species importance however testing their performance in guiding to ecosystem management has not yielded proper results fedor and vasas 2009 mcdonald madden et al 2016 recently to overcome this challenge mathematical optimization techniques have been applied in related literature in this regard billionnet 2013 investigated key strategies to conserve biodiversity optimally while modeling the conservation prioritization problem under budgetary constraints however ecological interactions between species were not considered mcdonald madden et al 2016 proposed a budget constrained model to optimize the management prioritization of multiple interacting species their study established a mathematical model for optimal food web management aiming to maximize species survivability within small to medium sized food webs bayesian belief networks bbns were employed in the modeling which was extended to investigate the propagation effects of management choices throughout the web since a network approach usefully describes the structural and dynamic features of multi species communities ecological network conservation has been strongly proposed by conservation scientists and researchers borrett et al 2018 harvey et al 2017 schaubroeck et al 2012 within ecological network analysis the food web provides a powerful tool for investigating ecological interactions between predator and prey species jørgensen and fath 2011 due to their recognized capability to ecosystem modeling food webs are widely used to investigate the web effects of alternative management actions over ecosystems lim et al 2018 mcdonald madden et al 2016 with regard to conserving biodiversity assets against criminal threats the main challenge is determining the optimal allocation of limited resources to enhance security basak et al 2016 these limited security resources must be intelligently assigned taking into account differences in the respective priorities of the targets targets are prioritized based on their security coverage requirements attacker responses and potential uncertainties in terms of attacker capabilities knowledge and preferences jain et al 2013 among a variety of approaches addressing security resource allocation problems game theory has been widely used jain et al 2013 game theory models interactions between decision makers as players who interact with each other according to a set of rules each player has a set of actions and can then determine action preferences with potential rewards specified by a payoff function all players payoffs are affected by other players actions i e not only their own actions osborne 2004 tadelis 2013 players who know the rules of the game and make decisions based on this knowledge are termed intelligent in a security game approach the defender and the attacker are two players such that the defender seeks to allocate the limited resources to defend key targets and the attacker seeks to find the appropriate target to attack wilczyński et al 2016 a literature review by hausken and levitin 2012 shows that researchers could significantly benefit from a combination of reliability and game theory techniques in security resource allocation problems this work has been extended by rao et al 2016 hausken 2017a hausken 2017b and hausken 2019 who have generally focused on the optimal allocation of defensive resources within infrastructural systems against strategic adversaries most of the problems have been modeled as non constraint games in which the defender seeks to maximize the system survivability or reliability and the attacker attempts to maximize the system unreliability or probability of failure both without any constraint payoff functions have been formulated through system reliability engineering concepts principles and techniques system reliability or probability of survival is defined as the probability that a system performs the required function satisfactorily under given conditions during a stated period of time kuo and zuo 2003 reliability engineering thus provides an engineering framework for studying the reliability of an item component subsystem or system including measurement and analysis of failure as well as repair of the item in order to improve its use kiran 2017 naeem and li 1997 and naeem 1998 introduced reliability engineering concepts into ecosystem literature ecosystem reliability has been defined as the probability that the ecosystem will function in a specified environment during a given unit of time the ecosystem functioning refers to the flow of material and processing of energy or the ecosystem s biogeochemical processes the trophic levels in an ecosystem are linked in series and thus the ecosystem functions as a whole only if all the trophic levels function individually naeem 1998 however naeem 1998 also considered a potential parallel configuration for species with identical bio geochemical attributes at a trophic level with such a parallel configuration of species the extinction of a species does not lead to the failure of the trophic level and consequently to the failure of the ecosystem in recent years due to the success of game theory in addressing the challenges of allocating security resources to infrastructure systems researchers have begun to concentrate on the application of game theory within the green security domain basak et al 2016 focusing on environmental crime green security games can be applied to protecting forests against unauthorised exploitation conserving endangered animal species against hunters and protecting marine species from illegal fishing for example johnson et al 2012 and mccarthy et al 2016 applied game theory to determine optimal patrol strategies to protect forests against illegal extraction maximally yang et al 2014 and nguyen et al 2016 used game theory to generate an optimal ranger patrol allocation strategy to protect wildlife against poachers problems in green security are often modeled on the development of a stackelberg security game using various algorithms fang and nguyen 2016 a stackelberg security game models the interaction between a defender and an attacker as a leader follower game the defender as leader chooses to play a particular defensive strategy by considering all possible attacker responses the attacker as follower observes the defender s strategy and then selects the best response strategy hence a computational tool is provided to optimize the defender s payoff based on possible attacker responses an and tambe 2017 casorrán amilburu 2017 an overview of the literature on the green security game shows that most papers address opportunistic attacks these opportunistic attackers seek opportunities for attacking rather than strategically planning attacks in advance they are rationally bounded and exhibit limited pre attack surveillance in other words they have limited observation of the defense s chosen strategy thereby select their attack strategy based on limited information and computation this may lead to sub optimal strategic choices abbasi 2016 an example of real world opportunistic attackers in conservation situations can be seen in poachers who are not able to observe the complete ranger patrol strategy before choosing their attack basak et al 2016 a strategic attacker will adapt an optimal attacking strategy based on their observation of defense levels thus becoming less incentivized to attack more highly defended targets hao et al 2009 indeed the attacker is assumed to be a goal oriented human who adapts the actions to achieve a predefined goal this goal is determined based on conducting careful surveillance not on arising opportunities hausken 2014 in the context of conservation threats such strategic attacks fall within the scope of harmful anthropogenic actions involving the illegal exploitation and manipulation of natural resources an example is eco sabotage that refers to the deliberate destruction or damage of an ecosystem for environmental political reasons alpas et al 2011 applying the security game this paper investigates optimal multi species conservation against a strategic attacker hereafter the conservator and the strategic attacker are termed defender and attacker respectively accordingly the effect of the attacker s strategy is analyzed in relation to the defender s managerial decision making within a multi species conservation situation the present study considers species as nodes of an ecological food web system allowing for an analysis of players interactions on the food web in the present model the defender aims to optimize food web reliability from an ecological network analysis point of view an ecosystem consists of species linked in various configurations not only in parallel for this reason in some cases the removal of a species such as a keystone species may cause the failure of an ecosystem to capture this structural feature of an ecosystem a computational framework is provided to calculate food web reliability while remaining consistent with the definition of ecosystem reliability provided by naeem 1998 a parallel redundancy configuration is thus considered for the individuals of the population of each species accordingly a species is considered present or functions if at least one of its individuals is present or functions considering the web species configuration system reliability engineering techniques are then used for calculating the reliability of the food web system to the best of the authors knowledge no similar study has been conducted previously the two main research questions are thus 1 how can the interactions between food web defender and attacker be modeled and 2 how does the reliability of food web change as defense and attack strategies change 2 materials and methods 2 1 assumptions and prerequisites our model is established based on the following assumptions assumption 1 ignoring other intentional and non intentional factors of ecosystem destruction this study concentrates solely on strategic threats as an external intentional attack assumption 2 the model is built on a non cooperative stackelberg game between two strategic players defender and attacker a non cooperative game models conflict situations in which each player makes decisions independently without forming any coalition with other players the game is assumed to be one shot i e played once the game is determined by four components 1 players 2 the structure of players interactions including how they move as well as their knowledge when moving 3 players strategies or decisions that they can make and any constraints imposed on the choice of strategies and 4 their objective in choosing a strategy the payoff function which they try to optimize maximize or minimize fujiwara greve 2015 as a stackelberg game the model is a bi level program as generally formulated in eqs 1 4 1 min y y z z f y z 2 s t g y z 0 3 min z f y z 4 s t g y z 0 eqs 1 and 2 and eqs 3 and 4 demonstrate the defender leader problem and the attacker follower problem respectively y and z are the set of strategies for the defender and attacker respectively while g and g are the constraints imposed on the defender and attacker strategies respectively f and f are the defender and attacker objectives respectively which they attempt to minimize colson et al 2007 furthermore it is assumed that all parameters of the game are deterministic and are fully known for both players in advance assumption 3 it is assumed that the payoff value of each species is the same for both players the keystone index k i is employed to characterize the importance of species i in a food web system the keystone index quantifies the significance of a species at the mesoscale mcdonald madden et al 2016 this means that the keystone index incorporates interactions across the entire web but only those mediated by trophic links jordan et al 1999 this index helps set priorities in ecosystem management jordán 2009 mcdonald madden et al 2016 due to their structural significance keystone species play a crucial role in the ecosystems changes in keystone species populations may considerably alter the ecosystem function libralato et al 2006 and thus the ecosystem reliability naeem 1998 the keystone index considers bottom up and top down interactions fedor and vasas 2009 and embodies the location of a species in the food web indeed the keystone index for species i gives the number of species which experience secondary extinction due to species i removal for the keystone index the deletion probabilities are considered equal for each graph node accordingly a keystone species affects the food web reliability due to its position in the web graph and its deletion probability has no effect on web reliability jordan et al 1999 the calculation of the keystone index is briefly set out in appendix b assumption 4 the reliability or presence probability per individual of each species or individual survival probability is estimated as a function of the various mortality risks such as predation rate over a specified time period gervasi et al 2012 for simplicity similar to jordán and molnár 1999 the survival probability is assumed to be equally constant for all individuals of each species and that individuals fail or survive independently of one another however relaxing the time independency and operation independency assumptions and developing to further models is possible e g markov reliability models in rausand and høyland 2003 furthermore the food web is considered as a reliability system and food web reliability is calculated using system reliability engineering methods consistent with naeem 1998 food web reliability is defined as the probability that it will function in a specified environment and during a given unit of time the food web functioning refers to the flow of material and energy across the web the method used for computing system reliability depends on the reliability wise configuration of the subsystems components therefore to compute system reliability the reliability wise configuration of its components subsystems should be determined beforehand a reliability block diagram is a diagrammatic analysis method for modeling this configuration there are several reliability wise configurations including series parallel combined series and parallel and complex in a system with components in a series configuration the failure of any component will cause the failure of the entire system accordingly in the case of operationally independent components the reliability of a system with series components is equal to the product of its components reliabilities birolini 2007 hence in related literature a series network is referred to as a weakest link network and is successfully defended if the defender successfully defends all the targets components within the network kovenock and roberson 2012 in a system with all components arranged reliability wise in parallel the system fails only if all of its components fail components in parallel are also referred to as redundant components birolini 2007 consequently a parallel network is referred to as a best shot network this network successfully defended if at least one target component within the network is successfully defended kovenock and roberson 2012 in the case of series parallel configuration the system fails if at least one of its series subsystems fails an example of a reliability block diagram of a series parallel system is given in fig 4 two hypothetical three component systems series and parallel are also illustrated in fig 1 for a simple configuration the corresponding reliability block diagram is derived and then the reliability of each component is calculated the entire system reliability function is then calculated a simple configuration is that for which there exists a reliability block diagram which can be reduced to a series parallel configuration with independent components for more details see birolini 2007 and kuo and zuo 2003 assumption 5 predator prey interactions involving direct transfers of matter between species are employed feeding loops and cannibalism are not included in the model furthermore the model assumes small sized food webs that are configured with only one trophic pyramid to model the magnitude of energy flow between species energy flow descriptions of the food web are utilized the energy flow description depicts the transfer of energy or matter from prey to the predator moore and de ruiter 2012 additionally the food web attributes are expressed in terms of matter on a dry weight basis per unit area begon et al 2006 the matter is also estimated on the basis of population size in units of biomass bellingeri and bodini 2013 therefore the flow rate or flow intensity is conceptualized as a predator prey biomass ratio nilsson and mccann 2016 the flow rate indicates the amount of transferred energy or matter over a specified time period moore and de ruiter 2012 it should be noted that the model does not consider the dynamics of species populations i e variations of species abundances over time species population density is thus only expressed in units of biomass per area in the following the prerequisites for modeling are described sets and indices t of indices of species type i j indices of species type s i j species j is the prey of species i predator parameters n number of species types n 2 a i the available population size of species i a i the new population size of species i r i

attacking strategy for decreasing the population size of the n species food web note that in the following variables and parameters marked with an asterisk e g t t i n and a represent equilibrium values 2 2 the model formulation consider a n 2 species predator prey food web which the defender aims to conserve under certain financial and ecological constraints by considering all possible rational strategies that the attacker can select this interaction between defender and attacker is modeled as a non cooperative stackelberg game the objectives of the players are exactly the opposite the defender moves first and looks for the best preventive strategy t i n t d c which maximizes food web reliability through manipulating species population size this optimal defensive strategy determines the optimal subset of species the type increase decrease and the amount magnitude of increase decrease of effort that should be allocated to each species following this the attacker as a follower observes the defense s chosen strategy then strives to find the best attacking strategy t which maximizes food web unreliability within a budgetary constraint the best attacking strategy determines the optimal subset of species that should be attacked and the amount magnitude of decrease of effort which should be assigned to each species the interaction described over a hypothetical three species predator prey food web is schematically demonstrated in fig 2 in this food web system the species are the components of the system each component has a population size which means a group of individuals of a single species perlman and milder 2004 a parallel redundancy configuration is considered for individuals within the population of each species consequently according to the redundancy concept birolini 2007 each species fails or becomes absent if all of its individuals fail or become absent following naeem 1998 the reliability of a species is defined as its probability of presence in an ecosystem over time therefore the reliability of a species depends on the size of the population number of individuals according to assumption 4 the reliability of all individuals of species i is assumed to be equally constant r i i e time independent and operationally independent thus consistent with the reliability engineering principle of parallel system reliability birolini 2007 the reliability of species i r i is calculated according to eq 5 5 r i 1 i 1 p i 1 r i where p i denotes the population size of species i consequently based on the web configuration of n species the reliability of a given food web system r is obtained as a function f of n species reliabilities as shown in eq 6 6 r f r 1 r 2 r n the formulation of function f supports the system reliability theory the defender seeks to determine a set of efforts required to balance species populations as much as possible to maximize food web reliability under resource and ecological constraints according to the ecological principles of extinction threshold and carrying capacity the equilibrium population size of species i should be between the specified survival lower and upper boundaries bellingeri and bodini 2013 billionnet 2013 schmitz 2007 an extinction threshold is a population size below which extinction risk increases beyond critical values becoming so high that it is considered unacceptable hildenbrandt et al 2006 the ecological carrying capacity is defined as the maximum population size of a species that can be held by the ecosystem under existing conditions wang 2010 let a i be the available population size of species i considering the definitions in subsection 2 1 the increase and decrease in the population size of species i caused by defender effort are analogously obtained by d i i n t i i n and d i d c t i d c respectively following the same logic the measure of the decrease in the population size of species i caused by attacker effort is calculated as d i t i therefore assuming a i is the available population size the new population size of species i a i is calculated according to eq 7 7 a i a i d i i n t i i n d i d c t i d c d i t i it should be noted that as in the real world the population size of species i can be either increased or decreased therefore at any given time at least one of two efforts t i i n and t i d c should take a zero value eq 8 expresses this rule mathematically 8 t i i n t i d c 0 i i let l i be the threshold for the survival of species i i e extinction threshold and u i be its upper survival boundary i e carrying capacity thus aiming for reliability maximization the new population size must be between the specified intervals l i u i 9 a i l i u i i i 1 2 n each species requires a minimum level of energy to survive bellingeri and bodini 2013 in other words the incoming energy to a species should not be lower than a certain threshold l i j as a result the higher the energy threshold the higher the vulnerability level of the food web thierry et al 2011 based on the carrying capacity concept the amount of input energy is also limited to an upper boundary u i j which is interpreted as the maximum population density allowed by the prey species hussain and tschirhart 2013 according to assumption 5 the mathematical expression of this limitation states that the ratio of the new predator population size to the new prey population size must lie within a specific range as shown in constraint 10 10 l i j a i a j u i j i j s i j species j is the prey of species i predator it should be noted that these boundaries imposed on quantity or fraction are determined by conservation researchers such as studies carried out by hayward et al 2007 byron et al 2011 liao et al 2013 and lyons et al 2018 as expressed in assumption 5 population biomass is used as a helpful unit of measurement instead of population number in reply to the defender s strategy the attacker under a budgetary constraint seeks to minimize the food web reliability by disrupting the equilibrium population of species hence extending upon the general formulation given in eqs 1 4 the proposed stackelberg model is presented as a bi level program with a budget and ecological constraints this is shown in eqs 11 19 11 max t i n t d c r t i n t d c t f 1 i 1 a 1 k 1 m 1 1 r 1 1 i 1 a 2 k 2 m 2 1 r 2 1 i 1 a n k n m n 1 r n subject to 12 i 1 n h i i n t i i n h i d c t i d c b d 13 l i a i u i i i 14 l i j a i a j u i j i j s 15 t i i n t i d c 0 i i 16 t i i n t i d c 0 i i 17 max t 1 r t i n t d c t subject to 18 i 1 n h i t i b a 19 t i 0 i i eqs 11 16 demonstrate the first level defender model formulation derived from eqs 5 and 6 the defender maximizes the reliability of the food web by the objective function eq 11 as a law of nature when transferring from a lower to a higher trophic level much energy is wasted as heat the available energy is higher at lower trophic levels begon et al 2006 pimm 2002 considering this natural law as laid out in eq 11 the new population size of species i a i is divided by the available energy at the respective trophic level m i this normalizes the species populations at different trophic levels moreover species with higher keystone indices make network flows less reliable jordan et al 1999 therefore they should be ranked higher in terms of priorities for resource allocation in adhering to this principle the inverse of the keystone index k i is incorporated into the model as multiplied by the new population statement a i in the objective function accordingly the number of components of species i is equal to a i k i m i thereby consistent with eq 5 the reliability of species i is calculated as 1 i 1 a i k i m i 1 r i according to the reliability wise configuration of the web the entire web reliability is thus determined through the function f of its species reliabilities this remains consistent with eq 6 for example if the species are in series the food web reliability is equal to the product of its species reliabilities constraint 12 enforces the budget constraint of the defender and states that the cost of the efforts must be less than or equal to the total budget constraints 13 and 14 denote the above defined ecological constraints 9 and 10 respectively in ecological modeling conservation principles are often used as modeling constraints jørgensen and fath 2011 built on eq 8 constraint 15 ensures that both defensive efforts of t i i n and t i d c do not take a nonzero value simultaneously constraint 16 indicates that the decision variables of the upper level problem are non negative integers eqs 17 19 describe the second level attacker problem formulation composed of the objective function budget constraint and non negativity nature of integer decision variable respectively both upper level and lower level programs are mixed integer non linear programs minlp therefore the model is a non linear bi level programming with integer variables minlbp which is an np hard problem ma 2016 due to their complexity bi level optimization problems are mostly solved by approaches that involve meta heuristics or involve a model reformulation to an optimization problem talbi 2013 since the decision variables are discrete traditional reformulation methods such as karush kuhn tucker kkt conditions cannot be used to solve the model bazaraa et al 2006 when the lower level problem is regular and convex a popular reformulation approach of a bi level optimization problem is to include the kkt conditions of the lower level problem as constraints into the upper level problem colson et al 2007 hence a meta heuristic algorithm is developed to solve this model 2 3 solution approach a bi level nested genetic algorithm adopted from recent studies ma 2016 talbi 2013 was improved to solve the present np hard problem a distinctive characteristic of the applied algorithm is its capability to consider the nonlinearity non convexity and non differentiability of the problem as a novel innovation specifically mathematical repair procedures were used to generate feasible solutions avoiding the use of penalty functions supplementary details about the solution are provided in appendix a 2 4 implementation methodology to implement the model a methodology is proposed in five main steps as illustrated in fig 3 in the first step the reliability configuration and subsequently the reliability function of the food web are determined using system reliability engineering concepts and techniques in the second step the requisite ecological information is gathered regarding the available population size extinction threshold and carrying capacity for each species as well as the boundaries necessary for energy flow between connected species the potential threat is identified in the third step in the fourth step the optimal conservation strategy is found by solving the proposed model in equations 11 19 sensitivity analysis is performed to characterize the response of the equilibrium solution to variations of model parameters in this way it is possible to identify the most influential model parameters on the equilibrium strategy finally the conservation strategy is implemented and the results are recorded after a specific duration once this fifth step is completed the process is repeated from the second step 2 5 model application to verify the model and to illustrate some of its notable features a hypothetical three species food web system is considered in a specific geographical area the web structure is shown in fig 4 this predator prey web comprises an omnivorous predator species and two prey species where the omnivore feeds on both of the other two prey species each species separately belongs to a level of three level trophic community as shown in fig 4 consistent with system reliability rules birolini 2007 the food web has a series parallel configuration as its reliability block diagram illustrates in fig 4 according to this configuration the predator is in series with the subsystem consisting of prey i and prey ii in parallel consistent with series parallel configuration and using eq 11 the reliability function of the hypothetical food web is formulated in eq 20 20 r r 1 1 1 r 2 1 r 3 1 1 r 1 a 1 k 1 m 1 1 1 r 2 a 2 k 2 m 2 1 r 3 a 3 k 3 m 3 where index 1 indicates the predator as species 1 and prey i and prey ii are denoted as species 2 and species 3 respectively the parameters also follow predefined parameters in subsection 0 according to the assumed hypothetical food web characteristics numerical example parameter values are generated and provided in table 1 according to assumption 3 the value of each species is equal to its keystone index which is the same for both defender and attacker as shown in table 1 the keystone index of predator is 2 which is higher than the equal value i e 0 5 of the two prey species jordan et al 1999 note that according to assumption 5 it is assumed that the population size is continuous however rescaling to discrete measures such as individuals per unit area is simple three scenarios are formulated to test the behavior of the proposed model and to quantify the equilibrium population of the multi species hypothetical food web the scenarios differ in the population of the omnivorous predator information about the scenarios is presented in table 2 recall that r in table 2 represents the food web reliability before the game as calculated by eq 20 for zero efforts scenario 1 examines a situation in which the available population of the predator is below the extinction threshold consequently the available population of both prey species is just below carrying capacity due to a trophic cascade effect the available population of the predator in scenario 2 is above the carrying capacity consequently the available population of both prey species is just above the extinction threshold because of a trophic cascade effect therefore in the two scenarios the equilibrium of the hypothetical food web is disrupted in scenario 3 the available population of all three species lies near the middle values of the determined intervals the optimal decisions in scenarios which are obtained by running the algorithm provided in subsection 0 are presented in table 3 r in table 3 represents the food web reliability after the game i e the defender s payoff for the equilibrium solution for running the algorithm the maximal generation was empirically set at 100 and 200 and the population size at 50 and 100 for lower level ga and upper level ga respectively the remaining four parameters of the algorithm were tuned by taguchi experiment implementation via minitab 19 0 comprised of crossover rate and mutation rate of upper level ga and lower level ga in this regard three levels were set for each parameter based on the levels defined minitab proposed orthogonal array l9 for the experiment number the model was executed three times and the mean of solutions was utilized based on the experiment output the mutation rate and crossover rate of upper level ga are set at 0 3 and 0 6 the mutation rate and crossover rate of lower level ga are set at 0 2 and 0 7 to evaluate the performance of the algorithm used the convergence of solutions to stackelberg equilibrium in scenario 1 is depicted in fig 5 it can be observed that after around 24 iterations both objective functions reach the equilibrium value 3 results sequential decision making processes by players in scenario 1 are schematically presented in fig 6 in scenario 1 the available population size of the predator is below the extinction threshold as depicted in the left hand side of fig 6 the defender thus allocates a considerable amount of effort to increase the predator population towards the equilibrium population according to the related reliability block diagram the predator is in series with other species so its removal will cause entire web failure in addition to being a keystone species the defender also manipulates the populations of both prey species such that the web reliability maximizes while simultaneously the web reaches equilibrium considering the sequential nature of the game the optimal defensive strategy is proposed by taking into consideration the best possible response of the attacker as schematically shown in the right hand side of fig 6 the attacker in return prefers only to attack prey i and prey ii this attacking strategy is the best response to the defensive action and causes the greatest reduction in web reliability consistent with the risk deflection feature of intentional threats xiaofeng and shifei 2012 this result confirms that the attackers are likely to refrain from attacking high value targets and instead select high vulnerable targets the attacker avoids spending a greater budget because he she is not able to increase his her payoff unlike the defender who uses as much of the total defense budget as possible therefore any trophic cascade effect either due to predator extinction or due to predator population exceeding carrying capacity may be controlled by employing the proposed overarching conservation strategy moreover despite the limitations and threats overall food web reliability may be improved significantly by choosing the proposed preventive approach according to suggested defensive strategies in both scenarios 2 and 3 the defender chooses the overarching conservation strategy in contrast the attacker effectively has to withdraw selecting zero attack efforts because extra efforts will not increase their payoff furthermore as the results illustrate despite the keystone index the model does not necessarily rank both prey i and prey ii at the same level due to other determinative prioritization factors besides the keystone index the sequential decision making processes of players in scenarios 2 and 3 are schematically presented in fig a 3 and fig a 4 respectively 4 discussion the present study is related to work by mcdonald madden et al 2016 the essential distinctions between the two papers are summarized in table 4 mcdonald madden et al 2016 developed a budget constraint mathematical optimization model to find the optimal subset of species to manage in order to maximize the survival of the multiple interacting species for a small to medium sized food web the goal of the present paper is the same but the model decision structure is different because the present paper considers the effect of strategic threats on food web management according to the essence and structure of decision making a security game approach was selected for modeling the problem and a meta heuristic solution method was used to tackle its complexity this paper presents an innovative approach to modeling ecological food web studies energy flows are incorporated by considering the food web as a reliability system where its functioning refers to the flow of material and energy across the web certain other ecological constraints are also considered in the model energy is the most essential ecosystem currency moving through food webs from plants to herbivores predators and decomposers perlman and milder 2004 to overcome the challenge of weak performing prioritization indices mcdonald madden et al 2016 proposed a mathematical optimization model as a substitution tool however the present study uses a combination of food web specific conservation prioritization indices and mathematical optimization techniques to develop an appropriate tool for food web conservation prioritization mcdonald madden et al 2016 focused on the optimal subgroup of species that should be conserved in addition to determining the priority of species conservation the present model also determines the type and amount of effort to be allocated to any species while incorporating financial and ecological limitations therefore the model can be useful in answering one of the most important contemporary conservation questions how can exploited ecosystems be optimally managed for promoting biodiversity under economic constraints braunisch et al 2012 since there is currently insufficient information to develop full realistic model parameterization a hypothetical numerical example of a small sized food web was generated to validate the proposed model common sense values were used by referring to corresponding cases in the literature and expert opinions however the required data to parameterize a real world model especially ecological data are difficult to gather thus the derivation of realistic model parameters must be discussed in depth prior to applying the model in the field likewise any conclusions must be evaluated with realistic parameter values for a wide range of cases and environments the model has also been simplified with a number of assumptions while ecological features such as species populations material energy flow rate and food web reliability or survivability are dynamic the model was constructed as static nevertheless this study demonstrated the potential benefits of the model in studying dynamic food web models since it allows inter species material energy flow rates to be modeled across the food web regarding the security game domain it was assumed that the parameters of the model are fully known for both players without considering uncertainty uncertainties in features of players were not taken into account including player knowledge and capabilities both players were assumed to have complete information on their own strategies and payoff or utility functions as well as those of the opposing player however this assumption could be simplistic in the real world green security domain an and tambe 2017 recently diverse innovative approaches have been proposed to address these uncertainty challenges for example the challenge of uncertainty in game parameters could be addressed by robust optimization techniques using innovative concepts such as maximin robustness in the face of an attacker whose utility is unknown i e attacker preferences are unknown to the defender the literature proposes an innovative learning approach here the optimal defensive strategy is learned by repeatedly implementing the selected strategies in an intelligent manner sinha et al 2018 additionally the survival of a food web may be simultaneously threatened by several factors both intentional and non intentional only a single strategic threat was investigated in the present paper to address this challenge the problem could be modeled as a multi player game wu et al 2019 the results show how defense and attack strategies as well as the food web reliability change as the population of keystone species change therefore although the model is simplified with various assumptions it can provide theoretical insight into strategic planning to conserve food webs containing endangered or threatened species a particularly important use of this model would be in controlling and preventing trophic cascade effects 5 conclusions this paper mathematically investigated how to optimally conserve a food web against a strategic threat with this aim the model concentrated on a security game between a food web defender leader and a strategic human attacker follower the best defensive strategy determines the optimal subset of species that should be protected as well as the type and amount of conservation effort that should be allocated to the selected species a scenario based examination specifically demonstrated that by employing the proposed preventive strategy it is possible to deter the attacker from attacking or to mitigate the food web unreliability caused by the attack output analysis for various realistic food webs may therefore provide managerial insights into strategic planning to conserve food webs a comparison with a previous study mcdonald madden et al 2016 demonstrated certain improvements in ecological food web modeling in terms of model structure and modeling tool which provide potential benefits in studying dynamic food web models additionally a step wise methodology is presented to implement the model the model can be extended to incorporate the dynamic nature of ecological parameters as well as various uncertainty features of the security domain furthermore a natural research extension would be to consider the simultaneous effect of various intentional and non intentional factors threatening food web survival 6 author statement this paper has been accomplished on the basis of a ph d research project by ms zohreh s gatmiry supervised by dr ashkan

appendix a supplementary details about the solution as seen in fig a 1 the main steps of the applied algorithm are described in the pseudo code computations were conducted in matlab software on an intel core i7 2 7 ghz and 8gb ram personal computer similar to well known techniques for conventional ga operators were implemented as below encoding consistent with the bi level problem a value encoding strategy was used which assigns discrete variable values to ordered arrays kumar 2013 the player decision variables were encoded into two types of chromosomes for the upper level and second level as shown in fig a 2 the upper level chromosome represents the defender strategies t i n and t d c respectively from left to right its length equals twice the number of species in the food web the first n gen for strategy t i n and the second n gen for strategy t d c beginning from the left the i th gen of chromosomes t i n and t d c represents the amount of effort which is allocated to increase and decrease the population of species i respectively in the same manner the lower level chromosome represents the attacker strategy t which the nature per gen is similar to the abovementioned definition that is the i th gen is dedicated to attacker effort which is allocated to decrease the population of species i the length of the lower level chromosome is also equal to the number of species in the food web selection the roulette wheel method was used as the selection operator crossover the flat crossover technique was used which applies uniform distribution to randomly produce offspring between the genes of the parents lim et al 2017 the crossover rate was fixed mutation the mutation is performed by the greep mutation operator in which a randomly chosen value among

24668,localized management of white tailed deer odocoileus virginianus involves the removal of matriarchal family units with the intent to create areas of reduced deer density however application of this approach has not always been successful possibly because of female dispersal and high deer densities we developed a spatially explicit agent based model to investigate the intensity of deer removal required to locally reduce deer density depending on the surrounding deer density dispersal behavior and size and shape of the area of localized reduction application of this model is illustrated using the example of abundant deer populations in pennsylvania usa most scenarios required at least 5 years before substantial deer density reductions occurred our model indicated that a localized reduction was successful for scenarios in which the surrounding deer density was lowest 30 deer mi² localized antlerless harvest rates were 30 and the removal area was 5 mi² when the size of the removal area was 5 mi2 end population density was highly variable and in some scenarios exceeded the initial density the shape of the area of localized reduction had less influence on the ability to reduce deer density than the size there were no differences in mean deer density in the same size circle or square removal areas similarly increasing the ratio of sides length width in rectangular removal areas had little influence on the ability to locally reduce deer densities situations in which deer density was higher 40 or 50 deer mi2 required antlerless removal rates to exceed 30 and took more than 5 years to considerably reduce density in the localized area regardless of its size these results indicate that the size of the removal area surrounding deer density and antlerless harvest rate are the most influential factors in locally reducing deer density therefore localized management likely can be an effective strategy for lower density herds especially in larger removal areas for high density herds the success of this strategy would depend most on the ability of resource managers to achieve consistently high antlerless harvest rates keywords agent based model modeling odocoileus virginianus population reduction rose petal hypothesis white tailed deer 1 introduction in the eastern united states white tailed deer odocoileus virginianus are considered a dominant species in forested landscapes diefenbach et al 1997 successful restoration of deer populations during the twentieth century resulted in an increase in abundance and the expansion of their distribution garrot et al 1993 today abundant deer populations can have negative effects on plant communities via excessive browsing côté et al 2004 and on human health through vehicle collisions crop depletion and disease spread côté et al 2004 nugent et al 2011 selective browsing by ungulates particularly in forests can lead to changes in the stand structure and compositional shifts of tree species miller et al 2010 simard et al 2013 consequently some forest stands may experience reduced stocking rates prolonged rotation lengths and regeneration failure horsley et al 2003 marquis 1974 these forest changes also can induce changes in associated animal communities nuttle et al 2011 to help alleviate issues induced by abundant deer populations management actions often involve reducing deer densities and strategies to do so include culling kilpatrick et al 1997 nugent et al 2011 fertility control merrill et al 2006 predator reintroductions ripple and beschta 2003 and most commonly hunting heusmann 1999 woolf and roseberry 1998 in north america regulated hunting has historically been used as a population management tool rutberg 1997 but management actions are typically applied at larger scales hundreds of mi2 because state agencies have difficulty collecting data at finer scales to assess deer abundance rosenberry and diefenbach 2019 consequently management actions by wildlife agencies may not be effective for controlling locally abundant populations waller and alverson 1997 research that has investigated the social structure of female or antlerless deer suggests that a targeted removal of female social groups has the potential to alleviate issues regarding locally abundant populations mcnulty et al 1997 porter et al 1991 female social groups are family units of primarily matriarchal females older presumably dominant females female offspring and siblings the rose petal hypothesis mathews 1989 suggests that deer populations expand as an array of family units composed of related females matriarchal females occupy a home range that is at the center of the family unit with several generations of female offspring occupying home ranges that overlap these overlapping home ranges expand in a form that is analogous to the petals of a rose the rose petal hypothesis depends on female deer in the target populations exhibiting low dispersal rates and high philopatry campbell et al 2004 localized management is a deer management strategy that aims to exploit the rose petal hypothesis by targeting these social groups through the removal of female deer in specific geographical areas with the goal of creating areas of persistent reduced deer density mcnulty et al 1997 porter et al 1991 for this approach to be applicable particularly on small areas 0 5 mi² the rose petal hypothesis must be a suitable model of population social structure porter et al 1991 proposed that the minimum area needed for the application of localized management would be 1 5 8 mi² however the minimum area estimate from their study is based solely on the home range size of female white tailed deer and does not account for the surrounding deer density i e deer density in a larger management unit consisting of the removal area and a buffer around it in addition the proposed minimum area size stems from the idea that the management action taking place is a targeted removal of female family units through sharp shooting or relocation and does not consider hunting as a potential tool despite being the most popular and common deer management method woolf and roseberry 1998 furthermore evidence for successful localized management at the small scale 0 5 mi² and large scale 8 mi² is conflicting boyce and mcdonald 1999 kilpatrick et al 2001 mcdonald et al 2007 mcnulty et al 1997 miller et al 2010 oyer and porter 2004 simard et al 2013 documented successes often have low surrounding deer densities high antlerless harvest rates and population monitoring immediately following the deer removal for only a few years kilpatrick et al 2001 mcdonald et al 2007 mcnulty et al 1997 oyer and porter 2004 however evidence suggests that the success of localized management may depend on a variety of environmental spatial temporal and biological factors that are often difficult to test empirically there are currently no empirical tests of localized management that have evaluated what effect if any the shape of a removal area has on the ability to reduce deer density this variable is important to consider because potential removal areas may be restricted in shape by landscape features e g streams roads or other factors such as boundaries for timber harvest sites or disease management areas accordingly in pennsylvania usa deer populations are considered abundant statewide and agencies such as the pennsylvania game commission pgc have created numerous programs to manage deer across the state one such program is the deer management assistance program dmap which was developed to help landowners meet their land use goals by providing hunters the opportunity to harvest additional antlerless deer on properties that participate in the program the pennsylvania department of conservation and natural resources bureau of forestry dcnr implements dmap in specific areas across approximately 3 500 mi² of state forest land according to numerous criteria e g deer impact data in order to meet deer management goals conserving forests and native plants through deer management internet 2019 however dmap areas vary considerably in size 4 to 39 mi² and logistical and financial constraints may limit the ability of managers to effectively monitor deer populations on these units therefore it is difficult to determine if dmap is achieving its intended goals and objectives due to the limitations that state wildlife agencies may face when evaluating deer management programs such as dmap model based approaches are becoming increasingly popular for assessing new and existing management actions models serve as an important tool for wildlife management because they are generally low cost pose less risk than field experiments and allow managers to test different management strategies and assess each strategy s effectiveness as it pertains to objectives mccarthy 2004 several models have evaluated the effects of different harvest strategies on the ability to locally kilpatrick et al 2004 mcdonald et al 2007 weckel and rockwell 2013 or regionally xie et al 1999 reduce deer numbers these models were able to simulate realistic deer populations for their respective study area s predict the factors that contribute to the success or failure of deer management actions and were validated by comparing model output with empirical data a similar model based approach could be beneficial for deer populations in pennsylvania particularly those in dmap areas so that managers can evaluate the efficacy of their deer management programs today agent based models abms also referred to as individual based models are also being used to help researchers model wildlife management problems abms describe population dynamics by explicitly simulating the behavior of individuals in a population on the landscape capturing local interactions and integrating individual life history information grimm and railsback 2005 wiens et al 1993 these features allow population properties to emerge from the behavior and interactions of individuals grimm and railsback 2005 semeniuk et al 2012 an advantage of abms is that they can capture fine scale spatial resolutions e g at the scale of a single population grimm et al 2006 that allow managers to use existing empirical data to test wildlife management scenarios salinas et al 2015 in addition abms are useful for modeling species whose population structure is influenced by social cues e g white tailed deer federico et al 2013 mathews 1989 watkins et al 2015 abms have been used to model a variety of wildlife management and conservation problems for many species such as the endangered huemul deer hippocamelus bisulcus lópez alfaro et al 2012 jaguars panthera once watkins et al 2015 endangered tigers panthera tigris carter et al 2015 wolves canis lupus chapron et al 2016 red howler monkeys alouatta seniculus wiederholt et al 2010 and feral hogs sus scrofa salinas et al 2015 for deer and other ungulates many spatially explicit abms have focused on modeling the impacts of landscape heterogeneity on species movement tierney 2015 turner et al 1993 dispersal behavior stanke et al 2018 or disease spread belsare et al 2020 kjær 2010 we developed a spatially explicit agent based model to evaluate the influence of different harvest management strategies on the ability to reduce white tailed deer densities in localized forested areas in pennsylvania usa we considered the surrounding deer density intensity of antlerless harvest and size and shape of the removal area as the parameters to vary in our model because we predicted they would have the greatest effect on white tailed deer population dynamics the size and shape of the removal area is of particular interest because deer density reductions often occur in specific geographical areas bounded by landscape features and the significance of these factors on deer numbers is not well understood mcnulty et al 1997 simard et al 2013 to date no spatially explicit abms have investigated the role of the size and shape of a localized area on the ability to reduce deer density or the influence of the surrounding deer density and level of harvest on deer population dynamics these effects may be important for localized management of white tailed deer because the species exhibits behaviors such as male dispersal long et al 2008 density dependent female dispersal lutz et al 2015 and density dependent reproduction that could influence recolonization and reproductive rates of areas where a localized deer density reduction is desired while our model focuses on localized reductions for white tailed deer populations in forested landscapes in pennsylvania the approach is applicable to other areas where local species and environmental data are available to parameterize models 2 model description the model description follows the odd overview design concepts details protocol for describing individual and agent based models grimm et al 2006 as updated by grimm et al 2020 the model was implemented using netlogo an agent based modeling program center for connected learning and computer based modeling northwestern university version 6 0 4 1999 2 1 purpose the purpose of the model is to predict changes in localized white tailed deer density in response to hunting pressure landscape deer density and size and shape of localized removal areas the framework is adapted for white tailed deer populations in forested landscapes in pennsylvania usa 2 2 entities state variables and scales model entities are male and female adult deer male and female juvenile deer fawns and patches all state variables characterizing these entities are listed in table 1 each deer has a combination of seven state variables that include age sex location reproduction and dispersal deer are categorized into 3 age classes fawn 0 years juvenile 1 year and adult 2 10 years we considered male juveniles and male adults to be antlered deer and fawns female juveniles and female adults to be antlerless deer patches have one state variable habitat which can take on a value of 1 to identify cells that make up the removal area or a value of 2 to identify cells that make up the surrounding area we defined the removal area to be a set of cells where antlerless deer harvest rates were greater potentially resulting in reduced deer densities and these areas could be one of three different shapes circle square or rectangle circle and square removal areas could take on one of seven different sizes 0 5 1 5 10 15 20 or 25 mi2 rectangular removal areas could be 5 10 or 20 mi² and at each size we varied the ratio of sides length width to be 1 3 1 1 5 1 2 1 3 1 4 1 5 1 in the 5 and 20 mi² areas 6 1 in the 10 mi² area and 10 1 in the 5 and 10 mi² areas we defined the surrounding area be a set of cells that were not included in the removal area where antlerless harvest rates kept the population size constant simulations were carried out on a 2 dimensional grid of 77 77 cells representing a 11 mi 11 mi forested landscape 121 mi2 each cell represented an area of 0 14 mi² and a 7 7 group of cells represented an area of one square mile we used miles rather than kilometers as the measurement unit because that is the scale for which wildlife management agencies typically implement their management actions and the results of this model need to be applicable those agencies belsare et al 2020 the model has an annual time step and it runs for a 20 year period with the model output being exported every year 2 3 process overview and scheduling at each time step 1 year the following processes for deer occur in the given order fig 1 model entities are processed in a randomized order and changes in state variables are updated immediately the submodels implementing these processes are described in detail in section 2 7 below 2 3 1 age and growth all individuals update their state variable age by one year juveniles and fawns simultaneously advance to the next age class 2 3 2 dispersal male and female juveniles disperse female dispersal rates and distances are density dependent while male dispersal rates and distances are density independent 2 3 3 reproduction adult females reproduce according to density dependent reproduction while juvenile females reproduce according to density independent reproduction 2 3 4 mortality independent individuals of all age classes fawn juvenile adult are subject to two types of mortality natural and harvest natural mortality occurs according to the annual survival rate of the model and the age of the individual harvest mortality occurs according to sex and age specific harvest rates as well as the location of the individual on the landscape 2 4 design concepts 2 4 1 emergence population density in the removal area emerges from individual behavior reproduction and dispersal and mortality natural and harvest behavior incorporates logical rules based on biological information from deer populations in pennsylvania usa and mortality is dictated by probabilities 2 4 2 adaptation male and female juveniles make the decision to disperse from their initial location to a new unoccupied cell on the landscape the model includes dynamic feedback on the reproduction and female juvenile dispersal parameters these values are density dependent and can change over time according to an individual s location on the landscape 2 4 3 sensing a fawn that is born can sense the identity of its mother and will inherit its mother s location although each cell on the landscape can have multiple agents individual deer exist independent of one another and individuals cannot distinguish between the surrounding area and removal area however individuals that experience density dependent behavior can sense the number of individuals in either the surrounding area or removal area depending on their position on the grid 2 4 4 stochasticity we incorporated stochastic processes into reproduction dispersal and mortality reproduction and female juvenile dispersal are density dependent for all other stochastic processes the model generates a random floating point number between 0 and 1 and the action occurs if the number is less than the probability of occurrence for each process see section 2 7 for details we did not include environmental stochasticity in the model therefore the landscape remains constant for the simulation period 20 years 2 4 5 observation at the end of each time step we observe population level processes these include the total number of deer harvested in the removal area the number of antlered and antlerless deer harvested in the removal area the total number of deer and post harvest population density in the removal area and the number of antlered and antlerless deer in the removal area the model also has two graphical displays one plots the abundance of deer in each patch type versus time and the other plots a frequency distribution of deer in all sex age classes 2 5 initialization the model is initialized with a landscape that contains a certain size and shape of the removal area model deer population for the landscape is initialized using a specific population density 30 40 or 50 deer mi² sex age composition fawns male juveniles female juveniles male adults female adults antlerless harvest rate in the surrounding area and antlerless harvest rate in the removal area each agent deer is placed in a randomly selected cell without replacement within the surrounding area or removal area we evaluated 30 deer mi2 because it emulates current deer density estimates in pennsylvania that were obtained using a sex age kill model norton et al 2013 we evaluated 40 and 50 deer mi2 to explore the effects of implementing different localized management strategies on high density populations we created the model s initial deer population from a baseline model that was developed in netlogo version 6 0 4 without any removal areas see appendix a for details the 30 40 and 50 deer mi² densities in the baseline model were run to determine the antlerless harvest rates that would stabilize the population at each density table s1 and the resulting sex age composition of the stable population fig 2 table s2 which was then used to initialize all simulations 2 6 input data the model does not use input data to represent time varying processes 2 7 submodels all model parameters are listed in table 2 details on the initial deer population sex age composition and the antlerless harvest rates in the surrounding area at each deer density 30 40 and 50 deer mi² can be found in appendix a all other population parameters were derived from peer reviewed literature harvest data collected by the pennsylvania game commission or are based on expert opinion 2 7 1 age and growth at the beginning of each time step individuals update their state variable age age in years by one year juvenile deer grow to become adults and fawns grow to become juveniles fawns have a 0 50 chance of being male and a 0 50 chance of being female which reflects the 1 1 sex ratio of fawns at birth ditchkoff 2011 2 7 2 dispersal male and female juveniles have the potential to disperse from their initial location to a new location on the landscape we modeled dispersal rates and distances for these individuals dispersal rate refers to the proportion of dispersing juveniles and is set using the parameters male juv disp rate and fem juv disp rate individuals who disperse travel a calculated distance in a random direction using the parameters male juv disp dist and fem juv disp dist if a dispersing individual reaches a cell that contains one or more agents it moves to the nearest unoccupied cell on the landscape dispersing juveniles can move from the surrounding area to the removal area and vice versa or disperse to a cell within the patch type they originated in our model assumes that the number of individuals dispersing out of the model landscape is equal to the number of individuals dispersing into the model landscape immigration emigration the model space is toroidal so if a dispersing individual moves past the edge of the landscape it will reappear on the opposite edge the dispersal rate for male juveniles is modeled as 0 75 long et al 2015 and dispersal distance is modeled by randomly drawing from a log normal distribution with μ 8 2 km and σ 7 6 km diefenbach et al 2008 the dispersal distance is then converted into miles and the individual disperses the calculated distance in a random direction female juvenile dispersal rates and distances are modeled as density dependent lutz et al 2015 deer density in both the surrounding area and removal area are first converted from deer per square mile to deer per square kilometer then dispersal rate is modeled using a subset of the data presented in lutz et al 2015 which excludes data from two populations in illinois due to the small proportion of forest and high dispersal rates according to the equation dispersal rate 1 1 e 2 345385 0 007345 d forest where dforest is deer km2 of forest female juvenile dispersal distance is modeled according to the equation d i s p e r s a l d i s t a n c e a b c where a 18 703 se 3 710 b 0 02533 se 0 857 and c deer km² the dispersal distance is then converted into miles and the individual disperses the calculated distance in a random direction after dispersal an individual s state variable dispersal status is updated to true dispersal distance is updated to the distance traveled in miles and location is updated to the cell where it lands 2 7 3 reproduction all juvenile and adult females have the potential to get pregnant and produce offspring fawns the mean number of fawns per female for 2 year old female adults is determined by the parameter adult repro 2 the mean number of fawns per female for 3 year old female adults is determined by the parameter adult repro 3 and the mean number of fawns per female for female juveniles is determined by the parameter juv repro reproduction is modeled as density dependent among 2 and 3 year old females according to the equation r r m a x 1 e 0 024 d t 58 where r max is the maximum reproductive rate 2 0 fawns per female for 2 year old females 2 3 fawns per female for 3 year old females and dt is deer mi2 the number of fawns per female is determined by randomly drawing from a poisson distribution with λ r we modeled r 0 18 fawns per female for juvenile females regardless of population density diefenbach et al 2019 if the number of fawns per female drawn from the poisson distribution for a given individual is zero that individual does not produce any fawns that year female adults that reproduce can give birth to 1 2 or 3 offspring and female juveniles that reproduce can give birth to 1 or 2 offspring after giving birth an individual s state variable reproductive status is updated to true and its state variable births is updated to the number of fawns it produces all new fawns have their state variable mom set to the id number of their mother 2 7 4 mortality mortality is divided into two groups natural and harvest natural mortality is any non hunting mortality for a deer e g deer vehicle collision disease and we chose to model annual survival which is the complement of natural mortality using the parameter chance survive the annual survival rate for all deer from the conclusion of one hunting season to the next is 0 90 wallingford et al 2017 male and female adults can also experience age specific mortality and adults will die if they reach the maximum age of 10 years old harvest mortality differs according to the population density the sex and age class of an individual and the individual s position on the landscape all individuals that survive non hunting mortality are susceptible to harvest mortality harvest rates represent the probability of mortality for white tailed deer from a hunting program in all cases harvest rates are 0 59 for male adults determined by the parameters s ma hunt and r ma hunt and 0 50 for male juveniles determined by the parameters s mj hunt and r mj hunt wallingford et al 2017 see section 2 8 1 for further information female adults female juveniles and fawns are all considered antlerless deer and experience the same harvest rates antlerless deer in the surrounding area experience harvest rates of 0 245 0 225 and 0 205 according to the parameter s ant hunt which results in stable population densities of

population at each desired density 30 40 50 deer mi² are available in appendix a all parameters used in our model simulations are derived from peer review literature based on expert opinions table 2 or are estimated using a baseline model appendix a and are meant to simulate realistic deer behavior and dynamics of white tailed deer populations in pennsylvania usa see appendix a for model calibration and validation of the initial model deer population the model s annual survival rate for all sex age classes male adult harvest rate and male juvenile harvest rate were derived from data collected from radio collared deer in two pennsylvania counties after antler point restrictions aprs were enforced in the state wallingford et al 2017 although wallingford et al 2017 estimated a male juvenile harvest rate of 0 31 95 ci 0 23 0 38 for two pennsylvania counties statewide harvest rates for male juveniles are highly variable across units where selective harvest criteria such as aprs are implemented the intention of aprs in pennsylvania is to protect 50 of male juveniles from harvest to increase the male age structure wallingford et al 2017 we used a value of 0 50 for the male juvenile harvest rate in our model to reflect this regulation and because this value allowed the model population to exhibit male female ratios that were comparable to statewide male female ratios norton et al 2013 appendix a dispersal rates for male juveniles range between 0 46 and 0 80 but proximate causes of dispersal are still not well understood long et al 2005 based on expert opinion we used a male juvenile dispersal rate of 0 75 for our model deer population female juvenile dispersal rates and dispersal distances were modeled as density dependent but on average mean dispersal rate was 9 and mean dispersal distance was 12 miles lutz et al 2015 we modeled reproductive rates for female adults and female juveniles as the mean number of fawns per female according to harvest data collected by the pennsylvania game commission from female deer in pennsylvania from 1999 to 2006 diefenbach et al 2019 there is evidence to suggest that reproductive rates for female adult deer are density dependent and we modeled this relationship for 2 and 3 year old females see reproduction submodel section 2 7 3 the average reproductive rates for these age classes are comparable to the rates that were estimated for females after aprs were implemented in pennsylvania diefenbach et al 2019 2 9 sensitivity analysis density dependent relationships in a deer population can greatly influence the population density in an area where a deer density reduction is desired particularly strong or weak density dependent relationships can significantly bolster or hinder population growth and may alter certain aspects of deer behavior such as dispersal which can be difficult to monitor predicting density dependence relationships with certainty is notoriously challenging therefore we wanted to assess how sensitive our model outputs were to changes in the way these relationships are modeled in particular we measured the sensitivity of model derived end population density in the removal area to variation in four density dependent relationships a 2 year old adult female reproduction b 3 year old adult female reproduction c female juvenile dispersal rate d and female juvenile dispersal distance sensitivity was calculated as the relative change of the output quantity we initialized the model with one of the three desired densities 30 40 or 50 deer mi² and all parameter values listed in table 2 the landscape included a 20 mi² circular removal area the way in which we modeled the four density dependent relationships in sections 2 7 2 and 2 73 served as the baseline relationships for the sensitivity analysis these relationships were either taken directly from peer reviewed literature female juvenile dispersal rate and distance lutz et al 2015 or resulted in values that were comparable to estimates derived from peer reviewed literature female adult reproductive rates diefenbach et al 2019 for each of the four density dependent relationships we tested a stronger and weaker relationship from the baseline fig 3 we ran the baseline strong and weak relationships for a 20 year period over 100 repeated simulations and calculated the mean end population density in the 20th year 2 10 statistical analysis the model was run using behaviorspace a netlogo tool that can run multiple model simulations by systematically varying parameters and recording the results of each model run we ran each scenario which included a specific size and shape of the removal area landscape deer density and antlerless harvest rate in the removal area for a 20 year period and 100 iterations we compared mean end population density in the removal area among different scenarios using unpaired two samples wilcoxon tests α 0 05 in program r r core team 2020 unless otherwise stated mean end population density in the removal area was computed after the 20th year using the 100 model iterations because of the large number of scenarios evaluated we assessed hundreds of comparisons of removal area shapes removal area sizes landscape deer densities and antlerless harvest rates therefore we present only the largest difference in mean end population density for a given scenario 3 results 3 1 sensitivity analysis deer population density in the removal area was most sensitive to fluctuations in 3 year old density dependent reproduction table s3 which is expected because female deer in these age classes make up a majority of the breeding population in particular a strong density dependent relationship in 3 year old reproduction increased end population density in the removal area by as much as 16 while a weak density dependent relationship decreased it by as much as 12 for all other density dependent relationships sensitivity of end population density in the removal area was low with strong and weak relationships resulting in changes of 10 in the model output in most cases table s3 3 2 circle and square removal areas 3 2 1 population changes there were no differences between end population density among the same size circle and square removal areas largest difference in mean end population density 6 8 deer mi² in addition there were no differences between mean end population density among different size removal areas within the same shape largest difference in mean end population density 6 2 deer mi² for each surrounding deer density 30 40 and 50 deer mi² populations in the removal area took on average 5 steps years to be reduced by 20 at their lowest antlerless harvest rate fig 4 for all other antlerless harvest rates populations in the removal area were reduced by 26 76 after 5 years fig 5 for instance a harvest rate of 0 35 with a surrounding density of 30 deer mi² reduced the end population density after 5 years by 40 and a harvest rate of 0 50 reduced it by 74 fig 5a for 40 and 50 deer mi² a harvest rate of 0 30 reduced the end population density after 5 years between 26 and 32 and a harvest rate of 0 50 reduced it between 70 and 76 fig 5b and c the magnitude of change in end population densities in removal areas over time was largest for the 30 deer mi² scenarios fig 4 at the lowest antlerless harvest rate for each population density 0 30 0 28 0 26 for 30 40 and 50 deer mi² respectively the largest decline in end population density in the removal area over the 20 year period occurred in the 30 deer mi² scenarios and the smallest decline occurred in the 50 deer mi² scenarios particularly in the 30 deer mi² scenarios a 34 decrease in end population density occurred after 10 years and a 43 decrease occurred after 20 years table 3 the percent decrease in end population density was smaller for the 40 and 50 deer mi² scenarios with 29 and 25 decreases after 10 years and 38 and 32 decreases after 20 years respectively table 3 the 40 and 50 deer mi² scenarios required harvest rates of 30 to obtain a similar percent decrease as the 30 deer mi² scenarios at its lowest harvest rate 30 table 3 3 2 2 success rates while there were individual simulations where ending deer densities in the removal area exceeded the starting density in all scenarios averaging across individual simulations within the scenario average ending deer densities were lower than the starting density table 4 the range of end population densities among simulations was large in small 0 5 and 1 mi² removal areas particularly at the lowest harvest rate for each surrounding density there was less variability in end population densities among simulations in the medium 5 mi² and large 10 15 20 25 mi² removal areas for instance for a scenario with 30 deer mi² starting density an antlerless harvest rate of 0 30 and a 0 5 mi² removal area 29 of simulations resulted in higher end population densities than the starting density while only 48 of simulations reduced the end population density by 20 after 5 years fig 6 in contrast 1 of simulations exceeded the starting density and 70 of simulations reduced the end population density by 20 after 5 years in scenarios with the same starting density and harvest parameters but where removal areas were medium 5 mi² or large 10 15 20 25 mi² fig 6 the variability in end population densities in each scenario remained relatively constant over time for instance in the 30 deer mi² scenarios at antlerless harvest rates of 0 35 and in the 40 and 50 deer mi² scenarios at antlerless harvest rates of 0 30 small removal areas 0 5 and 1 mi² had high variability in end population densities and these scenarios required higher antlerless harvest rates in order to reduce variability over the 20 year period medium and large removal areas 5 mi² had lower variability in end population densities after 5 years and maintained that small variability over the 20 year period even at the lowest harvest rate for each surrounding density 0 30 0 28 0 26 for 30 40 and 50 deer mi² respectively regardless of the surrounding deer density or size of removal areas antlerless harvest rates of 0 40 had the least variability in end population densities and the lowest harvest rate for each surrounding deer density had the greatest variability 3 2 3 rectangle removal areas there were no differences in end population density among different size removal areas with the same ratio of sides largest difference in mean end population density 2 1 deer mi² nor were there differences among different ratios of sides within removal areas of the same size largest difference in mean end population density 2 9 deer mi² for all sizes of rectangular removal areas 5 10 and 20 mi² and surrounding deer densities 30 40 and 50 deer mi² increasing the ratio of sides from 1 3 1 to 5 1 in the 20 mi² area and 1 3 1 to 10 1 in the 5 and 10 mi² areas did not change the average end population density in the removal area fig 7 similarly the variability in end population density changed little as the ratio of sides of the removal area increased however variability decreased as the size of the removal area increased in addition there were no differences in end population density among rectangular removal areas with different ratios of sides compared to square removal areas of the same size i e ratio of sides 1 1 fig 7 while there was a slight increase in the variability in end population densities for rectangular compared to square removal areas this variation was minimal given the variation in length width ratios 4 discussion hunting has historically been utilized as a population management tool and managers often use hunters to reduce deer densities in specific geographical areas in order to meet land use and human health objectives e g promote forest regeneration reduce deer vehicle collisions however the decline of hunting license sales across the united states poses a challenge to deer management programs that rely on hunter harvest to manipulate deer populations in addition state wildlife agencies nationwide that have observed a decline in hunting license sales have simultaneously observed an increase in the number of antlered males harvested u s fish and wildlife service and u s census bureau 2016 research that has investigated the social structure of female deer suggests that localized management a deer management strategy that focuses on the removal of related female family units has the potential to reduce locally abundant populations mcnulty et al 1997 porter et al 1991 still hunter preference for antlered males has led to considerably higher harvest rates for these individuals than for antlerless female deer wallingford et al 2017 state agencies across the eastern united states have created programs to incentivize hunters to harvest antlerless deer e g dmap in pennsylvania but the effectiveness of such programs and their impact on localized deer populations remains poorly understood our results indicate that the landscape deer density localized antlerless harvest rate and size of the removal area have the greatest influence on the ability to locally reduce deer density while the shape of the removal area circle square or rectangle with different ratios of sides has little influence the application of a localized antlerless removal may therefore be an effective strategy for lower density herds 30 deer mi² in larger areas 5 mi² for higher density herds consistently high antlerless harvest rates may be needed to see substantial localized deer density reductions in our model all scenarios had on average a reduction in deer density in the removal area over the 20 year time period and a 20 reduction was obtained in 5 years however the magnitude of change over time was smaller for the higher density scenarios 40 and 50 deer mi² than for the lower density scenario 30 deer mi² particularly at the lowest harvest rate for each deer density table 3 furthermore the success of a localized deer density reduction program may depend on the management objective for example if the objective is to reduce deer density below a certain threshold the antlerless harvest rate and time required to reach that objective can vary greatly depending on the threshold value for instance horsley et al 2003 determined that the deer density threshold for negative impacts on forest vegetation under four experimental plots in northwestern pennsylvania usa was 21 deer mi² using this value as a reference our model shows that in order to reduce deer densities in 5 years at or below that threshold antlerless harvest rates of 0 35 are needed in landscapes with deer densities of 30 deer mi² fig 5a 0 40 in landscapes with deer densities of 40 deer mi² fig 5b and 0 45 in landscapes with deer densities of 50 deer mi² fig 5c it is important to note when interpreting these results that our model simulated a continuous removal effort maintaining increased antlerless harvest rates in the removal area throughout the simulations while deer density in the surrounding area remained constant if managers are unable to achieve consistent antlerless harvest rates or if deer density surrounding a removal area changes substantially the success of a localized deer density program may be impacted and localized reductions may take longer to achieve than what our model predicted ultimately to reduce deer densities in landscapes of higher deer densities 30 deer mi² through hunting our model suggests that managers will need to maintain antlerless harvest rates of 30 for 5 years which may be difficult as hunting license sales continue to decline to confirm our modeling exercise we compare our results to a study conducted by mcdonald et al 2007 where controlled hunts occurred from 1991 to 2004 in 5 zones at quabbin reservation in central massachusetts usa the hunted zones ranged in size from 7 to 19 mi² and initial estimated deer densities in each zone ranged from 29 7 to 71 8 deer mi² the management goal to achieve post hunt deer densities of 10 deer mi² was achieved after 2 4 years in each hunted zone and hunters harvested 55 83 of antlerless deer annually while it is likely that the high antlerless harvest rates in this study allowed the management goal to be achieved in such a short time frame these harvest rates were able to be maintained for the entirety of the study and as a result the post hunt deer densities were sustained at or below the management goal in contrast simard et al 2012 reduced deer densities within five 8 mi² areas on anticosti island québec canada with initial deer densities ranging from 34 to 55 deer mi² by removing 50 of antlerless deer in year 1 and 25 in years 2 5 but did not find evidence of successful vegetative growth in experimental sites antlerless harvest rates in this study were reduced by half after one year and our model would suggest that this decrease coupled with the high initial deer densities is likely what hindered the success of the localized deer density reduction porter et al 1991 proposed that the minimum area needed to apply a localized deer removal would be 1 5 8 mi² our results show that the minimum size necessary to successfully reduce deer density is 5 mi² and that localized reductions are also successful in areas as large as 25 mi² in our model smaller removal areas 0 5 and 1 mi² had on average low success 50 in reducing deer density over time and noticeably high variability in end population density among simulations whereas larger removal areas 5 mi² had higher success 70 and more consistent results across simulations fig 6 these results demonstrate that hunting alone is unlikely to successfully reduce locally abundant populations on small areas but may be an effective strategy for populations on larger areas the difficulty with using hunters to manage small local deer populations is further exacerbated in landscapes with high deer densities although higher antlerless harvest rates in our model resulted in larger deer density reductions in small areas on average they did little to reduce the variability among simulations compared to larger areas fig 5 localized management through actions such as culling has been suggested as an alternative to hunting for small locally abundant deer populations based on the rose petal hypothesis mathews 1989 porter et al 1991 using this technique mcnulty et al 1997 was able to successfully reduce deer densities in a small 0 5 mi² area in new york usa but the landscape was characterized by low initial deer densities 5 15 deer mi² which may have contributed to the success similarly miller et al 2010 performed high intensity culling by removing approximately 60 of females from a 0 5 mi² area in west virginia usa where deer herds averaged 30 50 deer mi² but found that deer adjacent to the removal area shifted their home ranges and recolonized the removal area within 3 years these results and the results from our model suggest that localized management may be an effective technique for reducing deer densities in small areas on landscapes with low deer density but where deer density is high neither culling nor hunting alone may be sufficient for reducing small locally abundant populations this is likely because in areas of high deer density even if the populations are an ideal candidate for localized management i e have high site fidelity and low female dispersal campbell et al 2004 larger deer numbers can still provide several opportunities for dispersal even if the likelihood of any one female dispersing is low weckel and rockwell 2013 therefore a combination of culling and antlerless deer hunting may be needed if managers want to reduce deer densities in small 5 mi² areas on landscapes of high deer densities further exploration via a model based approach is necessary to determine if this combination of deer removal techniques is sufficient to reduce deer densities in small areas areas to apply a deer density reduction often are chosen based on a variety of factors such as areas where deer vehicle collisions are common or on recent timber harvest sites where adequate forest regeneration is desired these areas may be surrounded by certain landscape features e g rivers roads that can constrain the size and shape of a unit in our model we tested three different removal area shapes circle square and rectangle with different ratios of sides length width to emulate removal areas that may be limited by spatial configurations we found that the shape of the removal area in particular increasing the ratio of sides in a rectangular area had little effect on the ability to locally reduce deer density this unexpected result is likely a product of long dispersal distances particularly for females average male and female dispersal distance in forested landscapes is 4 12 mi with some males dispersing 24 mi and some females dispersing 30 mi long et al 2005 lutz et al 2015 we would expect that given the dispersal behavior of a deer population that there is a threshold for how large the ratio of sides of a removal area can be and once that threshold is reached the longevity of spatial reductions would decrease in our model the largest ratio of sides was 10 1 for 5 and 10 mi² areas and 5 1 for 20 mi² areas which corresponds approximately to 10 mi 0 5 mi 10 mi 1 0 mi and 10 mi 2 mi respectively it is possible that these ratios were not extreme enough to counteract the long dispersal distances of simulated individuals and influence end population density in the removal area simulating scenarios with a greater ratio of sides e g 15 1 20 1 25 1 etc may help elucidate what effect if any this variable has on the ability locally reduce deer density in addition dispersal is the primary mechanism that is driving the minimum size needed to affect a localized reduction in deer density based on our model results we would expect the minimum size of a removal area to increase as juvenile dispersal rate and distance increases that is the larger the average dispersal rate and the longer the average dispersal distance for males and females in a deer population the larger the removal area needed for long term sustained deer density reductions moving forward managers can use the results of our model to evaluate the effectiveness of their antlerless deer removal programs and possibly adjust their programs to help better achieve deer management goals while our model simulated hunting patterns and behavior for white tailed deer in forested landscapes in pennsylvania usa our approach could be widely adopted for deer populations where local data are available to parameterize models the design of our model landscape was meant to simulate a densely forested habitat but it did not include any additional landscape features e g streams roads or habitat fragmentation that could impact deer movement across the landscape incorporating these spatial configurations into the model could help determine if these factors have any effect on dispersal behavior and subsequent hunter success rates in addition other hunting regulations such as antler point restrictions and season length could be considered to elucidate the impacts of multiple hunting regimes on the ability to locally reduce deer density modeling deer density reductions in areas of mixed forested and agricultural land areas with a specific spatial distribution of young and old forest or in non forested areas such as agricultural landscapes parks and urban suburban regions may be useful in helping to design or modify deer management programs based on landscape and residential classifications 5 conclusions our study and other empirical studies have shown that localized antlerless deer harvest has the potential to create areas of persistent reduced deer density kilpatrick et al 2001 mcnulty et al 1997 oyer and porter 2004 porter et al 1991 2004 hunter preference for large mature male white tailed deer has led to considerably higher harvest rates for these individuals than for female deer wallingford et al 2017 however targeting female deer can reduce a population s reproductive potential brown et al 2000 and can help create areas of reduced deer density if females exhibit low dispersal and high site fidelity campbell et al 2004 in forested landscapes promoting forest regeneration in areas such as recent timber harvest sites is often a goal of land managers increasing antlerless harvest in these specific geographical areas can reduce deer density which in turn can decrease deer browsing and stimulate regeneration as well as provide hunters additional opportunities to hunt our results show that increasing antlerless harvest rates through hunting for lower density herds 30 deer mi² in areas 5 mi² can successfully reduce deer densities in 5 years and that these reductions can be maintained long term with continuous removal efforts however it may take several seasons after an antlerless deer harvest program has been implemented before it can achieve the harvest rates required to see a localized reduction in addition the ability of managers to maintain constant antlerless harvest rates annually may be unlikely due to issues such as partial controllability and environmental variation williams 1997 furthermore for substantial deer density reductions to occur in small 5 mi² areas or in areas of high 40 deer mi² deer density managers need to consistently achieve considerably high antlerless harvest rates 30 which may not be feasible using hunting holsman et al 2010 our model did not consider factors such as changing hunting regulations or disease e g chronic wasting disease that could influence white tailed deer population dynamics devivo et al 2017 nor did it consider the effects of spatial configurations e g habitat fragmentation landscape classification on deer populations thus the size of a removal area and hunting pressure needed to enact a localized deer density reduction may differ

24668,localized management of white tailed deer odocoileus virginianus involves the removal of matriarchal family units with the intent to create areas of reduced deer density however application of this approach has not always been successful possibly because of female dispersal and high deer densities we developed a spatially explicit agent based model to investigate the intensity of deer removal required to locally reduce deer density depending on the surrounding deer density dispersal behavior and size and shape of the area of localized reduction application of this model is illustrated using the example of abundant deer populations in pennsylvania usa most scenarios required at least 5 years before substantial deer density reductions occurred our model indicated that a localized reduction was successful for scenarios in which the surrounding deer density was lowest 30 deer mi² localized antlerless harvest rates were 30 and the removal area was 5 mi² when the size of the removal area was 5 mi2 end population density was highly variable and in some scenarios exceeded the initial density the shape of the area of localized reduction had less influence on the ability to reduce deer density than the size there were no differences in mean deer density in the same size circle or square removal areas similarly increasing the ratio of sides length width in rectangular removal areas had little influence on the ability to locally reduce deer densities situations in which deer density was higher 40 or 50 deer mi2 required antlerless removal rates to exceed 30 and took more than 5 years to considerably reduce density in the localized area regardless of its size these results indicate that the size of the removal area surrounding deer density and antlerless harvest rate are the most influential factors in locally reducing deer density therefore localized management likely can be an effective strategy for lower density herds especially in larger removal areas for high density herds the success of this strategy would depend most on the ability of resource managers to achieve consistently high antlerless harvest rates keywords agent based model modeling odocoileus virginianus population reduction rose petal hypothesis white tailed deer 1 introduction in the eastern united states white tailed deer odocoileus virginianus are considered a dominant

depletion and disease spread côté et al 2004 nugent et al 2011 selective browsing by ungulates particularly in forests can lead to changes in the stand structure and compositional shifts of tree

these forest changes also can induce changes in associated animal communities nuttle et al 2011 to help alleviate issues induced by abundant deer populations management actions often involve reducing deer densities and strategies to do so include culling kilpatrick et al 1997 nugent et al 2011 fertility control merrill et al 2006 predator reintroductions ripple and beschta 2003 and most commonly hunting heusmann 1999 woolf and roseberry 1998 in north america regulated hunting has historically been used as a population management tool rutberg 1997 but management actions are typically applied at larger scales hundreds of mi2 because state agencies have difficulty collecting data at finer scales to assess deer abundance rosenberry and diefenbach 2019 consequently management actions by wildlife agencies may not be effective for controlling locally abundant populations waller and alverson 1997 research that has investigated the social structure of female or antlerless deer suggests that a targeted removal of female social groups has the potential to alleviate issues regarding locally abundant populations mcnulty et al 1997 porter et al 1991 female social groups are family units of primarily matriarchal females older presumably dominant females female offspring and siblings the rose petal hypothesis mathews 1989 suggests that deer populations expand as an array of family units composed of related females matriarchal females occupy a home range that is at the center of the family unit with several generations of female offspring occupying home ranges that overlap these overlapping home ranges expand in a form that is analogous to the petals of a rose the rose petal hypothesis depends on female deer in the target populations exhibiting low dispersal rates and high philopatry campbell et al 2004 localized management is a deer management strategy that aims to exploit the rose petal hypothesis by targeting these social groups through the removal of female deer in specific geographical areas with the goal of creating areas of persistent reduced deer density mcnulty et al 1997 porter et al 1991 for this approach to be applicable particularly on small areas 0 5 mi² the rose petal hypothesis must be a suitable model of population social structure porter et al 1991 proposed that the minimum area needed for the application of localized management would be 1 5 8 mi² however the minimum area estimate from their study is based solely on the home range size of female white tailed deer and does not account for the surrounding deer density i e deer density in a larger management unit consisting of the removal area and a buffer around it in addition the proposed minimum area size stems from the idea that the management action taking place is a targeted removal of female family units through sharp shooting or relocation and does not consider hunting as a potential tool despite being the most popular and common deer management method woolf and roseberry 1998 furthermore evidence for successful localized management at the small scale 0 5 mi² and large scale 8 mi² is conflicting boyce and mcdonald 1999 kilpatrick et al 2001 mcdonald et al 2007 mcnulty et al 1997 miller et al 2010 oyer and porter 2004 simard et al 2013 documented successes often have low surrounding deer densities high antlerless harvest rates and population monitoring immediately following the deer removal for only a few years kilpatrick et al 2001 mcdonald et al 2007 mcnulty et al 1997 oyer and porter 2004 however evidence suggests that the success of localized management may depend on a variety of environmental spatial temporal and biological factors that are often difficult to test empirically there are currently no empirical tests of localized management that have evaluated what effect if any the shape of a removal area has on the ability to reduce deer density this variable is important to consider because potential removal areas may be restricted in shape by landscape features e g streams roads or other factors such as boundaries for timber harvest sites or disease management areas accordingly in pennsylvania usa deer populations are considered abundant statewide and agencies such as the pennsylvania game commission pgc have created numerous programs to manage deer across the state one such program is the deer management assistance program dmap which was developed to help landowners meet their land use goals by providing hunters the opportunity to harvest additional antlerless deer on properties that participate in the program the pennsylvania department of conservation and natural resources bureau of forestry dcnr implements dmap in specific areas across approximately 3 500 mi² of state forest land according to numerous criteria e g deer impact data in order to meet deer management goals conserving forests and native plants through deer management internet 2019 however dmap areas vary considerably in size 4 to 39 mi² and logistical and financial constraints may limit the ability of managers to effectively monitor deer populations on these units therefore it is difficult to determine if dmap is achieving its intended goals and objectives due to the limitations that state wildlife agencies may face when evaluating deer management programs such as dmap model based approaches are becoming increasingly popular for assessing new and existing management actions models serve as an important tool for wildlife management because they are generally low cost pose less risk than field experiments and allow managers to test different management strategies and assess each strategy s effectiveness as it pertains to objectives mccarthy 2004 several models have evaluated the effects of different harvest strategies on the ability to locally kilpatrick et al 2004 mcdonald et al 2007 weckel and rockwell 2013 or regionally xie et al 1999 reduce deer numbers these models were able to simulate realistic deer populations for their respective study area s predict the factors that contribute to the success or failure of deer management actions and were validated by comparing model output with empirical data a similar model based approach could be beneficial for deer populations in pennsylvania particularly those in dmap areas so that managers can evaluate the efficacy of their deer management programs today agent based models abms also referred to as individual based models are also being used to help researchers model wildlife management problems abms describe population dynamics by explicitly simulating the behavior of individuals in a population on the landscape capturing local interactions and integrating individual life history information grimm and railsback 2005 wiens et al 1993 these features allow population properties to emerge from the behavior and interactions of individuals grimm and railsback 2005 semeniuk et al 2012 an advantage of abms is that they can capture fine scale spatial resolutions e g at the scale of a single population grimm et al 2006 that allow managers to use existing empirical data to test wildlife management scenarios salinas et al 2015 in addition abms are useful for modeling species whose population structure is influenced by social cues e g white tailed deer federico et al 2013 mathews 1989 watkins et al 2015 abms have been used to model a variety of wildlife management and conservation problems for many species such as the endangered huemul deer hippocamelus bisulcus lópez alfaro et al 2012 jaguars panthera once watkins et al 2015 endangered tigers panthera tigris carter et al 2015 wolves canis lupus chapron et al 2016 red howler monkeys alouatta seniculus wiederholt et al 2010 and feral hogs sus scrofa salinas et al 2015 for deer and other ungulates many spatially explicit abms have focused on modeling the impacts of landscape heterogeneity on species movement tierney 2015 turner et al 1993 dispersal behavior stanke et al 2018 or disease spread belsare et al 2020 kjær 2010 we developed a spatially explicit agent based model to evaluate the influence of different harvest management strategies on the ability to reduce white tailed deer densities in localized forested areas in pennsylvania usa we considered the surrounding deer density intensity of antlerless harvest and size and shape of the removal area as the parameters to vary in our model because we predicted they would have the greatest effect on white tailed deer population dynamics the size and shape of the removal area is of particular interest because deer density reductions often occur in specific geographical areas bounded by landscape features and the significance of these factors on deer numbers is not well understood mcnulty et al 1997 simard et al 2013 to date no spatially explicit abms have investigated the role of the size and shape of a localized area on the ability to reduce deer density or the influence of the surrounding deer density and level of harvest on deer population dynamics these effects may be important for localized management of white tailed deer because the species exhibits behaviors such as male dispersal long et al 2008 density dependent female dispersal lutz et al 2015 and density dependent reproduction that could influence recolonization and reproductive rates of areas where a localized deer density reduction is desired while our model focuses on localized reductions for white tailed deer populations in forested landscapes in pennsylvania the approach is applicable to other areas where local species and environmental data are available to parameterize models 2 model description the model description follows the odd overview design concepts details protocol for describing individual and agent based models grimm et al 2006 as updated by grimm et al 2020 the model was implemented using netlogo an agent based modeling program center for connected learning and computer based modeling northwestern university version 6 0 4 1999 2 1 purpose the purpose of the model is to predict changes in localized white tailed deer density in response to hunting pressure landscape deer density and size and shape of localized removal areas the framework is adapted for white tailed deer populations in forested landscapes in pennsylvania usa 2 2 entities state variables and scales model entities are male and female adult deer male and female juvenile deer fawns and patches all state variables characterizing these entities are listed in table 1 each deer has a combination of seven state variables that include age sex location reproduction and dispersal deer are categorized into 3 age classes fawn 0 years juvenile 1 year and adult 2 10 years we considered male juveniles and male adults to be antlered deer and fawns female juveniles and female adults to be antlerless deer patches have one state variable habitat which can take on a value of 1 to identify cells that make up the removal area or a value of 2 to identify cells that make up the surrounding area we defined the removal area to be a set of cells where antlerless deer harvest rates were greater potentially resulting in reduced deer densities and these areas could be one of three different shapes circle square or rectangle circle and square removal areas could take on one of seven different sizes 0 5 1 5 10 15 20 or 25 mi2 rectangular removal areas could be 5 10 or 20 mi² and at each size we varied the ratio of sides length width to be 1 3 1 1 5 1 2 1 3 1 4 1 5 1 in the 5 and 20 mi² areas 6 1 in the 10 mi² area and 10 1 in the 5 and 10 mi² areas we defined the surrounding area be a set of cells that were not included in the removal area where antlerless harvest rates kept the population size constant simulations were carried out on a 2 dimensional grid of 77 77 cells representing a 11 mi 11 mi forested landscape 121 mi2 each cell represented an area of 0 14 mi² and a 7 7 group of cells represented an area of one square mile we used miles rather than kilometers as the measurement unit because that is the scale for which wildlife management agencies typically implement their management actions and the results of this model need to be applicable those agencies belsare et al 2020 the model has an annual time step and it runs for a 20 year period with the model output being exported every year 2 3 process overview and scheduling at each time step 1 year the following processes for deer occur in the given order fig 1 model entities are processed in a randomized order and changes in state variables are updated immediately the submodels implementing these processes are described in detail in section 2 7 below 2 3 1 age and growth all individuals update their state variable age by one year juveniles and fawns simultaneously advance to the next age class 2 3 2 dispersal male and female juveniles disperse female dispersal rates and distances are density dependent while male dispersal rates and distances are density independent 2 3 3 reproduction adult females reproduce according to density dependent reproduction while juvenile females reproduce according to density independent reproduction 2 3 4 mortality independent individuals of all age classes fawn juvenile adult are subject to two types of mortality natural and harvest natural mortality occurs according to the annual survival rate of the model and the age of the individual harvest mortality occurs according to sex and age specific harvest rates as well as the location of the individual on the landscape 2 4 design concepts 2 4 1 emergence population density in the removal area emerges from individual behavior reproduction and dispersal and mortality natural and harvest behavior incorporates logical rules based on biological information from deer populations in pennsylvania usa and mortality is dictated by probabilities 2 4 2 adaptation male and female juveniles make the decision to disperse from their initial location to a new unoccupied cell on the landscape the model includes dynamic feedback on the reproduction and female juvenile dispersal parameters these values are density dependent and can change over time according to an individual s location on the landscape 2 4 3 sensing a fawn that is born can sense the identity of its mother and will inherit its mother s location although each cell on the landscape can have multiple agents individual deer exist independent of one another and individuals cannot distinguish between the surrounding area and removal area however individuals that experience density dependent behavior can sense the number of individuals in either the surrounding area or removal area depending on their position on the grid 2 4 4 stochasticity we incorporated stochastic processes into reproduction dispersal and mortality reproduction and female juvenile dispersal are density dependent for all other stochastic processes the model generates a random floating point number between 0 and 1 and the action occurs if the number is less than the probability of occurrence for each process see section 2 7 for details we did not include environmental stochasticity in the model therefore the landscape remains constant for the simulation period 20 years 2 4 5 observation at the end of each time step we observe population level processes these include the total number of deer harvested in the removal area the number of antlered and antlerless deer harvested in the removal area the total number of deer and post harvest population density in the removal area and the number of antlered and antlerless deer in the removal area the model also has two graphical displays one plots the abundance of deer in each patch type versus time and the other plots a frequency distribution of deer in all sex age classes 2 5 initialization the model is initialized with a landscape that contains a certain size and shape of the removal area model deer population for the landscape is initialized using a specific population density 30 40 or 50 deer mi² sex age composition fawns male juveniles female juveniles male adults female adults antlerless harvest rate in the surrounding area and antlerless harvest rate in the removal area each agent deer is placed in a randomly selected cell without replacement within the surrounding area or removal area we evaluated 30 deer mi2 because it emulates current deer density estimates in pennsylvania that were obtained using a sex age kill model norton et al 2013 we evaluated 40 and 50 deer mi2 to explore the effects of implementing different localized management strategies on high density populations we created the model s initial deer population from a baseline model that was developed in netlogo version 6 0 4 without any removal areas see appendix a for details the 30 40 and 50 deer mi² densities in the baseline model were run to determine the antlerless harvest rates that would stabilize the population at each density table s1 and the resulting sex age composition of the stable population fig 2 table s2 which was then used to initialize all simulations 2 6 input data the model does not use input data to represent time varying processes 2 7 submodels all model parameters are listed in table 2 details on the initial deer population sex age composition and the antlerless harvest rates in the surrounding area at each deer density 30 40 and 50 deer mi² can be found in appendix a all other population parameters were derived from peer reviewed literature harvest data collected by the pennsylvania game commission or are based on expert opinion 2 7 1 age and growth at the beginning of each time step individuals update their state variable age age in years by one year juvenile deer grow to become adults and fawns grow to become juveniles fawns have a 0 50 chance of being male and a 0 50 chance of being female which reflects the 1 1 sex ratio of fawns at birth ditchkoff 2011 2 7 2 dispersal male and female juveniles have the potential to disperse from their initial location to a new location on the landscape we modeled dispersal rates and distances for these individuals dispersal rate refers to the proportion of dispersing juveniles and is set using the parameters male juv disp rate and fem juv disp rate individuals who disperse travel a calculated distance in a random direction using the parameters male juv disp dist and fem juv disp dist if a dispersing individual reaches a cell that contains one or more agents it moves to the nearest unoccupied cell on the landscape dispersing juveniles can move from the surrounding area to the removal area and vice versa or disperse to a cell within the patch type they originated in our model assumes that the number of individuals dispersing out of the model landscape is equal to the number of individuals dispersing into the model landscape immigration emigration the model space is toroidal so if a dispersing individual moves past the edge of the landscape it will reappear on the opposite edge the dispersal rate for male juveniles is modeled as 0 75 long et al 2015 and dispersal distance is modeled by randomly drawing from a log normal distribution with μ 8 2 km and σ 7 6 km diefenbach et al 2008 the dispersal distance is then converted into miles and the individual disperses the calculated distance in a random direction female juvenile dispersal rates and distances are modeled as density dependent lutz et al 2015 deer density in both the surrounding area and removal area are first converted from deer per square mile to deer per square kilometer then dispersal rate is modeled using a subset of the data presented in lutz et al 2015 which excludes data from two populations in illinois due to the small proportion of forest and high dispersal rates according to the equation dispersal rate 1 1 e 2 345385 0 007345 d forest where dforest is deer km2 of forest female juvenile dispersal distance is modeled according to the equation d i s p e r s a l d i s t a n c e a b c where a 18 703 se 3 710 b 0 02533 se 0 857 and c deer km² the dispersal distance is then converted into miles and the individual disperses the calculated distance in a random direction after dispersal an individual s state variable dispersal status is updated to true dispersal distance is updated to the distance traveled in miles and location is updated to the cell where it lands 2 7 3 reproduction all juvenile and adult females have the potential to get pregnant and produce offspring fawns the mean number of fawns per female for 2 year old female adults is determined by the parameter adult repro 2 the mean number of fawns per female for 3 year old female adults is determined by the parameter adult repro 3 and the mean number of fawns per female for female juveniles is determined by the parameter juv repro reproduction is modeled as density dependent among 2 and 3 year old females according to the equation r r m a x 1 e 0 024 d t 58 where r max is the maximum reproductive rate 2 0 fawns per female for 2 year old females 2 3 fawns per female for 3 year old females and dt is deer mi2 the number of fawns per female is determined by randomly drawing from a poisson distribution with λ r we modeled r 0 18 fawns per female for juvenile females regardless of population density diefenbach et al 2019 if the number of fawns per female drawn from the poisson distribution for a given individual is zero that individual does not produce any fawns that year female adults that reproduce can give birth to 1 2 or 3 offspring and female juveniles that reproduce can give birth to 1 or 2 offspring after giving birth an individual s state variable reproductive status is updated to true and its state variable births is updated to the number of fawns it produces all new fawns have their state variable mom set to the id number of their mother 2 7 4 mortality mortality is divided into two groups natural and harvest natural mortality is any non hunting mortality for a deer e g deer vehicle collision disease and we chose to model annual survival which is the complement of natural mortality using the parameter chance survive the annual survival rate for all deer from the conclusion of one hunting season to the next is 0 90 wallingford et al 2017 male and female adults can also experience age specific mortality and adults will die if they reach the maximum age of 10 years old harvest mortality differs according to the population density the sex and age class of an individual and the individual s position on the landscape all individuals that survive non hunting mortality are susceptible to harvest mortality harvest rates represent the probability of mortality for white tailed deer from a hunting program in all cases harvest rates are 0 59 for male adults determined by the parameters s ma hunt and r ma hunt and 0 50 for male juveniles determined by the parameters s mj hunt and r mj hunt wallingford et al 2017 see section 2 8 1 for further information female adults female juveniles and fawns are all considered antlerless deer and experience the same harvest rates antlerless deer in the surrounding area experience harvest rates of 0 245 0 225 and 0 205 according to the parameter s ant hunt which results in stable population densities of 30 40 and 50 deer mi² respectively see appendix a table s1 and these harvest rates remain constant over time antlerless deer in the removal area experience harvest rates of either 0 30 0 35 0 40 0 45 or 0 50 for 30 deer mi² 0 28 0 30 0 35 0 40 0 45 or 0 50 for 40 deer mi² and 0 26 0 30 0 35 0 40 0 45 or 0 50 for 50 deer mi² according to the parameter r ant hunt table 2 the addition of 0 28 for 40 deer mi² and 0 26 for 50 deer mi² allows the percent increase from each population density s stabilizing harvest rate 0 245 0 225 0 205 in the surrounding area to its lowest increased harvest rate 0 30 0 28 0 26 in the removal area to be proportional 2 8 parameterization and simulation experiments 2 8 1 parameterization and calibration population parameters used to initialize the model deer population at each desired density 30 40 50 deer mi² are available in appendix a all parameters used in our model simulations are derived from peer review literature based on expert opinions table 2 or are estimated using a baseline model appendix a and are meant to simulate realistic deer behavior and dynamics of white tailed deer populations in pennsylvania usa see appendix a for model calibration and validation of the initial model deer population the model s annual survival rate for all sex age classes male adult harvest rate and male juvenile harvest rate were derived from data collected from radio collared deer in two pennsylvania counties after antler point restrictions aprs were enforced in the state wallingford et al 2017 although wallingford et al 2017 estimated a male juvenile harvest rate of 0 31 95 ci 0 23 0 38 for two pennsylvania counties statewide harvest rates for male juveniles are highly variable across units where selective harvest criteria such as aprs are implemented the intention of aprs in pennsylvania is to protect 50 of male juveniles from harvest to increase the male age structure wallingford et al 2017 we used a value of 0 50 for the male juvenile harvest rate in our model to reflect this regulation and because this value allowed the model population to exhibit male female ratios that were comparable to statewide male female ratios norton et al 2013 appendix a dispersal rates for male juveniles range between 0 46 and 0 80 but proximate causes of dispersal are still not well understood long et al 2005 based on expert opinion we used a male juvenile dispersal rate of 0 75 for our model deer population female juvenile dispersal rates and dispersal distances were modeled as density dependent but on average mean dispersal rate was 9 and mean dispersal distance was 12 miles lutz et al 2015 we modeled reproductive rates for female adults and female juveniles as the mean number of fawns per female according to harvest data collected by the pennsylvania game commission from female deer in pennsylvania from 1999 to 2006 diefenbach et al 2019 there is evidence to suggest that reproductive rates for female adult deer are density dependent and we modeled this relationship for 2 and 3 year old females see reproduction submodel section 2 7 3 the average reproductive rates for these age classes are comparable to the rates that were estimated for females after aprs were implemented in pennsylvania diefenbach et al 2019 2 9 sensitivity analysis density dependent relationships in a deer population can greatly influence the population density in an area where a deer density reduction is desired particularly strong or weak density dependent relationships can significantly bolster or hinder population growth and may alter certain aspects of deer behavior such as dispersal which can be difficult to monitor predicting density dependence relationships with certainty is notoriously challenging therefore we wanted to assess how sensitive our model outputs were to changes in the way these relationships are modeled in particular we measured the sensitivity of model derived end population density in the removal area to variation in four density dependent relationships a 2 year old adult female reproduction b 3 year old adult female reproduction c female juvenile dispersal rate d and female juvenile dispersal distance sensitivity was calculated as the relative change of the output quantity we initialized the model with one of the three desired densities 30 40 or 50 deer mi² and all parameter values listed in table 2 the landscape included a 20 mi² circular removal area the way in which we modeled the four density dependent relationships in sections 2 7 2 and 2 73 served as the baseline relationships for the sensitivity analysis these relationships were either taken directly from peer reviewed literature female juvenile dispersal rate and distance lutz et al 2015 or resulted in values that were comparable to estimates derived from peer reviewed literature female adult reproductive rates diefenbach et al 2019 for each of the four density dependent relationships we tested a stronger and weaker relationship from the baseline fig 3 we ran the baseline strong and weak relationships for a 20 year period over 100 repeated simulations and calculated the mean end population density in the 20th year 2 10 statistical analysis the model was run using behaviorspace a netlogo tool that can run multiple model simulations by systematically varying parameters and recording the results of each model run we ran each scenario which included a specific size and shape of the removal area landscape deer density and antlerless harvest rate in the removal area for a 20 year period and 100 iterations we compared mean end population density in the removal area among different scenarios using unpaired two samples wilcoxon tests α 0 05 in program r r core team 2020 unless otherwise stated mean end population density in the removal area was computed after the 20th year using the 100 model iterations because of the large number of scenarios evaluated we assessed hundreds of comparisons of removal area shapes removal area sizes landscape deer densities and antlerless harvest rates therefore we present only the largest difference in mean end population density for a given scenario 3 results 3 1 sensitivity analysis deer population density in the removal area was most sensitive to fluctuations in 3 year old density dependent reproduction table s3 which is expected because female deer in these age classes make up a majority of the breeding population in particular a strong density dependent relationship in 3 year old reproduction increased end population density in the removal area by as much as 16 while a weak density dependent relationship decreased it by as much as 12 for all other density dependent relationships sensitivity of end population density in the removal area was low with strong and weak relationships resulting in changes of 10 in the model output in most cases table s3 3 2 circle and square removal areas 3 2 1 population changes there were no differences between end population density among the same size circle and square removal areas largest difference in mean end population density 6 8 deer mi² in addition there were no differences between mean end population density among different size removal areas within the same shape largest difference in mean end population density 6 2 deer mi² for each surrounding deer density 30 40 and 50 deer mi² populations in the removal area took on average 5 steps years to be reduced by 20 at their lowest antlerless harvest rate fig 4 for all other antlerless harvest rates populations in the removal area were reduced by 26 76 after 5 years fig 5 for instance a harvest rate of 0 35 with a surrounding density of 30 deer mi² reduced the end population density after 5 years by 40 and a harvest rate of 0 50 reduced it by 74 fig 5a for 40 and 50 deer mi² a harvest rate of 0 30 reduced the end population density after 5 years between 26 and 32 and a harvest rate of 0 50 reduced it between 70 and 76 fig 5b and c the magnitude of change in end population densities in removal areas over time was largest for the 30 deer mi² scenarios fig 4 at the lowest antlerless harvest rate for each population density 0 30 0 28 0 26 for 30 40 and 50 deer mi² respectively the largest decline in end population density in the removal area over the 20 year period occurred in the 30 deer mi² scenarios and the smallest decline occurred in the 50 deer mi² scenarios particularly in the 30 deer mi² scenarios a 34 decrease in end population density occurred after 10 years and a 43 decrease occurred after 20 years table 3 the percent decrease in end population density was smaller for the 40 and 50 deer mi² scenarios with 29 and 25 decreases after 10 years and 38 and 32 decreases after 20 years respectively table 3 the 40 and 50 deer mi² scenarios required harvest rates of 30 to obtain a similar percent decrease as the 30 deer mi² scenarios at its lowest harvest rate 30 table 3 3 2 2 success rates while there were individual simulations where ending deer densities in the removal area exceeded the starting density in all scenarios averaging across individual simulations within the scenario average ending deer densities were lower than the starting density table 4 the range of end population densities among simulations was large in small 0 5 and 1 mi² removal areas particularly at the lowest harvest rate for each surrounding density there was less variability in end population densities among simulations in the medium 5 mi² and large 10 15 20 25 mi² removal areas for instance for a scenario with 30 deer mi² starting density an antlerless harvest rate of 0 30 and a 0 5 mi² removal area 29 of simulations resulted in higher end population densities than the starting density while only 48 of simulations reduced the end population density by 20 after 5 years fig 6 in contrast 1 of simulations exceeded the starting density and 70 of simulations reduced the end population density by 20 after 5 years in scenarios with the same starting density and harvest parameters but where removal areas were medium 5 mi² or large 10 15 20 25 mi² fig 6 the variability in end population densities in each scenario remained relatively constant over time for instance in the 30 deer mi² scenarios at antlerless harvest rates of 0 35 and in the 40 and 50 deer mi² scenarios at antlerless harvest rates of 0 30 small removal areas 0 5 and 1 mi² had high variability in end population densities and these scenarios required higher antlerless harvest rates in order to reduce variability over the 20 year period medium and large removal areas 5 mi² had lower variability in end population densities after 5 years and maintained that small variability over the 20 year period even at the lowest harvest rate for each surrounding density 0 30 0 28 0 26 for 30 40 and 50 deer mi² respectively regardless of the surrounding deer density or size of removal areas antlerless harvest rates of 0 40 had the least variability in end population densities and the lowest harvest rate for each surrounding deer density had the greatest variability 3 2 3 rectangle removal areas there were no differences in end population density among different size removal areas with the same ratio of sides largest difference in mean end population density 2 1 deer mi² nor were there differences among different ratios of sides within removal areas of the same size largest difference in mean end population density 2 9 deer mi² for all sizes of rectangular removal areas 5 10 and 20 mi² and surrounding deer densities 30 40 and 50 deer mi² increasing the ratio of sides from 1 3 1 to 5 1 in the 20 mi² area and 1 3 1 to 10 1 in the 5 and 10 mi² areas did not change the average end population density in the removal area fig 7 similarly the variability in end population density changed little as the ratio of sides of the removal area increased however variability decreased as the size of the removal area increased in addition there were no differences in end population density among rectangular removal areas with different ratios of sides compared to square removal areas of the same size i e ratio of sides 1 1 fig 7 while there was a slight increase in the variability in end population densities for rectangular compared to square removal areas this variation was minimal given the variation in length width ratios 4 discussion hunting has historically been utilized as a population management tool and managers often use hunters to reduce deer densities in specific geographical areas in order to meet land use and human health objectives e g promote forest regeneration reduce deer vehicle collisions however the decline of hunting license sales across the united states poses a challenge to deer management programs that rely on hunter harvest to manipulate deer populations in addition state wildlife agencies nationwide that have observed a decline in hunting license sales have simultaneously observed an increase in the number of antlered males harvested u s fish and wildlife service and u s census bureau 2016 research that has investigated the social structure of female deer suggests that localized management a deer management strategy that focuses on the removal of related female family units has the potential to reduce locally abundant populations mcnulty et al 1997 porter et al 1991 still hunter preference for antlered males has led to considerably higher harvest rates for these individuals than for antlerless female deer wallingford et al 2017 state agencies across the eastern united states have created programs to incentivize hunters to harvest antlerless deer e g dmap in pennsylvania but the effectiveness of such programs and their impact on localized deer populations remains poorly understood our results indicate that the landscape deer density localized antlerless harvest rate and size of the removal area have the greatest influence on the ability to locally reduce deer density while the shape of the removal area circle square or rectangle with different ratios of sides has little influence the application of a localized antlerless removal may therefore be an effective strategy for lower density herds 30 deer mi² in larger areas 5 mi² for higher density herds consistently high antlerless harvest rates may be needed to see substantial localized deer density reductions in our model all scenarios had on average a reduction in deer density in the removal area over the 20 year time period and a 20 reduction was obtained in 5 years however the magnitude of change over time was smaller for the higher density scenarios 40 and 50 deer mi² than for the lower density scenario 30 deer mi² particularly at the lowest harvest rate for each deer density table 3 furthermore the success of a localized deer density reduction program may depend on the management objective for example if the objective is to reduce deer density below a certain threshold the antlerless harvest rate and time required to reach that objective can vary greatly depending on the threshold value for instance horsley et al 2003 determined that the deer density threshold for negative impacts on forest vegetation under four experimental plots in northwestern pennsylvania usa was 21 deer mi² using this value as a reference our model shows that in order to reduce deer densities in 5 years at or below that threshold antlerless harvest rates of 0 35 are needed in landscapes with deer densities of 30 deer mi² fig 5a 0 40 in landscapes with deer densities of 40 deer mi² fig 5b and 0 45 in landscapes with deer densities of 50 deer mi² fig 5c it is important to note when interpreting these results that our model simulated a continuous removal effort maintaining increased antlerless harvest rates in the removal area throughout the simulations while deer density in the surrounding area remained constant if managers are unable to achieve consistent antlerless harvest rates or if deer density surrounding a removal area changes substantially the success of a localized deer density program may be impacted and localized reductions may take longer to achieve than what our model predicted ultimately to reduce deer densities in landscapes of higher deer densities 30 deer mi² through hunting our model suggests that managers will need to maintain antlerless harvest rates of 30 for 5 years which may be difficult as hunting license sales continue to decline to confirm our modeling exercise we compare our results to a study conducted by mcdonald et al 2007 where controlled hunts occurred from 1991 to 2004 in 5 zones at quabbin reservation in central massachusetts usa the hunted zones ranged in size from 7 to 19 mi² and initial estimated deer densities in each zone ranged from 29 7 to 71 8 deer mi² the management goal to achieve post hunt deer densities of 10 deer mi² was achieved after 2 4 years in each hunted zone and hunters harvested 55 83 of antlerless deer annually while it is likely that the high antlerless harvest rates in this study allowed the management goal to be achieved in such a short time frame these harvest rates were able to be maintained for the entirety of the study and as a result the post hunt deer densities were sustained at or below the management goal in contrast simard et al 2012 reduced deer densities within five 8 mi² areas on anticosti island québec canada with initial deer densities ranging from 34 to 55 deer mi² by removing 50 of antlerless deer in year 1 and 25 in years 2 5 but did not find evidence of successful vegetative growth in experimental sites antlerless harvest rates in this study were reduced by half after one year and our model would suggest that this decrease coupled with the high initial deer densities is likely what hindered the success of the localized deer density reduction porter et al 1991 proposed that the minimum area needed to apply a localized deer removal would be 1 5 8 mi² our results show that the minimum size necessary to successfully reduce deer density is 5 mi² and that localized reductions are also successful in areas as large as 25 mi² in our model smaller removal areas 0 5 and 1 mi² had on average low success 50 in reducing deer density over time and noticeably high variability in end population density among simulations whereas larger removal areas 5 mi² had higher success 70 and more consistent results across simulations fig 6 these results demonstrate that hunting alone is unlikely to successfully reduce locally abundant populations on small areas but may be an effective strategy for populations on larger areas the difficulty with using hunters to manage small local deer populations is further exacerbated in landscapes with high deer densities although higher antlerless harvest rates in our model resulted in larger deer density reductions in small areas on average they did little to reduce the variability among simulations compared to larger areas fig 5 localized management through actions such as culling has been suggested as an alternative to hunting for small locally abundant deer populations based on the rose petal hypothesis mathews 1989 porter et al 1991 using this technique mcnulty et al 1997 was able to successfully reduce deer densities in a small 0 5 mi² area in new york usa but the landscape was characterized by low initial deer densities 5 15 deer mi² which may have contributed to the success similarly miller et al 2010 performed high intensity culling by removing approximately 60 of females from a 0 5 mi² area in west virginia usa where deer herds averaged 30 50 deer mi² but found that deer adjacent to the removal area shifted their home ranges and recolonized the removal area within 3 years these results and the results from our model suggest that localized management may be an effective technique for reducing deer densities in small areas on landscapes with low deer density but where deer density is high neither culling nor hunting alone may be sufficient for reducing small locally abundant populations this is likely because in areas of high deer density even if the populations are an ideal candidate for localized management i e have high site fidelity and low female dispersal campbell et al 2004 larger deer numbers can still provide several opportunities for dispersal even if the likelihood of any one female dispersing is low weckel and rockwell 2013 therefore a combination of culling and antlerless deer hunting may be needed if managers want to reduce deer densities in small 5 mi² areas on landscapes of high deer densities further exploration via a model based approach is necessary to determine if this combination of deer removal techniques is sufficient to reduce deer densities in small areas areas to apply a deer density reduction often are chosen based on a variety of factors such as areas where deer vehicle collisions are common or on recent timber harvest sites where adequate forest regeneration is desired these areas may be surrounded by certain landscape features e g rivers roads that can constrain the size and shape of a unit in our model we tested three different removal area shapes circle square and rectangle with different ratios of sides length width to emulate removal areas that may be limited by spatial configurations we found that the shape of the removal area in particular increasing the ratio of sides in a rectangular area had little effect on the ability to locally reduce deer density this unexpected result is likely a product of long dispersal distances particularly for females average male and female dispersal distance in forested landscapes is 4 12 mi with some males dispersing 24 mi and some females dispersing 30 mi long et al 2005 lutz et al 2015 we would expect that given the dispersal behavior of a deer population that there is a threshold for how large the ratio of sides of a removal area can be and once that threshold is reached the longevity of spatial reductions would decrease in our model the largest ratio of sides was 10 1 for 5 and 10 mi² areas and 5 1 for 20 mi² areas which corresponds approximately to 10 mi 0 5 mi 10 mi 1 0 mi and 10 mi 2 mi respectively it is possible that these ratios were not extreme enough to counteract the long dispersal distances of simulated individuals and influence end population density in the removal area simulating scenarios with a greater ratio of sides e g 15 1 20 1 25 1 etc may help elucidate what effect if any this variable has on the ability locally reduce deer density in addition dispersal is the primary mechanism that is driving the minimum size needed to affect a localized reduction in deer density based on our model results we would expect the minimum size of a removal area to increase as juvenile dispersal rate and distance increases that is the larger the average dispersal rate and the longer the average dispersal distance for males and females in a deer population the larger the removal area needed for long term sustained deer density reductions moving forward managers can use the results of our model to evaluate the effectiveness of their antlerless deer removal programs and possibly adjust their programs to help better achieve deer management goals while our model simulated hunting patterns and behavior for white tailed deer in forested landscapes in pennsylvania usa our approach could be widely adopted for deer populations where local data are available to parameterize models the design of our model landscape was meant to simulate a densely forested habitat but it did not include any additional landscape features e g streams roads or habitat fragmentation that could impact deer movement across the landscape incorporating these spatial configurations into the model could help determine if these factors have any effect on dispersal behavior and subsequent hunter success rates in addition other hunting regulations such as antler point restrictions and season length could be considered to elucidate the impacts of multiple hunting regimes on the ability to locally reduce deer density modeling deer density reductions in areas of mixed forested and agricultural land areas with a specific spatial distribution of young and old forest or in non forested areas such as agricultural landscapes parks and urban suburban regions may be useful in helping to design or modify deer management programs based on landscape and residential classifications 5 conclusions our study and other empirical studies have shown that localized antlerless deer harvest has the potential to create areas of persistent reduced deer density kilpatrick et al 2001 mcnulty et al 1997 oyer and porter 2004 porter et al 1991 2004 hunter preference for large mature male white tailed deer has led to considerably higher harvest rates for these individuals than for female deer wallingford et al 2017 however targeting female deer can reduce a population s reproductive potential brown et al 2000 and can help create areas of reduced deer density if females exhibit low dispersal and high site fidelity campbell et al 2004 in forested landscapes promoting forest regeneration in areas such as recent timber harvest sites is often a goal of land managers increasing antlerless harvest in these specific geographical areas can reduce deer density which in turn can decrease deer browsing and stimulate regeneration as well as provide hunters additional opportunities to hunt our results show that increasing antlerless harvest rates through hunting for lower density herds 30 deer mi² in areas 5 mi² can successfully reduce deer densities in 5 years and that these reductions can be maintained long term with continuous removal efforts however it may take several seasons after an antlerless deer harvest program has been implemented before it can achieve the harvest rates required to see a localized reduction in addition the ability of managers to maintain constant antlerless harvest rates annually may be unlikely due to issues such as partial controllability and environmental variation williams 1997 furthermore for substantial deer density reductions to occur in small 5 mi² areas or in areas of high 40 deer mi² deer density managers need to consistently achieve considerably high antlerless harvest rates 30 which may not be feasible using hunting holsman et al 2010 our model did not consider factors such as changing hunting regulations or disease e g chronic wasting disease that could influence white tailed deer population dynamics devivo et al 2017 nor did it consider the effects of spatial configurations e g habitat fragmentation landscape classification on deer populations thus the size of a removal area and hunting pressure needed to enact a localized deer density reduction may differ

24669,animal movement spanning all time and space scales in nature is constrained by the individual s available energy to spend creating a strong link between physiology and observed movement and distribution patterns to progress movement ecology needs an explicit focus on common mechanisms such as energetics linking behaviour to fitness consequences across scales but simplified by process based approaches such as individual based models ibms we review the animal movement literature from fine scale patch foraging to large scale geographic migration focussing on ibms incorporating individual energetics hereafter termed eibms the literature shows ibms in movement ecology are mainly defined by the following four categories nested across different space and time scales 1 fine scale displacement i e foraging and local habitat selection by animals under different resource availabilities including 2 cognitive processes such as risk perception memory and learning 3 home range occupancy and dispersal potential and 4 migration and biogeographic distribution amongst eibms a common issue emerges individual traits like energetics are sometimes species and problem specific leading to divergence in the way energetics are incorporated and aggregated in the models further movement becomes more difficult to predict with increasing time and space scales and behaviour and biological complexity using this individual level approach we show 1 it is most effective in explaining fine scale movement foraging and competition where the links between the animal and their habitat are immediate and absolute compared to coarser time and space scales 2 coarser time and space scales present further challenges for the animal that require more careful interpretation of movement drivers and 3 common but more complex behaviours across scales such as risk perception and memory are better explained with richer ecological data that are well integrated into movement models we propose formulating individual energetics in a modelling framework as a next gen extension to address the challenges of modelling movement across different scales species and constraints keywords energy budget energy reserves environmental change external cues individual traits mechanistic movement models energetic costs physiology resource use trade offs patch foraging 1 introduction there is an urgency to understand how changing environments drive movement species survival their distributions and ultimately community assembly bauer and hoye 2014 börger et al 2011 schlägel et al 2020 animals adapt to environmental change across many time and space scales a process which can be energetically costly these costs are linked to metabolism supporting survival growth and reproduction as well as time and opportunity costs bonte et al 2012 humston et al 2004 therefore interpreting the direct links between animal physiology and the external environment is crucial to understanding animal movement integrating internal processes such as energy use with behaviour into a modelling framework couples the internal individual state with the external environment wilson et al 2012 internal processes such as perception pe er and kramer schadt 2008 teckentrup et al 2018 learning fagan et al 2013 and collective decision making bonnell et al 2013 dumont and hill 2004 sueur et al 2011 enrich the movement process however when movement models become too descriptive e g using correlated random walks levy flight or state space models delgado et al 2014 langrock et al 2014 patterson et al 2008 turchin 1998 they often focus on single components e g only the cognitive state see table 1 for models on perception memory and learning or neglect key mechanisms such as physiology and principles relating to energy use holyoak et al 2008 basic principles of ecology combined with animal physiology are crucial for understanding fitness outcomes both directly such as the energy costs of movement under different thermal environments bennett et al 2018 malishev et al 2018 sears and angilletta 2015 and indirectly such as mortality from predation when the prey cannot allocate energy to fleeing or hiding or losses in reproductive output shepard et al 2013 bridging these trade offs with a mechanistic link between constraints on physiology and movement behaviour across appropriate time and space scales under a general framework benhamou 2014 giuggioli and bartumeus 2010 nathan et al 2008 van moorter et al 2013 offers a useful way to capture movement consequences in space and time shepard et al 2013 wilson et al 2013 for example energy costs and gains can be summarized with energy and mass balances generating an energy budget that connects the individual with its environment in a mechanistic way kearney et al 2009 sibly et al 2013 hence an individual s lifetime energy budget serves as a movement roadmap energetic costs are a common constraint to movement and fitness across many systems ayllón et al 2016 cote et al 2016 hawkes 2009 malishev et al 2018 mclane et al 2017 railsback and harvey 2002 stillman et al 2015a individual based models ibms also called agent based models abms grimm and railsback 2005 are a useful platform to build these constraints into individual decision making forecast these decisions as energetic consequences in space and time buckley et al 2014 gustafson 2013 kearney et al 2009 and upscale these to the population level ayllón et al 2016 ellis et al 2012 louzao et al 2014 stillman et al 2015b community level bjorge et al 2002 buchmann et al 2011 mueller and fagan 2008 singer et al 2016 travis et al 2005 travis and dytham 1998 wilson 1998 and trophic level giacomini et al 2009 ibms come with well established standards e g the odd protocol grimm et al 2010 2006 with the capacity to integrate ecological processes from first principles radchuk et al 2019 in this context dynamic energy budget deb theory kooijman 2010 is a practical general metabolic theory capturing energy uptake and use by individuals that connects ecology and physiology from first principles first steps in this direction were established with deb ibms martin et al 2012 2013 sibly et al 2013 mainly for the aquatic world until recently movement and its energetics consequences had not been explicitly addressed in these models we argue that by marrying the predictive capabilities of ibms with energetics frameworks in the following termed eibms it is possible to model movement patterns of individuals over time and space with universal internal mechanisms using biologically relevant rules for movement e g malishev et al 2018 and chimienti et al 2020 for terrestrial species and gallagher et al 2021 for marine mammal population dynamics we reviewed the animal movement literature focussing on individual based models incorporating energetics eibms from theory to experimental case studies with a focus mainly on terrestrial species these eibms were reviewed on their strengths and limitations in tackling key questions in movement ecology such as how animals choose habitats under environmental change use resources to define home ranges in space and use energy reserves to inform migratory decisions we used a keyword search query on web of science to search current literature incorporating fine to coarse time scales from the local patch to the regional scale published between 1991 and 2019 table 1 and supplementary material for keyword search terms we omitted review manuscripts because references to energetics were less heuristic and more descriptive of the 87 resulting ibm movement papers 84 n 73 either incorporated energetics at the respective time and space scale of the study or claimed energetics were needed in movement ecology in general these eibms fell into four categories 1 fine scale displacement foraging and local patch selection fig 1 section 1 n 41 including 2 cognitive processes n 16 such as perception memory and learning 3 home range occupancy and dispersal potential fig 1 section 2 n 13 and 4 migration and biogeographic distribution fig 1 section 3 n 17 for each theme we a review what existing ibms teach us about modelling movement challenges b investigate how eibms incorporate energetics within the model design or process including energy gain use and costs of movement and c use landmark examples of eibms to identify whether energetics models are well designed and how energetics and fitness seeking connect with model outcomes 2 foraging and local habitat selection 2 1 challenges foraging i e fine scale displacement is the minimum level of hierarchy nested within all larger movement scales and is the foundation from where physiology and energy use such as the individual energy budget are linked to resource availability predator avoidance and species interactions fig 1 section 1 early foraging models relied on random walk rw algorithms bartumeus et al 2005 which were later improved upon to capture non random movement patterns in more fragmented landscapes e g correlated random walk crw zollner and lima 1999 bergman et al 2000 fronhofer et al 2013 and levy flight that assumes both frequent and infrequent movement events but see benhamou 2007 sims et al 2007 plank and codling 2009 despite these improvements many foraging models assume behaviour is imposed rather than emergent for example a rw strategy in animals can improve foraging success under uncertainty duffy 2011 but underperforms in changing habitats where more advanced crw strategies may dominate morales et al 2004 duffy 2011 classic foraging theory such as optimal foraging theory oft pyke et al 1977 charnov 1976 wajnberg et al 2013 can help define general movement strategies however this approach might neglect key behaviour such as movement capacity and habitat dependant strategies as well as movement drivers such as energy use and predator presence process based approaches such as eibms are well suited to integrate these key drivers that shift away from the oft paradigm and imposed behaviour to represent more ecologically realistic scenarios and provide a bottom up approach to parse essential behaviour from overall movement strategies börger et al 2008 holyoak et al 2008 mueller and fagan 2008 giuggioli and bartumeus 2010 bauer and klaassen 2013 fagan et al 2013 however the number of potential drivers makes incorporating energetics into ibms challenging foraging involves a change in multiple traits that process based models such as ibms can identify as key mechanisms driving movement in space and time these include changes in activity states morales et al 2004 giske et al 2013 pauli et al 2013 ringelman 2014 such as avoiding predators duffy 2011 kranstauber et al 2012 wajnberg et al 2013 latombe et al 2014 in turn effect and response traits such as physiological states biomass roese et al 1991 buchmann et al 2011 and energy reserves including metabolism and gut capacity dalleau et al 2019 peck and daewel 2007 roese et al 1991 wood et al 2013 both influence and are changed by the movement process in this context eibms have added useful insights to identify what key movement traits persist dominate or adapt to fitness outcomes budaev et al 2019 shepard et al 2013 wood et al 2013 the remaining challenge is to accurately capture energy use as an essential part of the foraging process and include cooperating behaviours such as individual responses to food and group members giske et al 2013 bonnell et al 2013 resource attractiveness bode and delcourt 2013 dumont and hill 2004 earl and zollner 2014 kułakowska et al 2014 wolff 1994 and individual to group movement dumont and hill 2004 couzin et al 2005 rasmussen et al 2008 bonnell et al 2013 here eibms identify behaviour often overlooked in classic foraging models such as explicit foraging costs to help bridge the gap between modelled and real movement patterns guensch et al 2001 bonnell et al 2013 mooij and deangelis 2003 pauli et al 2013 roese et al 1991 2 2 design and performance many eibms have focused on finding a common currency that explains emergent components of movement that can not only capture different costs but how these costs depend on physiology shepard and lambertucci 2013 r s wilson et al 2015 wilson et al 2015b examples of these components include turning angle step length net displacement per time unit and movement activity or speed often measured by proxies such as overall dynamic body acceleration odba gleiss et al 2011 miwa et al 2015 here biologging can capture behavioural modes or activity bouts in terms of energy expenditure for example miwa et al 2015 suggest movement speed is more closely linked to heart rate than step length alone as a proxy for energy costs however odba measurements indirectly approximate energy costs miwa et al 2015 extending this tool for direct energy costs related to movement would involve summarising the activity budget within a process based energetics model chimienti et al 2020 use a deb ibm to show how activity states from detailed biologging data can incorporate energetic costs over the animal lifecycle providing a framework to integrate movement costs more explicitly combined turning angle step length and speed can usefully capture fine scale movement through energetic trade offs that depend on different space and time scales r s wilson et al 2015 wilson et al 2015b the following examples show how model designs at fine space and time scales incorporate these trade offs and how this propagates to outcomes at large scales at fine time scales physiology and energy use are intrinsically linked suggesting animals use time budgets to trade off energy costs and gains against future risks such as food intake and handling time against predators and starvation risk allocation hypothesis lima et al 1999 although implicitly accounted for in holling functional responses in mathematical models of optimal foraging e g krivan and vrkoc 2004 food size bite size and intake rate are key but often overlooked traits associated with energetics shaping movement borrell 2007 roese et al 1991 guensch et al 2001 peck and daewel 2007 wilson et al 2011 pauli et al 2013 this level of detail would help distinguish essential behaviour such as feeding rates wilson et al 2011 and digestive capacity roese et al 1991 peck and daewel 2007 giske et al 2013 that determine activity patterns and time budgets bergman et al 2001 levy et al 2017 louzao et al 2014 malishev et al 2018 merkle et al 2014 for example finding resources within suitable thermal or refuge areas can limit dispersal levy et al 2017 suggesting access to ideal habitat conditions becomes increasingly important under environmental change buckley et al 2018 levy et al 2017 sears and angilletta 2015 and that changing habitat quality microhabitats and temperature impose movement limits ayllón et al 2016 fort et al 2009 levy et al 2017 malishev et al 2018 sears and angilletta 2015 further examples of how these fine scale physiological processes can shape movement include exploring the animal chronobiological rhythm together with temperature and prey constraints here intake rates of seasonal resources such as high fat foods to survive winter periods reflect body condition throughout the animal s lifetime and thus reproductive strategy on longer time scales parker et al 2009 hence these trade offs at the patch level also have consequences on longer time scales by affecting life developmental stages wolff 1994 and adaptation to future environmental change ayllón et al 2016 therefore physiology and behaviour adapted to mediate fitness costs i e growth and reproduction may impose more crucial constraints than simply optimising short term foraging gain humston et al 2004 these constraints emphasise how the individual energy budget built on physiology can be useful in predicting fitness outcomes from movement behaviour sibly et al 2013 mclane et al 2017 finally animals use energy to connect movement costs with habitat use and survival probability under different risks at fine scales for example railsback et al 1999 show stream fish choose patches of low energy gain that minimise risk from fast flowing water currents while pauli et al 2013 use energetics to show individual growth changes in response to resource habitat and predation and starvation risks e g landscape of fear vs food semeniuk et al 2012 laundré et al 2014 teckentrup et al 2018 by incorporating energy use as a decision making mechanism for future movement these approaches demonstrate the trade offs of using local habitat information are connected to how animals assess survival risk in space 3 memory and cognition 3 1 challenges we found memory and cognition are common traits amongst movement ibms because exploiting memory creates more spatially aware consumers linking resource and energy use sets useful constraints upon which the memory and decision making parts of movement can be identified and further developed memory allows animals to better exploit food patches nabe nielsen et al 2013 and is characteristic of more spatially aware animals for remembering or finding resources fagan et al 2013 this raises two questions i how do we best couple memory with energetics and ii which approaches best capture the transition from cognitive processes to movement using energetic demands memory and energy reserves both vary amongst individuals suggesting other drivers such as movement strategy in space may be necessary for memory to be effective for example predators using spatial memory can improve foraging success when prey are clustered ringelman 2014 however being spatially aware can be less efficient when resources are random fronhofer et al 2013 in changing environments the turnover of memorised experiences should be rapid as long term memory can diminish the probability of gathering future valuable information eliassen et al 2009 the expected energy intake of animals over time can depend heavily on previous foraging experience to locate larger closer or better food sources merkle et al 2014 mclane et al 2017 however animals relying on estimates of future food yield from current working knowledge would probably benefit from using multiple strategies such as assessing current energy reserves prior to revisiting food sites particularly when food changes in time kułakowska et al 2014 mclane et al 2017 against predator risk eliassen et al 2007 teckentrup et al 2018 and under landscape change dey et al 2017 teckentrup et al 2019 memory can improve spatial awareness of resources however without prior habitat knowledge what other cues help animals shape future movement decisions having some forecasting ability is mechanistic that is memory involves feedback between external conditions and internal states to motivate future movement for movement models this means forecasting more than one movement step into the future which suggests individual level mechanisms driving movement should consider not only immediate benefits but be prescient 3 2 design and performance adopting different types of memory such as remembering sites reference memory and assessing current gain from previous experience working memory van moorter et al 2009 can build a localised understanding of the landscape avgar et al 2013 fronhofer et al 2013 therefore exploiting this ability probably provides selective advantages for example ringelman 2014 used a spatial ibm to show mammal predators recognise how prey distributes itself in space based on their movement decisions about nesting sites earlier in the season remembering food location is also more sustainable and potentially improves fitness with better quality food bison seem to better recognise food location than quality but high quality food can be a stronger incentive than location to re visit profitable patches merkle et al 2014 further increased foraging effort motivated by depleted body condition can force predators to adapt to shifting prey locations under a changing landscape dey et al 2017 remembering previous food sites is likely to outperform random foraging by building more efficient paths to connect food sources within landscapes mueller et al 2011 avgar et al 2013 selection may then favour memory when the environment is relatively stable finally combining memory with habitat and social information e g seabirds using social cues of conspecifics to find resources grünbaum and veit 2003 can also help animals use less space i e energy and improve searching efficiency merkle et al 2014 suggesting memory is also sensitive to scale huse et al 2002 couzin et al 2005 bonnell et al 2013 latombe et al 2014 we argue that movement models incorporating complex cognitive processes and multiple behaviours become more useful and predictive when standardized by a general shared mechanism and common currency amongst taxa such as energetics further we also need to consider the value of long term memory when information on habitat quality is unreliable especially over large space and time scales eliassen et al 2009 and for realism incorporate restricted and imprecise memory fronhofer et al 2013 finally complementary individual traits tell us movement models must be sensitive to changes in scale 4 home range occupancy and dispersal potential 4 1 challenges the challenge here is using energetics to constrain movement decisions and connect fine scale behaviour where movement equates to energy costs and gains with coarse scales where movement outcomes are a collection of many decisions memory thus is a central component of home range occupancy however as we move upward in time and space this challenge may become computationally intractable or result in errors at the fine scale level propagating upwards through the system our review shows home range ibms linked to energetics generally use resource sites mitchell and powell 2004 nabe nielsen et al 2013 or patches consumed anderson et al 2005 buchmann et al 2011 van moorter et al 2009 as a proxy for energy intake rather than individual energy reserves instead of letting home ranges emerge from individual movement decisions home range occupancy is often measured using metrics that assess habitat suitability via resource selection functions anderson et al 2005 bocedi et al 2014a 2014b hayes and thompson 2013 henry et al 2014 kramer schadt et al 2005 2004 mooij and deangelis 2003 rasmussen et al 2008 here relying on habitat suitability indices to predict home range or patch occupancy may ignore important behavioural detail and thus dilute subtle but decisive movement mechanisms kubisch et al 2014 mooij and deangelis 2003 schurr et al 2012 recent advances have extended resource selection functions by considering energetic constraints in a statistical framework to assess how moving animals choose habitat based on energetic constraints klappstein et al 2020 still these energy selection functions stay phenomenological home range formation is a by product of recurring frequent fine scale movement linked to behaviour connecting animals to space such as memory and resource use van dyck baguette 2005 mortality risk kramer schadt et al 2005 bocedi et al 2014a 2014b and species interactions e g competition predation and mating opportunities moorcroft et al 2006 teckentrup et al 2018 2019 wang and grimm 2007 similarly dispersal i e the long distance movement between leaving the parental home range and establishing a new one is often subsumed by aggregated metrics for example new home ranges are drawn from a habitat suitability map with imposed cost distances from the natal home range schadt et al 2002 or from a density kernel bocedi et al 2014a the challenge here would be to accurately model the processes of competitor and predator avoidance as well as the energy gains that motivate long distance movements away from the natal patch combined home range occupancy and dispersal translate to larger scales such as population s range expansion and species distribution fig 1 section 2 dispersal ability allows us to estimate how individuals kautz et al 2014 populations fahrig 2003 latombe et al 2014 aben et al 2014 and communities buchmann et al 2011 respond to changing environments at larger scales such as fragmentation or climate change hence an improvement of predictive models at the home range level would already significantly increase our understanding of global change impacts on species survival probability in the long run such an improvement would involve integrating a common mechanism underlying movement that is general and predictive this could involve implementing behavioural rules based on energy reserves to calculate movement costs sears and angilletta 2015 malishev et al 2018 and build suitable attraction rules to profitable food sources nabe nielsen et al 2013 mclane et al 2017 or shelter moorcroft et al 2006 while also accounting for mortality risk bowler and benton 2005 kanagaraj et al 2013 4 2 design and performance home range behaviour is often directly related to memory i e animals occupy habitats by revisiting previous sites and build home ranges by relying on different types of memory such as reference and working van moorter et al 2009 however because home range stability changes in space and time lyons et al 2013 home range models need to consider memory costs such as animals requiring too much information börger et al 2008 for example incorporating the duration and frequency of patch visits can support biologically relevant movement rules that reduce the capacity for unrealistic dispersal patterns lyons et al 2013 van moorter et al 2016 campos candela et al 2019 incorporated between and within individual differences in home range behaviour into a theoretical energetics model to understand eco evolutionary processes behind movement syndromes and different life history strategies to be predictive in heterogeneous landscapes or real situations however models need to capture individual responses to resource competitor predator or mate distribution at the home range level because they impose practical spatial limits bocedi et al 2014a b buchmann et al 2011 lyons et al 2013 mitchell and powell 2004 moorcroft et al 2006 when home range behaviour and dispersal involve multiple cues pe er and kramer schadt 2008 schick et al 2008 assuming animals prioritise certain activities without a thorough understanding of their usefulness can often be misleading mitchell and powell 2004 therefore the way animals use energy across time and space can identify general mechanisms that summarise complex movement or that prioritise decisions exploring movement from a mechanistic basis simplifies how movement decisions shape more complex strategies such as when internal energy reserves drive animals to compromise or exploit resources or mates individual energetics are directly linked to space via resource use and mortality risk as a basic constraint to home range emergence for example visitation rates of profitable patches shape how animals build home ranges such as cached resource sites mclane et al 2017 and exploiting optimal thermal patches as landscapes change in space sears and angilletta 2015 whereas irrelevant space use such as animals visiting empty patches can be equally important when setting spatial limits i e territory borders mitchell and powell 2012 if defining a detailed energy budget is not always possible an alternative but abstract way to integrate energetics into movement is depicting multiple decision making surfaces based on resource availability or mortality risk fronhofer et al 2013 pauli et al 2013 finally supplementing energetics with other traits like memory can make movement models more predictive and realistic latombe et al 2014 such as using energy costs to impose more realistic dispersal limits than just arbitrary maximum distances 5 migration and geographic distribution 5 1 challenges there are a few reasons why eibms do not consider all migratory species at the migration scale where currently birds and marine species dominate bauer et al 2009 first the large time and space scale of migration means migrants must adapt to long physical travel and uncertain habitat and resource availability at destination sites which can be difficult to capture in a model bjorge et al 2002 duriez et al 2009 holsman et al 2003 pettifor et al 2000 second large scale movement is often group based merkle et al 2015 rasmussen et al 2008 and social input can dilute the migration process to make it less predictable cote et al 2016 shaw and couzin 2013 particularly under large scale environmental change boone et al 2006 finally migration events may rely on specific group social structures for example dominant and experienced individuals can influence group behaviour which depends on the timing of emerging dominants with migration events cooke et al 2008 huse et al 2002 therefore a combination of both internal cues such as using energy reserves to gauge distances to future stopover sites duriez et al 2009 pettifor et al 2000 and external cues such as departing during optimal food and climate conditions mcnamara et al 2011 boone et al 2006 should help animals make more informed movement decisions ibms typically use behavioural rules to model group movement during migration duriez et al 2009 huse et al 2004 2002 huse and giske 1998 pettifor et al 2000 shaw and couzin 2013 providing a framework to integrate internal cues with external ones generating useful model forecasts at the migration scale is limited by two main challenges first a lot of the necessary resolution relies on large scale environmental data that can be difficult to obtain manage or project in meaningful ways for example connecting large scale environmental data directly with animal movement and gps tagged data that are both user friendly and manageable remains an on going challenge ferdinando et al 2010 but open and expansive repositories are becoming more popular e g the env data system dodge et al 2013 isolating key drivers of animal movement such as resource availability helps pinpoint useful and accessible data for example boult et al 2018 used the normalised difference vegetation index ndvi to estimate landscape level food biomass to connect movement projections of gps tagged elephant populations isolated geographic areas with reliable movement ranges of animals provide unique opportunities to predict movement in mechanistic ways such as gis tracking of local harbour seal populations in archipelagos accessed by fisheries bjørge et al 2002 a comprehensive overview of the limitations and opportunities of using large scale data has been discussed elsewhere cagnacci et al 2010 ferdinando et al 2010 as well as those of radio tracking individual animals cooke et al 2004 second complex behaviour and movement such as sociality and avoiding predation risk relies on fine scale dynamic data that can be less amenable and lead to coarser model forecasts at larger scales this is compounded by increasingly imprecise and unreliable movement data with increasing scale frair et al 2010 migration often involves two distinct movement phases small scale within and large scale between sites external cues such as seasonal weather boone et al 2006 holsman et al 2003 pettifor et al 2000 and resource patterns duriez et al 2009 operate at both scales fine scale habitat changes dictate food availability or predation risk within sites e g geese navigating daily tidal cycles pettifor et al 2000 changes in prey populations based on prey rich areas holsman et al 2003 and fish in diurnal giske et al 2013 and diel migration busch et al 2011 at larger scales migrants may rely heavily on seasonal cues between sites pettifor et al 2000 but switch to favour localised cues such as resources within sites shaw and couzin 2013 integrating scalable and high resolution environmental data with this localised behaviour is challenging but can project the behavioural part of movement and activity patterns to larger geographic ranges such as latitudinal microclimate data based on historical weather patterns linked to thermal space use levy et al 2017 the following examples show how external and internal cues can be used for modelling migratory decisions based on energetics 5 2 design and performance external cues such as seasonality and temperature alter resource density in space and time suggesting large scale dispersal is sensitive to the rate and scale of change in these cues boone et al 2006 busch et al 2011 huse et al 2004 kearney et al 2009 the problem is that external cues vary widely at large scales one solution is categorising the migration path into distinct movement phases at a local scale i e adapting to wind currents to identify vital points in time and space that animals can exploit for example local habitats provide physical catalysts such as wind or oceanic currents for migrating birds and turtles safi et al 2013 dalleau et al 2019 e g dynamic soaring sachs et al 2013 shepard and lambertucci 2013 to facilitate faster movement and improve access to food sources especially for species with greater ranges shepard and lambertucci 2013 despite these opportunities migrants may not always capitalise on paths of least resistance such as bar headed geese that on average exploit wind conditions sub optimally for reduced energy costs despite available tail winds hawkes et al 2013 the conclusions here are twofold 1 although migrating birds sometimes utilise low altitude areas along migratory paths to reduce movement costs over longer time periods this type of behaviour may not always be possible or sustainable hawkes et al 2013 sachs et al 2013 shepard and lambertucci 2013 and 2 individuals exploit habitats differently which is particularly evident in group based migration cote et al 2016 therefore the general limiting constraint to movement in lieu of or dominant to the external physical environment is likely to be internal using internal cues to shape migration suggests individual level detail can fill in the critical gaps between local behaviour and larger scales body condition as a timing cue for long distance migrants such as sockeye salmon returning to breeding sites can reliably distinguish delayed migrants from timely ones cooke et al 2008 geese use external cues such as spring plant emergence to trigger migration decisions however combining habitat information with detailed data on internal cues such as energy reserves metabolic rates and thermoregulatory costs can optimise departure times duriez et al 2009 these detailed individual level data such as gut capacity feeding response to prey density functional response bite size ingestion rate and metabolic activities of respiration egestion and excretion are realistic measurements of behaviour ultimately linking large scale movement to reasonable fitness outcomes such as growth and reproduction boult et al 2018 huse et al 2004 pettifor et al 2000 because internal cues such as energy reserves vary at any given time amongst individuals estimating movement decisions from these cues retains individual specific responses to environmental change this has three immediate advantages it improves how we interpret movement costs in different ecosystems i e terrestrial versus aquatic hein et al 2012 particularly as energy use can become more abstract with increasing scales pauli et al 2013 r s wilson et al 2015 wilson et al 2015b it allows us to estimate metabolic activity such as intake rates in environments where direct measurements can be difficult to obtain e g offshore seabird foraging fort et al 2009 and it addresses the common problem that many movement models neglect key between individual differences holyoak et al 2008 our review reinforced the need to explicitly consider space in models at the migration scale this was primarily due to the ability for spatial models to more accurately reflect real movement patterns under large scale habitat change huse and giske 1998 pettifor et al 2000 shaw and couzin 2013 the importance of fine scale space on food encounter rates bode and delcourt 2013 huse et al 2004 wajnberg et al 2013 and the response of highly mobile prey to environmental change huse and giske 1998 by using a common mechanism connecting trade offs in movement costs and gains across scales such as energy use we can identify some of the barriers when developing large scale movement models such as sensitivity to scale habitat loss increases travel distance to new sites so spatial models need to clearly define what makes habitats attractive for migrants pettifor et al 2000 further due to the subtlety of spatial movement models should be sensitive to the types of movement rules applied at large scales huse et al 2004 for example over long time periods slow moving animals can incur greater movement costs across large scales compared to faster animals by accumulating more non movement costs per distance travelled wilson et al 2015a the costs of migration can be substantial and difficult to define across species and systems therefore using energy reserves to interpret the relationship between common physical traits such as body mass with movement costs hein et al 2012 see also buchmann et al 2013 2012 2011 duriez et al 2009 fiksen and carlotti 1998 giske et al 2013 roese et al 1991 underpins the migration process with a common and useful mechanism finally migration often involves group movement so grouping individuals into common assemblages using a shared trait purves et al 2013 satisfies the concept of the super individual one type of individual representing a suite of individuals with similar attributes across large space and time scales huse et al 2004 e g smaller animals with high metabolic rates than larger ones require different handling times and incur greater movement costs here the concept of collectives from the odd protocol for individual based model development offers well established terminology grimm et al 2010 2006 6 conclusions interpreting movement using energetics has several advantages first energetics connects measureable individual traits such as reserve capacity to fitness trade offs giske et al 2013 bode and delcourt 2013 second it provides a uniform and discrete unit of measurement such as joules to calculate metabolic rates and summarise energy exchange between individuals and the environment here energy uptake can be measured through surfaces in terrestrial or volumes in aquatic habitats i e measuring prey as biomass in oceans finally eibms can highlight useful assumptions sensitive to species and scale for example static parameters such as maximum feeding rate may underestimate intake rates as prey density varies in space and time peck and daewel 2007 further movement costs depend on turning angle across distance travelled that also accumulates at finer scales wilson et al 2013 ignoring these assumptions may underestimate realistic movement costs therefore models focused on only single outcomes such as growth may ignore essential cooperating constraints to movement such as trade offs to predation railsback et al 1999 fiksen and carlotti 1998 risk taking in landscapes of food vs fear giske et al 2013 laundré et al 2014 teckentrup et al 2018 and metabolic processes other than simply energy intake louzao et al 2014 such as maintenance costs kooijman 2010 sibly et al 2013 and fitness outputs over time ayllón et al 2016 levy et al 2017 new et al 2014 despite the direct relationship between energy and time movement models often make energetics case specific probably due to convenience ease and simplicity holyoak et al 2008 alternatively using energetics theory to formulate the individual energy budget offers a general way to estimate movement costs malishev et al 2018 this aims to fill in field data gaps and escape the development demands of formulating case specific models grimm et al 2005 louzao et al 2014 we found studies that did not explicitly include energetics used other proxies for energy intake such as resource patch use for such cases the added effort of parameterising a complete energetics component to the model may be unnecessary for the problem at hand here behavioural components may be a synergistic way of incorporating energy related constraints such as separating movement into direct costs where movement is taxed by energy use and indirect costs where fine scale movement costs translate to fitness consequences over longer time scales we encourage studies to consider the data requirements needed to incorporate these details against their usefulness as computational tools and the costs of developing the model advanced technology such as gps units with accelerometers and other sensors can help by simplifying how we calculate energy use from field data of different behaviours gleiss et al 2011 louzao et al 2014 nams 2014 miwa et al 2015 kays et al 2015 scharf et al 2016 this is particularly evident when available movement data are supplemented by detailed ecological and habitat data such as connecting energetics to food availability at the landscape level boult et al 2018 and predation trade offs with habitat productivity bjørge et al 2002 busch et al 2011 7 future directions our review identified several pertinent trends first the movement ecology literature incorporates eibms across foraging and local patch selection memory and learning home range behaviour and dispersal potential and migration this highlights that movement ibms indeed consider energetics across most time and space scales finer scales such as foraging most readily integrated energetic consequences of movement at the coarser migration scale these consequences were closely linked to similar behaviour at finer scales bode and delcourt 2013 huse et al 2004 wajnberg et al 2013 such as resource intake from local patches at migration sites pettifor et al 2000 dalleau et al 2019 this opens opportunities to explore both small and large scale movement with similar drivers this pattern also suggests that more complex behaviours such as predation and competition are less easily explained by energy use due to the inherent intricacies of animal behaviour and decision making across taxa that require adequate data ayllón et al 2016 chimienti et al 2020 hawkes et al 2013 levy et al 2017 malishev et al 2018 sears and angilletta 2015 shepard and lambertucci 2013 wahle 1992 wilson et al 2013 second movement at the individual level is based on adaptive decision making grimm et al 2005 grimm and railsback 2011 2005 mooij and deangelis 2003 tang and bennett 2010 zollner and lima 2005 however many individual based models still mix imposed and emergent behaviour encouraging efforts bauer and klaassen 2013 and therein identify ibms to progress mechanistic modelling of animal movement as movement decisions become more complex internal mechanisms like memory aid animals in locating resources and structuring home ranges while cooperating internal and external cues facilitating movement reinforce the need for modelling space at increasing scales the sensitivity of movement to different scales species and constraints reinforces the need for general simplified mechanisms to unify the way we interpret movement third integrating energetics and building model assumptions needs to match activity patterns to accurately capture costs of environmental change on physiological rates particularly individual responses to large scale environmental change humston et al 2004 levy et al 2017 one mutual drawback of many energetics models is their reliance on ad hoc estimates of energy use which misses an opportunity to capture movement costs from formal and well established metabolic rules common across taxa more thought is needed into validating movement costs with metabolic rules in space and time as shown when predicting population cycles bacher and gangnery 2006 martin et al 2013 and to link individuals with populations directly such as density dependant foraging pressure on patch selection through competition chudzińska et al 2016 and indirectly such as spatial patterns of population fitness across landscapes humston et al 2004 shepard et al 2013 finally recent advances in biologging are improving how we calculate energy costs gleiss et al 2011 louzao et al 2014 nathan et al 2012 scharf et al 2016 chimienti et al 2020 to improve model development and advance movement theory using direct energetic feedback between animals and their habitat louzao et al 2014 i e energy landscapes hawkes et al 2013 sachs et al 2013 shepard et al 2013 therefore our current state of knowledge combining energy budgets movement theory and data from advanced animal tracking technology is timely for fully adopting general ibm frameworks that predict movement behaviour with individual energetics at its core movement ecology is beginning to embrace the same principles we explore in this review by explicitly addressing energetic costs bonnell et al 2013 bonte et al 2012 hawkes et al 2013 pauli et al 2013 sachs et al 2013 shepard et al 2013 wood et al 2013 and focusing on mechanisms and scales benhamou 2014 holyoak et al 2008 giuggioli and bartumeus 2010 which have been simplified by the strengths of process based approaches such as

24669,animal movement spanning all time and space scales in nature is constrained by the individual s available energy to spend creating a strong link between physiology and observed movement and distribution patterns to progress movement ecology needs an explicit focus on common mechanisms such as energetics linking behaviour to fitness consequences across scales but simplified by process based approaches such as individual based models ibms we review the animal movement literature from fine scale patch foraging to large scale geographic migration focussing on ibms incorporating individual energetics hereafter termed eibms the literature shows ibms in movement ecology are mainly defined by the following four categories nested across different space and time scales 1 fine scale displacement i e foraging and local habitat selection by animals under different resource availabilities including 2 cognitive processes such as risk perception memory and learning 3 home range occupancy and dispersal potential and 4 migration and biogeographic distribution amongst eibms a common issue emerges individual traits like energetics are sometimes species and problem specific leading to divergence in the way energetics are incorporated and aggregated in the models further movement becomes more difficult to predict with increasing time and space scales and behaviour and biological complexity using this individual level approach we show 1 it is most effective in explaining fine scale movement foraging and competition where the links between the animal and their habitat are immediate and absolute compared to coarser time and space scales 2 coarser time and space scales present further challenges for the animal that require more careful interpretation of movement drivers and 3 common but more complex behaviours across scales such as risk perception and memory are better explained with richer ecological data that are well integrated into movement models we propose formulating individual energetics in a modelling framework as a next gen extension to address the challenges of modelling movement across different scales species and constraints keywords energy budget energy reserves environmental change external cues individual traits mechanistic movement models energetic costs physiology resource use trade offs patch foraging 1 introduction there is an urgency to understand how changing environments drive movement species survival their distributions and ultimately community assembly bauer and hoye 2014 börger et al 2011 schlägel et al 2020 animals adapt to environmental change across many time and space scales a process which can be energetically costly these costs are linked to metabolism supporting survival growth and reproduction as well as time and opportunity costs bonte et al 2012 humston et al 2004 therefore interpreting the direct links between animal physiology and the external environment is crucial to understanding animal movement integrating internal processes such as energy use with behaviour into a modelling framework couples the internal individual state with the external environment wilson et al 2012 internal processes such as perception pe er and kramer schadt 2008 teckentrup et al 2018 learning fagan et al 2013 and collective decision making bonnell et al 2013 dumont and hill 2004 sueur et al 2011 enrich the movement process however when movement models become too descriptive e g using correlated random walks levy flight or state space models delgado et al 2014 langrock et al 2014 patterson et al 2008 turchin 1998 they often focus on single components e g only the cognitive state see table 1 for models on perception memory and learning or neglect key mechanisms such as physiology and principles relating to energy use holyoak et al 2008 basic principles of ecology combined with animal physiology are crucial for understanding fitness outcomes both directly such as the energy costs of movement under different thermal environments bennett et al 2018 malishev et al 2018 sears and angilletta 2015 and indirectly such as mortality from predation when the prey cannot allocate energy to fleeing or hiding or losses in reproductive output shepard et al 2013 bridging these trade offs with a mechanistic link between constraints on physiology and movement behaviour across appropriate time and space scales under a general framework benhamou 2014 giuggioli and bartumeus 2010 nathan et al 2008 van moorter et al 2013 offers a useful way to capture movement consequences in space and time shepard et al 2013 wilson et al 2013 for example energy costs and gains can be summarized with energy and mass balances generating an energy budget that connects the individual with its environment in a mechanistic way kearney et al 2009 sibly et al 2013 hence an individual s lifetime energy budget serves as a movement roadmap energetic costs are a common constraint to movement and fitness across many systems ayllón et al 2016 cote et al 2016 hawkes 2009 malishev et al 2018 mclane et al 2017 railsback and harvey 2002 stillman et al 2015a individual based models ibms also called agent based models abms grimm and railsback 2005 are a useful platform to build these constraints into individual decision making forecast these decisions as energetic consequences in space and time buckley et al 2014 gustafson 2013 kearney et al 2009 and upscale these to the population level ayllón et al 2016 ellis et al 2012 louzao et al 2014 stillman et al 2015b community level bjorge et al 2002 buchmann et al 2011 mueller and fagan 2008 singer et al 2016 travis et al 2005 travis and dytham 1998 wilson 1998 and trophic level giacomini et al 2009 ibms come with well established standards e g the odd protocol grimm et al 2010 2006 with the capacity to integrate ecological processes from first principles radchuk et al 2019 in this context dynamic energy budget deb theory kooijman 2010 is a practical general metabolic theory capturing energy uptake and use by individuals that connects ecology and physiology from first principles first steps in this direction were established with deb ibms martin et al 2012 2013 sibly et al 2013 mainly for the aquatic world until recently movement and its energetics consequences had not been explicitly addressed in these models we argue that by marrying the predictive capabilities of ibms with energetics frameworks in the following termed eibms it is possible to model movement patterns of individuals over time and space with universal internal mechanisms using biologically relevant rules for movement e g malishev et al 2018 and chimienti et al 2020 for terrestrial species and gallagher et al 2021 for marine mammal population dynamics we reviewed the animal movement literature focussing on individual based models incorporating energetics eibms from theory to experimental case studies with a focus mainly on terrestrial species these eibms were reviewed on their strengths and limitations in tackling key questions in movement ecology such as how animals choose habitats under environmental change use resources to define home ranges in space and use energy reserves to inform migratory decisions we used a keyword search query on web of science to search current literature incorporating fine to coarse time scales from the local patch to the regional scale published between 1991 and 2019 table 1 and supplementary material for keyword search terms we omitted review manuscripts because references to energetics were less heuristic and more descriptive of the 87 resulting ibm movement papers 84 n 73 either incorporated energetics at the respective time and space scale of the study or claimed energetics were needed in movement ecology in general these eibms fell into four categories 1 fine scale displacement foraging and local patch selection fig 1 section 1 n 41 including 2 cognitive processes n 16 such as perception memory and learning 3 home range occupancy and dispersal potential fig 1 section 2 n 13 and 4 migration and biogeographic distribution fig 1 section 3 n 17 for each theme we a review what existing ibms teach us about modelling movement challenges b investigate how eibms incorporate energetics within the model design or process including energy gain use and costs of movement and c use landmark examples of eibms to identify whether energetics models are well designed and how energetics and fitness seeking connect with model outcomes 2 foraging and local habitat selection 2 1 challenges foraging i e fine scale displacement is the minimum level of hierarchy nested within all larger movement scales and is the foundation from where physiology and energy use such as the individual energy budget are linked to resource availability predator avoidance and species interactions fig 1 section 1 early foraging models relied on random walk rw algorithms bartumeus et al 2005 which were later improved upon to capture non random movement patterns in more fragmented landscapes e g correlated random walk crw zollner and lima 1999 bergman et al 2000 fronhofer et al 2013 and levy flight that assumes both frequent and infrequent movement events but see benhamou 2007 sims et al 2007 plank and codling 2009 despite these improvements many foraging models assume behaviour is imposed rather than emergent for example a rw strategy in animals can improve foraging success under uncertainty duffy 2011 but underperforms in changing habitats where more advanced crw strategies may dominate morales et al 2004 duffy 2011 classic foraging theory such as optimal foraging theory oft pyke et al 1977 charnov 1976 wajnberg et al 2013 can help define general movement strategies however this approach might neglect key behaviour such as movement capacity and habitat dependant strategies as well as movement drivers such as energy use and predator presence process based approaches such as eibms are well suited to integrate these key drivers that shift away from the oft paradigm and imposed behaviour to represent more ecologically realistic scenarios and provide a bottom up approach to parse essential behaviour from overall movement strategies börger et al 2008 holyoak et al 2008 mueller and fagan 2008 giuggioli and bartumeus 2010 bauer and klaassen 2013 fagan et al 2013 however the number of potential drivers makes incorporating energetics into ibms challenging foraging involves a change in multiple traits that process based models such as ibms can identify as key mechanisms driving movement in space and time these include changes in activity states morales et al 2004 giske et al 2013 pauli et al 2013 ringelman 2014 such as avoiding predators duffy 2011 kranstauber et al 2012 wajnberg et al 2013 latombe et al 2014 in turn effect and response traits such as physiological states biomass roese et al 1991 buchmann et al 2011 and energy reserves including metabolism and gut capacity dalleau et al 2019 peck and daewel 2007 roese et al 1991 wood et al 2013 both influence and are changed by the movement process in this context eibms have added useful insights to identify what key movement traits persist dominate or adapt to fitness outcomes budaev et al 2019 shepard et al 2013 wood et al 2013 the remaining challenge is to accurately capture energy use as an essential part of the foraging process and include cooperating behaviours such as individual responses to food and group members giske et al 2013 bonnell et al 2013 resource attractiveness bode and delcourt 2013 dumont and hill 2004 earl and zollner 2014 kułakowska et al 2014 wolff 1994 and individual to group movement dumont and hill 2004 couzin et al 2005 rasmussen et al 2008 bonnell et al 2013 here eibms identify behaviour often overlooked in classic foraging models such as explicit foraging costs to help bridge the gap between modelled and real movement patterns guensch et al 2001 bonnell et al 2013 mooij and deangelis 2003 pauli et al 2013 roese et al 1991 2 2 design and performance many eibms have focused on finding a common currency that explains emergent components of movement that can not only capture different costs but how these costs depend on physiology shepard and lambertucci 2013 r s wilson et al 2015 wilson et al 2015b examples of these components include turning angle step length net displacement per time unit and movement activity or speed often measured by proxies such as overall dynamic body acceleration odba gleiss et al 2011 miwa et al 2015 here biologging can capture behavioural modes or activity bouts in terms of energy expenditure for example miwa et al 2015 suggest movement speed is more closely linked to heart rate than step length alone as a proxy for energy costs however odba measurements indirectly approximate energy costs miwa et al 2015 extending this tool for direct energy costs related to movement would involve summarising the activity budget within a process based energetics model chimienti et al 2020 use a deb ibm to show how activity states from detailed biologging data can incorporate energetic costs over the animal lifecycle providing a framework to integrate movement costs more explicitly combined turning angle step length and speed can usefully capture fine scale movement through energetic trade offs that depend on different space and time scales r s wilson et al 2015 wilson et al 2015b the following examples show how model designs at fine space and time scales incorporate these trade offs and how this propagates to outcomes at large scales at fine time scales physiology and energy use are intrinsically linked suggesting animals use time budgets to trade off energy costs and gains against future risks such as food intake and handling time against predators and starvation risk allocation hypothesis lima et al 1999 although implicitly accounted for in holling functional responses in mathematical models of optimal foraging e g krivan and vrkoc 2004 food size bite size and intake rate are key but often overlooked traits associated with energetics shaping movement borrell 2007 roese et al 1991 guensch et al 2001 peck and daewel 2007 wilson et al 2011 pauli et al 2013 this level of detail would help distinguish essential behaviour such as feeding rates wilson et al 2011 and digestive capacity roese et al 1991 peck and daewel 2007 giske et al 2013 that determine activity patterns and time budgets bergman et al 2001 levy et al 2017 louzao et al 2014 malishev et al 2018 merkle et al 2014 for example finding resources within suitable thermal or refuge areas can limit dispersal levy et al 2017 suggesting access to ideal habitat conditions becomes increasingly important under environmental change buckley et al 2018 levy et al 2017 sears and angilletta 2015 and that changing habitat quality microhabitats and temperature impose movement limits ayllón et al 2016 fort et al 2009 levy et al 2017 malishev et al 2018 sears and angilletta 2015 further examples of how these fine scale physiological processes can shape movement include exploring the animal chronobiological rhythm together with temperature and prey constraints here intake rates of seasonal resources such as high fat foods to survive winter periods reflect body condition throughout the animal s lifetime and thus reproductive strategy on longer time scales parker et al 2009 hence these trade offs at the patch level also have consequences on longer time scales by affecting life developmental stages wolff 1994 and adaptation to future environmental change ayllón et al 2016 therefore physiology and behaviour adapted to mediate fitness costs i e growth and reproduction may impose more crucial constraints than simply optimising short term foraging gain humston et al 2004 these constraints emphasise how the individual energy budget built on physiology can be useful in predicting fitness outcomes from movement behaviour sibly et al 2013 mclane et al 2017 finally animals use energy to connect movement costs with habitat use and survival probability under different risks at fine scales for example railsback et al 1999 show stream fish choose patches of low energy gain that minimise risk from fast flowing water currents while pauli et al 2013 use energetics to show individual growth changes in response to resource habitat and predation and starvation risks e g landscape of fear vs food semeniuk et al 2012 laundré et al 2014 teckentrup et al 2018 by incorporating energy use as a decision making mechanism for future movement these approaches demonstrate the trade offs of using local habitat information are connected to how animals assess survival risk in space 3 memory and cognition 3 1 challenges we found memory and cognition are common traits amongst movement ibms because exploiting memory creates more spatially aware consumers linking resource and energy use sets useful constraints upon which the memory and decision making parts of movement can be identified and further developed memory allows animals to better exploit food patches nabe nielsen et al 2013 and is characteristic of more spatially aware animals for remembering or finding resources fagan et al 2013 this raises two questions i how do we best couple memory with energetics and ii which approaches best capture the transition from cognitive processes to movement using energetic demands memory and energy reserves both vary amongst individuals suggesting other drivers such as movement strategy in space may be necessary for memory to be effective for example predators using spatial memory can improve foraging success when prey are clustered ringelman 2014 however being spatially aware can be less efficient when resources are random fronhofer et al 2013 in changing environments the turnover of memorised experiences should be rapid as long term memory can diminish the probability of gathering future valuable information eliassen et al 2009 the expected energy intake of animals over time can depend heavily on previous foraging experience to locate larger closer or better food sources merkle et al 2014 mclane et al 2017 however animals relying on estimates of future food yield from current working knowledge would probably benefit from using multiple strategies such as assessing current energy reserves prior to revisiting food sites particularly when food changes in time kułakowska et al 2014 mclane et al 2017 against predator risk eliassen et al 2007 teckentrup et al 2018 and under landscape change dey et al 2017 teckentrup et al 2019 memory can improve spatial awareness of resources however without prior habitat knowledge what other cues help animals shape future movement decisions having some forecasting ability is mechanistic that is memory involves feedback between external conditions and internal states to motivate future movement for movement models this means forecasting more than one movement step into the future which suggests individual level mechanisms driving movement should consider not only immediate benefits but be prescient 3 2 design and performance adopting different types of memory such as remembering sites reference memory and assessing current gain from previous experience working memory van moorter et al 2009 can build a localised understanding of the landscape avgar et al 2013 fronhofer et al 2013 therefore exploiting this ability probably provides selective advantages for example ringelman 2014 used a spatial ibm to show mammal predators recognise how prey distributes itself in space based on their movement decisions about nesting sites earlier in the season remembering food location is also more sustainable and potentially improves fitness with better quality food bison seem to better recognise food location than quality but high quality food can be a stronger incentive than location to re visit profitable patches merkle et al 2014 further increased foraging effort motivated by depleted body condition can force predators to adapt to shifting prey locations under a changing landscape dey et al 2017 remembering previous food sites is likely to outperform random foraging by building more efficient paths to connect food sources within landscapes mueller et al 2011 avgar et al 2013 selection may then favour memory when the environment is relatively stable finally combining memory with habitat and social information e g seabirds using social cues of conspecifics to find resources grünbaum and veit 2003 can also help animals use less space i e energy and improve searching efficiency merkle et al 2014 suggesting memory is also sensitive to scale huse et al 2002 couzin et al 2005 bonnell et al 2013 latombe et al 2014 we argue that movement models incorporating complex cognitive processes and multiple behaviours become more useful and predictive when standardized by a general shared mechanism and common currency amongst taxa such as energetics further we also need to consider the value of long term memory when information on habitat quality is unreliable especially over large space and time scales eliassen et al 2009 and for realism incorporate restricted and imprecise memory fronhofer et al 2013 finally complementary individual traits tell us movement models must be sensitive to changes in scale 4 home range occupancy and dispersal potential 4 1 challenges the challenge here is using energetics to constrain movement decisions and connect fine scale behaviour where movement equates to energy costs and gains with coarse scales where movement outcomes are a collection of many decisions memory thus is a central component of home range occupancy however as we move upward in time and space this challenge may become computationally intractable or result in errors at the fine scale level propagating upwards through the system our review shows home range ibms linked to energetics generally use resource sites mitchell and powell 2004 nabe nielsen et al 2013 or patches consumed anderson et al 2005 buchmann et al 2011 van moorter et al 2009 as a proxy for energy intake rather than individual energy reserves instead of letting home ranges emerge from individual movement decisions home range occupancy is often measured using metrics that assess habitat suitability via resource selection functions anderson et al 2005 bocedi et al 2014a 2014b hayes and thompson 2013 henry et al 2014 kramer schadt et al 2005 2004 mooij and deangelis 2003 rasmussen et al 2008 here relying on habitat suitability indices to predict home range or patch occupancy may ignore important behavioural detail and thus dilute subtle but decisive movement mechanisms kubisch et al 2014 mooij and deangelis 2003 schurr et al 2012 recent advances have extended resource selection functions by considering energetic constraints in a statistical framework to assess how moving animals choose habitat based on energetic constraints klappstein et al 2020 still these energy selection functions stay phenomenological home range formation is a by product of recurring frequent fine scale movement linked to behaviour connecting animals to space such as memory and resource use van dyck baguette 2005 mortality risk kramer schadt et al 2005 bocedi et al 2014a 2014b and species interactions e g competition predation and mating opportunities moorcroft et al 2006 teckentrup et al 2018 2019 wang and grimm 2007 similarly dispersal i e the long distance movement between leaving the parental home range and establishing a new one is often subsumed by aggregated metrics for example new home ranges are drawn from a habitat suitability map with imposed cost distances from the natal home range schadt et al 2002 or from a density kernel bocedi et al 2014a the challenge here would be to accurately model the processes of competitor and predator avoidance as well as the energy gains that motivate long distance movements away from the natal patch combined home range occupancy and dispersal translate to larger scales such as population s range expansion and species distribution fig 1 section 2 dispersal ability allows us to estimate how individuals kautz et al 2014 populations fahrig 2003 latombe et al 2014 aben et al 2014 and communities buchmann et al 2011 respond to changing environments at larger scales such as fragmentation or climate change hence an improvement of predictive models at the home range level would already significantly increase our understanding of global change impacts on species survival probability in the long run such an improvement would involve integrating a common mechanism underlying movement that is general and predictive this could involve implementing behavioural rules based on energy reserves to calculate movement costs sears and angilletta 2015 malishev et al 2018 and build suitable attraction rules to profitable food sources nabe nielsen et al 2013 mclane et al 2017 or shelter moorcroft et al 2006 while also accounting for mortality risk bowler and benton 2005 kanagaraj et al 2013 4 2 design and performance home range behaviour is often directly related to memory i e animals occupy habitats by revisiting previous sites and build home ranges by relying on different types of memory such as reference and working van moorter et al 2009 however because home range stability changes in space and time lyons et al 2013 home range models need to consider memory costs such as animals requiring too much information börger et al 2008 for example incorporating the duration and frequency of patch visits can support biologically relevant movement rules that reduce the capacity for unrealistic dispersal patterns lyons et al 2013 van moorter et al 2016 campos candela et al 2019 incorporated between and within individual differences in home range behaviour into a theoretical energetics model to understand eco evolutionary processes behind movement syndromes and different life history strategies to be predictive in heterogeneous landscapes or real situations however models need to capture individual responses to resource competitor predator or mate distribution at the home range level because they impose practical spatial limits bocedi et al 2014a b buchmann et al 2011 lyons et al 2013 mitchell and powell 2004 moorcroft et al 2006 when home range behaviour and dispersal involve multiple cues pe er and kramer schadt 2008 schick et al 2008 assuming animals prioritise certain activities without a thorough understanding of their usefulness can often be misleading mitchell and powell 2004 therefore the way animals use energy across time and space can identify general mechanisms that summarise complex movement or that prioritise decisions exploring movement from a mechanistic basis simplifies how movement decisions shape more complex strategies such as when internal energy reserves drive animals to compromise or exploit resources or mates individual energetics are directly linked to space via resource use and mortality risk as a basic constraint to home range emergence for example visitation rates of profitable patches shape how animals build home ranges such as cached resource sites mclane et al 2017 and exploiting optimal thermal patches as landscapes change in space sears and angilletta 2015 whereas irrelevant space use such as animals visiting empty patches can be equally important when setting spatial limits i e territory borders mitchell and powell 2012 if defining a detailed energy budget is not always possible an alternative but abstract way to integrate energetics into movement is depicting multiple decision making surfaces based on resource availability or mortality risk fronhofer et al 2013 pauli et al 2013 finally supplementing energetics with other traits like memory can make movement models more predictive and realistic latombe et al 2014 such as using energy costs to impose more realistic dispersal limits than just arbitrary maximum distances 5 migration and geographic distribution 5 1 challenges there are a few reasons why eibms do not consider all migratory species at the migration scale where currently birds and marine species dominate bauer et al 2009 first the large time and space scale of migration means migrants must adapt to long physical travel and uncertain habitat and resource availability at destination sites which can be difficult to capture in a model bjorge et al 2002 duriez et al 2009 holsman et al 2003 pettifor et al 2000 second large scale movement is often group based merkle et al 2015 rasmussen et al 2008 and social input can dilute the migration process to make it less predictable cote et al 2016 shaw and couzin 2013 particularly under large scale environmental change boone et al 2006 finally migration events may rely on specific group social structures for example dominant and experienced individuals can influence group behaviour which depends on the timing of emerging dominants with migration events cooke et al 2008 huse et al 2002 therefore a combination of both internal cues such as using energy reserves to gauge distances to future stopover sites duriez et al 2009 pettifor et al 2000 and external cues such as departing during optimal food and climate conditions mcnamara et al 2011 boone et al 2006 should help animals make more informed movement decisions ibms typically use behavioural rules to model group movement during migration duriez et al 2009 huse et al 2004 2002 huse and giske 1998 pettifor et al 2000 shaw and couzin 2013 providing a framework to integrate internal cues with external ones generating useful model forecasts at the migration scale is limited by two main challenges first a lot of the necessary resolution relies on large scale environmental data that can be difficult to obtain manage or project in meaningful ways for example connecting large scale environmental data directly with animal movement and gps tagged data that are both user friendly and manageable remains an on going challenge ferdinando et al 2010 but open and expansive repositories are becoming more popular e g the env data system dodge et al 2013 isolating key drivers of animal movement such as resource availability helps pinpoint useful and accessible data for example boult et al 2018 used the normalised difference vegetation index ndvi to estimate landscape level food biomass to connect movement projections of gps tagged elephant populations isolated geographic areas with reliable movement ranges of animals provide unique opportunities to predict movement in mechanistic ways such as gis tracking of local harbour seal populations in archipelagos accessed by fisheries bjørge et al 2002 a comprehensive overview of the limitations and opportunities of using large scale data has been discussed elsewhere cagnacci et al 2010 ferdinando et al 2010 as well as those of radio tracking individual animals cooke et al 2004 second complex behaviour and movement such as sociality and avoiding predation risk relies on fine scale dynamic data that can be less amenable and lead to coarser model forecasts at larger scales this is compounded by increasingly imprecise and unreliable movement data with increasing scale frair et al 2010 migration often involves two distinct movement phases small scale within and large scale between sites external cues such as seasonal weather boone et al 2006 holsman et al 2003 pettifor et al 2000 and resource patterns duriez et al 2009 operate at both scales fine scale habitat changes dictate food availability or predation risk within sites e g geese navigating daily tidal cycles pettifor et al 2000 changes in prey populations based on prey rich areas holsman et al 2003 and fish in diurnal giske et al 2013 and diel migration busch et al 2011 at larger scales migrants may rely heavily on seasonal cues between sites pettifor et al 2000 but switch to favour localised cues such as resources within sites shaw and couzin 2013 integrating scalable and high resolution environmental data with this localised behaviour is challenging but can project the behavioural part of movement and activity patterns to larger geographic ranges such as latitudinal microclimate data based on historical weather patterns linked to thermal space use levy et al 2017 the following examples show how external and internal cues can be used for modelling migratory decisions based on energetics 5 2 design and performance external cues such as seasonality and temperature alter resource density in space and time suggesting large scale dispersal is sensitive to the rate and scale of change in these cues boone et al 2006 busch et al 2011 huse et al 2004 kearney et al 2009 the problem is that external cues vary widely at large scales one solution is categorising the migration path into distinct movement phases at a local scale i e adapting to wind currents to identify vital points in time and space that animals can exploit for example local habitats provide physical catalysts such as wind or oceanic currents for migrating birds and turtles safi et al 2013 dalleau et al 2019 e g dynamic soaring sachs et al 2013 shepard and lambertucci 2013 to facilitate faster movement and improve access to food sources especially for species with greater ranges shepard and lambertucci 2013 despite these opportunities migrants may not always capitalise on paths of least resistance such as bar headed geese that on average exploit wind conditions sub optimally for reduced energy costs despite available tail winds hawkes et al 2013 the conclusions here are twofold 1 although migrating birds sometimes utilise low altitude areas along migratory paths to reduce movement costs over longer time periods this type of behaviour may not always be possible or sustainable hawkes et al 2013 sachs et al 2013 shepard and lambertucci 2013 and 2 individuals exploit habitats differently which is particularly evident in group based migration cote et al 2016 therefore the general limiting constraint to movement in lieu of or dominant to the external physical environment is likely to be internal using internal cues to shape migration suggests individual level detail can fill in the critical gaps between local behaviour and larger scales body condition as a timing cue for long distance migrants such as sockeye salmon returning to breeding sites can reliably distinguish delayed migrants from timely ones cooke et al 2008 geese use external cues such as spring plant emergence to trigger migration decisions however combining habitat information with detailed data on internal cues such as energy reserves metabolic rates and thermoregulatory costs can optimise departure times duriez et al 2009 these detailed individual level data such as gut capacity feeding response to prey density functional response bite size ingestion rate and metabolic activities of respiration egestion and excretion are realistic measurements of behaviour ultimately linking large scale movement to reasonable fitness outcomes such as growth and reproduction boult et al 2018 huse et al 2004 pettifor et al 2000 because internal cues such as energy reserves vary at any given time amongst individuals estimating movement decisions from these cues retains individual specific responses to environmental change this has three immediate advantages it improves how we interpret movement costs in different ecosystems i e terrestrial versus aquatic hein et al 2012 particularly as energy use can become more abstract with increasing scales pauli et al 2013 r s wilson et al 2015 wilson et al 2015b it allows us to estimate metabolic activity such as intake rates in environments where direct measurements can be difficult to obtain e g offshore seabird foraging fort et al 2009 and it addresses the common problem that many movement models neglect key between individual differences holyoak et al 2008 our review reinforced the need to explicitly consider space in models at the migration scale this was primarily due to the ability for spatial models to more accurately reflect real movement patterns under large scale habitat change huse and giske 1998 pettifor et al 2000 shaw and couzin 2013 the importance of fine scale space on food encounter rates bode and delcourt 2013 huse et al 2004 wajnberg et al 2013 and the response of highly mobile prey to environmental change huse and giske 1998 by using a common mechanism connecting trade offs in movement costs and gains across scales such as energy use we can identify some of the barriers when developing large scale movement models such as sensitivity to scale habitat loss increases travel distance to new sites so spatial models need to clearly define what makes habitats attractive for migrants pettifor et al 2000 further due to the subtlety of spatial movement models should be sensitive to the types of movement rules applied at large scales huse et al 2004 for example over long time periods slow moving animals can incur greater movement costs across large scales compared to faster animals by accumulating more non movement costs per distance travelled wilson et al 2015a the costs of migration can be substantial and difficult to define across species and systems therefore using energy reserves to interpret the relationship between common physical traits such as body mass with movement costs hein et al 2012 see also buchmann et al 2013 2012 2011 duriez et al 2009 fiksen and carlotti 1998 giske et al 2013 roese et al 1991 underpins the migration process with a common and useful mechanism finally migration often involves group movement so grouping individuals into common assemblages using a shared trait purves et al 2013 satisfies the concept of the super individual one type of individual representing a suite of individuals with similar attributes across large space and time scales huse et al 2004 e g smaller animals with high metabolic rates than larger ones require different handling times and incur greater movement costs here the concept of collectives from the odd protocol for individual based model development offers well established terminology grimm et al 2010 2006 6 conclusions interpreting movement using energetics has several advantages first energetics connects measureable individual traits such as reserve capacity to fitness trade offs giske et al 2013 bode and delcourt 2013 second it provides a uniform and discrete unit of measurement such as joules to calculate metabolic rates and summarise energy exchange between individuals and the environment here energy uptake can be measured through surfaces in terrestrial or volumes in aquatic habitats i e measuring prey as biomass in oceans finally eibms can highlight useful assumptions sensitive to species and scale for example static parameters such as maximum feeding rate may underestimate intake rates as prey density varies in space and time peck and daewel 2007 further movement costs depend on turning angle across distance travelled that also accumulates at finer scales wilson et al 2013 ignoring these assumptions may underestimate realistic movement costs therefore models focused on only single outcomes such as growth may ignore essential cooperating constraints to movement such as trade offs to predation railsback et al 1999 fiksen and carlotti 1998 risk taking in landscapes of food vs fear giske et al 2013 laundré et al 2014 teckentrup et al 2018 and metabolic processes other than simply energy intake louzao et al 2014 such as maintenance costs kooijman 2010 sibly et al 2013 and fitness outputs over time ayllón et al 2016 levy et al 2017 new et al 2014 despite the direct relationship between energy and time movement models often make energetics case specific probably due to convenience ease and simplicity holyoak et al 2008 alternatively using energetics theory to formulate the individual energy budget offers a general way to estimate movement costs malishev et al 2018 this aims to fill in field data gaps and escape the development demands of formulating case specific models grimm et al 2005 louzao et al 2014 we found studies that did not explicitly include energetics used other proxies for energy intake such as resource patch use for such cases the added effort of parameterising a complete energetics component to the model may be unnecessary for the problem at hand here behavioural components may be a synergistic way of incorporating energy related constraints such as separating movement into direct costs where movement is taxed by energy use and indirect costs where fine scale movement costs translate to fitness consequences over longer time scales we encourage studies to consider the data requirements needed to incorporate these details against their usefulness as computational tools and the costs of developing the model advanced technology such as gps units with accelerometers and other sensors can help by simplifying how we calculate energy use from field data of different behaviours gleiss et al 2011 louzao et al 2014 nams 2014 miwa et al 2015 kays et al 2015 scharf et al 2016 this is particularly evident when available movement data are supplemented by detailed ecological and habitat data such as connecting energetics to food availability at the landscape level boult et al 2018 and predation trade offs with habitat productivity bjørge et al 2002 busch et al 2011 7 future directions our review identified several pertinent trends first the movement ecology literature incorporates eibms across foraging and local patch selection memory and learning home range behaviour and dispersal potential and migration this highlights that movement ibms indeed consider energetics across most time and space scales finer scales such as foraging most readily integrated energetic consequences of movement at the coarser migration scale these consequences were closely linked to similar behaviour at finer scales bode and delcourt 2013 huse et al 2004 wajnberg et al 2013 such as resource intake from local patches at migration sites pettifor et al 2000 dalleau et al 2019 this opens opportunities to explore both small and large scale movement with similar drivers this pattern also suggests that more complex behaviours such as predation and competition are less easily explained by energy use due to the inherent intricacies of animal behaviour and decision making across taxa that require adequate data ayllón et al 2016 chimienti et al 2020 hawkes et al 2013 levy et al 2017 malishev et al 2018 sears and angilletta 2015 shepard and lambertucci 2013 wahle 1992 wilson et al 2013 second movement at the individual level is based on adaptive decision making grimm et al 2005 grimm and railsback 2011 2005 mooij and deangelis 2003 tang and bennett 2010 zollner and lima 2005 however many individual based models still mix imposed and emergent behaviour encouraging efforts bauer and klaassen 2013 and therein identify ibms to progress mechanistic modelling of animal movement as movement decisions become more complex internal mechanisms like memory aid animals in locating resources and structuring home ranges while cooperating internal and external cues facilitating movement reinforce the need for modelling space at increasing scales the sensitivity of movement to different scales species and constraints reinforces the need for general simplified mechanisms to unify the way we interpret movement third integrating energetics and building model assumptions needs to match activity patterns to accurately capture costs of environmental change on physiological rates particularly individual responses to large scale environmental change humston et al 2004 levy et al 2017 one mutual drawback of many energetics models is their reliance on ad hoc estimates of energy use which misses an opportunity to capture movement costs from formal and well established metabolic rules common across taxa more thought is needed into validating movement costs with metabolic rules in space and time as shown when predicting population cycles bacher and gangnery 2006 martin et al 2013 and to link individuals with populations directly such as density dependant foraging pressure on patch selection through competition chudzińska et al 2016 and indirectly such as spatial patterns of population fitness across landscapes humston et al 2004 shepard et al 2013 finally recent advances in biologging are improving how we calculate energy costs gleiss et al 2011 louzao et al 2014 nathan et al 2012 scharf et al 2016 chimienti et al 2020 to improve model development and advance movement theory using direct energetic feedback between animals and their habitat louzao et al 2014 i e energy landscapes hawkes et al 2013 sachs et al 2013 shepard et al 2013 therefore our current state of knowledge combining energy budgets movement theory and data from advanced animal tracking technology is timely for fully adopting general ibm frameworks that predict movement behaviour with individual energetics at its core movement ecology is beginning to embrace the same principles we explore in this review by explicitly addressing energetic costs bonnell et al 2013 bonte et al 2012 hawkes et al 2013 pauli et al 2013 sachs et al 2013 shepard et al 2013 wood et al 2013 and focusing on mechanisms and scales benhamou 2014 holyoak et al 2008 giuggioli and bartumeus 2010 which have been simplified by the strengths of process based approaches such as
