precipitation temperature and antecedent wetness to elucidate changes in the baseflow volume and timing using broadly available and accessible datasets furthermore we identify regions with currently undetected changes in baseflow which can direct future work to investigate what is driving baseflow changes in unimpaired and anthropogenic watersheds 2 data and methodology 2 1 data daily discharge records were gathered from 1 275 water survey of canada wsc streamflow gages accessed from the wsc hydat database environment and climate change canada 2010 using the tidyhydat package albers 2017 fig 2 to determine monthly baseflow trends we calculated the mean of daily baseflow estimates stations were only included if they had at least 27 years of available data between 1989 and 2019 and the trend analysis was run for months with less than 5 of missing values a subset of 272 utilized gages are classified as reference hydrometric basin network rhbn stations with minimal human impact and that have a record period that meets the criteria indicated above i e 30 years of data with less than 10 missing years environment and climate change canada 2020 catchment areas ranged from 626 km2 to 34 850 km2 with mean median areas of 7 228 5335 km2 the climate analysis used a different period of record starting as early as 1940 and requiring at least 30 years of data the longer historical record was needed to ensure that even weak to moderate correlations between baseflow and climate predictors would be detected feaster lee 2017 daily records of precipitation and temperature were provided by environment and climate change canada eccc and were accessed using the weathercan package lazerte albers 2018 monthly basin averaged values were calculated by averaging daily temperature and averaging the cumulative precipitation for all stations in each basin and for each which resulted in one set of data for each basin we then matched the streamflow data to the basin averaged climate dataset based on the basins in which they are located monthly values were only used if records were missing less than one day per month i e months needed to be at least 95 complete antecedent wetness is defined as the sum of the previous three month s precipitation consistent with ayers et al 2021a who examined the sensitivity of antecedent precipitation on baseflow they found that 3 months was the best definition for antecedent conditions important for baseflow discharge across the u s midwest 2 2 baseflow separation methods tracer based methods are one of the only ways to measure baseflow directly however because extensive fieldwork is required and data are usually collected for short time periods they are not feasible when analyzing baseflow across broad regions and for longer record lengths to quantify baseflow we used an established hydrograph separation technique the one parameter digital filter which was developed by lyne hollick 1979 the one parameter digital filter has been shown to be effective when compared to other hydrograph separation methods ayers et al 2022 nathan mcmahon 1990 it is given by q t α q t 1 1 α 2 q t q t 1 where qt is the filtered quick response at the t time step qt 1 is the filtered quick response at the t 1 time step qt is the total streamflow discharge at the t time step qt 1 is the total streamflow discharge at the t 1 time step and α is the recession constant which represents the rate of streamflow decay in this study we used α 0 925 which is consistent with previous studies e g nathan mcmahon 1990 arnold allen 1999 gonzales et al 2009 lott stewart 2016 to prevent a temporal shift in the wave patterns the discharge timeseries is passed through forwards and backwards lyne hollick 1979 generally each time the timeseries passes through the filter reduces the baseflow estimate in our study we passed each timeseries through the digital filter three times consistent with work by nathan mcmahon 1990 the r package ecohydrology fuka et al 2018 was used to apply the one parameter digital filter to each streamflow time series fig s1 shows four years of daily streamflow data from streamflow gage 02hb013 plotted with daily baseflow obtained from applying the one parameter digital filter 2 3 trend analysis monthly baseflow trends were detected using the mann kendall mk trend test the mk trend test was used to detect monotonic i e consistently increasing or decreasing trends in a time series with a significance level of p 0 05 the objective of this work is to identify trends for which mk is an appropriate methodology that was selected to be consistent with previous work e g ayers et al 2022 in this analysis we did not consider the effects of serial correlation yue et al 2003 as studies have shown it to be theoretically flawed because it does not address variance inflation related to dependence farris et al 2021 serinaldi kilsby 2016 furthermore we assume that the baseflow trends are monotonic which is consistent with the mk test we acknowledge that baseflow records may exhibit more complex patterns and that there is discussion of nonstationarity in hydrological processes that may influence the results of our analysis e g bayazit 2015 hall tajvidi 2000 serinaldi et al 2018 slater villarini 2017 furthermore to verify the mk trend analysis we used the theil sen trend test within the trend package which confirmed the mk results pohlert 2020 fig s2 monthly baseflow trends were analyzed over a thirty year period from 1989 to 2019 the r package kendall mcleod 2022 was used to compute the mk trends an example of the timeseries and a trendline from streamflow gage 02hb013 for the month of august is available in supplemental information fig s2 2 4 statistical modelling framework generalized additive model for location scale and shape gamlss is a distribution based approach to regression models rigby stasinopoulos 2005 stasinopoulos rigby 2008 gamlss is a regression type model that assumes a parametric distribution on the response variable where different distribution types can be used to relate explanatory variables to the response variable in this study gamlss was used to develop models of monthly baseflow because it can incorporate many distribution types including gamma distribution used for positively continuous right skewed data typical of both streamflow and baseflow e g ayers et al 2021a slater villarini 2017 historical baseflow observations were related to three climate predictors precipitation antecedent wetness and temperature the null model represents time as the selected covariate indicating that none of the climate variables analyzed here were statistically significant predictors each combination of climate predictors was evaluated and the best predictive model was selected at each station and for each month using a stepwise model selection while residence time of groundwater in basins across canada varies with basin characteristics we use the previous three month s precipitation to understand how soil moisture and pressure changes within the flow system impact groundwater discharge pressure changes such as increased hydraulic heads due to increased recharge can induce increased groundwater discharge to downstream surface water bodies further work can investigate the relationship of basin characteristics with variation in the response time to precipitation to select the best gamlss models we used the bayesian information criteria bic schwarz 1978 table 1 shows the five model formulations that were selected most often to account for streamflow intermittency and periods when streams may be frozen over the analysis was only run for months that contributed to greater than 5 of annual baseflow 3 results results are presented in reference to their geographical location in canada often referring to specific provinces and territories fig 1 in the following discussion section results are analyzed in context of specific environmental climate and or land use conditions making them more broadly applicable 3 1 monthly baseflow trend results for all stations and months analyzed a significant increase in baseflow was detected 11 6 of the time while a significant decrease was detected 2 7 of the time the remaining 85 7 of station and months showed no statistically significant trends statistically significant baseflow trends show distinct spatial and temporal patterns fig 3 the trend results are further summarized by month and province territory fig 4 to help the reader understand further the distribution of trends through time and space table s1 includes the summary by both month and province territory for every month of the year increasing baseflow trends were detected in manitoba central saskatchewan and the greater toronto area in southern ontario from march to june increasing trends were most pronounced in central parts of canada i e southern alberta saskatchewan manitoba and southern ontario but were also present across southern canada in the colder months october to february increasing trends were only concentrated in manitoba southern ontario southern quebec and newfoundland the canadian prairies alberta saskatchewan and manitoba showed clusters of increasing trends from june to october furthermore notable increasing trends were observed in the yukon from august to october decreasing baseflow trends were observed in april on the east coast and in may across northern parts of british columbia alberta and saskatchewan across western canada decreasing trends were observed from june to september and were detected more often in alberta and british columbia during july and august although decreases in baseflow were sparse they were detected in the east for every month of the year in this study we focus on climatic variables that effect baseflow trends but regional and basin characteristics e g land use soil properties geologic characteristics also influence the spatial distribution of baseflow trends while exploring the relationship between the identified trends and other characteristics is beyond the scope of this work it can be included in future research 3 2 climate model performance the climate model was used to analyze the relationship between baseflow and climate predictors for stations with sufficient climate data available i e at least thirty years of overlapping monthly climate and baseflow data from 1940 to 2019 monthly records from 877 of the 1 275 streamflow stations used in the mk trend analysis qualified for statistical analysis fig 2 the correlation coefficient r and coefficient of determination r2 was calculated for each station and month to measure the strength of the probabilistic model fit overall the models performed fairly well with a mean r value of 0 56 r2 of 0 31 fig 5 the models perform worst in april with a mean r of 0 49 r2 of 0 24 and best in november and december with mean r values greater than 0 60 r2 greater than 0 36 for the remaining months all except april november and december mean values of r ranged from 0 53 to 0 59 r2 from 0 28 to 0 35 there was not a significant difference in model performance between rhbn and non rhbn stations where mean r values were 0 57 and 0 56 r2 of 0 32 and 0 31 respectively 3 3 climate predictions a summary of model selection using precipitation antecedent wetness and temperature as predictors is shown in fig 6 with each season represented by one month i e march june september and december the full climate model results using precipitation antecedent wetness and temperature as predictors are available in figures s4 s5 and s6 respectively overall antecedent wetness was chosen most often as a predictor 64 8 of the time followed by precipitation 50 0 of the time and temperature 38 0 of the time for 15 3 of stations and months no predictors were selected in the model formulation indicating that other factors not analyzed in this study are playing a role in baseflow variability of the 3 616 combinations of hydrometer stations and calendar months with sufficient baseflow and climate data 519 showed statistically significant baseflow trends 14 4 of these stations with baseflow trends 142 27 4 stations and their respective months selected no predictors in the model formulation non rhbn stations were found to be twice as likely to select no climate driver as a predictor in their models when compared with rhbn stations the results of the gamlss climate models vary by region and calendar month overall precipitation and antecedent wetness related positively to increases in baseflow throughout the entire year but in southern canada british columbia and east of manitoba these predictors were selected most often during the coldest months november to march in eastern canada sites with positive correlations to precipitation and antecedent wetness were sparse from july to october temperature also had a positive relationship with baseflow from december to march indicating that increases in temperature play a role in increasing baseflow trends during the spring months april to june temperature transitioned from a positive to negative relationship with baseflow from july to november the clusters of sites that selected temperature in their model formulation were in western canada and from july to september 4 discussion long term trends in baseflow identified in this study are reflective of long term changes to the hydrologic conditions and not the result of a one off dry or wet year or short term changes in water use a recent report by bush lemmen 2019 highlighted the extent of observed climate change across canada which includes consistent seasonal increases in temperature across the country with the exception of northern quebec fig s7 and both increases and decreases in seasonal precipitation and snow and ice cover figs s8 s9 these observations provide context for discussing potential climate induced changes in baseflow specifically the role of 1 changing cold season conditions including changes to snow and ice melt ice thickness and increased winter temperatures 2 changing warm season conditions including increased temperature and evapotranspiration and 3 changing seasonal transitions including earlier snow melt and longer dry season conditions as previously noted several other factors can play a role in the identified trends in baseflow including surface and subsurface characteristics that influence the infiltration groundwater flow and discharge to surface waters the role of topographic and land use factors is beyond the scope of this work 4 1 changing cold season conditions consistent with observations from around the world climate change in canada is most pronounced in the colder northern regions bush lemmen 2019 in these regions changes to the timing of snowmelt and the prevalence and thickness of permafrost and ground ice due to increased temperatures are expected alter hydrologic partitioning and water volumes across these landscapes e g chen et al 2022 duan et al 2017 results from this work in northern canada are sparse because of a lack of long term gauge stations and because the streams freeze throughout the winter months however across canada identified baseflow trends in the winter and spring months are predominantly increasing trends fig 3 during these months canada receives snow as the dominant form of precipitation although there are increased incidences of mid winter melting periods and rain on snow events pavlovskii et al 2019 mid winter melting periods can contribute to increased baseflow as meltwater can infiltrate and induce increased discharge to streams warming trends across most of canada have caused observed declines in days of snow cover by 5 to 10 per decade due to later onset of snow cover and earlier melt time environment and climate change canada 2018 during the winter months and early spring december to march the observed baseflow trends are positively related to most climate predictors along the southern coastal and great lakes regions fig 6 we speculate that this is at least in part from increased temperature which allows rainfall to infiltrate through unfrozen ground and earlier mid season snow melt events 4 2 changing warm season conditions during summer months increases in temperature and precipitation have been observed across much of the country figs s7 s8 and baseflow was related positively to both temperature and precipitation fig 6 changes in warm season climate are likely affecting baseflow conditions through changes in evapotranspiration rates and recharge rates for example temperature was positively related to baseflow in the model formulations across much of the country during the winter and spring likely indicating that increased snow melt caused baseflow increases on the other hand during the late spring early summer in central canada baseflow and temperature were negatively related demonstrating that increased temperature and evapotranspiration may be driving decreases in baseflow fig 6 furthermore decreasing baseflow trends observed in southwestern canada and in southern northwest territories in the summer detected a positive relationship with precipitation and antecedent wetness and or negative relationships with temperature indicating that an arid climate during summer is likely contributing to decreases in baseflow drier climate can causes decreases in regional groundwater storage and increases losses from evapotranspiration condon et al 2020 wu et al 2020 4 3 seasonal transitions seasonal transitions i e timing and duration are important factors that influence baseflow volume and recession rates spring brings increased temperatures which melt snow and ice thus increasing surface water runoff infiltration and vegetative growth that increases evapotranspiration the opposite occurs in the fall when there is reduction in vegetation that causes decreases in evapotranspiration and a transition to more snow events and frozen soil across much of the country the magnitude of changes during these transitions such as the volume of snow cover that melt spring and decreases in vegetation fall affect hydrologic inputs that influence baseflow on the other hand the timing of these seasonal transitions can also shift the timing and distribution of baseflow across landscapes in the mid to late spring april and may the number of identified trends in baseflow significantly increased with widespread increases in baseflow in the prairie provinces these increasing trends may be a result of shifts in snow melt timing and volumes as indicated by antecedent wetness being selected as a common model predictor in the southern and central regions springtime decreasing trends were detected in the maritimes eastern canada during april and in the mid northwest northern parts of british columbia alberta and saskatchewan along with southern northwest territories in may precipitation and antecedent wetness showed a strong positive relationship with monthly baseflow in the maritimes during april signifying that dry weather e g decreased snowfall as indicated in fig s9 may be contributing to springtime decreases in this region it is also noted that this region had measured much less winter snow cover over the record period fig s9 which would reduce the water available to support baseflow during the spring melt furthermore the strong positive relationship with temperature in the winter may indicate earlier melting and depletion of snowpack from spring to fall mixed baseflow trends were observed in the far north yukon and northwest territories increases in baseflow seen predominantly in the yukon related positively with antecedent wetness precipitation and temperature our results indicate that heavier rainfall thicker snowpack warming and melting permafrost could be contributing to baseflow increases however the northwest territories and nunavut have experienced the bulk of northern precipitation increases and relatively smaller change in snow cover until summer months figs s8 s9 shrestha et al 2021 walvoord kurylyk 2016 reviewed research which related climate change melting permafrost and the expansion of northern subsurface flow pathways results indicated that permafrost thaw can enhance groundwater discharge to streams i e baseflow which supports our hypothesis that changes in permafrost expanse area contribute to the observed increasing baseflow trends reported here 4 4 possible role of anthropogenic activities about 27 of the identified baseflow trends did not select a meaningful climate predictor in their model formulations which indicates that other factors are driving changes in baseflow further non rhbn stations were found to be twice as likely to select no climate drivers as predictors compared to rhbn stations which indicates that anthropogenic activities are likely a dominant driver of baseflow changes observed here although the analysis of rhbn gages from non rhbn gages points to the effect of anthropogenic influence the inclusion of anthropogenic factors was beyond the scope of this work however previous studies have shown that pumping and land cover can have a significant impact on surface and subsurface flow ayers et al 2021a zipper et al 2022 and future work should take these factors into consideration 5 conclusions the objective of this study was to investigate long term baseflow trends and identify possible climatic drivers across canada thirty years of stream gage data was gathered from across canada to investigate changes in monthly baseflow monotonic trends were identified using the mann kendall test and gamlss statistical models were developed to identify the relationships between monthly climate predictors precipitation antecedent wetness and temperature and monthly baseflow changes in monthly baseflow varied across canada and throughout the year most trends were increasing but there were regions with notable decreasing trends such as the western provinces and the maritimes temporally increasing baseflow trends were observed across canada for each calendar month but decreasing trends were concentrated in warmer months june august of the three climate predictors antecedent wetness was selected most often in the model formulations 64 8 across all sites and month which highlights the importance of soil moisture in driving baseflow response precipitation was an important predictor of water availability as was observed from the positive relationship with baseflow throughout the year temperature was selected in model formulations but its relationship to baseflow depended on the season and location during the spring a positive relationship with baseflow was observed pointing to the role that snowmelt plays in increasing baseflow in the summer a negative relationship with temperature was observed likely because of increases in evapotranspiration in some regions including southwest canada and southern northwest territories baseflow decreased due to an overall drier climate including positive relationships with precipitation and antecedent wetness non rhbn stations were twice as likely as rhbn stations to have months which selected no climate predictors in their models indicating the need for further research to investigate the influence of anthropogenic activities on baseflow response there are several limitations in this study and several opportunities for future work firstly a lack of northern streamflow and weather station coverage prevented a thorough interpretation of trends and climatic drivers in that region winter streamflow is an inherently difficult observation to measure in a cold climate because the surface often freezes over in all but the most energetic streams future studies would would benefit from a denser network of permanent streamflow and weather stations furthermore there were predictors that were only assessed indirectly through temperature i e evapotranspiration and snowmelt because there was a lack of data availability for such parameters at the scale needed for this study the results reported here warrant further investigation to determine if human activity or other forces have caused changes in baseflow stations that selected no climate predictors in their model formula indicate that anthropogenic activities such as land use change groundwater extraction or water wastewater routing may be influencing changes in baseflow while these analyses are out of the scope of this work the results reported here can help direct future

months was the best definition for antecedent conditions important for baseflow discharge across the u s midwest 2 2 baseflow separation methods tracer based methods are one of the only ways to measure baseflow directly however because extensive fieldwork is required and data are usually collected for short time periods they are not feasible when analyzing baseflow across broad regions and for longer record lengths to quantify baseflow we used an established hydrograph separation technique the one parameter digital filter which was developed by lyne hollick 1979 the one parameter digital filter has been shown to be effective when compared to other hydrograph separation methods ayers et al 2022 nathan mcmahon 1990 it is given by q t α q t 1 1 α 2 q t q t 1 where qt is the filtered quick response at the t time step qt 1 is the filtered quick response at the t 1 time step qt is the total streamflow discharge at the t time step qt 1 is the total streamflow discharge at the t 1 time step and α is the recession constant which represents the rate of streamflow decay in this study we used α 0 925 which is consistent with previous studies e g nathan mcmahon 1990 arnold allen 1999 gonzales et al 2009 lott stewart 2016 to prevent a temporal shift in the wave patterns the discharge timeseries is passed through forwards and backwards lyne hollick 1979 generally each time the timeseries passes through the filter reduces the baseflow estimate in our study we passed each timeseries through the digital filter three times consistent with work by nathan mcmahon 1990 the r package ecohydrology fuka et al 2018 was used to apply the one parameter digital filter to each streamflow time series fig s1 shows four years of daily streamflow data from streamflow gage 02hb013 plotted with daily baseflow obtained from applying the one parameter digital filter 2 3 trend analysis monthly baseflow trends were detected using the mann kendall mk trend test the mk trend test was used to detect monotonic i e consistently increasing or decreasing trends in a time series with a significance level of p 0 05 the objective of this work is to identify trends for which mk is an appropriate methodology that was selected to be consistent with previous work e g ayers et al 2022 in this analysis we did not consider the effects of serial correlation yue et al 2003 as studies have shown it to be theoretically flawed because it does not address variance inflation related to dependence farris et al 2021 serinaldi kilsby 2016 furthermore we assume that the baseflow trends are monotonic which is consistent with the mk test we acknowledge that baseflow records may exhibit more complex patterns and that there is discussion of nonstationarity in hydrological processes that may influence the results of our analysis e g bayazit 2015 hall tajvidi 2000 serinaldi et al 2018 slater villarini 2017 furthermore to verify the mk trend analysis we used the theil sen trend test within the trend package which confirmed the mk results pohlert 2020 fig s2 monthly baseflow trends were analyzed over a thirty year period from 1989 to 2019 the r package kendall mcleod 2022 was used to compute the mk trends an example of the timeseries and a trendline from streamflow gage 02hb013 for the month of august is available in supplemental information fig s2 2 4 statistical modelling framework generalized additive model for location scale and shape gamlss is a distribution based approach to regression models rigby stasinopoulos 2005 stasinopoulos rigby 2008 gamlss is a regression type model that assumes a parametric distribution on the response variable where different distribution types can be used to relate explanatory variables to the response variable in this study gamlss was used to develop models of monthly baseflow because it can incorporate many distribution types including gamma distribution used for positively continuous right skewed data typical of both streamflow and baseflow e g ayers et al 2021a slater villarini 2017 historical baseflow observations were related to three climate predictors precipitation antecedent wetness and temperature the null model represents time as the selected covariate indicating that none of the climate variables analyzed here were statistically significant predictors each combination of climate predictors was evaluated and the best predictive model was selected at each station and for each month using a stepwise model selection while residence time of groundwater in basins across canada varies with basin characteristics we use the previous three month s precipitation to understand how soil moisture and pressure changes within the flow system impact groundwater discharge pressure changes such as increased hydraulic heads due to increased recharge can induce increased groundwater discharge to downstream surface water bodies further work can investigate the relationship of basin characteristics with variation in the response time to precipitation to select the best gamlss models we used the bayesian information criteria bic schwarz 1978 table 1 shows the five model formulations that were selected most often to account for streamflow intermittency and periods when streams may be frozen over the analysis was only run for months that contributed to greater than 5 of annual baseflow 3 results results are presented in reference to their geographical location in canada often referring to specific provinces and territories fig 1 in the following discussion section results are analyzed in context of specific environmental climate and or land use conditions making them more broadly applicable 3 1 monthly baseflow trend results for all stations and months analyzed a significant increase in baseflow was detected 11 6 of the time while a significant decrease was detected 2 7 of the time the remaining 85 7 of station and months showed no statistically significant trends statistically significant baseflow trends show distinct spatial and temporal patterns fig 3 the trend results are further summarized by month and province territory fig 4 to help the reader understand further the distribution of trends through time and space table s1 includes the summary by both month and province territory for every month of the year increasing baseflow trends were detected in manitoba central saskatchewan and the greater toronto area in southern ontario from march to june increasing trends were most pronounced in central parts of canada i e southern alberta saskatchewan manitoba and southern ontario but were also present across southern canada in the colder months october to february increasing trends were only concentrated in manitoba southern ontario southern quebec and newfoundland the canadian prairies alberta saskatchewan and manitoba showed clusters of increasing trends from june to october furthermore notable increasing trends were observed in the yukon from august to october decreasing baseflow trends were observed in april on the east coast and in may across northern parts of british columbia alberta and saskatchewan across western canada decreasing trends were observed from june to september and were detected more often in alberta and british columbia during july and august although decreases in baseflow were sparse they were detected in the east for every month of the year in this study we focus on climatic variables that effect baseflow trends but regional and basin characteristics e g land use soil properties geologic characteristics also influence the spatial distribution of baseflow trends while exploring the relationship between the identified trends and other characteristics is beyond the scope of this work it can be included in future research 3 2 climate model performance the climate model was used to analyze the relationship between baseflow and climate predictors for stations with sufficient climate data available i e at least thirty years of overlapping monthly climate and baseflow data from 1940 to 2019 monthly records from 877 of the 1 275 streamflow stations used in the mk trend analysis qualified for statistical analysis fig 2 the correlation coefficient r and coefficient of determination r2 was calculated for each station and month to measure the strength of the probabilistic model fit overall the models performed fairly well with a mean r value of 0 56 r2 of 0 31 fig 5 the models perform worst in april with a mean r of 0 49 r2 of 0 24 and best in november and december with mean r values greater than 0 60 r2 greater than 0 36 for the remaining months all except april november and december mean values of r ranged from 0 53 to 0 59 r2 from 0 28 to 0 35 there was not a significant difference in model performance between rhbn and non rhbn stations where mean r values were 0 57 and 0 56 r2 of 0 32 and 0 31 respectively 3 3 climate predictions a summary of model selection using precipitation antecedent wetness and temperature as predictors is shown in fig 6 with each season represented by one month i e march june september and december the full climate model results using precipitation antecedent wetness and temperature as predictors are available in figures s4 s5 and s6 respectively overall antecedent wetness was chosen most often as a predictor 64 8 of the time followed by precipitation 50 0 of the time and temperature 38 0 of the time for 15 3 of stations and months no predictors were selected in the model formulation indicating that other factors not analyzed in this study are playing a role in baseflow variability of the 3 616 combinations of hydrometer stations and calendar months with sufficient baseflow and climate data 519 showed statistically significant baseflow trends 14 4 of these stations with baseflow trends 142 27 4 stations and their respective months selected no predictors in the model formulation non rhbn stations were found to be twice as likely to select no climate driver as a predictor in their models when compared with rhbn stations the results of the gamlss climate models vary by region and calendar month overall precipitation and antecedent wetness related positively to increases in baseflow throughout the entire year but in southern canada british columbia and east of manitoba these predictors were selected most often during the coldest months november to march in eastern canada sites with positive correlations to precipitation and antecedent wetness were sparse from july to october temperature also had a positive relationship with baseflow from december to march indicating that increases in temperature play a role in increasing baseflow trends during the spring months april to june temperature transitioned from a positive to negative relationship with baseflow from july to november the clusters of sites that selected temperature in their model formulation were in western canada and from july to september 4 discussion long term trends in baseflow identified in this study are reflective of long term changes to the hydrologic conditions and not the result of a one off dry or wet year or short term changes in water use a recent report by bush lemmen 2019 highlighted the extent of observed climate change across canada which includes consistent seasonal increases in temperature across the country with the exception of northern quebec fig s7 and both increases and decreases in seasonal precipitation and snow and ice cover figs s8 s9 these observations provide context for discussing potential climate induced changes in baseflow specifically the role of 1 changing cold season conditions including changes to snow and ice melt ice thickness and increased winter temperatures 2 changing warm season conditions including increased temperature and evapotranspiration and 3 changing seasonal transitions including earlier snow melt and longer dry season conditions as previously noted several other factors can play a role in the identified trends in baseflow including surface and subsurface characteristics that influence the infiltration groundwater flow and discharge to surface waters the role of topographic and land use factors is beyond the scope of this work 4 1 changing cold season conditions consistent with observations from around the world climate change in canada is most pronounced in the colder northern regions bush lemmen 2019 in these regions changes to the timing of snowmelt and the prevalence and thickness of permafrost and ground ice due to increased temperatures are expected alter hydrologic partitioning and water volumes across these landscapes e g chen et al 2022 duan et al 2017 results from this work in northern canada are sparse because of a lack of long term gauge stations and because the streams freeze throughout the winter months however across canada identified baseflow trends in the winter and spring months are predominantly increasing trends fig 3 during these months canada receives snow as the dominant form of precipitation although there are increased incidences of mid winter melting periods and rain on snow events pavlovskii et al 2019 mid winter melting periods can contribute to increased baseflow as meltwater can infiltrate and induce increased discharge to streams warming trends across most of canada have caused observed declines in days of snow cover by 5 to 10 per decade due to later onset of snow cover and earlier melt time environment and climate change canada 2018 during the winter months and early spring december to march the observed baseflow trends are positively related to most climate predictors along the southern coastal and great lakes regions fig 6 we speculate that this is at least in part from increased temperature which allows rainfall to infiltrate through unfrozen ground and earlier mid season snow melt events 4 2 changing warm season conditions during summer months increases in temperature and precipitation have been observed across much of the country figs s7 s8 and baseflow was related positively to both temperature and precipitation fig 6 changes in warm season climate are likely affecting baseflow conditions through changes in evapotranspiration rates and recharge rates for example temperature was positively related to baseflow in the model formulations across much of the country during the winter and spring likely indicating that increased snow melt caused baseflow increases on the other hand during the late spring early summer in central canada baseflow and temperature were negatively related demonstrating that increased temperature and evapotranspiration may be driving decreases in baseflow fig 6 furthermore decreasing baseflow trends observed in southwestern canada and in southern northwest territories in the summer detected a positive relationship with precipitation and antecedent wetness and or negative relationships with temperature indicating that an arid climate during summer is likely contributing to decreases in baseflow drier climate can causes decreases in regional groundwater storage and increases losses from evapotranspiration condon et al 2020 wu et al 2020 4 3 seasonal transitions seasonal transitions i e timing and duration are important factors that influence baseflow volume and recession rates spring brings increased temperatures which melt snow and ice thus increasing surface water runoff infiltration and vegetative growth that increases evapotranspiration the opposite occurs in the fall when there is reduction in vegetation that causes decreases in evapotranspiration and a transition to more snow events and frozen soil across much of the country the magnitude of changes during these transitions such as the volume of snow cover that melt spring and decreases in vegetation fall affect hydrologic inputs that influence baseflow on the other hand the timing of these seasonal transitions can also shift the timing and distribution of baseflow across landscapes in the mid to late spring april and may the number of identified trends in baseflow significantly increased with widespread increases in baseflow in the prairie provinces these increasing trends may be a result of shifts in snow melt timing and volumes as indicated by antecedent wetness being selected as a common model predictor in the southern and central regions springtime decreasing trends were detected in the maritimes eastern canada during april and in the mid northwest northern parts of british columbia alberta and saskatchewan along with southern northwest territories in may precipitation and antecedent wetness showed a strong positive relationship with monthly baseflow in the maritimes during april signifying that dry weather e g decreased snowfall as indicated in fig s9 may be contributing to springtime decreases in this region it is also noted that this region had measured much less winter snow cover over the record period fig s9 which would reduce the water available to support baseflow during the spring melt furthermore the strong positive relationship with temperature in the winter may indicate earlier melting and depletion of snowpack from spring to fall mixed baseflow trends were observed in the far north yukon and northwest territories increases in baseflow seen predominantly in the yukon related positively with antecedent wetness precipitation and temperature our results indicate that heavier rainfall thicker snowpack warming and melting permafrost could be contributing to baseflow increases however the northwest territories and nunavut have experienced the bulk of northern precipitation increases and relatively smaller change in snow cover until summer months figs s8 s9 shrestha et al 2021 walvoord kurylyk 2016 reviewed research which related climate change melting permafrost and the expansion of northern subsurface flow pathways results indicated that permafrost thaw can enhance groundwater discharge to streams i e baseflow which supports our hypothesis that changes in permafrost expanse area contribute to the observed increasing baseflow trends reported here 4 4 possible role of anthropogenic activities about 27 of the identified baseflow trends did not select a meaningful climate predictor in their model formulations which indicates that other factors are driving changes in baseflow further non rhbn stations were found to be twice as likely to select no climate drivers as predictors compared to rhbn stations which indicates that anthropogenic activities are likely a dominant driver of baseflow changes observed here although the analysis of rhbn gages from non rhbn gages points to the effect of anthropogenic influence the inclusion of anthropogenic factors was beyond the scope of this work however previous studies have shown that pumping and land cover can have a significant impact on surface and subsurface flow ayers et al 2021a zipper et al 2022 and future work should take these factors into consideration 5 conclusions the objective of this study was to investigate long term baseflow trends and identify possible climatic drivers across canada thirty years of stream gage data was gathered from across canada to investigate changes in monthly baseflow monotonic trends were identified using the mann kendall test and gamlss statistical models were developed to identify the relationships between monthly climate predictors precipitation antecedent wetness and temperature and monthly baseflow changes in monthly baseflow varied across canada and throughout the year most trends were increasing but there were regions with notable decreasing trends such as the western provinces and the maritimes temporally increasing baseflow trends were observed across canada for each calendar month but decreasing trends were concentrated in warmer months june august of the three climate predictors antecedent wetness was selected most often in the model formulations 64 8 across all sites and month which highlights the importance of soil moisture in driving baseflow response precipitation was an important predictor of water availability as was observed from the positive relationship with baseflow throughout the year temperature was selected in model formulations but its relationship to baseflow depended on the season and location during the spring a positive relationship with baseflow was observed pointing to the role that snowmelt plays in increasing baseflow in the summer a negative relationship with temperature was observed likely because of increases in evapotranspiration in some regions including southwest canada and southern northwest territories baseflow decreased due to an overall drier climate including positive relationships with precipitation and antecedent wetness non rhbn stations were twice as likely as rhbn stations to have months which selected no climate predictors in their models indicating the need for further research to investigate the influence of anthropogenic activities on baseflow response there are several limitations in this study and several opportunities for future work firstly a lack of northern streamflow and weather station coverage prevented a thorough interpretation of trends and climatic drivers in that region winter streamflow is an inherently difficult observation to measure in a cold climate because the surface often freezes over in all but the most energetic streams future studies would would benefit from a denser network of permanent streamflow and weather stations furthermore there were predictors that were only assessed indirectly through temperature i e evapotranspiration and snowmelt because there was a lack of data availability for such parameters at the scale needed for this study the results reported here warrant further investigation to determine if human activity or other forces have caused changes in baseflow stations that selected no climate predictors in their model formula indicate that anthropogenic activities such as land use change groundwater extraction or water wastewater routing may be influencing changes in baseflow while these analyses are out of the scope of this work the results reported here can help direct future

2251,soil macropores impact water infiltration due to the complexity of macropore structure most macropore soil water dynamic simulations use simplified assumptions such as cylindrical shape macropores which do not well represent fluid flow in actual macropores in this study 3d digitalized structures of actual anecic earthworm burrows are obtained by combining tin casting with a 3d scanner the in situ earthworm burrows are imported into finite element numerical simulation software comsol based on simulations the effects of burrow spatial characteristics such as number n length l average diameter davg and tortuosity τ of partially penetrating non through and fully penetrating through burrows on water infiltration are clarified the n value of non through burrows correlates significantly with preferential flow infiltration rates r 1 in addition to the n value the l value of non through burrows is an important factor affecting preferential flow infiltration r 0 99 for the through earthworm burrows macroporosity εp is the best predictor of ksat unlike davg and l the τ of burrows has a low correlation coefficient with ksat the increase of adjacent infiltration is n dependent for non through burrows and is n independent for through burrows these findings demonstrate that actual macropore morphology can be used for numerical simulations which provides a new pathway forward for pore scale soil water dynamic research keywords 3d scanner comsol simulation earthworm burrows tin casting 3d structural characteristics water infiltration data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction as an important preferential flow pathway soil macropores play a pivotal role in soil hydrology as well as solute transport the importance of soil macropores has gained popularity among researchers germann and beven 1985 jarvis 2007 luo et al 2010 as preferential flow pathways soil macropores can rapidly transport water air and chemicals through the soil and promote root growth katuwal et al 2015 colombi et al 2017 in addition surface applied fertilizers and pesticides can be transported to deeper soils through macropores potentially reducing their use efficiency and contaminating groundwater coquet et al 2005 jarvis 2007 although accounting for only a small fraction of the total soil porosity luxmoore et al 1990 soil macropores play a central role in fluid flow and solute transport luo et al 2010 katuwal and larsbo 2014 earthworms are important soil fauna worldwide and good examples of soil bioturbators their burrows play a significant role in macropore related infiltration bottinelli et al 2015 soil macropores are composed of two main types of pores biological and non biological which differ in their ability to conduct water due to their 3d structural characteristics abou najm et al 2010 zhang et al 2019 gackiewicz et al 2022 in contrast to non biopores biopores are more capable of transporting water solutes and air katuwal and larsbo 2014 cheik et al 2021 also noted that the 3d structural characteristics of burrows produced by soil fauna are relatively unaffected by rainfall infiltration and dry wet cycles and have high structural stability and longevity under natural conditions bottinelli et al 2017 found that earthworm burrows once abandoned can persist for months in clay soils and even for years in sandy soils therefore biopores especially earthworm burrows are important for soil water dynamics research developing quantitative relationships between macropore geometry and soil hydraulic properties will further the understanding of water and solute transport ct scanning is emerging as an effective method to explore saturated hydraulic conductivity and permeability zhang et al 2019 köhne and mohanty 2005 used a novel apparatus with a cylindrical macropore in a repacked soil column to quantify preferential flow components in matrix domains macropore domains and interdomains arora et al 2011 designed soil columns by filling soil inside cylindrical caves with various artificial macropore densities to assess whether preferential flow was a function of their density urbina et al 2019 studied water movement in soils with non homogeneous artificial macropores and evaluated the performance of hydrus 1d and swap models however most of these experiments in disturbed soil were designed by assuming that the shape of macropores was cylindrical and they did not fully consider the characteristics of natural macropores such as tortuosity and connectivity bouché and al addan 1997 bastardie et al 2003 vervoort and cattle 2003 recently 3d printing techniques combined with μct were used to evaluate the role of actual soil pores in soil hydrodynamics and gas transport bacher et al 2015 dal ferro and morari 2015 lamandé et al 2020 however unlike the soil matrix 3d printing material could lead to unreliable results in present day soil science the use of 3d printed artificial soil is limited arrieta escobar et al 2020 casting methods have been used to extract soil macropore spatial structures abou najm et al 2010 wen et al 2022 compared to traditional casting methods e g liquid latex resin and plaster the tin casting method wen et al 2022 has the advantages of low volumetric shrinkage about 3 low coefficient of dynamic viscosity and high density 7 3 g cm3 alavi and passandideh fard 2011 gancarz et al 2011 3d scanners have been widely used in archaeological excavations and artifact restoration due to their high spatial resolution 5 um ease of operation and low experimental error kuzminsky and gardiner 2012 recently wen et al 2022 demonstrated that the combination of tin casting and 3d scanning could be used to reconstruct the 3d structure of actual earthworm burrows in order to assess the role of macropores on water transport and solute migration a quantitative relationship is needed between the 3d structural characteristics of macropores such as the diameter length and tortuosity of macropores and hydraulic parameters such as saturated hydraulic conductivity katuwal et al 2015 zhang et al 2019 because all of the above listed methods only quantify limited spatial structure characteristics there is a lack of agreement on the relationship between macropore porosity and saturated hydraulic conductivity ksat rasse et al 2000 luo et al 2010 the same is true for the relationship between tortuosity and ksat and macropore diameter and ksat as well allaire leung et al 2000b zhang et al 2019 the use of numerical simulation software such as comsol or ansys can help identify relationships between soil macropore structure parameters and soil hydraulic parameters liu et al 2006 sang et al 2020 when several factors contribute to a physical process the use of numerical simulation can separate the influence of each factor via sensitivity analysis this is an unmatchable advantage over other methods because of the cost of computing and the difficulty of treating irregular macropores and generating meshes liu et al 2006 most preferential flow simulation studies have mainly utilized simplified macropore structures xin et al 2016 zhou et al 2020 to our knowledge there is no 3d numerical simulation of water movement inside macropores based on realistic soil pore morphology because of the complicated spatial structure of macropores current numerical studies hydrus for example are mainly based on simplified structures such as cylinders urbina et al 2019 these simplified macropore models cannot accurately quantify the impact of actual soil macropores let alone effectively establish quantitative relationships between 3d structural characteristics of macropores and hydraulic conductivity comsol multiphysics a finite element based numerical simulation software with efficient computational performance and outstanding multi physics field coupling analysis capability has been widely used in the fields of geosciences liu and si 2011 chemical engineering and structural mechanics rosenbom et al 2014 khajepour and rahmani 2017 mao et al 2018 comsol has an advantage of being able to import 3d spatial structures with irregular boundaries by importing the reconstructed 3d irregular spatial mesh files of earthworm burrows into comsol it has the potential to quantify the roles of actual macropores on soil water infiltration processes this research explores a new method to quantitatively analyze the relationship between anecic earthworm burrow spatial characteristics and ksat by using the tin cast method and a 3d laser scanner we digitalized the 3d earthworm burrows we imported the spatial structures of burrows into comsol for numerical simulations by adjusting the diameter d length l and tortuosity τ as well as the number n of burrows we analyze separately the influence of each parameter finally we quantify the contributions of d l n or macroporosity εp and τ to soil water infiltration 2 experimental sites and methods 2 1 experimental sites for this study two sites were selected for earthworm burrow extractions the lvyuan experimental station ly 39 57 n 116 18 e and the shangzhuang experimental station sz 40 08 n 116 10 e both sites are situated on the north china pre mountain impact plain which is a warm temperate semi humid continental monsoon climate zone the climatic conditions at both sites are similar with an average annual temperature of 11 5 c and average annual precipitation of 640 mm rainfall mainly occurs between june and august spring maize and chinese cabbage are rotated annually at ly where the soil type is meadow brown with a silt loam texture and organic matter content of 10 5 g kg 1 rainfed sweet potatoes and winter wheat are rotated annually at sz where the soil type is tidal and the soil texture is sandy loam with an organic matter content of 6 4 g kg 1 2 2 extraction of earthworm burrow 3d structures 2 2 1 casting of earthworm burrows and earthworm species classification before extracting the 3d structure of earthworm burrows we used an electric shock method to determine earthworm population density and species level pelosi et al 2021 genetic sequencing results showed that the earthworm species at the ly site was predominantly metaphire vulgaris while the sz site was dominated by amynthas amis the number of earthworm burrows per square meter was 16 and 4 respectively see wen et al 2022 for details as shown in fig 1 visible open burrows at the soil surface are made by anecic earthworm species we randomly selected areas with earthworm burrows at both field sites to extract earthworm burrows first we cleaned off the earthworm feces as well as weeds stones and other debris around the holes then we used a butane heater to melt the tin stored in a stainless steel cup to about 300 c and poured it into each earthworm burrow finally after the tin cooled and solidified we excavated the complete cast of each earthworm burrow 2 2 2 3d reconstruction of the earthworm burrow tin castings we used the photographic 3d optical scanner okio 5m 3d scanner tianyuan 3d technology co ltd beijing china to digitize and 3d reconstruct the earthworm burrow tin castings the instrument consists of an industrial camera a tripod a calibration system and a data processing system when used the calibration block was first placed onto the workbench to calibrate the 3d scanner through its calibration system then the burrow casting was scanned to form a point cloud with the help of 3dscan finally the wormhole 3d structure was reconstructed by geomagic wrap north carolina usa the reconstruction process is shown in fig 2 and the detailed procedures can be found in wen et al 2022 2 3 comsol simulation we used the subsurface flow module of comsol multiphysics 6 0 comsol inc stockholm sweden to simulate soil water infiltration the model geometry consisted of two parts the macropore domain earthworm burrows and the soil matrix domain where the soil type of the matrix was sandy loam following akay et al 2008 and xin et al 2016 we define the macropore domain in the model as a super permeability zone and the hydraulic parameters of each part of the model are shown in table 1 soil water movement is modeled by the richards equation bear 1978 1 c m s e s h p t k h p d 0 where cm denotes specific water capacity m 1 se

elevation m which is positive upwards when h p t is equal to 0 eq 1 will reduce to steady state infiltration equation for saturated soil we can use the steady state approximation the relationship

build different cases for simulations where the matrix domain has a cylindrical geometry with a radius of 0 4 m and height of 0 5 m fig 3 a to investigate the effects of wormholes on water infiltration we simulated extreme rainfall scenarios i e thunderstorm or heavy rainfall conditions therefore a constant hydraulic head of 0 05 m was set at the soil surface the bottom boundary at a depth of 0 5 m was set as a free drainage boundary condition and the other boundaries were set as no flow boundary conditions hou and fan 2022 fig 3 c displays the model meshing with a much finer mesh in the macropore domain four scenarios were set up to simulate the effects of 3d macropore features on water infiltration see table 2 1 ntb n different numbers 1 7 of earthworm burrows were imported

on water infiltration we stretched the l value of all 13 burrows to 0 25 m and then imported them into the comsol software to build different cases for simulations where the matrix domain has a cylindrical geometry with a radius of 0 4 m and a height of 0 25 m for all simulations a constant head of 0 05 m was set at the soil surface with an initial condition of hydrostatic pressure distribution p ρgh the bottom boundary at a depth of 0 25 m was set as a free drainage boundary condition p 0 and the other boundaries were set as no flow boundary conditions four scenarios were set up to simulate the effects of 3d through burrow features on water infiltration see table 2 1 tb n n was set from 1 to 7 and davg was kept as the original values davg draw to simulate the relationship between the n of earthworm burrows and k sat 21 tb d n was set to 1 4 7 and davg was kept as the original values davg draw to simulate the relationship between the davg of earthworm burrows and k sat 3 tb τ n was set to 1 4 7 and davg was stretched to 0 01 m to simulate the relationship between the τ of earthworm burrows and ksat 4 εp εp and ksat of all cases in the above tb d and tb τ scenarios were calculated to establish a relationship between them 3 results and discussion 3 1 the 3d characteristics of reconstructed burrows after finishing tin casting and 3d reconstruction we selected 9 and 4 representative earthworm burrows at ly and sz respectively for study fig 4 a the davg of the burrows at the ly site ranged from 5 5 mm to 9 4 mm with the longest burrow being 245 mm the davg of burrows at the sz site ranged from 2 6 mm to 4 1 mm with the longest burrow being 195 mm due to soil particle blockage some of the earthworm burrows obtained by casting may not represent actual burrow length and this can also occur with ct scanning methods ma et al 2021 there was a clear difference in the davg of earthworm burrows between the two sites with the davg at the ly site being more than twice that at the sz site which could be due to a difference in earthworm species 3 2 demonstration of a comsol simulation we used the comsol to analyze the variations of hydraulic heads over time in the simulation cases with non through burrows n 1 in fig 5 a the hydraulic heads with time are plotted for five points from cases ntb n 6 and ntb n 11 with different distances from the center position respectively the hydraulic head gradually increased with time and stabilized at about 60 min the closer the location to the center the faster the hydraulic head rose and the greater the hydraulic head value at the time of stabilization the closer to the hydraulic head of the surface although the length of the burrow was 0 15 m in the two simulation cases there were differences in the hydraulic head values at the same location which was mainly related to the davg value of the burrow the davg of the burrow in case ntb n 6 was more than three times larger than that for case ntb n 11 and the larger the diameter the more pronounced the change in the hydraulic head in fig 5b the distributions of hydraulic heads in the middle profile of cases ntb n 1 and ntb n 9 are plotted at different times the 0 03 m hydraulic head contour kept moving downward as time increased moreover the presence of burrows contributed to the downward movement of soil water and affected the variation of the hydraulic head within the soil the longer burrows had more obvious effects the l of the burrow in case ntb n 1 was more than four times larger than that of case ntb n 9 the results of the comsol simulations were in agreement with the results of xin et al 2016 i e the presence of large pores significantly contributed to the downward shift in the hydraulic head contour 3 3 the effect of non through burrows on preferential flow as shown in fig 6 we calculated the infiltration fluxes in different cross sections of the 13 simulation cases n 7 davg draw l lraw after water infiltration had reached stability the mean infiltration fluxes for the different cross sections of all cases were about 6 61 10 3 kg s 1 and there were no significant differences in the total infiltration flux tif between the different sections p 0 05 as shown in fig 6a while the coefficients of variation for tifs in all cases at the cross section h 0 05 m were relatively small 5 9 the proportion of the infiltration fluxes from burrows i e the preferential flow infiltration flux pfif contributing to the tifs was significantly different 49 0 3 0 which was mainly influenced by the 3d structural characteristics of the burrows as shown in fig 6b c we found that the proportion of pfifs in some cases was already zero mainly because macropores are intercepted as the l of all burrows was less than 0 3 m the pfifs disappeared at cross section h 0 3 m fig 6d we will also explore the effect of 3d characteristics of non through burrows on the pfifs 3 3 1 the effect of earthworm burrow number n we chose to calculate the pfifs at cross section h 0 05 m to display the effect of macropore number or macropore porosity on preferential flow infiltration in fig 7 the pfifs kept increasing with the increase in the number of burrows due to the different sizes of all burrows the proportion of the pfifs in the tifs also varied the burrow in case ntb n 1 was the longest 0 245 m and when the n of the burrows increased from 1 to 7 the proportion of the pfifs in the tifs increased from 10 3 to 49 0 in contrast case ntb n 9 had the shortest burrow 0 05 m and the proportion of the pfif was only 3 1 n 7 at the same time the adjacent increment of pfifs defined as the pfif of n minus that of n 1 decreased continuously as the n of the burrows increased fig 8 which could be mainly dependent on the density of the burrows it was more obvious in the simulation cases with longer burrows such as cases ntb n 1 and ntb n 2 while it was not obvious in cases ntb n 9 and ntb n 13 with smaller burrow sizes the correlation coefficient between the number of burrows and the pfifs in the cross sections was analyzed to be close to 1 which was further evidence of the importance of the macropore number as an important factor affecting soil water infiltration an increase in the n of burrows must lead to an increase in the pfifs 3 3 2 the effect of earthworm burrow size davg and l by varying the values of davg and l we analyzed the influence of burrow size the variation of burrow tortuosity was ignored in this section to quantify the effect of l and davg on pfifs separately at first we stretched the davg of the burrows uniformly to 0 01 m fig 4b and then simulated the effect of the l on pfifs as shown in fig 9 we plot the variation of the pfifs at three cross sections h 0 05 m 0 1 m and 0 2 m in different simulation cases and their proportion in tifs respectively from fig 9a we can see that the pfifs gradually decreased with decreasing burrow length for all cases the pfif at the cross section h 0 05 m for the longest burrow case ntb l 1 l 0 245 m was 14 6 times larger than that for the shortest burrow case ntb l 9 l 0 06 m when the l of the burrows was above the cross section the pfifs dropped to zero fig 9d and 9g this indicated that the effect of the l on pfifs was significant r 0 99 measurements of the direct connectivity of large holes to subsurface drains reported by akay and fox 2007 in a physical experiment showed that the l of a large hole connected to the surface was important for drain connectivity alberti and cey 2011 in their analysis of the effects of macropore connectivity suggested that the l and continuity of a macropore could determine the degree of preferential flow similarly capowiez et al 2015 in their study of the morphology and function of earthworm burrows also noted a significant linear correlation between the l of earthworm burrows and water infiltration rates burrow diameter is another factor that affects water infiltration we imported the burrows shown in fig 4c into cosmol for simulations as shown in fig 9b we also plotted the variation of the pfifs with different simulation cases at three cross sections h 0 05 m 0 1 m and 0 2 m and their proportions compared to l variations in burrow davg had less effect on pfifs the pfifs of case ntb d 4 with the largest burrow davg 9 4 mm were 1 32 times h 0 05 m 1 34 times h 0 1 m and 1 37 times h 0 2 m larger than that of case ntb d 11 with the smallest burrow davg 3 0 mm respectively at the same time the proportion of the pfifs in the tifs decreased continuously as the depth of the cross section decreased statistical analysis indicated that the effect of davg on pfifs was significant r 0 96 in conclusion the diameter of the burrows had a relatively small effect on pfifs compared to the length which may be related to the connectivity of the burrows jarvis et al 2017 also indicated that the connectivity of large pores strongly influenced preferential flow sensitivity the role of through burrows is explored in section 3 4 3 3 3 the effects of earthworm burrow tortuosity to explore the influence of τ separate from the effects of both davg and l davg and l of all burrows were stretched to 0 01 m and 0 25 m respectively fig 4d the mean value of burrow τ was 1 08 0 07 with the largest burrow τ in case nbt τ 2 τ 1 20 and the smallest in case nbt τ 7 τ 1 00 from fig 9c we can see that the proportions of the pfifs varied in different simulation cases but the effect of τ was relatively small with the standard deviation of pfifs for the three cross sections being 4 5 10 4 kg s 1 h 0 05 m 4 3 10 4 kg s 1 h 0 1 m 3 6 10 4 kg s 1 h 0 2 m the correlation analysis also showed that the correlation between burrow tortuosity and the pfifs was relatively low r 0 37 compared with the davg and l of the burrows the contribution of the burrow τ to the pfifs was not as significant as davg and l the earthworm burrows measured by tin castings did not penetrate through the whole model soil due to their limited length lmax 0 245 m it led to the fact that the tifs of the different cross sections were mainly controlled by the hydraulic conductivity of the matrix soil and the inclusion of burrows had a limited effect on the tifs as described by allaire leung et al 2000a only highly continuous bio pores could effectively transport water or air and the inclusion of non through burrows had a limited effect on infiltration fluxes between different soil sections descriptions by van dam et al 2008 and tiktak et al 2012 indicated that macropores like ours that ended before the lower boundary were called internal catchments although these macropores could not transport water and air as quickly as through macropores they could still convey water into the soil interior which then moved into the deeper unsaturated matrix as shown in fig 3d and fig 5b high hydraulic heads close to surface heads occurred in the deeper parts of the soil due to the presence of burrows which facilitated the infiltration of surface water through the macropores into the deeper matrix domains meanwhile urbina et al 2019 also noted that water entering the internal catchment might also re infiltrate through the matrix into the macropores as described in the previous results any change in the 3d structural characteristics of burrows affected the pfifs at different cross sections when the davg n and l of burrows were set at 0 01 m 7 and 0 25 m respectively the percentage of pfif at h 0 05 m section exceeded 40 for all simulation cases indicating that more than 40 of the water passed through the burrows into the deeper soil layers moreover as water and solutes entering the soil through preferential flow channels greatly reduced the sorption time to soil particles non through burrows could also affect the efficiency of water and nutrient use while increasing the potential for downward migration rates of contaminants júnior et al 2004 tiktak et al 2012 3 4 the effect of through burrows on water infiltration to evaluate the effect of penetrating through burrows on water infiltration we rebuilt the simulation cases containing through burrows the simulation results showed that the inclusion of through burrows could significantly improve the soil water penetrability our simulation results also showed that when n was increased from 1 to 7 the ksat increased significantly 20 to 90 times in order to establish the relationship between ksat and 3d spatial structure of burrows we used εp to characterize ksat in through burrow simulations in fig 10 a the linear relationship between εp and ksat indicates a significant correlation between them r 0 96 we also include field data reported by other authors on the relationship between εp and ksat in fig 10b e among them rasse et al 2000 also concluded that ksat was significantly correlated with macroporosity r 0 90 when analyzing the effect of alfalfa root systems on soil hydraulic properties the results of luo et al 2010 indicated that macroporosity in agricultural soils estimated well the whole soil ksat r2 0 74 comsol simulation results were reliable compared to field data variations in ksat versus the n of burrows are presented in fig 11 the ksat of the simulation cases with through burrows increased linearly with the n and the adjacent increment of ksat and thus the adjacent increment of infiltration was nearly constant while no sign of any density dependence trends was observed this clearly differs from the results of non through burrows fig 8 of these cases tb n 4 and tb n 6 brought the largest gains probably mainly because the davg values of these two burrows were the largest tb n 4 davg 9 0 mm tb n 6 davg 9 4 mm in general our simulated results agree with the results from the references alberti and cey 2011 showed an almost linear relationship between infiltration volumes and the number of macropores in their tension infiltration experiments meanwhile ma et al 2021 in their study of the effect of earthworm density on water infiltration reached a similar conclusion that the number of macropores was positively and linearly related to soil water flux to further clarify the effects of 3d characteristics of non through burrows on soil hydraulic properties we also analyzed the relationship between davg and τ of burrows and ksat fig 12 the davg of the burrows better correlated with soil ksat than with dmax and dmin of the burrows r 0 93 meanwhile the dmin of the burrows was more predictive of the ksat than the dmax fig 12a as shown in fig 12b the correlation between τ of the burrows and the ksat of the soil was lower r 0 64 which could be related to the low level in the tortuosity of all burrows τmax 1 2 the effect of τ cannot be neglected and its importance needs further study allaire leung et al 2000b as stated by mossadeghi björklund et al 2016 connected macropores in soils strongly impacted water flow and solute transport the presence of through burrows could significantly alter the hydraulic properties of soil among them the porosity of through macropores was the best factor to predict ksat in the future we will use the casting technique to obtain 3d structures of earthworm burrows in additional soil types to further evaluate the method and research conclusions meanwhile in this study only earthworm burrows with openings at the soil surface were considered further studies are also needed to clarify the effects of the spatial features of buried burrows unopened at the soil surface on water infiltration 4 conclusions in this study we explored the possibility of using comsol to assess the influence of actual earthworm burrows on water infiltration processes and quantified the different effects of 3d spatial features d l n τ εp of earthworm burrows on water infiltration the results demonstrated that the method of digitalizing tin casting combined with comsol simulations quantified the effects of actual burrows on soil water movement the simulation results indicated that among the 3d features of non through burrows the length was the most important influencing factor the presence of through burrows significantly changed the soil permeability capacity the macroporosity of the through burrows was the best predictor of ksat r 0 96 compared to the maximum and minimum diameters of burrows the average diameter of burrows better predicted ksat r 0 93 compared with the diameter and length the tortuosity of burrows had a low correlation coefficient with ksat the simulation results also indicated that the effect of non through burrows on the total infiltration fluxes was less than that of through burrows credit authorship contribution statement jie zhang conceptualization formal analysis methodology software visualization

2251,soil macropores impact water infiltration due to the complexity of macropore structure most macropore soil water dynamic simulations use simplified assumptions such as cylindrical shape macropores which do not well represent fluid flow in actual macropores in this study 3d digitalized structures of actual anecic earthworm burrows are obtained by combining tin casting with a 3d scanner the in situ earthworm burrows are imported into finite element numerical simulation software comsol based on simulations the effects of burrow spatial characteristics such as number n length l average diameter davg and tortuosity τ of partially penetrating non through and fully penetrating through burrows on water infiltration are clarified the n value of non through burrows correlates significantly with preferential flow infiltration rates r 1 in addition to the n value the l value of non through burrows is an important factor affecting preferential flow infiltration r 0 99 for the through earthworm burrows macroporosity εp is the best predictor of ksat unlike davg and l the τ of burrows has a low correlation coefficient with ksat the increase of adjacent infiltration is n dependent for non through burrows and is n independent for through burrows these findings demonstrate that actual macropore morphology can be used for numerical simulations which provides a new pathway forward for pore scale soil water dynamic research keywords 3d scanner comsol simulation earthworm burrows tin casting 3d structural characteristics water infiltration data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction as an important preferential flow pathway soil macropores play a pivotal role in soil hydrology as well as solute transport the importance of soil macropores has gained popularity among researchers germann and beven 1985 jarvis 2007 luo et al 2010 as preferential flow pathways soil macropores can rapidly transport water air and chemicals through the soil and promote root growth katuwal et al 2015 colombi et al 2017 in addition surface applied fertilizers and pesticides can be transported to deeper soils through macropores potentially reducing their use efficiency and contaminating groundwater coquet et al 2005 jarvis 2007 although accounting for only a small fraction of the total soil porosity luxmoore et al 1990 soil macropores play a central role in fluid flow and solute transport luo et al 2010 katuwal and larsbo 2014 earthworms are important soil fauna worldwide and good examples of soil bioturbators their burrows play a significant role in macropore related infiltration bottinelli et al 2015 soil macropores are composed of two main types of pores biological and non biological which differ in their ability to conduct water due to their 3d structural characteristics abou najm et al 2010 zhang et al 2019 gackiewicz et al 2022 in contrast to non biopores biopores are more capable of transporting water solutes and air katuwal and larsbo 2014 cheik et al 2021 also noted that the 3d structural characteristics of burrows produced by soil fauna are relatively unaffected by rainfall infiltration and dry wet cycles and have high structural stability and longevity under natural conditions bottinelli et al 2017 found that earthworm burrows once abandoned can persist for months in clay soils and even for years in sandy soils therefore biopores especially earthworm burrows are important for soil water dynamics research developing quantitative relationships between macropore geometry and soil hydraulic properties will further the understanding of water and solute transport ct scanning is emerging as an effective method to explore saturated hydraulic conductivity and permeability zhang et al 2019 köhne and mohanty 2005 used a novel apparatus with a cylindrical macropore in a repacked soil column to quantify preferential flow components in matrix domains macropore domains and interdomains arora et al 2011 designed soil columns by filling soil inside cylindrical caves with various artificial macropore densities to assess whether preferential flow was a function of their density urbina et al 2019 studied water movement in soils with non homogeneous artificial macropores and evaluated the performance of hydrus 1d and swap models however most of these experiments in disturbed soil were designed by assuming that the shape of macropores was cylindrical and they did not fully consider the characteristics of natural macropores such as tortuosity and connectivity bouché and al addan 1997 bastardie et al 2003 vervoort and cattle 2003 recently 3d printing techniques combined with μct were used to evaluate the role of actual soil pores in soil hydrodynamics and gas transport bacher et al 2015 dal ferro and morari 2015 lamandé et al 2020 however unlike the soil matrix 3d printing material could lead to unreliable results in present day soil science the use of 3d printed artificial soil is limited arrieta escobar et al 2020 casting methods have been used to extract soil macropore spatial structures abou najm et al 2010 wen et al 2022 compared to traditional casting methods e g liquid latex resin and plaster the tin casting method wen et al 2022 has the advantages of low volumetric shrinkage about 3 low coefficient of dynamic viscosity and high density 7 3 g cm3 alavi and passandideh fard 2011 gancarz et al 2011 3d scanners have been widely used in archaeological excavations and artifact restoration due to their high spatial resolution 5 um ease of operation and low experimental error kuzminsky and gardiner 2012 recently wen et al 2022 demonstrated that the combination of tin casting and 3d scanning could be used to reconstruct the 3d structure of actual earthworm burrows in order to assess the role of macropores on water transport and solute migration a quantitative relationship is needed between the 3d structural characteristics of macropores such as the diameter length and tortuosity of macropores and hydraulic parameters such as saturated hydraulic conductivity katuwal et al 2015 zhang et al 2019 because all of the above listed methods only quantify limited spatial structure characteristics there is a lack of agreement on the relationship between macropore porosity and saturated hydraulic conductivity ksat rasse et al 2000 luo et al 2010 the same is true for the relationship between tortuosity and ksat and macropore diameter and ksat as well allaire leung et al 2000b zhang et al 2019 the use of numerical simulation software such as comsol or ansys can help identify relationships between soil macropore structure parameters and soil hydraulic parameters liu et al 2006 sang et al 2020 when several factors contribute to a physical process the use of numerical simulation can separate the influence of each factor via sensitivity analysis this is an unmatchable advantage over other methods because of the cost of computing and the difficulty of treating irregular macropores and generating meshes liu et al 2006 most preferential flow simulation studies have mainly utilized simplified macropore structures xin et al 2016 zhou et al 2020 to our knowledge there is no 3d numerical simulation of water movement inside macropores based on realistic soil pore morphology because of the complicated spatial structure of macropores current numerical studies hydrus for example are mainly based on simplified structures such as cylinders urbina et al 2019 these simplified macropore models cannot accurately quantify the impact of actual soil macropores let alone effectively establish quantitative relationships between 3d structural characteristics of macropores and hydraulic conductivity comsol multiphysics a finite element based numerical simulation software with efficient computational performance and outstanding multi physics field coupling analysis capability has been widely used in the fields of geosciences liu and si 2011 chemical engineering and structural mechanics rosenbom et al 2014 khajepour and rahmani 2017 mao et al 2018 comsol has an advantage of being able to import 3d spatial structures with irregular boundaries by importing the reconstructed 3d irregular spatial mesh files of earthworm burrows into comsol it has the potential to quantify the roles of actual macropores on soil water infiltration processes this research explores a new method to quantitatively analyze the relationship between anecic earthworm burrow spatial characteristics and ksat by using the tin cast method and a 3d laser scanner we digitalized the 3d earthworm burrows we imported the spatial structures of burrows into comsol for numerical simulations by adjusting the diameter d length l and tortuosity τ as well as the number n of burrows we analyze separately the influence of each parameter finally we quantify the contributions of d l n or macroporosity εp and τ to soil water infiltration 2 experimental sites and methods 2 1 experimental sites for this study two sites were selected for earthworm burrow extractions the lvyuan experimental station ly 39 57 n 116 18 e and the shangzhuang experimental station sz 40 08 n 116 10 e both sites are situated on the north china pre mountain impact plain which is a warm temperate semi humid continental monsoon climate zone the climatic conditions at both sites are similar with an average annual temperature of 11 5 c and average annual precipitation of 640 mm rainfall mainly occurs between june and august spring maize and chinese cabbage are rotated annually at ly where the soil type is meadow brown with a silt loam texture and organic matter content of 10 5 g kg 1 rainfed sweet potatoes and winter wheat are rotated annually at sz where the soil type is tidal and the soil texture is sandy loam with an organic matter content of 6 4 g kg 1 2 2 extraction of earthworm burrow 3d structures 2 2 1 casting of earthworm burrows and earthworm species classification before extracting the 3d structure of earthworm burrows we used an electric shock method to determine earthworm population density and species level pelosi et al 2021 genetic sequencing results showed that the earthworm species at the ly site was predominantly metaphire vulgaris while the sz site was dominated by amynthas amis the number of earthworm burrows per square meter was 16 and 4 respectively see wen et al 2022 for details as shown in fig 1 visible open burrows at the soil surface are made by anecic earthworm species we randomly selected areas with earthworm burrows at both field sites to extract earthworm burrows first we cleaned off the earthworm feces as well as weeds stones and other debris around the holes then we used a butane heater to melt the tin stored in a stainless steel cup to about 300 c and poured it into each earthworm burrow finally after the tin cooled and solidified we excavated the complete cast of each earthworm burrow 2 2 2 3d reconstruction of the earthworm burrow tin castings we used the photographic 3d optical scanner okio 5m 3d scanner tianyuan 3d technology co ltd beijing china to digitize and 3d reconstruct the earthworm burrow tin castings the instrument consists of an industrial camera a tripod a calibration system and a data processing system when used the calibration block was first placed onto the workbench to calibrate the 3d scanner through its calibration system then the burrow casting was scanned to form a point cloud with the help of 3dscan finally the wormhole 3d structure was reconstructed by geomagic wrap north carolina usa the reconstruction process is shown in fig 2 and the detailed procedures can be found in wen et al 2022 2 3 comsol simulation we used the subsurface flow module of comsol multiphysics 6 0 comsol inc stockholm sweden to simulate soil water infiltration the model geometry consisted of two parts the macropore domain earthworm burrows and the soil matrix domain where the soil type of the matrix was sandy loam following akay et al 2008 and xin et al 2016 we define the macropore domain in the model as a super permeability zone and the hydraulic parameters of each part of the model are shown in table 1 soil water movement is modeled by the richards equation bear 1978 1 c m s e s h p t k h p d 0 where cm denotes specific water capacity m 1 se

build different cases for simulations where the matrix domain has a cylindrical geometry with a radius of 0 4 m and height of 0 5 m fig 3 a to investigate the effects of wormholes on water infiltration we simulated extreme rainfall scenarios i e thunderstorm or heavy rainfall conditions therefore a constant hydraulic head of 0 05 m was set at the soil surface the bottom boundary at a depth of 0 5 m was set as a free drainage boundary condition and the other boundaries were set as no flow boundary conditions hou and fan 2022 fig 3 c displays the model meshing with a much finer mesh in the macropore domain four scenarios were set up to simulate the effects of 3d macropore features on water infiltration see table 2 1 ntb n different numbers 1 7 of earthworm burrows were imported into comsol for simulations 2 ntb d l was stretched to 0 25 m davg average diameter was kept as the original values davg draw and n was set to 7 3 ntb l davg was stretched to 0 01 m l was kept as the original values l lraw and n was set to 7 4 ntb τ davg and l were stretched to 0 01 m and 0 25 m respectively and n was set to 7 2 3 2 through burrows tb to investigate the effect of through burrows on water infiltration we stretched the l value of all 13 burrows to 0 25 m and then imported them into the comsol software to build different cases for simulations where the matrix domain has a cylindrical geometry with a radius of 0 4 m and a height of 0 25 m for all simulations a constant head of 0 05 m was set at the soil surface with an initial condition of hydrostatic pressure distribution p ρgh the bottom boundary at a depth of 0 25 m was set as a free drainage boundary condition p 0 and the other boundaries were set as no flow boundary conditions four scenarios were set up to simulate the effects of 3d through burrow features on water infiltration see table 2 1 tb n n was set from 1 to 7 and davg was kept as the original values davg draw to simulate the relationship between the n of earthworm burrows and k sat 21 tb d n was set to 1 4 7 and davg was kept as the original values davg draw to simulate the relationship between the davg of earthworm burrows and k sat 3 tb τ n was set to 1 4 7 and davg was stretched to 0 01 m to simulate the relationship between the τ of earthworm burrows and ksat 4 εp εp and ksat of all cases in the above tb d and tb τ scenarios were calculated to establish a relationship between them 3 results and discussion 3 1 the 3d characteristics of reconstructed burrows after finishing tin casting and 3d reconstruction we selected 9 and 4 representative earthworm burrows at ly and sz respectively for study fig 4 a the davg of the burrows at the ly site ranged from 5 5 mm to 9 4 mm with the longest burrow being 245 mm the davg of burrows at the sz site ranged from 2 6 mm to 4 1 mm with the longest burrow being 195 mm due to soil particle blockage some of the earthworm burrows obtained by casting may not represent actual burrow length and this can also occur with ct scanning methods ma et al 2021 there was a clear difference in the davg of earthworm burrows between the two sites with the davg at the ly site being more than twice that at the sz site which could be due to a difference in earthworm species 3 2 demonstration of a comsol simulation we used the comsol to analyze the variations of hydraulic heads over time in the simulation cases with non through burrows n 1 in fig 5 a the hydraulic heads with time are plotted for five points from cases ntb n 6 and ntb n 11 with different distances from the center position respectively the hydraulic head gradually increased with time and stabilized at about 60 min the closer the location to the center the faster the hydraulic head rose and the greater the hydraulic head value at the time of stabilization the closer to the hydraulic head of the surface although the length of the burrow was 0 15 m in the two simulation cases there were differences in the hydraulic head values at the same location which was mainly related to the davg value of the burrow the davg of the burrow in case ntb n 6 was more than three times larger than that for case ntb n 11 and the larger the diameter the more pronounced the change in the hydraulic head in fig 5b the distributions of hydraulic heads in the middle profile of cases ntb n 1 and ntb n 9 are plotted at different times the 0 03 m hydraulic head contour kept moving downward as time increased moreover the presence of burrows contributed to the downward movement of soil water and affected the variation of the hydraulic head within the soil the longer burrows had more obvious effects the l of the burrow in case ntb n 1 was more than four times larger than that of case ntb n 9 the results of the comsol simulations were in agreement with the results of xin et al 2016 i e the presence of large pores significantly contributed to the downward shift in the hydraulic head contour 3 3 the effect of non through burrows on preferential flow as shown in fig 6 we calculated the infiltration fluxes in different cross sections of the 13 simulation cases n 7 davg draw l lraw after water infiltration had reached stability the mean infiltration fluxes for the different cross sections of all cases were about 6 61 10 3 kg s 1 and there were no significant differences in the total infiltration flux tif between the different sections p 0 05 as shown in fig 6a while the coefficients of variation for tifs in all cases at the cross section h 0 05 m were relatively small 5 9 the proportion of the infiltration fluxes from burrows i e the preferential flow infiltration flux pfif contributing to the tifs was significantly different 49 0 3 0 which was mainly influenced by the 3d structural characteristics of the burrows as shown in fig 6b c we found that the proportion of pfifs in some cases was already zero mainly because macropores are intercepted as the l of all burrows was less than 0 3 m the pfifs disappeared at cross section h 0 3 m fig 6d we will also explore the effect of 3d characteristics of non through burrows on the pfifs 3 3 1 the effect of earthworm burrow number n we chose to calculate the pfifs at cross section h 0 05 m to display the effect of macropore number or macropore porosity on preferential flow infiltration in fig 7 the pfifs kept increasing with the increase in the number of burrows due to the different sizes of all burrows the proportion of the pfifs in the tifs also varied the burrow in case ntb n 1 was the longest 0 245 m and when the n of the burrows increased from 1 to 7 the proportion of the pfifs in the tifs increased from 10 3 to 49 0 in contrast case ntb n 9 had the shortest burrow 0 05 m and the proportion of the pfif was only 3 1 n 7 at the same time the adjacent increment of pfifs defined as the pfif of n minus that of n 1 decreased continuously as the n of the burrows increased fig 8 which could be mainly dependent on the density of the burrows it was more obvious in the simulation cases with longer burrows such as cases ntb n 1 and ntb n 2 while it was not obvious in cases ntb n 9 and ntb n 13 with smaller burrow sizes the correlation coefficient between the number of burrows and the pfifs in the cross sections was analyzed to be close to 1 which was further evidence of the importance of the macropore number as an important factor affecting soil water infiltration an increase in the n of burrows must lead to an increase in the pfifs 3 3 2 the effect of earthworm burrow size davg and l by varying the values of davg and l we analyzed the influence of burrow size the variation of burrow tortuosity was ignored in this section to quantify the effect of l and davg on pfifs separately at first we stretched the davg of the burrows uniformly to 0 01 m fig 4b and then simulated the effect of the l on pfifs as shown in fig 9 we plot the variation of the pfifs at three cross sections h 0 05 m 0 1 m and 0 2 m in different simulation cases and their proportion in tifs respectively from fig 9a we can see that the pfifs gradually decreased with decreasing burrow length for all cases the pfif at the cross section h 0 05 m for the longest burrow case ntb l 1 l 0 245 m was 14 6 times larger than that for the shortest burrow case ntb l 9 l 0 06 m when the l of the burrows was above the cross section the pfifs dropped to zero fig 9d and 9g this indicated that the effect of the l on pfifs was significant r 0 99 measurements of the direct connectivity of large holes to subsurface drains reported by akay and fox 2007 in a physical experiment showed that the l of a large hole connected to the surface was important for drain connectivity alberti and cey 2011 in their analysis of the effects of macropore connectivity suggested that the l and continuity of a macropore could determine the degree of preferential flow similarly capowiez et al 2015 in their study of the morphology and function of earthworm burrows also noted a significant linear correlation between the l of earthworm burrows and water infiltration rates burrow diameter is another factor that affects water infiltration we imported the burrows shown in fig 4c into cosmol for simulations as shown in fig 9b we also plotted the variation of the pfifs with different simulation cases at three cross sections h 0 05 m 0 1 m and 0 2 m and their proportions compared to l variations in burrow davg had less effect on pfifs the pfifs of case ntb d 4 with the largest burrow davg 9 4 mm were 1 32 times h 0 05 m 1 34 times h 0 1 m and 1 37 times h 0 2 m larger than that of case ntb d 11 with the smallest burrow davg 3 0 mm respectively at the same time the proportion of the pfifs in the tifs decreased continuously as the depth of the cross section decreased statistical analysis indicated that the effect of davg on pfifs was significant r 0 96 in conclusion the diameter of the burrows had a relatively small effect on pfifs compared to the length which may be related to the connectivity of the burrows jarvis et al 2017 also indicated that the connectivity of large pores strongly influenced preferential flow sensitivity the role of through burrows is explored in section 3 4 3 3 3 the effects of earthworm burrow tortuosity to explore the influence of τ separate from the effects of both davg and l davg and l of all burrows were stretched to 0 01 m and 0 25 m respectively fig 4d the mean value of burrow τ was 1 08 0 07 with the largest burrow τ in case nbt τ 2 τ 1 20 and the smallest in case nbt τ 7 τ 1 00 from fig 9c we can see that the proportions of the pfifs varied in different simulation cases but the effect of τ was relatively small with the standard deviation of pfifs for the three cross sections being 4 5 10 4 kg s 1 h 0 05 m 4 3 10 4 kg s 1 h 0 1 m 3 6 10 4 kg s 1 h 0 2 m the correlation analysis also showed that the correlation between burrow tortuosity and the pfifs was relatively low r 0 37 compared with the davg and l of the burrows the contribution of the burrow τ to the pfifs was not as significant as davg and l the earthworm burrows measured by tin castings did not penetrate through the whole model soil due to their limited length lmax 0 245 m it led to the fact that the tifs of the different cross sections were mainly controlled by the hydraulic conductivity of the matrix soil and the inclusion of burrows had a limited effect on the tifs as described by allaire leung et al 2000a only highly continuous bio pores could effectively transport water or air and the inclusion of non through burrows had a limited effect on infiltration fluxes between different soil sections descriptions by van dam et al 2008 and tiktak et al 2012 indicated that macropores like ours that ended before the lower boundary were called internal catchments although these macropores could not transport water and air as quickly as through macropores they could still convey water into the soil interior which then moved into the deeper unsaturated matrix as shown in fig 3d and fig 5b high hydraulic heads close to surface heads occurred in the deeper parts of the soil due to the presence of burrows which facilitated the infiltration of surface water through the macropores into the deeper matrix domains meanwhile urbina et al 2019 also noted that water entering the internal catchment might also re infiltrate through the matrix into the macropores as described in the previous results any change in the 3d structural characteristics of burrows affected the pfifs at different cross sections when the davg n and l of burrows were set at 0 01 m 7 and 0 25 m respectively the percentage of pfif at h 0 05 m section exceeded 40 for all simulation cases indicating that more than 40 of the water passed through the burrows into the deeper soil layers moreover as water and solutes entering the soil through preferential flow channels greatly reduced the sorption time to soil particles non through burrows could also affect the efficiency of water and nutrient use while increasing the potential for downward migration rates of contaminants júnior et al 2004 tiktak et al 2012 3 4 the effect of through burrows on water infiltration to evaluate the effect of penetrating through burrows on water infiltration we rebuilt the simulation cases containing through burrows the simulation results showed that the inclusion of through burrows could significantly improve the soil water penetrability our simulation results also showed that when n was increased from 1 to 7 the ksat increased significantly 20 to 90 times in order to establish the relationship between ksat and 3d spatial structure of burrows we used εp to characterize ksat in through burrow simulations in fig 10 a the linear relationship between εp and ksat indicates a significant correlation between them r 0 96 we also include field data reported by other authors on the relationship between εp and ksat in fig 10b e among them rasse et al 2000 also concluded that ksat was significantly correlated with macroporosity r 0 90 when analyzing the effect of alfalfa root systems on soil hydraulic properties the results of luo et al 2010 indicated that macroporosity in agricultural soils estimated well the whole soil ksat r2 0 74 comsol simulation results were reliable compared to field data variations in ksat versus the n of burrows are presented in fig 11 the ksat of the simulation cases with through burrows increased linearly with the n and the adjacent increment of ksat and thus the adjacent increment of infiltration was nearly constant while no sign of any density dependence trends was observed this clearly differs from the results of non through burrows fig 8 of these cases tb n 4 and tb n 6 brought the largest gains probably mainly because the davg values of these two burrows were the largest tb n 4 davg 9 0 mm tb n 6 davg 9 4 mm in general our simulated results agree with the results from the references alberti and cey 2011 showed an almost linear relationship between infiltration volumes and the number of macropores in their tension infiltration experiments meanwhile ma et al 2021 in their study of the effect of earthworm density on water infiltration reached a similar conclusion that the number of macropores was positively and linearly related to soil water flux to further clarify the effects of 3d characteristics of non through burrows on soil hydraulic properties we also analyzed the relationship between davg and τ of burrows and ksat fig 12 the davg of the burrows better correlated with soil ksat than with dmax and dmin of the burrows r 0 93 meanwhile the dmin of the burrows was more predictive of the ksat than the dmax fig 12a as shown in fig 12b the correlation between τ of the burrows and the ksat of the soil was lower r 0 64 which could be related to the low level in the tortuosity of all burrows τmax 1 2 the effect of τ cannot be neglected and its importance needs further study allaire leung et al 2000b as stated by mossadeghi björklund et al 2016 connected macropores in soils strongly impacted water flow and solute transport the presence of through burrows could significantly alter the hydraulic properties of soil among them the porosity of through macropores was the best factor to predict ksat in the future we will use the casting technique to obtain 3d structures of earthworm burrows in additional soil types to further evaluate the method and research conclusions meanwhile in this study only earthworm burrows with openings at the soil surface were considered further studies are also needed to clarify the effects of the spatial features of buried burrows unopened at the soil surface on water infiltration 4 conclusions in this study we explored the possibility of using comsol to assess the influence of actual earthworm burrows on water infiltration processes and quantified the different effects of 3d spatial features d l n τ εp of earthworm burrows on water infiltration the results demonstrated that the method of digitalizing tin casting combined with comsol simulations quantified the effects of actual burrows on soil water movement the simulation results indicated that among the 3d features of non through burrows the length was the most important influencing factor the presence of through burrows significantly changed the soil permeability capacity the macroporosity of the through burrows was the best predictor of ksat r 0 96 compared to the maximum and minimum diameters of burrows the average diameter of burrows better predicted ksat r 0 93 compared with the diameter and length the tortuosity of burrows had a low correlation coefficient with ksat the simulation results also indicated that the effect of non through burrows on the total infiltration fluxes was less than that of through burrows credit authorship contribution statement jie zhang conceptualization formal analysis methodology software visualization

2252,with the aim of deepening our understanding of deep seated fluids upwelling and mixing in large regional aquifers we performed a hydrogeochemical study of twenty two springs in the contursi area upper sele river valley southern apennines by means of the measurements of chemical physical parameters major ions trace elements and stable and radioactive isotopes besides we realized two updated geo structural cross sections in order to reconstruct the groundwater flowpath in the study area the hydrogeochemical composition as well as the water temperature allow to identify three main groups of groundwater cold and low salinity groundwater clgw intermediate salinity groundwater isgw and thermal salinity groundwater tsgw the clgw group mostly emerging at the boundary of carbonate aquifers is characterized by alkaline earth bicarbonate hydrofacies instead isgw and tsgw situated in the inner zone of the valley show gradually a hydrogeochemical evolution towards sodium chloride type hydrofacies domain with the highest salinity value stable isotope δ18o δd of clgw reveal the local meteoric origin of groundwater while isotopic signatures of isgw and tsgw is associated with the deep fluids inflow clgw hydrogeochemistry is clearly related to dissolution of carbonate rocks on the other hand for isgw and tsgw an additional contribution from evaporitic rocks is supported by saturation indices values gypsum and anhydrite and validated by isotopic signature of dissolved sulphate δ34s δ18o the application of two models based on tritium data i e the piston flow and well

hydrogeochemistry faults data availability all data are freely available 1 introduction the investigation of crustal scale groundwater flow is one of the most demanding challenges for hydrogeochemistry and hydrogeological scientists groundwater hydrogeochemistry is the result of many simultaneous processes involving the water rock gas system that include weathering dissolution precipitation ion exchange redox reactions sorption gas generation and consumption and other mechanisms freeze and cherry 1979 matthess 1982 deutsch 2020 the occurrence of these processes and their extent are strictly related to some hydrogeological factors such as i the nature of the aquifer system e g both the lithology of host rocks and the water type i e meteoric marine or magmatic ii the length and depth of groundwater flowpath iii the groundwater residence time iv the presence and the location of tectonic features e g faults and fractures which can enhance groundwater mixing and deep fluids upwelling andreo et al 2016 gil márquez et al 2017 therefore water geochemistry is telling us a long and complex story that groundwater undergoes in the brittle crust sibson et al 1975 goldscheider et al 2010 doglioni et al 2014 smeraglia et al 2018 the scale of groundwater flow both in terms of depth and width is mainly affected by the continuity of aquifer systems hydraulic gradient between the recharge area and the discharge one and by the presence of regional tectonic structures toth 1995 de vries and simmers 2002 cook 2003 chen and goldscheider 2014 in detail high hydraulic gradient can cause deepening of flowpaths in the aquifer that can lead groundwater up to some kilometres below the topographic surface according to the local geothermal gradient groundwater gets higher temperature and thus can rise convectively mainly along faults minissale 1991 qiu et al 2018 yang et al 2019 in this complex hydro geostructural framework the ascending of endogenous

groundwater in the sele river valley is addressed to many different uses for instance fresh springs directly fed by carbonate aquifers are tapped for drinking purposes and the mineralized and thermal

mechanism of water salinization c to calculate the reservoir temperature using classical geothermometric approaches d to propose a conceptual model of fluids flowpath through the construction of two

offer a relevant preliminary tool in order to define the relationship between stress field variations pore pressure evolution at depth in a seismically active area 2 geological and hydrogeological setting the study area is located in the southern apennines which is part of a mountain chain that develops from the southern abruzzi alto molise region to sicily crossing the calabrian arc malinverno and ryan 1986 doglioni 1991 patacca and scandone 2007 from a geodynamic point of view the southern apennines are an east verging fold and thrust belt related to the subduction of the apulian lithosphere towards west doglioni 1995 faccenna et al 2001 starting from middle upper pleistocene the axial zone of the chain raised and an extensional tectonic developed in nw se direction responsible of the formation of seismogenic faults up to 15 km deep the southern apennines are characterized by a series of superimposed tectonic units constituted by a deep seated carbonate duplex system belonging to the so called apennine carbonates characterized by shallow water deformed carbonates and overlained by basinal sequences belonging to lagonegro units patacca and scandone 2007 ciarcia et al 2009 pierdominici et al 2011 vitale and ciarcia 2018 low angle thrust faults separate the apennine carbonates in the hanging wall from the lagonegro units in the footwall the apennine accretionary wedge is tectonically superimposed onto the buried apulian platform which is characterized by the presence of folds that form hydrocarbon and co2 geological traps shiner et al 2004 generating overpressured reservoirs geophysical studies carried out in this sector of apennines amoroso et al 2014 improta et al 2014 shed light on a diffused high vp vs ratio within the fractured apulian platform carbonates between 5 and 10 km depth where intense microseismicity occurs this seismic imaging from p and s waves velocity models suggests deep seated fluid accumulation i e mixtures of brine and or co2 in a wide rock volume below the study area amoroso et al 2017 de landro et al 2022 this study focuses on the sele river valley situated in the central portion of the southern apennine precisely in the irpinia region commonly the structural pattern of the upper sele river valley has been interpreted as a ns trending graben ortolani 1975 cotecchia 1986 coppola and pescatore 1989 where the main tectonic discontinuities border the high relief massifs made of mesozoic carbonate rocks located to the west and east of the sele river valley i e the picentini mts and mt marzano ogna respectively merlini and mostardini 1986 wasowski et al 2002 from a seismological standpoint the ongoing crustal extension regime is responsible for the high seismicity of the southern apennines in particular the study area represents an interesting site for seismologists since it is considered one of the areas in southern apennines with the highest seismogenic potential slejko et al 1998 it was struck by the recent strong 1980 mw 6 9 irpinia earthquake bernard and zollo 1989 ascione et al 2020 that occur few kilometres away from contursi village the area is currently affected by background seismicity with the most of seismic events occurring along the 1980 irpinia deep seated ruptures de matteis et al 2012 with prevailing normal faulting focal mechanisms pierdominici et al 2011 the hydrogeological setting of the southern apennines is characterized by meso cenozoic carbonates that act as huge karst aquifers bounded by low permeability deposits i e aquitards and or aquicludes such as syn orogenic siliciclastic marine deposits or messinian evaporites boni et al 1986 celico et al 2006 the upper sele river valley is bordered to east and west by two carbonate mountain ranges mt marzano ogna and picentini mts respectively fig 1 they constitute two main aquifers of the study area because of their large volume and high hydraulic conductivity enhanced by diffuse fracturing and intense karst processes celico and civita 1976 wasowski et al 2002 they fed several springs located along their fault boundaries where aquicludes of turbidite deposits are in direct contact with carbonate rocks budetta et al 1988 the picentini mts constitute a 600 km2 wide large karst system and encompass four large mountain groups corniello et al 2010 recognized as different hydrogeological basins among these basins the mt polveracchio aquifer fig 1 is characterized by a complex geo structural setting that affects groundwater flowpaths strictly constrained by tectonic discontinuities celico et al 1987 along the northern and north eastern margin the hydrogeological limit consists of a fault between acerno and calabritto localities where the main groundwater outlet is the acquara ponticchio spring s1 along the western margin the boundary is represented by a fault system separating mt accellica from mt polveracchio further south the polveracchio basin is buffered by impermeable lithotypes of the lagonegro units fig 1 see legend unit 7 corniello et al 2010 finally along the eastern margin in the upper valley of the sele river the boundary consists of a tectonic thrusting front where many cold springs i e s2 s3 s5 s6 are located through a deeper and longer circuit groundwater feeds very mineralized springs in the inner zone of the sele river valley i e contursi terme and bagni di contursi springs from s15 to s22 celico et al 1979 celico 1983 by crossing carbonate substrate covered by terrigenous deposits 3 material and analytical methods 3 1 sampling field and laboratory analysis a sampling survey of twenty two springs was carried out in may 2021 fig 1 water samples for major minor and trace elements analyses were filtered with 0 45 μm membrane filters and to keep metals in solution the latter were acidified on site with ultrapure hno3 to ph 2 water samples for isotopic analyses δ18o h2o δd h2o 3h h2o δ34s so4 and δ18o so4 were collected without treatments they were sampled into high density polyethylene bottles and stored at low temperatures in ice filled fridge boxes to avoid alterations of chemical components electrical conductivity ec measured at 25 c temperature t and ph were directly measured in situ using the multiparametric probe wtw multi 3420 with accuracies of 1 μs cm 0 1 c and 0 01 ph unit respectively anions and cations were determined by ion chromatography at the geochemistry laboratory of the department of earth sciences at sapienza university of rome chromatographs dionex ics 5000 and dionex ics 1100 were used to analyse anions f cl so4 2 and no3 and cations ca2 mg2 na and k respectively bicarbonate ions were measured by titration with 0 05 n hcl solution as titrating agent and methyl orange as indicator ionic balance error checked on each sample was within 5 baird et al 2017 dissolved sio2 was measured by vis spectrophotometry upon reaction with ammonium molybdate in acid media and treatment with oxalic acid to form a yellow silicomolybdate complex whose absorbance was read at 410 nm nollet 2007 samples for trace elements were analysed using an icp ms spectrometer x series 2 thermo fisher scientific waltham ma usa blanks standard solutions and sample dilutions were prepared by using ultrapure water millipore milli q 16 mw cm and an internal standard rh was added to correct the icp ms instrumental drift the analytical accuracy of this method ranges between 2 and 5 measurements of the water stable isotope ratios δ18o and δd and the sulphur and oxygen isotopic composition in dissolved sulphate δ34s so4 and δ18o so4 are expressed in terms of delta units units relative to the vienna standard mean ocean water v smow and vienna canyon diablo troilite v cdt standards respectively tritium 3h content was determined by an electrolytic enrichment and liquid scintillation counting method and it is reported in tu tritium unit these analyses were performed only on some springs i e s2 s4 s7 s9 s10 s16 s17 s18 s21 at it2e isotope tracer technologies europe srl in milan italy the speciation software phreeqc interactive 3 6 2 parkhurst and appelo 2013 was used to calculate saturation index s i 3 2 calculation of mean residence time of groundwater tritium 3h is a natural radioactive isotope of hydrogen its short half life is of 12 32 years that can be used as a tracer for determining the groundwater age due to the increase and decrease of this radionuclide in rainwater during atmospheric nuclear weapons testing in the 1945 1963 s it is often used to differentiate groundwater recharged before and after the early 1950 s mcmahon 2012 groundwater age is useful to estimate recharge rates wang et al 2008 to propose hydrogeochemistry models on the fluid circulation sanford 2011 apollaro et al 2015 and to infer information on the vulnerability of aquifers to contamination by anthropogenic activities at the land surface raco et al 2022 the dating of groundwater assumes that the tritium activity at the time of recharge is known and that the measured value in water sample corresponds only to the radioactive decay the estimation of the mean residence time of groundwater was obtained by adopting two end member models i e the piston flow and the well mixed reservoir the piston flow model assumes absence of mixing along the whole water flowpath from the recharge area to discharge one contrarily the well mixed reservoir model assumes complete mixing between the water entering the reservoir and the water already stored into it shevenell and goff 1995 apollaro et al 2015 apollaro et al 2016 to link tritium content of groundwater to its mean residence time it was necessary to take into account tritium data of local rainwaters from the iaea wmo stations iaea wmo 2013 and from the global network of isotopes in precipitation gnip in italy and europe about 2000 values of rainwaters from 1953 to 2019 have been used in order to define tritium contents as a function of time the dataset shows a sudden increase in tritium values in 1961 1963 and then a gradual decrease until reaching constant values around 8 5 tritium unit in recent years tritium time plot is reported in fig s1 as described by apollaro et al 2015 2016 the required input functions calculated in the dataset in different number of segments have been defined and applied for two different models the piston flow and the well mixed reservoir in the equations proposed by shevenell and goff 1995 linking the output tritium concentration at time t to the mean residence time of water in the geothermal reservoir 3 3 geothermometers the classical method used to calculate the reservoir temperature is chemical geothermometry consisting of the use of different empiric or experimental calibrations based on temperature dependent heterogeneous chemical reactions many geothermometric techniques have been proposed through the years for different geochemical and geological settings fournier 1977 fournier and potter 1979 fouillac and michard 1981 arnórsson et al 1983 marini et al 1986 giggenbach 1988 chiodini et al 1995a chiodini et al 1995b battistel et al 2014 it is known that chemical geothermometers are based on some theoretical assumptions i water is in equilibrium with host rocks as such water is saturated by the mineral phases governing the geothermometer and ii the waters neither re equilibrate nor mix with shallow circulating fluids during the ascent towards the surface the silica geothermometers sio2 chalcedony and sio2 quartz truesdell 1976 fournier 1977 and cation geothermometers k mg giggenbach 1988 fournier 1979 fournier and truesdell 1973 were employed in this study 3 4 geological cross section construction to achieve the goal of this study also two orthogonal schematic geological sections were made in order to reconstruct the fluids flowpaths down to 5 km depth below the surface both the cross sections fall within the sele river valley the first one is a w e section a a and the second one is a ns section b b see fig 1 these sections have been realized by using as reference the foglio 468 eboli which is a geological map of the carg cartografia geologica project on a scale of 1 50 000 fig 1 shows the tectonic scheme obtained from the above mentioned map regarding the reference elevation model the dem

197 and 229 mv isgw belongs to ca mg hco3 hydrofacies like clgw a third group of thermal and saline groundwater hereafter tsgw includes samples from s15 to s22 see table 1 in detail tsgw group is brackish type water according to the classification of drever 1997 having ec values from 2560 to 6470 µs cm the latter are thermal with t values between 25 and 47 c slightly acidic ph values from 6 2 to 6 4 and have negative eh values up to 285 mv furthermore they are characterized by a na hco3 cl composition fig 4 and show a marked enrichment in sulphate respect to other groups table 1 these waters show a bubbling gas phase and have high dissolved co2 values too italiano et al 2000 no3 values are generally very low at times ranging from below the detection limit from 0 18 to 4 15 mg l s20 and did not show significant differences among the three groups among minor and trace elements f li b rb sr cs sio2 and ba tsgw show the highest concentrations up to three orders of magnitude higher than clgw and isgw groups the δ18o h2o and δd h2o values measured in nine samples three of clgw group two of isgw group and four of tsgw group table 2 range from 8 5 to 6 3 and from 50 to 38 respectively the δ34s so4 and δ18o so4 values measured in six samples belonging to isgw and tsgw groups show the following range values from 5 3 to 8 4 and from 9 7 to 21 9 for δ18o and for δ34s respectively finally tritium content is between 1 and 2 3 tu see table 2 measured in nine water samples 4 2 geo structural interpretation with the aim of furnishing a model for groundwater and deep fluids flowpaths and to reconstruct the geological scheme of the sele river valley we realized two schematic geological cross sections both longitudinally and transversally with respect to the location of thermal springs and to the vergence of the apennines fold and thrust belt as well as a stratigraphic column down to a depth of about 5 km fig 2 in the central part of the a a section fig 2 the so called valle del sele tectonic unit results to be the geometrically highest unit in the area overlying the carbonate tectonic unit with a maximum thickness of about 400 m the valle del sale tectonic unit is characterized from bottom to top by the presence of clayey units interspersed with marly limestones clayey limestones and arenaceous marl di nocera et al 2016 the lower unit is the so called carbonate tectonic unit with a maximum thickness of about 3500 m it outcrops in picentini mts and in mt castello the western and eastern part of the a a cross section respectively and also in the structural highs of oliveto citra and mt pruno it consists of mesozoic carbonates deposited in an interval between the triassic and the cretaceous and generated in a transition sector between the carbonate shelf edge and the lagonegro basin di nocera et al 2016 at the bottom of the carbonates there are dolomitic successions the picentini mts were generated by the e verging thrust front while the back thrust and the respective splays that dissects the carbonate units in the eastern part are responsible for the presence of the oliveto citra and mt pruno highs see fig 2 these tectonic structures have been also recognized in the videpi seismic line 1 84 pa 1 see location in fig 1 the unresolved western part of the a a section is due to the uncertainty given by the huge vertical displacement that involved the lagonegrese tectonic unit fig 2 in the b b section both the valle del sele tectonic unit and the carbonate tectonic unit are covered at times by the synorogenic unit in erosive and disconformable contact fig 2 in the northern part of the section a lateral ramp tectonically underlying to the carbonate tectonic unit is constituted by the carbonates of monti della maddalena tectonic unit di nocera et al 2016 with a maximum thickness of about 2000 m fig 2 at the bottom it is constituted by the presence of an intensely fractured dolomitic succession from upper triassic to lower jurassic at the top it consists of a carbonate platform succession from the lower jurassic to the upper miocene the lagonegrese tectonic unit is mainly represented by mesozoic clayey deposits of deep sea environment and at the top by flysch deposits in this area the maximum thickness of the lagonegrese tectonic unit is about 2000 m the tectonic contact between the lagonegrese unit and the apulian carbonates is found at a depth of 4286 m in the acerno 001 well see location in fig 1 this well falls in the campagna tectonic window which testifies the presence of a tectonic doubling of the lagonegrese units patacca 2007 that could justify the shallow depth of these units in the western part of the cross section the doubling of the lagonegrese units is also due to the sandwiching of the mt croce tectonic unit which outcrops in the western part of the study area fig 1 but it is not in the area of sampling and is not crossed by the geological sections the presence of the evaporitic messinian gessoso solfifera formation mainly constituted by gypsum and clays with a thickness of about 80 m is also reported the geometrically deepest tectonic unit recognizable in the area is represented by the apulian carbonates up to at least 5 km in depth it is constituted by shallow water mesozoic tertiary platform carbonates as shown in both sections regarding the tectonic discontinuities a deep normal fault crosses both the messinian gessoso solfifera formation and the apulian carbonates it is supposed to be responsible for playing a crucial role in the uprising of deep fluids towards the surface in the area of bagni di contursi fig 2 overall carbonate units are the most common in the area and represent both the edge and the central part of the carbonate platform at the bottom of these units intensely fractured dolomitic successions are present and classified as cataclasites and ultra cataclasites di nocera et al 2016 it is worthy of note that montanari et al 2017 analyzed drill stem tests performed in mesozoic carbonate units whose physical features are comparable with the ones of the sele river valley and they also measured porosity and permeability values over 6 km depth on fine grained dolostones and vuggy dolomicrites they measured an average permeability 1 0 10 18 m2 and equal to 7 7 10 13 m2 respectively in carbonate units permeability varies from 1 9 10 16 m2 to 1 2 10 13 m2 besides taking into account the p waves velocity provided by valoroso et al 2011 the density of the main tectonic units was calculated and also the lithostatic pressure at 5 km depth was set at about 1 3 kbar 5 discussion 5 1 water rock interaction processes the langelier ludwig diagram fig 4 clarifies that t and ec increase fig 3 is related to a gradual enrichment of the cl so4 and na contents starting from ca mg hco3 composition of cold samples clgw type up to na hco3 cl composition of thermal samples tsgw type in this latter hydrogeochemical facies the composition of brine waters both in the apennine context toscani et al 2007 boschetti et al 2011a boschetti et al 2011b and in the volcanic geothermal one minissale et al 2016 were reported fig 4 the separation between clgw and tsgw groups is well marked while most springs of isgw group show an intermediate composition suggesting the presence of mixing processes between the cold end member and the thermal one to evaluate both the role of the lithologies involved in the main geochemical processes and the related mixing process the relationships between the main solutes have been investigated the ca ca mg ratios have been plotted against hco3 hco3 so4 ratios fig 5 in order to verify if the aquifers are dominated by carbonate evaporite rocks the clgw and isgw groups fall along calcite and dolomite dissolution line indicating that the dissolution of carbonate rocks mainly calcite is the main process conversely tsgw is more shifted towards an anhydrite end member than clgw the relative increase in mg2 goes on with an increase of so4 2 suggesting that tsgw are affected by dedolomitization driven by dissolution of gypsum or anhydrite this process is quite common in aquifers containing dolostones associated with gypsiferous layers capaccioni et al 2001 appelo and postma 2005 ma et al 2011 capecchiacci et al 2015 the gypsum dissolution determines an increase in ca2 which in turn allows calcite to precipitate consequently the decrease in co3 2 causes the dolomite dissolution and the mg2 increase in solution gil márquez et al 2017 apollaro et al 2020 these constraints are confirmed by saturation indices of calcite dolomite and gypsum representative of the carbonate and evaporite components table 2 fig 6 a shows that clgw and isgw groups are in equilibrium with calcite slightly undersaturated in dolomite and strongly undersaturated with respect to gypsum tsgw is in equilibrium with calcite supersaturated or in equilibrium with dolomite and slightly undersaturated with a trend towards saturation with respect to gypsum fig 6b the mixing processes between cold end member and thermal one is also well represented by na cl diagram see fig s3 all investigated waters align along the na cl ratio 1 with tsgw having higher values than isgw and clgw for the latter ones the na cl ratio is linked to seawater spray while for thermal waters tsgw it can be associated to deep fluids uprising produced by halite dissolution from evaporitic layers tsgw shows also high f concentrations from 0 61 to 1 84 mg l that are probably linked to the presence of fluorine containing minerals such as fluorapatite fluorite and phlogopite in the lithology through which the water flows the precipitation of calcite and subordinately dolomite could cause the removal of ca2 and enhance fluorite dissolution and f enrichment as proposed by apollaro et al 2020 for carbonate aquifers in the tsgw the high b concentrations and the positive correlation with cl content conservative element supports the occurrence of evaporitic water interaction process since this element is typically enriched in evaporite sequences battistel et al 2016 holser 2018 similarly to b also li and rb show a good positive correlation with cl high pearson s r correlation coefficient greater than 0 9 see fig s4 and table s1 suggesting a contribution from water rock interaction wang et al 2019 5 2 oxygen and hydrogen isotope composition the δd and δ18o values are displayed in fig 7 together with southern italy meteoric water line siml longinelli and selmo 2003 and global meteoric water line gmwl clark and fritz 2013 clgw is enriched in lighter isotopes and falls on siml representing the shallow component i e the current meteoric recharge of the aquifer similar to clgw type isgw samples fall on meteoric water line and are located between the shallow cold end member clgw type and the inflowing thermal and brackish fluids tsgw type with oxygen isotopic signature more enriched in heavy isotopes tsgw type has a narrow range of δ18o values from 6 38 to 6 30 and conversely a wide variability for δd they move away from siml with a positive δ18o shift more marked for s18 and s21 showing the highest t and salinity value generally saline waters brackish brine connate formation water metamorphic water etc fall on the right of the local meteoric water line though scattered with an increase in both δ18o and δd values with increasing salinity and t kharaka and hanor 2003 hoefs 2009 toscani et al 2007 boschetti et al 2011a boschetti et al 2011b sharp 2017 and their origin cannot be related to present day precipitation from an isotopic point of view the composition of tsgw may be interpreted as a mixture between brine type waters originated from deep aquifer flowing upward and cold water in order to verify this hypothesis the δ18o values are plotted against cl contents together with mixing lines between cold water representing local meteoric water line and average values of brine type from literature fig 8 for shallow end member we used the average values of cold water cl 10 4 mg l and δ18o 8 09 while for brine end member cl contents between 70 and 120 g l and δ18o value of 5 toscani et al 2007 boschetti et al 2011a boschetti et al 2011b yan et al 2013 has been taken into account thermal waters do not fall on the mixing lines showed an enrichment in heavy oxygen isotope linked probably to secondary processes responsible for the modification of the chemical and isotopic composition additionally thermal waters in contursi area are characterized by bubbling gases with high co2 content duchi et al 1995 italiano et al 2000 minissale 2004 it is known that for co2 rich waters various natural processes may deviate the δ18o e δd values in reservoir waters from equilibrium values on the meteoric water line generally 18o enrichment with no change in the hydrogen isotope ratio has been associated with oxygen isotope exchange with bedrock minerals or water steam separation in geothermal conditions clayton and steiner 1975 matsuhisa et al 1979 giggenbach 1992 while 18o depletion is proposed to be due to co2 water interaction at lower temperatures recently karolite et al 2017 have verified that for co2 rich springs the equilibration with co2 dominat gas can result in 18o enrichment and depletion in waters and therefore geothermal conditions are not necessary to produce 18o enriched waters the 18o enrichment is facilitated if the starting δ18o value of co2 is significantly higher than that of the water and if high gas water ratios are present karolyte et al 2017 our samples show these conditions linked to co2 nevertheless thermal waters are characterized from a big range of δd values too the δd enrichment without an effect on δ18o can be justified from fractionation between degassing h2 h2s ch4 and water in active magmatic systems richet et al 1977 however the chemical geothermometers indicate roughly that contursi area is characterized by a low temperature geothermal system not comparable to an active magmatic one alternatively it is possible that the big range of δd values can be attributed to recharge in past at different temperatures higher than the current one a further explanation for this variability of isotopic data positive δ18o shift and the value range in δd can be linked to evaporative processes in fact during evaporation the lighter isotopes 16o and 1h enter the vapour phase and consequently water vapour is depleted in 18o and 2h whereas the remaining water is enriched in both heavier isotopes 18o and 2h the d excess d δd 8 δ18o is an important parameter for evaluating the effect of evaporation hoefs 2009 and its value decreases during the evaporations process the deuterium excesses of investigated groundwater calculated using the siml range from 11 8 s2 to 2 05 s21 plotting the d excess vs ec values fig 9 it is possible to verify if the evaporation process is occurred clgw and isgw are located along the dissolution line while tsgw shows a negative correlation falling into the area linked to evaporative processes in addition all waters are well correlated r2 0 94 highlighting that the mixing processes between cold end member and thermal deep one evaporated in depth can be occurred 5 3 tritium data based on the above mentioned hydrogeochemical and isotopic considerations different flowpaths can be supposed for the analysed groundwater in order to estimate different residence times the binary relationship between groundwater tritium and cl contents was investigated however it did not show a linear correlation fig s5 based on the assumptions reported in the methods section the piston flow model was applied only to the clgw group while the well mixed reservoir model to isgw and tsgw according to the approach adopted by apollaro et al 2015 2016 clgw show tritium contents between 0 98 tu and 2 23 the two water samples of isgw have tritium values of 1 7 tu and 2 2 tu respectively and the tritium contents of tsgw are between 1 1 tu and 2 3 tu based on the first above mentioned model i e piston flow with the uncertainties caused by the input functions of tritium data of rainwaters a mean residence time of about 20 years has been estimated for clgw this residence time value indicates that these springs are discharged from a relatively young and shallow aquifer behaving as a piston flow circuit of a high flow rate as evidenced by their chemical composition too alternatively for other groundwater groups by adopting the well mixed reservoir model the mean residence is greater than 100 years with maximum values associated with tsgw these values indicate that thermal waters are conditioned by longer circuits affecting the geothermal reservoir in depth while isgw is due to the mixing of meteoric water same as clgw and thermal and brackish water uprising 5 4 reservoir temperature estimation considering the physical chemical composition of the investigated groundwater and the geological hydrogeological framework the geothermal reservoir feeding the contursi area thermal systems was expected to be hosted in carbonate evaporitic rocks only tsgw type has been treated with geothermometric calculations since these waters are the least affected by dilution and thus they are the most representative of the thermal deep end member the sio2 quartz geothermometers truesdell 1976 fournier 1977 michard 1979 show temperatures in the range 80 96 c while sio2 chalcedony geothermometers provide temperatures between 50 and 68 c the latter temperature range is slightly higher than the discharge temperature and therefore quartz is likely the most phase controlling the dissolved silica contents in the studied area the k mg geothermometers yields temperatures from 75 to 96 c similar to those obtained with the sio2 quartz geothermometers in previous studies e g apollaro et al 2012 pastorelli et al 1999 wang et al 2015 these two geothermometers have been considered as the most suitable for low temperature carbonate evaporitic systems considering all these results and excluding the higher values previously mentioned a thermal reservoir temperature range of 75 95 c can be considered representative for the investigated area taking into account the geothermometric estimations and the trend of geotherm proposed by boncio et al 2008 thermal reservoir can be estimated at the depth between 2 and 3 km 5 5 δ34s and δ18o values in dissolved sulphate the isotope composition of dissolved sulphate in groundwater has been analysed in order to constrain the sulphate origin in some water samples belonging to the isgw and tsgw groups the clgw samples have not been analysed as they show low so4 values the δ34s so4 and δ18o so4 values of the investigated groundwater samples fall into and very close to the field of evaporites fig 10 clark and fritz 1997 paternoster et al 2010 petitta et al 2011 geological data indicate the presence of the messinian gessoso solfifera formation at the top of the apulian carbonates at a depth of about 4 km in acerno 001 well fig 2 to ascertain that isotopic signature of studied waters is attributable to these evaporitic messinian deposits the δ34s so4 values and so4 concentration of the water samples have been plotted together with mixing lines between rainwater and messinian marine sulphate minerals values from boschetti et al 2011a boschetti et al 2011b vespasiano et al 2021 fig 11 three water samples s9 s10 and s21 fall along the mixing lines suggesting that the messinian deposits are the mainly source of dissolved sulphate for the thermal systems of contursi area nevertheless three samples s16 s17 and s18 do not match the mixing model and show an 32s enrichment in the dissolved sulphate known that thermal waters are characterised by bubbling gases with high co2 and h2s contents italiano et al 2000 minissale 2004 it is possible that part of the h2s of the gas phase is rapidly oxidized when it comes into contact with shallow meteoric water the irreversible oxidation of h2s much faster kinetically than the reduction of sulphate to sulphide ohmoto and rye 1979 determines an 32s enrichment in the dissolved sulphate whose entity is function of the degree of oxidation in non equilibrium condition as stated by martinez serrano et al 1996 therefore for these samples the dissolved sulphate may be due to the contribution of oxidation of h2s and the messinian deposits leaching at depth 5 6 interpretative model of fluids flow this hydrogeochemical multi approach allows to draw a hydrogeological model of the fluid circulation with the aid of cross sections see fig 2 hydrogeochemical and isotopic data both stable and radioactive indicate the existence of more complex and regional groundwater hydrodynamics for the isgw and tsgw which are characterized by longer and deeper flowpaths emerging in the inner zone of the sele river valley instead a local flow system with a shorter residence time of water is supposed for the clgw shallow carbonate groundwater mostly emerging at the boundary of carbonate aquifers besides as shown in the geological schematic sections fig 2 tectonic discontinuities e g deep seated faults play a crucial role in the circulation acting as pathways for the upward migration of deep contributions to reach the shallow regional aquifers that are totally recharged by meteoric infiltration as stated by δd and δ18o values the mixing between deep seated thermal fluids and colder shallow groundwater fed by regional carbonate aquifers occurs with different degree for isgw and tsgw springs particularly the latter ones show hydrogeochemical features directly connected with deep tectonic structures of the contursi area see fig 2 we speculate that deep inputs ascend from the apulian platform where combinations of brine and or co2 mixtures are supposed duchi et al 1995 amoroso et al 2017 de landro et al 2022 and crossing the messinian deposits they acquire the above mentioned isotopic signature of evaporites in the shallower portion of the crust i e within the carbonate tectonic unit these mineralized fluids mix with fresh groundwater hosted in regional carbonate aquifers our results are in line with recent geophysical studies carried out in this sector of apennines that detected deep seated fluid accumulation i e mixtures of brine and or co2 amoroso et al 2014 improta et al 2014 amoroso et al 2017 de landro et al 2022 it is noteworthy also that de landro et al 2022 observed spatiotemporal seismic velocity changes that are caused by different mechanisms in the shallow and in the deep crust in the shallower volume they are associated with meteoric water recharge processes and in the deeper volume they are related to pore pressure pulsations since previous works invoked overpressured fluids at depth as primary mechanism of interaction between fluid dynamic and earthquake triggering chiarabba et al 2020 chiodini et al 2020 for future research the hydrogeochemical investigation in active seismic areas could be based on high frequency and long term multiparametric hydrogeochemical monitoring to quantify these pulsations as function of changes in mixing ratio between shallow groundwater and deep contributions 6 conclusion in complex and active tectonic areas the multi component approach combining hydrogeochemistry to geo structural setting and isotopic study is a powerful tool for analysing mixing and related processes between shallow groundwater and ascending deep fluids along main fault systems the application of this tool to the contursi area in the upper sele river valley southern apennines southern italy results to be appropriate to monitor this hydrogeochemical process owing to its hydrogeological and geo structural features in fact the study area is characterized by groundwater resources converging from shallow carbonate aquifers to several springs showing different geochemical signatures e g degree of mineralization and thermalism and by the presence of deep seated tectonic discontinuities acting as preferential pathways for fluids upwelling a significant hydrogeochemical evolutionary trend from the ca mg hco3 hydrofacies to the na hco3 cl one was found in the analysed groundwater samples thus according to the geochemical composition as well as to the thermal trend and to the ec three main groups of groundwater have been identified as follows cold and low salinity groundwater clgw intermediate salinity groundwater isgw and thermal and saline groundwater tsgw this classification was validated by stable isotopes δ18o δd in fact isotopic values of clgw corresponding to the shallow end member fall on the local meteoric water line i e δ18o from 8 51 to 7 75 δd 50 4 to 46 4 while isgw and tsgw are characterized by isotopic signatures more enriched in heavy isotopes i e δ18o from 7 51 to 6 30 δd 48 1 to 38 4 attributed to the inflow of deep fluids which have undergone natural processes modifying the pristine isotopic signature therefore clgw chemistry is clearly related to carbonate rocks calcite and dolomite water interaction in contrast for isgw and tsgw an additional contribution from evaporitic rocks can be proposed as shown by chemical composition si values gypsum and anhydrite and sulphur isotopic signature of dissolved sulphate whose values are associated with the evaporitic messinian gessoso solfifera formation our geo structural review provided a structural sketch down to a depth of approximately 5 km the geological cross sections highlighted the presence of deep seated normal faults which could represent the best network of pathways for deep fluids migration towards the surface allowing the mixing between deep and shallow end members additionally through the application of two models i e the piston flow and well mixed reservoir based on tritium isotope deeper and longer circuits have been pointed out for tsgw flowpaths also by selecting geothermometers for medium low geothermal systems the equilibrium reservoir temperature of deep contributions between 75 and 96 c was extrapolated for springs where evidence of significant deep contributions was found hence applying the geothermal gradient of the study area an estimation of depth of fluids reservoir at about 3 km was inferred moreover our results agree with recent geodetical and seismological studies in the selected area that reported an intensely fractured deep fluid saturated volume of the crust the same studies shed light on the spatiotemporal evolution of pore pressure pulsations at depth in highly sensitive fault system zones at the same time in the shallow crust transient deformations were attributable to phases of recharge of wide aquifers consequently recording changes in hydrogeological mixing ratio by long lasting hydrogeochemical multi component approach could be crucial to analyse and discern both the pore pressure pulsations in the deep crust and hydrogeological variations in the shallow crust credit authorship contribution statement

2252,with the aim of deepening our understanding of deep seated fluids upwelling and mixing in large regional aquifers we performed a hydrogeochemical study of twenty two springs in the contursi area upper sele river valley southern apennines by means of the measurements of chemical physical parameters major ions trace elements and stable and radioactive isotopes besides we realized two updated geo structural cross sections in order to reconstruct the groundwater flowpath in the study area the hydrogeochemical composition as well as the water temperature allow to identify three main groups of groundwater cold and low salinity groundwater clgw intermediate salinity groundwater isgw and thermal salinity groundwater tsgw the clgw group mostly emerging at the boundary of carbonate aquifers is characterized by alkaline earth bicarbonate hydrofacies instead isgw and tsgw situated in the inner zone of the valley show gradually a hydrogeochemical evolution towards sodium chloride type hydrofacies domain with the highest salinity value stable isotope δ18o δd of clgw reveal the local meteoric origin of groundwater while isotopic signatures of isgw and tsgw is associated with the deep fluids inflow clgw hydrogeochemistry is clearly related to dissolution of carbonate rocks on the other hand for isgw and tsgw an additional contribution from evaporitic rocks is supported by saturation indices values gypsum and anhydrite and validated by isotopic signature of dissolved sulphate δ34s δ18o the application of two models based on tritium data i e the piston flow and well mixed reservoir attributes longer and deeper groundwater flowpaths to tsgw through geothermometric calculations e g k mg and sio2 quartz the equilibrium temperature of deep fluids reservoir is also extrapolated i e 75 96 c the results of the adopted hydrogeochemical multi component approach allowed us to propose an interpretative model of groundwater flowpath for the contursi area where deep seated tectonic discontinuities play a significant role for the upwelling of saline deep thermal fluids in shallow aquifers keywords groundwater mixing deep fluids thermal fluids isotopes hydrogeochemistry faults data availability all data are freely available 1 introduction the investigation of crustal scale groundwater flow is one of the most demanding challenges for hydrogeochemistry and hydrogeological scientists groundwater hydrogeochemistry is the result of many simultaneous processes involving the water rock gas system that include weathering dissolution precipitation ion exchange redox reactions sorption gas generation and consumption and other mechanisms freeze and cherry 1979 matthess 1982 deutsch 2020 the occurrence of these processes and their extent are strictly related to some hydrogeological factors such as i the nature of the aquifer system e g both the lithology of host rocks and the water type i e meteoric marine or magmatic ii the length and depth of groundwater flowpath iii the groundwater residence time iv the presence and the location of tectonic features e g faults and fractures which can enhance groundwater mixing and deep fluids upwelling andreo et al 2016 gil márquez et al 2017 therefore water geochemistry is telling us a long and complex story that groundwater undergoes in the brittle crust sibson et al 1975 goldscheider et al 2010 doglioni et al 2014 smeraglia et al 2018 the scale of groundwater flow both in terms of depth and width is mainly affected by the continuity of aquifer systems hydraulic gradient between the recharge area and the discharge one and by the presence of regional tectonic structures toth 1995 de vries and simmers 2002 cook 2003 chen and goldscheider 2014 in detail high hydraulic gradient can cause deepening of flowpaths in the aquifer that can lead groundwater up to some kilometres below the topographic surface according to the local geothermal gradient groundwater gets higher temperature and thus can rise convectively mainly along faults minissale 1991 qiu et al 2018 yang et al 2019 in this complex hydro geostructural framework the ascending of endogenous fluids e g chiefly co2 dominant must be considered too chiodini et al 1995a chiodini et al 1995b italiano et al 2000 paternoster et al 2017 barbieri et al 2020 barberio et al 2021 gori and barberio

al 2020 in this study we performed a multi component hydrogeochemical characterization of 22 springs in the contursi area in the inner zone of the sele river valley southern apennines italy where groundwater flowpaths from regional carbonate aquifers converge additionally springs located along main tectonic lineaments are affected by thermalism and intense degassing with a mantle related

geophysical studies furnished seismic imaging of this area from p and s waves velocity models suggesting a fluid accumulation in a wide rock volume below the study area amoroso et al 2014 improta et al 2014 also the presence of brackish and brine waters was supposed duchi et al 1995 improta et al 2014 amoroso et al 2017 de landro et al 2022 owing to the various hydrogeochemical characteristics groundwater in the sele river valley is addressed to many different uses for instance fresh springs directly fed by carbonate aquifers are tapped for drinking purposes and the mineralized and thermal ones supply spas the goal of this work is a to define water rock interaction processes affecting the chemical composition of the investigated groundwater b to determine fluids origin and evolution the mechanism of water salinization c to calculate the reservoir temperature using classical geothermometric approaches d to propose a conceptual model of fluids flowpath through the construction of two updated geological cross sections the results of this study may find important applications such as exploitation of low enthalpy geothermal resources use of thermal waters for therapeutic purposes and offer a relevant preliminary tool in order to define the relationship between stress field variations pore pressure evolution at depth in a seismically active area 2 geological and hydrogeological setting the study area is located in the southern apennines which is part of a mountain chain that develops from the southern abruzzi alto molise region to sicily crossing the calabrian arc malinverno and ryan 1986 doglioni 1991 patacca and scandone 2007 from a geodynamic point of view the southern apennines are an east verging fold and thrust belt related to the subduction of the apulian lithosphere towards west doglioni 1995 faccenna et al 2001 starting from middle upper pleistocene the axial zone of the chain raised and an extensional tectonic developed in nw se direction responsible of the formation of seismogenic faults up to 15 km deep the southern apennines are characterized by a series of superimposed tectonic units constituted by a deep seated carbonate duplex system belonging to the so called apennine carbonates characterized by shallow water deformed carbonates and overlained by basinal sequences belonging to lagonegro units patacca and scandone 2007 ciarcia et al 2009 pierdominici et al 2011 vitale and ciarcia 2018 low angle thrust faults separate the apennine carbonates in the hanging wall from the lagonegro units in the footwall the apennine accretionary wedge is tectonically superimposed onto the buried apulian platform which is characterized by the presence of folds that form hydrocarbon and co2 geological traps shiner et al 2004 generating overpressured reservoirs geophysical studies carried out in this sector of apennines amoroso et al 2014 improta et al 2014 shed light on a diffused high vp vs ratio within the fractured apulian platform carbonates between 5 and 10 km depth where intense microseismicity occurs this seismic imaging from p and s waves velocity models suggests deep seated fluid accumulation i e mixtures of brine and or co2 in a wide rock volume below the study area amoroso et al 2017 de landro et al 2022 this study focuses on the sele river valley situated in the central portion of the southern apennine precisely in the irpinia region commonly the structural pattern of the upper sele river valley has been interpreted as a ns trending graben ortolani 1975 cotecchia 1986 coppola and pescatore 1989 where the main tectonic discontinuities border the high relief massifs made of mesozoic carbonate rocks located to the west and east of the sele river valley i e the picentini mts and mt marzano ogna respectively merlini and mostardini 1986 wasowski et al 2002 from a seismological standpoint the ongoing crustal extension regime is responsible for the high seismicity of the southern apennines in particular the study area represents an interesting site for seismologists since it is considered one of the areas in southern apennines with the highest seismogenic potential slejko et al 1998 it was struck by the recent strong 1980 mw 6 9 irpinia earthquake bernard and zollo 1989 ascione et al 2020 that occur few kilometres away from contursi village the area is currently affected by background seismicity with the most of seismic events occurring along the 1980 irpinia deep seated ruptures de matteis et al 2012 with prevailing normal faulting focal mechanisms pierdominici et al 2011 the hydrogeological setting of the southern apennines is characterized by meso cenozoic carbonates that act as huge karst aquifers bounded by low permeability deposits i e aquitards and or aquicludes such as syn orogenic siliciclastic marine deposits or messinian evaporites boni et al 1986 celico et al 2006 the upper sele river valley is bordered to east and west by two carbonate mountain ranges mt marzano ogna and picentini mts respectively fig 1 they constitute two main aquifers of the study area because of their large volume and high hydraulic conductivity enhanced by diffuse fracturing and intense karst processes celico and civita 1976 wasowski et al 2002 they fed several springs located along their fault boundaries where aquicludes of turbidite deposits are in direct contact with carbonate rocks budetta et al 1988 the picentini mts constitute a 600 km2 wide large karst system and encompass four large mountain groups corniello et al 2010 recognized as different hydrogeological basins among these basins the mt polveracchio aquifer fig 1 is characterized by a complex geo structural setting that affects groundwater flowpaths strictly constrained by tectonic discontinuities celico et al 1987 along the northern and north eastern margin the hydrogeological limit consists of a fault between acerno and calabritto localities where the main groundwater outlet is the acquara ponticchio spring s1 along the western margin the boundary is represented by a fault system separating mt accellica from mt polveracchio further south the polveracchio basin is buffered by impermeable lithotypes of the lagonegro units fig 1 see legend unit 7 corniello et al 2010 finally along the eastern margin in the upper valley of the sele river the boundary consists of a tectonic thrusting front where many cold springs i e s2 s3 s5 s6 are located through a deeper and longer circuit groundwater feeds very mineralized springs in the inner zone of the sele river valley i

sampling field and laboratory analysis a sampling survey of twenty two springs was carried out in may 2021 fig 1 water samples for major minor and trace elements analyses were filtered with 0 45 μm membrane filters and to keep metals in solution the latter were acidified on site with ultrapure hno3 to ph 2 water samples for isotopic analyses δ18o h2o δd h2o 3h h2o δ34s so4 and δ18o so4 were collected without treatments they were sampled into high density polyethylene bottles and stored at low temperatures in ice filled fridge boxes to avoid alterations of chemical components electrical conductivity ec measured at 25 c temperature t and ph were directly measured in situ using the multiparametric probe wtw multi 3420 with accuracies of 1 μs cm 0 1 c and 0 01 ph unit respectively anions and cations were determined by ion chromatography at the geochemistry laboratory of the department of earth sciences at sapienza university of rome chromatographs dionex ics 5000 and dionex ics 1100 were used to analyse anions f cl so4 2 and no3 and cations ca2 mg2 na and k respectively bicarbonate ions were measured by titration with 0 05 n hcl solution as titrating agent and methyl orange as indicator ionic balance error checked on each sample was within 5 baird et al 2017 dissolved sio2 was measured by vis spectrophotometry upon reaction with ammonium molybdate in acid media and treatment with oxalic acid to form a yellow silicomolybdate complex whose absorbance was read at 410 nm nollet 2007 samples for trace elements were analysed using an icp ms spectrometer x series 2 thermo fisher scientific waltham ma usa blanks standard solutions and sample dilutions were prepared by using ultrapure water millipore milli q 16 mw cm and an internal standard rh was added to correct the icp ms instrumental drift the analytical accuracy of this method ranges between 2 and 5 measurements of the water stable isotope ratios δ18o and δd and the sulphur and oxygen isotopic composition in dissolved sulphate δ34s so4 and δ18o so4 are expressed in terms of delta units units relative to the vienna standard mean ocean water v smow and vienna canyon diablo troilite v cdt standards respectively tritium 3h content was determined by an electrolytic enrichment and liquid scintillation counting method and it is reported in tu tritium unit these analyses were performed only on some springs i e s2 s4 s7 s9 s10 s16 s17 s18 s21 at it2e isotope tracer technologies europe srl in milan italy the speciation software phreeqc interactive 3 6 2 parkhurst and appelo 2013 was used to calculate saturation index s i 3 2 calculation of mean residence time of groundwater tritium 3h is a natural radioactive isotope of hydrogen its short half life is of 12 32 years that can be used as a tracer for determining the groundwater age due to the increase and decrease of this radionuclide in rainwater during atmospheric nuclear weapons testing in the 1945 1963 s it is often used to differentiate groundwater recharged before and after the early 1950 s mcmahon 2012 groundwater age is useful to estimate recharge rates wang et al 2008 to propose hydrogeochemistry models on the fluid circulation sanford 2011 apollaro et al 2015 and to infer information on the vulnerability of aquifers to contamination by anthropogenic activities at the land surface raco et al 2022 the dating of groundwater assumes that the tritium activity at the time of recharge is known and that the measured value in water sample corresponds only to the radioactive decay the estimation of the mean residence time of groundwater was obtained by adopting two end member models i e the piston flow and the well mixed reservoir the piston flow model assumes absence of mixing along the whole water flowpath from the recharge area to discharge one contrarily the well mixed reservoir model assumes complete mixing between the water entering the reservoir and the water already stored into it shevenell and goff 1995 apollaro et al 2015 apollaro et al 2016 to link tritium content of groundwater to its mean residence time it was necessary to take into account tritium data of local rainwaters from the iaea wmo stations iaea wmo 2013 and from the global network of isotopes in precipitation gnip in italy and europe about 2000 values of rainwaters from 1953 to 2019 have been used in order to define tritium contents as a function of time the dataset shows a sudden increase in tritium values in 1961 1963 and then a gradual decrease until reaching constant values around 8 5 tritium unit in recent years tritium time plot is reported in fig s1 as described by apollaro et al 2015 2016 the required input functions calculated in the dataset in different number of segments have been defined and applied for two different models the piston flow and the well mixed reservoir in the equations proposed by shevenell and goff 1995 linking the output tritium concentration at time t to the mean residence time of water in the geothermal reservoir 3 3 geothermometers the classical method used to calculate the reservoir temperature is chemical geothermometry consisting of the use of different empiric or experimental calibrations based on temperature dependent heterogeneous chemical reactions many geothermometric techniques have been proposed through the years for different geochemical and geological settings fournier 1977 fournier and potter 1979 fouillac and michard 1981 arnórsson et al 1983 marini et al 1986 giggenbach 1988 chiodini et al 1995a chiodini et al 1995b battistel et al 2014 it is known that chemical geothermometers are based on some theoretical assumptions i water is in equilibrium with host rocks as such water is saturated by the mineral phases governing the geothermometer and ii the waters neither re equilibrate nor mix with shallow circulating fluids during the ascent towards the surface the silica geothermometers sio2 chalcedony and sio2 quartz truesdell 1976 fournier 1977 and cation geothermometers k mg giggenbach 1988 fournier 1979 fournier and truesdell 1973 were employed in this study 3 4 geological cross section construction to achieve the goal of this study also two orthogonal schematic geological sections were made in order to reconstruct the fluids flowpaths down to 5 km depth below the surface both the cross sections fall within the sele river valley the first one is a w e section a a and the second one is a ns section b b see fig 1 these sections have been realized by using as reference the foglio 468 eboli which is a geological map of the carg cartografia geologica project on a scale of 1 50 000 fig 1 shows the tectonic scheme obtained from the above mentioned map regarding the reference elevation model the dem provided by the tinitaly portal tarquini et al 2007 was used based on videpi database wells acerno 001 contursi 001 and s gregorio magno 001 were studied in order to calibrate the geological sections all the data were imported and elaborated both in qgis v 3 22 5 and in movetm software v 2022 1 4 results 4 1 hydrogeochemical characterization the chemical physical parameters major ions minor and trace elements saturation indices and isotopic data δ18o h2o δd h2o 3h h2o δ34s so4 and δ18o so4 are listed in table 1 table 2 and table 3 according to the ec and t values three main groups can be clearly recognized see fig 3 also the multivariate statistical approach of principal component analyses pca was performed maćkiewicz and ratajczak 1993 using r software to support and validate the hydrogeochemical classification of samples based on chemical compositional similarities the first two principal component resolve 96 5 of the total data variance see fig s2 a first group represented by cold and low salinity groundwater hereafter clgw includes samples from s1 to s8 see table 1 these waters have the lowest ec 700 µs cm and t values from 7 8 to 14 3 c the ph values are alkaline between 7 2 and 8 4 and these waters are in oxidizing condition average value of 247 mv they show a ca mg hco3 hydrofacies fig 4 a second group with intermediate salinity groundwater hereafter isgw includes samples from s9 to s14 see table 1 they show t values between 13 8 and 18 5 c ec values from 1090 to 1981 µs cm the ph values are slightly acidic from 6 0 to 6 8 while eh values are between 197 and 229 mv isgw belongs to ca mg hco3 hydrofacies like clgw a third group of thermal and saline groundwater hereafter tsgw includes samples from s15 to s22 see table 1 in detail tsgw group is brackish type water according to the classification of drever 1997 having ec values from 2560 to 6470 µs cm the latter are thermal with t values between 25 and 47 c slightly acidic ph values from 6 2 to 6 4 and have negative eh values up to 285 mv furthermore they are characterized by a na hco3 cl composition fig 4 and show a marked enrichment in sulphate respect to other groups table 1 these waters show a bubbling gas phase and have high dissolved co2 values too italiano et al 2000 no3 values are generally very low at times ranging from below the detection limit from 0 18 to 4 15 mg l s20 and did not show significant differences among the three groups among minor and trace elements f li b rb sr cs sio2 and ba tsgw show the highest concentrations up to three orders of magnitude higher than clgw and isgw groups the δ18o h2o and δd h2o values measured in nine samples three of clgw group two of isgw group and four of tsgw group table 2 range from 8 5 to 6 3 and from 50 to 38 respectively the δ34s so4 and δ18o so4 values measured in six samples belonging to isgw and tsgw groups show the following range values from 5 3 to 8 4 and from 9 7 to 21 9 for δ18o and for δ34s respectively finally tritium content is between 1 and 2 3 tu see table 2 measured in nine water samples 4 2 geo structural interpretation with the aim of furnishing a model for groundwater and deep fluids flowpaths and to reconstruct the geological scheme of the sele river valley we realized two schematic geological cross sections both longitudinally and transversally with respect to the location of thermal springs and to the vergence of the apennines fold and thrust belt as well as a stratigraphic column down to a depth of about 5 km fig 2 in the central part of the a a section fig 2 the so called valle del sele tectonic unit results to be the geometrically highest unit in the area overlying the carbonate tectonic unit with a maximum thickness of about 400 m the valle del sale tectonic unit is characterized from bottom to top by the presence of clayey units interspersed with marly limestones clayey limestones and arenaceous marl di nocera et al 2016 the lower unit is the so called carbonate tectonic unit with a maximum thickness of about 3500 m it outcrops in picentini mts and in mt castello the western and eastern part of the a a cross section respectively and also in the structural highs of oliveto citra and mt pruno it consists of mesozoic carbonates deposited in an interval between the triassic and the cretaceous and generated in a transition sector between the carbonate shelf edge and the lagonegro basin di nocera et al 2016 at the bottom of the carbonates there are dolomitic successions the picentini mts were generated by the e verging thrust front while the back thrust and the respective splays that dissects the carbonate units in the eastern part are responsible for the presence of the oliveto citra and mt pruno highs see fig 2 these tectonic structures have been also recognized in the videpi seismic line 1 84 pa 1 see location in fig 1 the unresolved western part of the a a section is due to the uncertainty given by the huge vertical displacement that involved the lagonegrese tectonic unit fig 2 in the b b section both the valle del sele tectonic unit and the carbonate tectonic unit are covered at times by the synorogenic unit in erosive and disconformable contact fig 2 in the northern part of the section a lateral ramp tectonically underlying to the carbonate tectonic unit is constituted by the carbonates of monti della maddalena tectonic unit di nocera et al 2016 with a maximum thickness of about 2000 m fig 2 at the bottom it is constituted by the presence of an intensely fractured dolomitic succession from upper triassic to lower jurassic at the top it consists of a carbonate platform succession from the lower jurassic to the upper miocene the lagonegrese tectonic unit is mainly represented by mesozoic clayey deposits of deep sea environment and at the top by flysch deposits in this area the maximum thickness of the lagonegrese tectonic unit is about 2000 m the tectonic contact between the lagonegrese unit and the apulian carbonates is found at a depth of 4286 m in the acerno 001 well see location in fig 1 this well falls in the campagna tectonic window which testifies the presence of a tectonic doubling of the lagonegrese units patacca 2007 that could justify the shallow depth of these units in the western part of the cross section the doubling of the lagonegrese units is also due to the sandwiching of the mt croce tectonic unit which outcrops in the western part of the study area fig 1 but it is not in the area of sampling and is not crossed by the geological sections the presence of the evaporitic messinian gessoso solfifera formation mainly constituted by gypsum and clays with a thickness of about 80 m is also reported the geometrically deepest tectonic unit recognizable in the area is represented by the apulian carbonates up to at least 5 km in depth it is constituted by shallow water mesozoic tertiary platform carbonates as shown in both sections regarding the tectonic discontinuities a deep normal fault crosses both the messinian gessoso solfifera formation and the apulian carbonates it is supposed to be responsible for playing a crucial role in the uprising of deep fluids towards the surface in the area of bagni di contursi fig 2 overall carbonate units are the most common in the area and represent both the edge and the central part of the carbonate platform at the bottom of these units intensely fractured dolomitic successions are present and classified as cataclasites and ultra cataclasites di nocera et al 2016 it is worthy of note that montanari et al 2017 analyzed drill stem tests performed in mesozoic carbonate units whose physical features are comparable with the ones of the sele river valley and they also measured porosity and permeability values over 6 km depth on fine grained dolostones and vuggy dolomicrites they measured an average permeability 1 0 10 18 m2 and equal to 7 7 10 13 m2 respectively in carbonate units permeability varies from 1 9 10 16 m2 to 1 2 10 13 m2 besides taking into account the p waves velocity provided by valoroso et al 2011 the density of the main tectonic units was calculated and also the lithostatic pressure at 5 km depth was set at about 1 3 kbar 5 discussion 5 1 water rock interaction processes the langelier ludwig diagram fig 4 clarifies that t and ec increase fig 3 is related to a gradual enrichment of the cl so4 and na contents starting from ca mg hco3 composition of cold samples clgw type up to na hco3 cl composition of thermal samples tsgw type in this latter hydrogeochemical facies the composition of brine waters both in the apennine context toscani et al 2007 boschetti et al 2011a boschetti et al 2011b and in the volcanic geothermal one minissale et al 2016 were reported fig 4 the separation between clgw and tsgw groups is well marked while most springs of isgw group show an intermediate composition suggesting the presence of mixing processes between the cold end member and the thermal one to evaluate both the role of the lithologies involved in the main geochemical processes and the related mixing process the relationships between the main solutes have been investigated the ca ca mg ratios have been plotted against hco3 hco3 so4 ratios fig 5 in order to verify if the aquifers are dominated by carbonate evaporite rocks the clgw and isgw groups fall along calcite and dolomite dissolution line indicating that the dissolution of carbonate rocks mainly calcite is the main process conversely tsgw is more shifted towards an anhydrite end member than clgw the relative increase in mg2 goes on with an increase of so4 2 suggesting that tsgw are affected by dedolomitization driven by dissolution of gypsum or anhydrite this process is quite common in aquifers containing dolostones associated with gypsiferous layers capaccioni et al 2001 appelo and postma 2005 ma et al 2011 capecchiacci et al 2015 the gypsum dissolution determines an increase in ca2 which in turn allows calcite to precipitate consequently the decrease in co3 2 causes the dolomite dissolution and the mg2 increase in solution gil márquez et al 2017 apollaro et al 2020 these constraints are confirmed by saturation indices of calcite dolomite and gypsum representative of the carbonate and evaporite components table 2 fig 6 a shows that clgw and isgw groups are in equilibrium with calcite slightly undersaturated in dolomite and strongly undersaturated with respect to gypsum tsgw is in equilibrium with calcite supersaturated or in equilibrium with dolomite and slightly undersaturated with a trend towards saturation with respect to gypsum fig 6b the mixing processes between cold end member and thermal one is also well represented by na cl diagram see fig s3 all investigated waters align along the na cl ratio 1 with tsgw having higher values than isgw and clgw for the latter ones the na cl ratio is linked to seawater spray while for thermal waters tsgw it can be associated to deep fluids uprising produced by halite dissolution from evaporitic layers tsgw shows also high f concentrations from 0 61 to 1 84 mg l that are probably linked to the presence of fluorine containing minerals such as fluorapatite fluorite and phlogopite in the lithology through which the water flows the precipitation of calcite and subordinately dolomite could cause the removal of ca2 and enhance fluorite dissolution and f enrichment as proposed by apollaro et al 2020 for carbonate aquifers in the tsgw the high b concentrations and the positive correlation with cl content conservative element supports the occurrence of evaporitic water interaction process since this element is typically enriched in evaporite sequences battistel et al 2016 holser 2018 similarly to b also li and rb show a good positive correlation with cl high pearson s r correlation coefficient greater than 0 9 see fig s4 and table s1 suggesting a contribution from water rock interaction wang et al 2019 5 2 oxygen and hydrogen isotope composition the δd and δ18o values are displayed in fig 7 together with southern italy meteoric water line siml longinelli and selmo 2003 and global meteoric water line gmwl clark and fritz 2013 clgw is enriched in lighter isotopes and falls on siml representing the shallow component i e the current meteoric recharge of the aquifer similar to clgw type isgw samples fall on meteoric water line and are located between the shallow cold end member clgw type and the inflowing thermal and brackish fluids tsgw type with oxygen isotopic signature more enriched in heavy isotopes tsgw type has a narrow range of δ18o values from 6 38 to 6 30 and conversely a wide variability for δd they move away from siml with a positive δ18o shift more marked for s18 and s21 showing the highest t and salinity value generally saline waters brackish brine connate formation water metamorphic water etc fall on the right of the local meteoric water line though scattered with an increase in both δ18o and δd values with increasing salinity and t kharaka and hanor 2003 hoefs 2009 toscani et al 2007 boschetti et al 2011a boschetti et al 2011b sharp 2017 and their origin cannot be related to present day precipitation from an isotopic point of view the composition of tsgw may be interpreted as a mixture between brine type waters originated from deep aquifer flowing upward and cold water in order to verify this hypothesis the δ18o values are plotted against cl contents together with mixing lines between cold water representing local meteoric water line and average values of brine type from literature fig 8 for shallow end member we used the average values of cold water cl 10 4 mg l and δ18o 8 09 while for brine end member cl contents between 70 and 120 g l and δ18o value of 5 toscani et al 2007 boschetti et al 2011a boschetti et al 2011b yan et al 2013 has been taken into account thermal waters do not fall on the mixing lines showed an enrichment in heavy oxygen isotope linked probably to secondary processes responsible for the modification of the chemical and isotopic composition additionally thermal waters in contursi area are characterized by bubbling gases with high co2 content duchi et al 1995 italiano et al 2000 minissale 2004 it is known that for co2 rich waters various natural processes may deviate the δ18o e δd values in reservoir waters from equilibrium values on the meteoric water line generally 18o enrichment with no change in the hydrogen isotope ratio has been associated with oxygen isotope exchange with bedrock minerals or water steam separation in geothermal conditions clayton and steiner 1975 matsuhisa et al 1979 giggenbach 1992 while 18o depletion is proposed to be due to co2 water interaction at lower temperatures recently karolite et al 2017 have verified that for co2 rich springs the equilibration with co2 dominat gas can result in 18o enrichment and depletion in waters and therefore geothermal conditions are not necessary to produce 18o enriched waters the 18o enrichment is facilitated if the starting δ18o value of co2 is significantly higher than that of the water and if high gas water ratios are present karolyte et al 2017 our samples show these conditions linked to co2 nevertheless thermal waters are characterized from a big range of δd values too the δd enrichment without an effect on δ18o can be justified from fractionation between degassing h2 h2s ch4 and water in active magmatic systems richet et al 1977 however the chemical geothermometers indicate roughly that contursi area is characterized by a low temperature geothermal system not comparable to an active magmatic one alternatively it is possible that the big range of δd values can be attributed to recharge in past at different temperatures higher than the current one a further explanation for this variability of isotopic data positive δ18o shift and the value range in δd can be linked to evaporative processes in fact during evaporation the lighter isotopes 16o and 1h enter the vapour phase and consequently water vapour is depleted in 18o and 2h whereas the remaining water is enriched in both heavier isotopes 18o and 2h the d excess d δd 8 δ18o is an important parameter for evaluating the effect of evaporation hoefs 2009 and its value decreases during the evaporations process the deuterium excesses of investigated groundwater calculated using the siml range from 11 8 s2 to 2 05 s21 plotting the d excess vs ec values fig 9 it is possible to verify if the evaporation process is occurred clgw and isgw are located along the dissolution line while tsgw shows a negative correlation falling into the area linked to evaporative processes in addition all waters are well correlated r2 0 94 highlighting that the mixing processes between cold end member and thermal deep one evaporated in depth can be occurred 5 3 tritium data based on the above mentioned hydrogeochemical and isotopic considerations different flowpaths can be supposed for the analysed groundwater in order to estimate different residence times the binary relationship between groundwater tritium and cl contents was investigated however it did not show a linear correlation fig s5 based on the assumptions reported in the methods section the piston flow model was applied only to the clgw group while the well mixed reservoir model to isgw and tsgw according to the approach adopted by apollaro et al 2015 2016 clgw show tritium contents between 0 98 tu and 2 23 the two water samples of isgw have tritium values of 1 7 tu and 2 2 tu respectively and the tritium contents of tsgw are between 1 1 tu and 2 3 tu based on the first above mentioned model i e piston flow with the uncertainties caused by the input functions of tritium data of rainwaters a mean residence time of about 20 years has been estimated for clgw this residence time value indicates that these springs are discharged from a relatively young and shallow aquifer behaving as a piston flow circuit of a high flow rate as evidenced by their chemical composition too alternatively for other groundwater groups by adopting the well mixed reservoir model the mean residence is greater than 100 years with maximum values associated with tsgw these values indicate that thermal waters are conditioned by longer circuits affecting the geothermal reservoir in depth while isgw is due to the mixing of meteoric water same as clgw and thermal and brackish water uprising 5 4 reservoir temperature estimation considering the physical chemical composition of the investigated groundwater and the geological hydrogeological framework the geothermal reservoir feeding the contursi area thermal systems was expected to be hosted in carbonate evaporitic rocks only tsgw type has been treated with geothermometric calculations since these waters are the least affected by dilution and thus they are the most representative of the thermal deep end member the sio2 quartz geothermometers truesdell 1976 fournier 1977 michard 1979 show temperatures in the range 80 96 c while sio2 chalcedony geothermometers provide temperatures between 50 and 68 c the latter temperature range is slightly higher than the discharge temperature and therefore quartz is likely the most phase controlling the dissolved silica contents in the studied area the k mg geothermometers yields temperatures from 75 to 96 c similar to those obtained with the sio2 quartz geothermometers in previous studies e g apollaro et al 2012 pastorelli et al 1999 wang et al 2015 these two geothermometers have been considered as the most suitable for low temperature carbonate evaporitic systems considering all these results and excluding the higher values previously mentioned a thermal reservoir temperature range of 75 95 c can be considered representative for the investigated area taking into account the geothermometric estimations and the trend of geotherm proposed by boncio et al 2008 thermal reservoir can be estimated at the depth between 2 and 3 km 5 5 δ34s and δ18o values in dissolved sulphate the isotope composition of dissolved sulphate in groundwater has been analysed in order to constrain the sulphate origin in some water samples belonging to the isgw and tsgw groups the clgw samples have not been analysed as they show low so4 values the δ34s so4 and δ18o so4 values of the investigated groundwater samples fall into and very close to the field of evaporites fig 10 clark and fritz 1997 paternoster et al 2010 petitta et al 2011 geological data indicate the presence of the messinian gessoso solfifera formation at the top of the apulian carbonates at a depth of about 4 km in acerno 001 well fig 2 to ascertain that isotopic signature of studied waters is attributable to these evaporitic messinian deposits the δ34s so4 values and so4 concentration of the water samples have been plotted together with mixing lines between rainwater and messinian marine sulphate minerals values from boschetti et al 2011a boschetti et al 2011b vespasiano et al 2021 fig 11 three water samples s9 s10 and s21 fall along the mixing lines suggesting that the messinian deposits are the mainly source of dissolved sulphate for the thermal systems of contursi area nevertheless three samples s16 s17 and s18 do not match the mixing model and show an 32s enrichment in the dissolved sulphate known that thermal waters are characterised by bubbling gases with high co2 and h2s contents italiano et al 2000 minissale 2004 it is possible that part of the h2s of the gas phase is rapidly oxidized when it comes into contact with shallow meteoric water the irreversible oxidation of h2s much faster kinetically than the reduction of sulphate to sulphide ohmoto and rye 1979 determines an 32s enrichment in the dissolved sulphate whose entity is function of the degree of oxidation in non equilibrium condition as stated by martinez serrano et al 1996 therefore for these samples the dissolved sulphate may be due to the contribution of oxidation of h2s and the messinian deposits leaching at depth 5 6 interpretative model of fluids flow this hydrogeochemical multi approach allows to draw a hydrogeological model of the fluid circulation with the aid of cross sections see fig 2 hydrogeochemical and isotopic data both stable and radioactive indicate the existence of more complex and regional groundwater hydrodynamics for the isgw and tsgw which are characterized by longer and deeper flowpaths emerging in the inner zone of the sele river valley instead a local flow system with a shorter residence time of water is supposed for the clgw shallow carbonate groundwater mostly emerging at the boundary of carbonate aquifers besides as shown in the geological schematic sections fig 2 tectonic discontinuities e g deep seated faults play a crucial role in the circulation acting as pathways for the upward migration of deep contributions to reach the shallow regional aquifers that are totally recharged by meteoric infiltration as stated by δd and δ18o values the mixing between deep seated thermal fluids and colder shallow groundwater fed by regional carbonate aquifers occurs with different degree for isgw and tsgw springs particularly the latter ones show hydrogeochemical features directly connected with deep tectonic structures of the contursi area see fig 2 we speculate that deep inputs ascend from the apulian platform where combinations of brine and or co2 mixtures are supposed duchi et al 1995 amoroso et al 2017 de landro et al 2022 and crossing the messinian deposits they acquire the above mentioned isotopic signature of evaporites in the shallower portion of the crust i e within the carbonate tectonic unit these mineralized fluids mix with fresh groundwater hosted in regional carbonate aquifers our results are in line with recent geophysical studies carried out in this sector of apennines that detected deep seated fluid accumulation i e mixtures of brine and or co2 amoroso et al 2014 improta et al 2014 amoroso et al 2017 de landro et al 2022 it is noteworthy also that de landro et al 2022 observed spatiotemporal seismic velocity changes that are caused by different mechanisms in the shallow and in the deep crust in the shallower volume they are associated with meteoric water recharge processes and in the deeper volume they are related to pore pressure pulsations since previous works invoked overpressured fluids at depth as primary mechanism of interaction between fluid dynamic and earthquake triggering chiarabba et al 2020 chiodini et al 2020 for future research the hydrogeochemical investigation in active seismic areas could be based on high frequency and long term multiparametric hydrogeochemical monitoring to quantify these pulsations as function of changes in mixing ratio between shallow groundwater and deep contributions 6 conclusion in complex and active tectonic areas the multi component approach combining hydrogeochemistry to geo structural setting and isotopic study is a powerful tool for analysing mixing and related processes between shallow groundwater and ascending deep fluids along main fault systems the application of this tool to the contursi area in the upper sele river valley southern apennines southern italy results to be appropriate to monitor this hydrogeochemical process owing to its hydrogeological and geo structural features in fact the study area is characterized by groundwater resources converging from shallow carbonate aquifers to several springs showing different geochemical signatures e g degree of mineralization and thermalism and by the presence of deep seated tectonic discontinuities acting as preferential pathways for fluids upwelling a significant hydrogeochemical evolutionary trend from the ca mg hco3 hydrofacies to the na hco3 cl one was found in the analysed groundwater samples thus according to the geochemical composition as well as to the thermal trend and to the ec three main groups of groundwater have been identified as follows cold and low salinity groundwater clgw intermediate salinity groundwater isgw and thermal and saline groundwater tsgw this classification was validated by stable isotopes δ18o δd in fact isotopic values of clgw corresponding to the shallow end member fall on the local meteoric water line i e δ18o from 8 51 to 7 75 δd 50 4 to 46 4 while isgw and tsgw are characterized by isotopic signatures more enriched in heavy isotopes i e δ18o from 7 51 to 6 30 δd 48 1 to 38 4 attributed to the inflow of deep fluids which have undergone natural processes modifying the pristine isotopic signature therefore clgw chemistry is clearly related to carbonate rocks calcite and dolomite water interaction in contrast for isgw and tsgw an additional contribution from evaporitic rocks can be proposed as shown by chemical composition si values gypsum and anhydrite and sulphur isotopic signature of dissolved sulphate whose values are associated with the evaporitic messinian gessoso solfifera formation our geo structural review provided a structural sketch down to a depth of approximately 5 km the geological cross sections highlighted the presence of deep seated normal faults which could represent the best network of pathways for deep fluids migration towards the surface allowing the mixing between deep and shallow end members additionally through the application of two models i e the piston flow and well mixed reservoir based on tritium isotope deeper and longer circuits have been pointed out for tsgw flowpaths also by selecting geothermometers for medium low geothermal systems the equilibrium reservoir temperature of deep contributions between 75 and 96 c was extrapolated for springs where evidence of significant deep contributions was found hence applying the geothermal gradient of the study area an estimation of depth of fluids reservoir at about 3 km was inferred moreover our results agree with recent geodetical and seismological studies in the selected area that reported an intensely fractured deep fluid saturated volume of the crust the same studies shed light on the spatiotemporal evolution of pore pressure pulsations at depth in highly sensitive fault system zones at the same time in the shallow crust transient deformations were attributable to phases of recharge of wide aquifers consequently recording changes in hydrogeological mixing ratio by long lasting hydrogeochemical multi component approach could be crucial to analyse and discern both the pore pressure pulsations in the deep crust and hydrogeological variations in the shallow crust credit authorship contribution statement

2253,the invasion of low salinity fluids into saline lacustrine reservoirs may induce salt dissolution resulting in significant changes in petrophysical properties accurate characterization of these changes due to salt dissolution is critical for efficient drilling and development here low salinity core flooding experiments and several core analysis technologies were employed to investigate the changes in pore structure porosity permeability evolution and mechanical properties ion compositions in outlet fluids analyzed in real time to determine the dissolved salt mineral compositions mainly include halite 1 66 anhydrite 7 32 and glauberite 0 98 salt dissolution produces many dissolution pores especially with sizes ranging from 0 01 to 10 μm broadens the seepage channels and enhances the connectivity between pores which significantly improves rock porosity close to 1 80 times the initial one and permeability to 70 times initial one during the salt dissolution process the stability of clay minerals is weakened to induce dispersion migration and swelling behavior leading to the reduction of porosity and permeability a semi empirical power law relating expressing porosity and permeability for saline lacustrine reservoirs is proposed allowing for salt dissolution and clay swelling during the invasion process of low salinity fluids although salt dissolution could slightly relieve stress sensitivity damage by 56 54 it significantly weakens rock strength by reduction of elastic modulus 43 51 and compressive strength 61 54 the positive and negative effects of salt dissolution on petrophysical properties are critical to guide the development of formation damage control measures for saline lacustrine reservoirs keywords low salinity fluids saline lacustrine reservoir salt dissolution pore structure porosity and permeability data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction accurately understanding the water rock reactions in porous media is critical for scientific and engineering applications including petroleum engineering ma et al 2019 spariharijaona et al 2019 cheng et al 2021 environmental science tsuji et al 2019

connectivity between pores etc porosity and permeability and rock strength ma et al 2019 sanchez roa et al 2020 přikryl et al 2017 to this end extensive efforts have been made to clarify the effect of mineral dissolution on rocks through laboratory experiments yoon et al 2019 bonnet et al 2023 numerical simulations chen et al 2018 and mathematical modeling deng and spycher 2019 salt dissolution is one type of water rock reaction and is defined as the dissolution of the invasion of external low salinity working fluids to salt minerals in reservoir rocks in general reservoir rocks are composed of multiple minerals such as quartz calcite feldspar clay minerals and salt minerals higgins et al 2018 rashid et al 2015 varying minerals show different chemical properties leading to different water rock reaction results and different application potentials for instance since acidic fluids can dissolve carbonate minerals matrix acidizing operation is a commonly used stimulation method for tight carbonate reservoirs mustafa et al 2021 salt minerals are prone to dissolution by low salinity fluids often used in the low salinity waterflooding process to possibly improve the rock conductivity xie et al 2015 qualitatively mineral dissolution can produce numerous dissolution pores increase pore size and correspondingly modify connectivity between pores which has an overall positive role in rock modification yang et al 2020 li et al 2019 however salt dissolution causes the rock matrix to become more porous and deformable weakening the rock strength and causing unexpected consequences liang et al 2008 unconventional hydrocarbon resources have gradually become essential in exploring and developing oil and gas resources throughout the 21st century ling et al 2015 tight carbonate reservoirs are widely believed to be one of the primary reserve rocks for unconventional oil and gas resources especially saline lacustrine tight carbonate reservoirs formed in the inland brackish water saline lacustrine basins and salt lake basins have gained much attention recently zhao 2015 zhang et al 2020 due to the unique saline lacustrine sedimentary environment with complicated geological conditions the saline lacustrine carbonate reservoirs are rich in salt and clay minerals compared to common carbonate reservoirs huang et al 2018 mohammed sajed and glover 2020 these minerals are susceptible to external working fluids potentially leading to severe formation damage during related engineering operations for instance salt minerals are easily dissolved in low salinity fluids which correspondingly induces substantial changes in petrophysical properties li et al 2019 the stability of clay minerals is prone to being weakened by external incompatible working fluids resulting in fluid sensitivity and permeability impairment zhang et al 2019 zhao et al 2019 furthermore salt dissolution can significantly affect the stability of clay minerals for saline lacustrine carbonate reservoirs the salinity can reach upwards of 20 104 30 104 mg l being in a state of physicochemical equilibrium with rock zhang et al 2020 also extension microfractures are well developed in tight carbonate reservoirs providing the main seepage channels for oil and gas production zeng et al 2012 these developed microfractures frequently lead to uncontrollable working fluid loss the drilling practices indicate that the salinity of formation water is usually much higher than that of working fluids zhang et al 2020 the invasion of large volumes of low salinity working fluids disrupts this equilibrium state inducing the salt dissolution behavior and consequently resulting in petrophysical properties changes by enlarging the pore fracture size tan et al 2020 even though the enlargement of the seepage channels could increase rock conductivity this also potentially in turn aggravates the working fluid loss to control the working fluid loss pore structure should be determined in the laboratory after salt dissolution pore size is a critical parameter to optimize the particle size distribution for lost circulation control which could be obtained by several laboratory measurements including high pressure mercury intrusion hpmi n2 adsorption experiments and nuclear magnetic resonance nmr wang et al 2018 the non destructive x ray computed tomography x ct technique with high resolution is widely utilized for spatial distribution characteristics of rock pore structure with the rapid development of computer performance lai et al 2018 combing with image processing software the x ct technique can reconstruct the inner pore structure of rock samples by 3d visualization rock porosity and permeability comprehension are critical for formation damage control and reservoir evaluation several empirical and theoretical models can predict porosity and permeability during mineral dissolution bartels et al 2005 guarracino et al 2014 however are barely suitable for the saline lacustrine reservoirs although salt dissolution can improve rock porosity and permeability sensitive clay minerals in saline lacustrine reservoirs also react with the low salinity fluids leading to mineral dispersion swelling and migration these reactions can narrow or plug the seepage channels leading to the reduction of porosity and permeability therefore the changes in porosity and permeability for saline lacustrine reservoirs are jointly controlled by both salt dissolution and clay dispersion swelling migration which was not taken into consideration in current models thereby reducing the versatility of these models a more general model should be proposed considering the reaction between salt minerals clay minerals and low salinity working fluids accordingly accurately characterizing changes in petrophysical properties due to salt dissolution is critical for efficient drilling and development of saline lacustrine carbonate reservoirs the reaction between water and tight carbonate rock has been widely investigated research on water rock reactions in carbonate rocks currently focuses on carbonate minerals calcite dolomite etc under acidic conditions andriamihaja et al 2019 garcia rios et al 2014 tutolo et al 2014 in general there are less mineralogical species in conventional carbonate reservoirs mainly dominated by carbonate minerals with an average content greater than 90 during the reaction between acidic fluids and carbonate minerals in carbonate reservoirs other minerals are less affected by the reaction process compared to conventional carbonate reservoirs saline lacustrine carbonate reservoirs deposited in inland brackish water saline lacustrine basins or salt lake basins are composed of various minerals among which the content of carbonate minerals is usually less than 70 the content of salt minerals in some samples is upwards of 20 huang et al 2018 followed by feldspar and clay minerals the varying mineral compositions can cause the water rock reaction to become more complex and intense than typical carbonate reservoirs with relatively simple mineral compositions the variable mineral compositions have not been widely investigated especially in petroleum engineering potentially posing a significant challenge to drilling safety and hydrocarbon development this work aims to understand salt dissolution of saline lacustrine carbonate reservoirs during the invasion process of low salinity working fluids and quantify the changes in petrophysical properties induced by salt dissolution low salinity waterflooding experiments were conducted on core samples from saline lacustrine carbonate reservoirs dissolved ion compositions during dissolution were analyzed to determine the dissolved salt minerals then several pore scale core analysis techniques including scanning electron microscopy sem hpmi n2 adsorption test and x ct were utilized to quantify the variations of pore microstructures based on the experimental data an empirical model expressing the porosity and permeability evolution of saline lacustrine carbonate reservoirs during salt dissolution was proposed accounting for clay swelling behavior subsequently stress sensitivity and triaxial mechanical tests were conducted to analyze rock strength before and after salt dissolution implications of salt dissolution were discussed to put forward the measures for formation damage control of saline lacustrine reservoirs this work can improve the understanding of reaction mechanisms between reactive fluids and carbonate rock 2 materials and methods 2 1 sample preparation experimental samples were obtained from a saline lacustrine carbonate reservoir located in the yingxi area of the qaidam basin in northwestern china this reservoir was deposited under the continental saline lacustrine sedimentary environment causing it to be rich in salt minerals such as halite anhydrite glauberite and other evaporite minerals fig 1 huang et al 2018 the mineral components of this reservoir primarily are dolomite 26 1 wt calcite 14 3 wt quartz 10 9 wt feldspar 9 4 wt pyrite 7 5 wt clay minerals 24 7 wt comprised of mixed layer of illite smectite 6 2 wt illite 13 5 wt and chlorite 5 0 wt and salt minerals 7 1 wt tan et al 2020 reservoir porosity and permeability range from 2 77 to 12 26 and 0 0047 0 0616 md respectively tan et al 2020 two samples drilled from different depths were first cut cylindrically into specimens about 2 5 cm in diameter 4 6 cm in length for experiments fig 2 each core sample was then cut radially into two samples with the same length set as a control group and experimental group respectively to explore the effect of salt dissolution on petrophysical properties 2 2 methods 2 2 1 core flooding experiment because salt minerals could be highly dissolved in low salinity fluids deionized water with ph of about 6 8 was used for core flooding experiments to investigate salt dissolution behavior of saline lacustrine carbonate rock the apparatus schematic for core flooding experiments can be found in our previous work tian et al 2018 and is shown in fig 3 this apparatus was self assembled and consists of a pressure control pump core holder pressure sensor and data collecting system the core plug was first placed into the core holder with a confining pressure of 7 mpa experimental fluids were pumped under a constant flow pressure differential of 3 mpa with a back pressure of 2 mpa into the sample core per the chinese oil industry standard sy t 5358 2010 formation damage evaluation by flow test and the work of tian et al 2018 under such pressure conditions more dominated seepage channels in tight reservoirs can provide effective conductivity for fluids once the deionized water is in direct contact with the salts salt dissolution is triggered the outlet fluids were collected at specific intervals during the core flooding process to analyze the ion species and concentration using an ion chromatograph ic6100a the outlet fluid flow rate was monitored in real time to calculate the rock permeability 2 2 2 microstructure characterization several pore scale measurements were conducted to investigate the variations of micro pore structure in detail induced by salt dissolution which are considered as the critical methods to reveal the micro mechanism sem quanta450 was used to observe the micropore structure and mineral state variations before and after salt dissolution in addition hpmi poremaster60 and n2 adsorption test nova 2000e were used to quantitatively analyze the changes in pore structure before and after core flooding experiments the capillary pressure curve adsorption isotherm and pore size distribution were obtained through the above tests the hpmi test determined pore sizes from tens of nanometers to hundreds of microns the n2 adsorption test determined the nanopores with sizes less than 100 nm lai et al 2018 tan et al 2020 2 2 3 x ray computed tomography the selected core samples have an ultra tight pore system mainly composed of nano intercrystal pores before salt dissolution tan et al 2020 after core flooding experiments the x ct scanning system skyscan2211 with a pixel resolution of 13 μm was performed on the core plugs and more than 1 000 slice 2d gray images were obtained under the current resolution pores smaller than 13 μm could not be detected because our previous work indicated that nano scale pores dominate the pore system of saline lacustrine carbonate reservoir and those pores with a size less than 13 μm take more than 90 proportion of total pores before the core flooding experiment tan et al 2020 there is no need to conduct the x ct scanning with a pixel resolution of 13 μm on the untreated samples for the cm scale core plug a median filter first enhanced the quality of these images to reduce the noise before segmenting the images then these gray images were binarized by the threshold value determined by the porosity φ 1 where the pores fractures and rock framework are separable φ 1 was first calculated by the actual tested porosity the bulk apparent porosity minus the porosity occupied by pores smaller than 13 µm determined by hpmi finally 3d visualization of the dissolution pore network was extracted and their geometric features were analyzed all procedures mentioned above were conducted using avizo software 2 2 4 porosity and permeability test porosity and permeability as the macro continuous scale properties of rock are highly altered due to salt dissolution during the core flooding process understanding the porosity and permeability evolution is helpful to artificially control or take advantage of the salt dissolution according to the definition of rock porosity temporal porosity is closely related to the total dissolved volume of minerals for this reason the dissolved mineral compositions are first determined based on the ion compositions in outlet fluids thus rock temporal porosity φ could be estimated by eq 1 luquot and gouze 2009 1 φ t φ o 1 v 1 ρ i q t c i t d t where φ 0 is the initial porosity v is the core plug volume i is the mineral type index ρ is the mineral density c is the mineral concentration q is the outlet flow rate rock temporal permeability k during the core flooding process could be calculated based on the outlet flow rate according to darcy s law as expressed in eq 2 2 k t μ l q t a δ p where μ is the fluid viscosity l and a are the length and cross sectional area of the core plug p is the pressure differential between the inlet and outlet of the experimental sample 2 2 5 mechanical test generally mineral dissolution highly affects rock strength and is essential for safe drilling and formation damage control here stress sensitivity and triaxial mechanical tests were conducted to determine the effect of salt dissolution on the mechanical properties of saline lacustrine carbonate reservoirs due to the ultra tight matrix of the experimental samples before salt dissolution the pressure attenuation method pam was introduced to evaluate the stress sensitivity behavior instead of the steady state test in the pam procedures the flow pressure exerted at the inlet of cores gradually decays while experimental fluid flows into the cores under the inlet pressure the better the conductivity of cores the faster the fluid flows through the cores and the more quickly the flow pressure decays according to pam rock permeability is inversely proportional to the pressure half life time as expressed by eq 3 see appendix a for more detail tan et al 2021 the pressure transducer automatically monitored the process of pressure attenuation once a flow pressure of 3 mpa was exerted by pure nitrogen n2 at the inlet of core samples the upstream gas supply was shut off then n2 flowed through the core sample to the atmosphere leading to the attenuation of upstream pressure the experiment was not stopped until the pressure decayed to half of the initial one the stress sensitivity coefficient developed by jones and owens 1980 jones and owens 1980 was adopted to evaluate the permeability stress sensitivity degree as shown in eq 4 the greater the stress sensitivity coefficient the stronger the stress sensitivity and the higher the permeability loss rate of the rock sample during stress loading the permeability recovery rate prr was also used to evaluate the permeability damage induced by stress sensitivity defined as the ratio of the ultimate permeability after stress unloading and the initial permeability 3 k t 1 4 s s 1 k i k o 1 3 lg σ i σ o 1 t o t i 1 3 lg σ i σ o 5 prr k o k o 100 t o t o 100 where t is the pressure half life time σ o and σ i are the effective stress at the initial and varying confining pressure respectively t o and t i are the pressure half life time under the initial and various effective stresses respectively t o and k o are the ultimate pressure half life time and permeability after stress unloading respectively s s is the stress sensitivity coefficient at the stress loading process prr is the permeability recovery rate after the stress unloading the triaxial mechanical test rtr 1000 was conducted on experimental samples before and after salt dissolution under a confining pressure of 40 mpa and temperature of 70 2 2 6 scale specification the saline lacustrine carbonate reservoir is characterized with multiscale pore system ranging from nano scale to macro scale tan et al 2020 in particular quantitatively nano scale pores refer to those pores with size less than 0 1 μm micro scale pores represent the pores with size in the range of 0 1 100 μm macro scale pores refer to those pores with size larger than 100 μm qualitatively the changes of petrophysical properties induced by salt dissolution in current work was analyzed in two scale aspects namely pore scale properties and continuous scale properties the pore scale properties could be investigated by sem hpmi test n2 adsorption test and x ct scanning to analysis the micro changes of pore structures in detail and the continuous scale properties are reflected by the evaluation of rock porosity permeability evolution 3 results and discussion 3 1 ion and mineral compositions salt dissolution in low salinity fluids is believed to be an ionization process as shown in eq 6 which shows that the reactants are ionized into anions and cations ion compositions in outlet fluids during core flooding experiments were detected as shown in fig 4 indicating that the dominant ions generated from salt dissolution are composed of na ca2 cl and so4 2 other ion compositions were also detected in outlet fluids such as k mg2 co3 2 hco3 etc due to the extremely low concentration these ions were neglected besides the fluid ph after core flooding experiments slightly increases to about 7 1 6 r α h 2 o m p a n n p b m as presented in fig 4 except for na the concentration evolutions of the other three ions during the core flooding process shows a trend of continuous decrease in contrast each cumulative ion mass in the outlet fluid increases rapidly after t 0 6 indicating that the degree of salt dissolution significantly increases as salt minerals dissolve the rock seepage capacity improves and the increasing rate of flow rate is higher than the increase in ion mass leading to the reduction of ion concentration liang et al 2008 fig 5 shows the increasing rate of cumulative mass of ion compositions calculated by eqs 7 8 during core flooding experiments indicating an increasing fluid flux due to salt dissolution which further promotes salt dissolution after t 0 6 in addition it could be reasonably speculated from salt mineral compositions of the current reservoir that the dissolved na possibly be generated from halite and glauberite cl from halite alone ca2 and so4 2 from anhydrite and glauberite differently the concentration of na shows a trend of first increasing and then decreasing as shown in fig 4a and fig 4c na concentration has the same trend as cl with a slightly decreasing trend before t 0 4 which indicates that na is mainly generated from halite and glauberite these two minerals are barely dissolved in this period after t 0 4 glauberite begins to dissolve fig 6 and produces a lot of na temporarily increasing na concentration in outlet fluids with mineral dissolution after t 0 8 the dissolved mass of glauberite increases no more fig 6 and na concentration gradually decreases due to the same reason as other ions decreases the molar concentration evolution trends of ca2 and so4 2 are very similar and are much higher than that of na and cl fig 4 suggesting that the anhydrite content in the experimental sample is much higher than halite 7 φ φ i φ min φ max φ min φ m k φ t 8 r δ φ δ t φ i 1 φ i t i 1 t i the dominant salt minerals involved in dissolution are inferred according to the conservation law of molar mass including halite nacl 1 66 wt anhydrite caso4 7 32 wt and glauberite na2so4 caso4 0 98 wt the temporal evolution in a dissolved mass of salt minerals is presented in fig 6 the transformation of these salt minerals into ionic states in low salinity fluids is expressed by chemical eqs 9 11 it should be noted from eqs 9 11 thst the salt mineral content inferred above is lower than the actual content in the core samples especially anhydrite and glauberite halite can be completely ionized into na and cl thus the inferred halite content is basically equivalent to the real one however most anhydrite swells and is converted into gypsum caso4 2h2o by water absorption under low salinity conditions reducing porosity and permeability sanchez roa et al 2020 li et al 2019 nevertheless some anhydrite can be dissolved to generate ca2 and so4 2 slightly increasing porosity and permeability for this reason the inferred anhydrite content excludes those that swell and is converted into gypsum glauberite is first transformed to hydroglauberite and then decomposed to gypsum and sodium sulfate aqueous solution similar to anhydrite salt dissolution is believed to increase void volume and the void volume in the experimental sample is theoretically expected to increase by 2 05 cm3 which indicates that the porosity increases by about 7 due to salt dissolution 9 nacl h 2 o na cl 10 caso 4 2 h 2 o caso 4 2 h

structure 3 2 1 microstructure observation pore structure and mineral stability are highly affected by mineral dissolution khather et al 2017 liu and mostaghimi 2017 the experimental samples that were collected from the saline lacustrine carbonate reservoir are rich in salt and clay minerals fig 7 a the sem images show that salt minerals initially occurs extensively on the surface of the rock framework fig 7a1 salt minerals stably cement much of the clay minerals to the rock framework fig 7a2 also some clay minerals are entirely covered by salt minerals which would not come in direct contact with low salinity fluids before salt dissolution occurs after the invasion of low salinity fluids salt mineral dissolution is induced once low salinity fluids contacts the surface of the salt minerals as shown in fig 7b1 salt dissolution reduces the degree of cementation between other minerals and rock framework leading to mineral detachment and microfracture initiation bennion 2002 the detached mineral fines can migrate and block the narrow pore throats resulting in permeability decline and formation damage fines migration is widely considered as one of the most serious formation damage mechanisms possibly causing irreversible physical damage to permeability pudlo et al 2015 microfractures induced by mineral detachment significantly improve rock permeability while also potentially increasing the risk of lost circulation and exacerbating the degree of lost circulation causing hard to control solid liquid damage to reservoir kang et al 2014 furthermore the invasion of low salinity fluids also results in clay dispersion e g illite and swelling e g the mixed layer illite smectite the dispersed clay minerals are susceptible to fines migration due to fluid drag and the swelled clay minerals can narrow the seepage channels reducing rock permeability and further damaging the formation formation damage caused by clay dispersion is permanent due to mechanical action while mineral swelling is believed to be a reversible process leading to temporary impairment in permeability civan and knapp 1987 as mentioned above the invasion process of low salinity fluids into saline lacustrine rock can be expressed as shown in fig 7c in the initial state saline lacustrine rock is saturated with high salinity formation water and the fluid rock system is in a state of physicochemical equilibrium salt minerals are widely distributed on the surface of the rock framework fig 7c1 as low salinity fluids invade the sample the salinity of the fluid rock system decreases and salt dissolution is gradually triggered fig 7c2 salt dissolution broadens the effective seepage channels and significantly increases porosity and permeability noiriel et al 2004 for saline lacustrine reservoirs sensitive clay minerals coexist with salt minerals with the continuing dissolution of salt minerals more and more clay minerals are exposed along the seepage channels which can potentially induce fluid sensitivity damage wilson et al 2014 as shown in fig 7c3 salt minerals are completely dissolved and clay minerals suffer from swelling and migration when directly in contact with the low salinity fluid which reduces rock porosity and permeability 3 2 2 3d visualization the ct results of the experimental core after core flooding are presented in fig 8 to show the spatial distribution characteristics of the dissolution pores a high resolution electron microscope was utilized to observe the local changes of the two flat surfaces of the core sample as shown in fig 8a after salt dissolution numerous dissolution pores form at the core upstream side in contrast fewer dissolution pores could be distinguished on the downstream side this is caused by direct contact with more low salinity fluids on the upstream side and a higher concentration gradient compared to the downstream side more than 1 000 slice 2d gray images were obtained by x ct scanning with a resolution of 13 μm the first image is shown in fig 8b1 it should be noted that numerous dissolution pores with sizes less than 13 μm were not counted in these images plenty of dissolution pores are observed in the 2d gray images shown as the dark gray areas and the apparent defects created by salt dissolution are observed at the edges of the images fig 8b1 after median filtering and threshold segmentation a 3d volume rendering function in avizo software was adopted to reconstruct the core sample as shown in fig 8b2 three micro interconnected pore channels through the core created by salt dissolution under the current scanning resolution were detected by the axis connectivity function and extracted as shown in fig 8b3 these interconnected pores significantly improve rock conductivity for working fluid invasion or hydrocarbon production the pore size distribution of dissolution pores was calculated using the analysis modules in avizo pore size primarily range from 20 to 100 μm fig 8c the quantity of which accounts for more than 90 of all dissolution pores the maximum radius of dissolution pores is up to 3000 μm the distribution characteristics of dissolution pores can be used to reflect the spatial characteristics of salt minerals because salt minerals generate dissolution pores under low salinity conditions the volume fraction function in avizo software analyzed the surface porosity along the core axis after salt dissolution fig 8d indicating that the absolute surface porosity ranges from 3 80 to 6 05 this does not consider pores smaller than 13 μm this value is much lower than the actual one by about 10 as tested by the cms 300 core measurement system along the core axis as the amount of low salinity fluids in contact with rock decreases the degree of salt dissolution decreases leading to a gradually decreasing surface porosity from top to bottom fig 8d in addition the porosity of interconnected pores i e effective porosity is between 1 21 and 2 83 accounting for about 45 of the absolute porosity and providing all the permeability in the core sample 3 2 3 pore size pore structures of saline lacustrine tight carbonate reservoirs are characterized as a multiscale pore system widely ranging from nano scale to micro scale with poor connectivity pore size significantly influences mineral dissolution and also changes with it beckingham 2017 accurate characterization of the changes in pore size due to dissolution is essential to understand the process and mechanisms of mineral dissolution the results of the hpmi test and n2 adsorption test to the experimental core before and after salt dissolution are presented in fig 9 as shown in fig 9a1 the capillary pressure curve before core flooding has a broader upper right platform indicating that the pore throat size of the rock sample before salt dissolution is relatively concentrated and better sorted the threshold pressure where mercury begins to enter rock samples reaches 44 31 mpa and the maximum mercury intrusion saturation only reaches 60 suggesting poor connectivity between pores before salt dissolution after core flooding the broad upper right platform in the capillary pressure almost disappears and the mercury intake curve shows a continuous upward trend indicating that both the continuity of the pore throat size distribution and connectivity between pores are greatly enhanced by salt dissolution additionally the threshold pressure significantly decreases to less than 1 mpa and maximum mercury intrusion saturation increases by more than 25 the pore system after salt dissolution can provide more space for oil and gas the pore throat size distributions were obtained from the capillary pressure curves fig 9a2 initially the pore system is dominated by nano scale pores and pore throat size distribution is mostly less than 0 05 μm salt dissolution increases the proportion of the pore throats with radii between 0 01 and 10 μm potentially created from the enlargement of existing nano scale pores or the generation of new pores however due to apparatus limitation of the hpmi test larger pore throats in the core samples after salt dissolution have not been effectively characterized which could be conducted by x ray ct technology fig 8c according to the results of the hpmi test the maximum pore throat size after salt dissolution can reach about 150 μm although the enlargement of pore throats can enhance rock conductivity it also exacerbates the invasion of the working fluids because nano scale pores dominate the pore system of the original sample n2 adsorption tests were utilized to better understand the effect of salt dissolution on nanopores fig 9b fig 9b1 shows the adsorption desorption isotherms before and after core flooding experiments classified as a type ii with a type b hysteresis loop anovitz and cole 2015 indicating no obvious changes in the shape de boer 1958 suggested that the different isotherm shapes are closely related to different pore shapes thus no obvious change in the isotherm shape suggests that the shape of the nanopores in the saline lacustrine carbonate reservoir is barely affected by salt dissolution furthermore almost no difference is observed in the size distribution curves of nano scale pores before and after salt dissolution ranging from 0 001 to 0 01 μm fig 9b2 overall salt dissolution appears to have little effect on nano scale pores especially pores with a radius of less than 0 01 μm and the generation of new pores mainly causes the increase in the number of pores with a radius ranging from 0 01 to 10 μm in addition this phenomenon also suggests that salt minerals are scarcely distributed on the surface of nano scale pores 3 3 porosity and permeability evolution porosity evolution during the mineral dissolution process is highly dependent on the total volume of salt dissolution that occurs at each elapsed period according to the ion compositions halite anhydrite and glauberite are the main salt minerals that undergo dissolution thus eq 1 evaluating the temporal porosity during salt dissolution can be expressed as eq 12 temporal permeability is calculated by real time flow rate and pressure difference based on darcy s law 12 φ t φ o 1 v q t c halite t ρ halite c anhydrite t ρ anhydrite c glauberite t ρ glauberite d t the initial porosity and permeability of the core sample before core flooding are 6 33 and 0 0102 md respectively fig 10 a shows the temporal evolution of dimensionless porosity and permeability during the core flooding process the dimensionless parameters are defined as eq 7 the porosity and permeability have a power relationship with the elapsed time with correlation coefficient r2 0 95 under the current conditions of a confining pressure of 7 mpa and a displacement pressure of 3 mpa different pressure combinations lead to different temporal evolution relationship of porosity and permeability with elapsed time nogues et al 2013 additionally the increasing rates of porosity and permeability are calculated by eq 8 to compare the increasing rate of porosity and permeability shown in fig 10b before dimensionless time t 0 65 the increasing rate of porosity is slightly higher than that of permeability as is well known rock porosity is highly dependent on the pore bodies while permeability is essentially controlled by pore throats the result indicates that salt dissolution at this time mainly occurs in disconnected areas or pore bodies which has little effect on permeability but can significantly increase rock porosity between 0 65 and 0 80 porosity increases at almost the same rate as permeability salt dissolution gradually broadens the pore throat channels increasing the permeability rate when dimensionless time is greater than 0 80 salt dissolution further promotes connectivity between pores and widens the seepage channels as a result the rate of increase in permeability is greater than that of porosity the power law relationship between relative permeability and relative porosity during salt dissolution is displayed in fig 10c which is expressed as k k 0 φ φ 0 n doyen 1988 where n is the power law exponent related to the tortuosity fractal dimension guarracino et al 2014 after salt dissolution the calculated ultimate porosity based on eq 12 reaches 13 38 about 2 2 times the initial value however the tested porosity after dissolution is 11 35 close to 1 80 times the initial value slightly lower than the calculated porosity as mentioned in section 3 2 1 during the core flooding process although salt mineral dissolution can significantly increase the rock porosity sensitive clay minerals swell when in contact with a low salinity fluids this results in the reduction of rock porosity to some extent accordingly the porosity evolution of saline lacustrine carbonate rock during low salinity fluid flooding is jointly controlled by the combination of salt dissolution and the adverse effects of clay swelling thus to more accurately estimate the rock porosity evolution due to salt dissolution the effect of clay swelling should be taken into consideration as appropriate furthermore the calculated ultimate permeability reaches 0 71 md about 70 times the initial permeability equal to the tested values the model can be used to calculate the actual flow capacity of saline lacustrine carbonate rock aksu et al 2015 suggested the isothermal swelling coefficient λ to evaluate the swelling ability of clay minerals and modify the porosity during the core flooding process expressed as eq 13 thus the power law relationship between permeability and porosity can be improved as shown in eq 14 this new equation can characterize the temporal evolution of permeability and porosity for saline lacustrine reservoirs during low salinity core flooding 13 φ t φ t 1 λ φ swell φ t swell w swell 14 k k 0 λ swell φ 1 λ swell w swell λ swell φ 0 n where φ is the temporal porosity calculated based on total dissolved volume φ is the modified porosity considering clay swelling during the mineral dissolution process w swell is the content of swelling clay minerals 3 4 response of mechanical properties to salt dissolution mineral dissolution changes the rock pore structure to be more porous and permeable further significantly affecting its mechanical properties to be more deformable liang et al 2008 tran et al 2012 stress sensitivity and triaxial mechanical tests were performed to evaluate the effects of salt dissolution on the mechanical properties of saline lacustrine carbonate rock due to low salinity core flooding fig 11 3 4 1 stress sensitivity stress sensitivity of a rock reflects the rock compressibility and permeability changes due to stress loading fig 11a shows the results of stress sensitivity evaluation of saline lacustrine carbonate rock before and after salt dissolution the trends of the two stress sensitivity curves before and after salt dissolution are entirely different rock permeability generally decreases with the increase in effective stress during stress loading as shown in fig 11a when effective stress is less than 15 mpa rock permeability decreases by about 50 60 the curve trend suggests that rock permeability after salt dissolution decreases faster at this stage owing to the easily compressed larger pores in the range of hundred nano to micron scale created by salt dissolution after an effective stress greater than 15 mpa the change in the stress sensitivity behavior is just the opposite of the first stage the stress sensitivity curve of the core sample after salt dissolution is greater than the curve obtained before indicating that the permeability retention rate is higher than before core flooding according to eq during the stress loading process the stress sensitivity coefficient and permeability loss rate of the experimental core before dissolution are respectively 0 4270 and 88 48 in comparison they are 0 3446 and 69 90 after salt dissolution respectively fig 11c this shows that the degree of stress sensitivity decreases by 19 30 and the permeability retention rate is absolutely improved by 18 58 this indicates that salt dissolution weakens the stress sensitivity of saline lacustrine carbonate rock after stress unloading the permeability recovery rate calculated by eq before dissolution is only 40 91 although it is up to 69 23 after dissolution the permeability recovery rate relatively increases by 69 22 and permeability damage decreases by 56 54 overall salt dissolution can promote permeability recovery after stress unloading and relieve the damage caused by stress sensitivity 3 4 2 rock strength the results of the triaxial mechanical tests of saline lacustrine carbonate rock before and after salt dissolution is shown in fig 11b the stress strain curve after dissolution is less than before dissolution this indicates that the strain of the experimental sample after salt dissolution under the lower stress condition increases this explains the stress sensitivity test results where the decreasing rate of permeability after salt dissolution is greater than before core flooding the elastic modulus characterizes the resistance of solid materials to elastic deformation which decreases by about 43 51 from 28337 20 mpa to 16007 11 mpa fig 11c this indicates that the ability of the rock to resist elastic deformation decreases and the rock is more sensitive to stress loading the compressive strength of rock refers to the strength limit under the application of external forces the reduction of about 61 54 indicates that the saline lacustrine carbonate rock is more easily broken under the stress after salt dissolution additionally the poisson s ratio also decreases by 34 09 fig 11c due to salt dissolution therefore salt dissolution overall reduces the rock strength of saline lacustrine carbonate rock to some extent potentially increasing the risk of borehole instability during drilling fines migration induced by working fluid intrusion and sand production during oil and gas production 4 implications for formation damage control of saline lacustrine reservoir while drilling the invasion of low salinity working fluids into saline lacustrine reservoirs disrupts the physicochemical equilibrium of the formation water rock system consequently resulting in salt mineral dissolution salt dissolution is a common engineering issue encountered in the drilling completion and production of saline lacustrine reservoirs and similar reservoirs yang et al 2020 pilcher and blumstein 2007 austad et al 2015 it has both positive and negative effects on reservoir properties and engineering operations salt dissolution can promote the generation of more pores improve the connectivity between pores and broaden seepage channels which significantly enhances rock conductivity for hydrocarbon production also salt dissolution reduces the content of plastic minerals which reduces plastic deformation under stress loading as a result this could alleviate stress sensitivity damage and improve the rock permeability retention rates during production however our experiments illustrate that salt dissolution can cause clay minerals to be exposed in the seepage channels these exposed clay minerals are prone to fluid sensitivity in a low salinity fluid condition such as swelling dispersion and migration which inevitably causes the seepage channels to shrink or become entirely blocked this then results in a significant decline in permeability wilson et al 2014 alhuraishawy et al 2018 additionally the increased seepage channels due to salt dissolution potentially worsen working fluid loss and induce severe formation damage problems because working fluid loss is widely believed to lead to the most severe types of formation damage zhang et al 2020 kang et al 2014 furthermore excessive salt dissolution significantly weakens rock strength affecting the stability of the wellbore and resulting in reservoir collapse and sand production because salt dissolution is triggered by low salinity fluid invasion controlling fluid invasion or adjusting fluid properties become the essential measures for example during the drilling process of saline lacustrine reservoirs drilling fluid loss is the dominant inducement of salt dissolution that in turn exacerbates the drilling fluid loss generally to effectively control drilling fluid loss the solid particle size distribution should be optimized in advance to plug the pore system according to in situ pore structures under certain stress loading conditions razavi et al 2016 xu et al 2020 however low salinity drilling fluid loss induces salt dissolution resulting in significant pore structure changes this brings a massive challenge for pore structure characterization for saline lacustrine reservoirs pore structures under the dual action of stress loading and salt dissolution should be first determined in the laboratory creating guidance for particle size optimization in drilling fluid drilling fluid loss can be efficiently controlled by a solid phase during the drilling process to control fluid invasion avoid the excessive dissolution of salt dissolution and minimize the related formation damage even though moderate dissolution occurs in addition brine water based drilling fluids are generally prepared by adding a large amount of salt treatment agents based on activity balance between drilling fluids and formation water to completely inhibit salt dissolution overcome the related adverse effects and maintain wellbore stability flak and dearing 2007 with the theory of balanced activity there is theoretically no mass transfer between drilling fluids and rock and correspondingly no salt dissolution in the saline lacustrine rock denney 2011 experimental results in the current work indicate that salt dissolution can positively and negatively affect reservoir properties dissolution can improve the porosity permeability properties of saline lacustrine reservoirs while potentially resulting in formation damage due to clay mineral swelling accordingly the positive effects of salt dissolution can be utilized while restricting the negative effects during drilling therefore it is suggested that moderate salt dissolution is allowed under the precondition that the optimized solid particles in the drilling fluid can effectively plug the pore system after salt dissolution according to this view slightly underbalanced activity between drilling fluids and formation water is recommended by adjusting the salt content in drilling fluids when drilling into the saline lacustrine reservoirs by this method reservoir porosity and permeability can be slightly improved and the cost of salt treatment agents can also be reduced therefore the effect of salt dissolution behavior on saline lacustrine reservoirs should be dialectically understood to fully use its advantages and restrict its disadvantages 5 conclusions low salinity core flooding experiments and several core analysis technologies were conducted to investigate salt dissolution and its effect on the petrophysical properties of saline lacustrine carbonate samples the following conclusions are obtained 1 ion compositions generated from salt dissolution during core flooding experiments are dominated by na ca2 cl and so4 2 the ion compositions indicates that the salt minerals undergoing dissolution in the low salinity fluids include halite anhydrite and glauberite 2 the invasion of low salinity fluids induces salt dissolution to create dissolution pores and microfractures and weakens the stability of clay minerals clay minerals could then be dispersed migrate and swell once exposed salt dissolution considerably develops the connectivity between pores and the number of pores with size in the 0 01 10 μm is dominantly increased it has little effect on the nanopore structure of the saline lacustrine carbonate reservoir 3 rock porosity and permeability are significantly improved by salt dissolution a semi empirical power model expressing porosity permeability evolution for the saline lacustrine reservoir is proposed by considering the salt dissolution and clay swelling during the invasion of low salinity fluids 4 salt dissolution improves the permeability retention recovery rate and slightly reduces the stress sensitivity damage due to the reduction of plastic minerals salt dissolution also significantly

relationship between rock permeability and pressure half life time pressure for pressure attenuation method the volume variation dv 0 of experimental fluid in tiny container in front of core after

2253,the invasion of low salinity fluids into saline lacustrine reservoirs may induce salt dissolution resulting in significant changes in petrophysical properties accurate characterization of these changes due to salt dissolution is critical for efficient drilling and development here low salinity core flooding experiments and several core analysis technologies were employed to investigate the changes in pore structure porosity permeability evolution and mechanical properties ion compositions in outlet fluids analyzed in real time to determine the dissolved salt mineral compositions mainly include halite 1 66 anhydrite 7 32 and glauberite 0 98 salt dissolution produces many dissolution pores especially with sizes ranging from 0 01 to 10 μm broadens the seepage channels and enhances the connectivity between pores which significantly improves rock porosity close to 1 80 times the initial one and permeability to 70 times initial one during the salt dissolution process the stability of clay minerals is weakened to induce dispersion migration and swelling behavior leading to the reduction of porosity and permeability a semi empirical power law relating expressing porosity and permeability for saline lacustrine reservoirs is proposed allowing for salt dissolution and clay swelling during the invasion process of low salinity fluids although salt dissolution could slightly relieve stress sensitivity damage by 56 54 it significantly weakens rock strength by reduction of elastic modulus 43 51 and compressive strength 61 54 the positive and negative effects of salt dissolution on petrophysical properties are critical to guide the development of formation damage control measures for saline lacustrine reservoirs keywords low salinity fluids saline lacustrine reservoir salt dissolution pore structure porosity and permeability data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction accurately understanding the water rock reactions in porous media is critical for scientific and engineering applications including petroleum engineering ma et al 2019 spariharijaona et al 2019 cheng et al 2021 environmental science tsuji et al 2019 geochemical fields sanchez roa et al 2020 marti et al 2021 yuan et al 2019 etc water rock reactions can significantly impact the petrophysical properties specifically pore structures e g pore size connectivity between pores etc porosity and permeability and rock strength ma et al 2019 sanchez roa et al 2020 přikryl et al 2017 to this end extensive efforts have been made to clarify the effect of mineral dissolution on rocks through laboratory experiments yoon et al 2019 bonnet et al 2023 numerical simulations chen et al 2018 and mathematical modeling deng and spycher 2019 salt dissolution is one type of water rock reaction and is defined as the dissolution of the invasion of external low salinity working fluids to salt minerals in reservoir rocks in general reservoir rocks are composed of multiple minerals such as quartz calcite feldspar clay minerals and salt minerals higgins et al 2018 rashid et al 2015 varying minerals show different chemical properties leading to different water rock reaction results and different application potentials for instance since acidic fluids can dissolve carbonate minerals matrix acidizing operation is a commonly used stimulation method for tight carbonate reservoirs mustafa et al 2021 salt minerals are prone to dissolution by low salinity fluids often used in the low salinity waterflooding process to possibly improve the rock conductivity xie et al 2015 qualitatively mineral dissolution can produce numerous dissolution pores increase pore size and correspondingly modify connectivity between pores which has an overall positive role in rock modification yang et al 2020 li et al 2019 however salt dissolution causes the rock matrix to become more porous and deformable weakening the rock strength and causing unexpected consequences liang et al 2008 unconventional hydrocarbon resources have gradually become essential in exploring and developing oil and gas resources throughout the 21st century ling et al 2015 tight carbonate reservoirs are widely believed to be one of the primary reserve rocks for unconventional oil and gas resources especially saline lacustrine tight carbonate reservoirs formed in the inland brackish water saline lacustrine basins and salt lake basins have gained much attention recently zhao 2015 zhang et al 2020 due to the unique saline lacustrine sedimentary environment with complicated geological conditions the saline lacustrine carbonate reservoirs are rich in salt and clay minerals compared to common carbonate reservoirs huang et al 2018 mohammed sajed and glover 2020 these minerals are susceptible to external working fluids potentially leading to severe formation damage during related engineering operations for instance salt minerals are easily dissolved in low salinity fluids which correspondingly induces substantial changes in petrophysical properties li et al 2019 the stability of clay minerals is prone to being weakened by external incompatible working fluids resulting in fluid sensitivity and permeability impairment zhang et al 2019 zhao et al 2019 furthermore salt dissolution can significantly affect the stability of clay minerals for saline lacustrine carbonate reservoirs the salinity can reach upwards of 20 104 30 104 mg l being in a state of physicochemical equilibrium with rock zhang et al 2020 also extension microfractures are well developed in tight carbonate reservoirs providing the main seepage channels for oil and gas production zeng et al 2012 these developed microfractures frequently lead to uncontrollable working fluid loss the drilling practices indicate that the salinity of formation water is usually much higher than that of working fluids zhang et al 2020 the invasion of large volumes of low salinity working fluids disrupts this equilibrium state inducing the salt dissolution behavior and consequently resulting in petrophysical properties changes by enlarging the pore fracture size tan et al 2020 even though the enlargement of the seepage channels could increase rock conductivity this also potentially in turn aggravates the working fluid loss to control the working fluid loss pore structure should be determined in the laboratory after salt dissolution pore size is a critical parameter to optimize the particle size distribution for lost circulation control which could be obtained by several laboratory measurements including high pressure mercury intrusion hpmi n2 adsorption experiments and nuclear magnetic resonance nmr wang et al 2018 the non destructive x ray computed tomography x ct technique with high resolution is widely utilized for spatial distribution characteristics of rock pore structure with the rapid development of computer performance lai et al 2018 combing with image processing software the x ct technique can reconstruct the inner pore structure of rock samples by 3d visualization rock porosity and permeability comprehension are critical for formation damage control and reservoir evaluation several empirical and theoretical models can predict porosity and permeability during mineral dissolution bartels et al 2005 guarracino et al 2014 however are barely suitable for the saline lacustrine reservoirs although salt dissolution can improve rock porosity and permeability sensitive clay minerals in saline lacustrine reservoirs also react with the low salinity fluids leading to mineral dispersion swelling and migration these reactions can narrow or plug the seepage channels leading to the reduction of porosity and permeability therefore the changes in porosity and permeability for saline lacustrine reservoirs are jointly controlled by both salt dissolution and clay dispersion swelling migration which was not taken into consideration in current models thereby reducing the versatility of these models a more general model should be proposed considering the reaction between salt minerals clay minerals and low salinity working fluids accordingly accurately characterizing changes in petrophysical properties due to salt dissolution is critical for efficient drilling and development of saline lacustrine carbonate reservoirs the reaction between water and tight carbonate rock has been widely investigated research on water rock reactions in carbonate rocks currently focuses on carbonate minerals calcite dolomite etc under acidic conditions andriamihaja et al 2019 garcia rios et al 2014 tutolo et al 2014 in general there are less mineralogical species in conventional carbonate reservoirs mainly dominated by carbonate minerals with an average content greater than 90 during the reaction between acidic fluids and carbonate minerals in carbonate reservoirs other minerals are less affected by the reaction process compared to conventional carbonate reservoirs saline lacustrine carbonate reservoirs deposited in inland brackish water saline lacustrine basins or salt lake basins are composed of various minerals among which the content of carbonate minerals is usually less than 70 the content of salt minerals in some samples is upwards of 20 huang et al 2018 followed by feldspar and clay minerals the varying mineral compositions can cause the water rock reaction to become more complex and intense than typical carbonate reservoirs with relatively simple mineral compositions the variable mineral compositions have not been widely investigated especially in petroleum engineering potentially posing a significant challenge to drilling safety and hydrocarbon development this work aims to understand salt dissolution of saline lacustrine carbonate reservoirs during the invasion process of low salinity working fluids and quantify the changes in petrophysical properties induced by salt dissolution low salinity waterflooding experiments were conducted on core samples from saline lacustrine carbonate reservoirs dissolved ion compositions during dissolution were analyzed to determine the dissolved salt minerals then several pore scale core analysis techniques including scanning electron microscopy sem hpmi n2 adsorption test and x ct were utilized to quantify the variations of pore microstructures based on the experimental data an empirical model expressing the porosity and permeability evolution of saline lacustrine carbonate reservoirs during salt dissolution was proposed accounting for clay swelling behavior subsequently stress sensitivity and triaxial mechanical tests were conducted to analyze rock strength before and after salt dissolution implications of salt dissolution were discussed to put forward the measures for formation damage control of saline lacustrine reservoirs this work can improve the understanding of reaction mechanisms between reactive fluids and carbonate rock 2 materials and methods 2 1 sample preparation experimental samples were obtained from a saline lacustrine carbonate reservoir located in the yingxi area of the qaidam basin in northwestern china this reservoir was deposited under the continental saline lacustrine sedimentary environment causing it to be rich in salt minerals such as halite anhydrite glauberite and other evaporite minerals fig 1 huang et al 2018 the mineral components of this reservoir primarily are dolomite 26 1 wt calcite 14 3 wt quartz 10 9 wt feldspar 9 4 wt pyrite 7 5 wt clay minerals 24 7 wt comprised of mixed layer of illite smectite 6 2 wt illite 13 5 wt and chlorite 5 0 wt and salt minerals 7 1 wt tan et al 2020 reservoir porosity and permeability range from 2 77 to 12 26 and 0 0047 0 0616 md respectively tan et al 2020 two samples drilled from different depths were first cut cylindrically into specimens about 2 5 cm in diameter 4 6 cm in length for experiments fig 2 each core sample was then cut radially into two samples with the same length set as a control group and experimental group respectively to explore the effect of salt dissolution on petrophysical properties 2 2 methods 2 2 1 core flooding experiment because salt minerals could be highly dissolved in low salinity fluids deionized water with ph of about 6 8 was used for core flooding experiments to investigate salt dissolution behavior of saline lacustrine carbonate rock the apparatus schematic for core flooding experiments can be found in our previous work tian et al 2018 and is shown in fig 3 this apparatus was self assembled and consists of a pressure control pump core holder pressure sensor and data collecting system the core plug was first placed into the core holder with a confining pressure of 7 mpa experimental fluids were pumped under a constant flow pressure differential of 3 mpa with a back pressure of 2 mpa into the sample core per the chinese oil industry standard sy t 5358 2010 formation damage evaluation by flow test and the work of tian et al 2018 under such pressure conditions more dominated seepage channels in tight reservoirs can provide effective conductivity for fluids once the deionized water is in direct contact with the salts salt dissolution is triggered the outlet fluids were collected at specific intervals during the core flooding process to analyze the ion species and concentration using an ion chromatograph ic6100a the outlet fluid flow rate was monitored in real time to calculate the rock permeability 2 2 2 microstructure characterization several pore scale measurements were conducted to investigate the variations of micro pore structure in detail induced by salt dissolution which are considered as the critical methods to reveal the micro mechanism sem quanta450 was used to observe the micropore structure and mineral state variations before and after salt dissolution in addition hpmi poremaster60 and n2 adsorption test nova 2000e were used to quantitatively analyze the changes in pore structure before and after core flooding experiments the capillary pressure curve adsorption isotherm and pore size distribution were obtained through the above tests the hpmi test determined pore sizes from tens of nanometers to hundreds of microns the n2 adsorption test determined the nanopores with sizes less than 100 nm lai et al 2018 tan et al 2020 2 2 3 x ray computed tomography the selected core samples have an ultra tight pore system mainly composed of nano intercrystal pores before salt dissolution tan et al 2020 after core flooding experiments the x ct scanning system skyscan2211 with a pixel resolution of 13 μm was performed on the core plugs and more than 1 000 slice 2d gray images were obtained under the current resolution pores smaller than 13 μm could not be detected because our previous work indicated that nano scale pores dominate the pore system of saline lacustrine carbonate reservoir and those pores with a size less than 13 μm take more than 90 proportion of total pores before the core flooding experiment tan et al 2020 there is no need to conduct the x ct scanning with a pixel resolution of 13 μm on the untreated samples for the cm scale core plug a median filter first enhanced the quality of these images to reduce the noise before segmenting the images then these gray images were binarized by the threshold value determined by the porosity φ 1 where the pores fractures and rock framework are separable φ 1 was first calculated by the actual tested porosity the bulk apparent porosity minus the porosity occupied by pores smaller than 13 µm determined by hpmi finally 3d visualization of the dissolution pore network was extracted and their geometric features were analyzed all procedures mentioned above were conducted using avizo software 2 2 4 porosity and permeability test porosity and permeability as the macro continuous scale properties of rock are highly altered due to salt dissolution during the core flooding process understanding the porosity and permeability evolution is helpful to artificially control or take advantage of the salt dissolution according to the definition of rock porosity temporal porosity is closely related to the total dissolved volume of minerals for this reason the dissolved mineral compositions are first determined based on the ion compositions in outlet fluids thus rock temporal porosity φ could be estimated by eq 1 luquot and gouze 2009 1 φ t φ o 1 v 1 ρ i q t c i t d t where φ 0 is the initial porosity v is the core plug volume i is the mineral type index ρ is the mineral density c is the mineral concentration q is the outlet flow rate rock temporal permeability k during the core flooding process could be calculated based on the outlet flow rate according to darcy s law as expressed in eq 2 2 k t μ l q t a δ p where μ is the fluid viscosity l and a are the length and cross sectional area of the core plug p is the pressure differential between the inlet and outlet of the experimental sample 2 2 5 mechanical test generally mineral dissolution highly affects rock strength and is essential for safe drilling and formation damage control here stress sensitivity and triaxial mechanical tests were conducted to determine the effect of salt dissolution on the mechanical properties of saline lacustrine carbonate reservoirs due to the ultra tight matrix of the experimental samples before salt dissolution the pressure attenuation method pam was introduced to evaluate the stress sensitivity behavior instead of the steady state test in the pam procedures the flow pressure exerted at the inlet of cores gradually decays while experimental fluid flows into the cores under the inlet pressure the better the conductivity of cores the faster the fluid flows through the cores and the more quickly the flow pressure decays according to pam rock permeability is inversely proportional to the pressure half life time as expressed by eq 3 see appendix a for more detail tan et al 2021 the pressure transducer automatically monitored the process of pressure attenuation once a flow pressure of 3 mpa was exerted by pure nitrogen n2 at the inlet of core samples the upstream gas supply was shut off then n2 flowed through the core sample to the atmosphere leading to the attenuation of upstream pressure the experiment was not stopped until the pressure decayed to half of the initial one the stress sensitivity coefficient developed by jones and owens 1980 jones and owens 1980 was adopted to evaluate the permeability stress sensitivity degree as shown in eq 4 the greater the stress sensitivity coefficient the stronger the stress sensitivity and the higher the permeability loss rate of the rock sample during stress loading the permeability recovery rate prr was also used to evaluate the permeability damage induced by stress sensitivity defined as the ratio of the ultimate permeability after stress unloading and the initial permeability 3 k t 1 4 s s 1 k i k o 1 3 lg σ i σ o 1 t o t i 1 3 lg σ i σ o 5 prr k o k o 100 t o t o 100 where t is the pressure half life time σ o and σ i are the effective stress at the initial and varying confining pressure respectively t o and t i are the pressure half life time under the initial and various effective stresses respectively t o and k o are the ultimate pressure half life time and permeability after stress unloading respectively s s is the stress sensitivity coefficient at the stress loading process prr is the permeability recovery rate after the stress unloading the triaxial mechanical test rtr 1000 was conducted on experimental samples before and after salt dissolution under a confining pressure of 40 mpa and temperature of 70 2 2 6 scale specification the saline lacustrine carbonate reservoir is characterized with multiscale pore system ranging from nano scale to macro scale tan et al 2020 in particular quantitatively nano scale pores refer to those pores with size less than 0 1 μm micro scale pores represent the pores with size in the range of 0 1 100 μm macro scale pores refer to those pores with size larger than 100 μm qualitatively the changes of petrophysical properties induced by salt dissolution in current work was analyzed in two scale aspects namely pore scale properties and continuous scale properties the pore scale properties could be investigated by sem hpmi test n2 adsorption test and x ct scanning to analysis the micro changes of pore structures in detail and the continuous scale properties are reflected by the evaluation of rock porosity permeability evolution 3 results and discussion 3 1 ion and mineral compositions salt dissolution in low salinity fluids is believed to be an ionization process as shown in eq 6 which shows that the reactants are ionized into anions and cations ion compositions in outlet fluids during core flooding experiments were detected as shown in fig 4 indicating that the dominant ions generated from salt dissolution are composed of na ca2 cl and so4 2 other ion compositions were also detected in outlet fluids such as k mg2 co3 2 hco3 etc due to the extremely low concentration these ions were neglected besides the fluid ph after core flooding experiments slightly increases to about 7 1 6 r α h 2 o m p a n n p b m as presented in fig 4 except for na the concentration evolutions of the other three ions during the core flooding process shows a trend of continuous decrease in contrast each cumulative ion mass in the outlet fluid increases rapidly after t 0 6 indicating that the degree of salt dissolution significantly increases as salt minerals dissolve the rock seepage capacity improves and the increasing rate of flow rate is higher than the increase in ion mass leading to the reduction of ion concentration liang et al 2008 fig 5 shows the increasing rate of cumulative mass of ion compositions calculated by eqs 7 8 during core flooding experiments indicating an increasing fluid flux due to salt dissolution which further promotes salt dissolution after t 0 6 in addition it could be reasonably speculated from salt mineral compositions of the current reservoir that the dissolved na possibly be generated from halite and glauberite cl from halite alone ca2 and so4 2 from anhydrite and glauberite differently the concentration of na shows a trend of first increasing and then decreasing as shown in fig 4a and fig 4c na concentration has the same trend as cl with a slightly decreasing trend before t 0 4 which indicates that na is mainly generated from halite and glauberite these two minerals are barely dissolved in this period after t 0 4 glauberite begins to dissolve fig 6 and produces a lot of na temporarily increasing na concentration in outlet fluids with mineral dissolution after t 0 8 the dissolved mass of glauberite increases no more fig 6 and na concentration gradually decreases due to the same reason as other ions decreases the molar concentration evolution trends of ca2 and so4 2 are very similar and are much higher than that of na and cl fig 4 suggesting that the anhydrite content in the experimental sample is much higher than halite 7 φ φ i φ min φ max φ min φ m k φ t 8 r δ φ δ t φ i 1 φ i t i 1 t i the dominant salt minerals involved in dissolution are inferred according to the conservation law of molar mass including halite nacl 1 66 wt anhydrite caso4 7 32 wt and glauberite na2so4 caso4 0 98 wt the temporal evolution in a dissolved mass of salt minerals is presented in fig 6 the transformation of these salt minerals into ionic states in low salinity fluids is expressed by chemical eqs 9 11 it should be noted from eqs 9 11 thst the salt mineral content inferred above is lower than the actual content in the core samples especially anhydrite and glauberite halite can be completely ionized into na and cl thus the inferred halite content is basically equivalent to the real one however most anhydrite swells and is converted into gypsum caso4 2h2o by water absorption under low salinity conditions reducing porosity and permeability sanchez roa et al 2020 li et al 2019 nevertheless some anhydrite can be dissolved to generate ca2 and so4 2 slightly increasing porosity and permeability for this reason the inferred anhydrite content excludes those that swell and is converted into gypsum glauberite is first transformed to hydroglauberite and then decomposed to gypsum and sodium sulfate aqueous solution similar to anhydrite salt dissolution is believed to increase void volume and the void volume in the experimental sample is theoretically expected to increase by 2 05 cm3 which indicates that the porosity increases by about 7 due to salt dissolution 9 nacl h 2 o na cl 10 caso 4 2 h 2 o caso 4 2 h

structure 3 2 1 microstructure observation pore structure and mineral stability are highly affected by mineral dissolution khather et al 2017 liu and mostaghimi 2017 the experimental samples that were collected from the saline lacustrine carbonate reservoir are rich in salt and clay minerals fig 7 a the sem images show that salt minerals initially occurs extensively on the surface of the rock framework fig 7a1 salt minerals stably cement much of the clay minerals to the rock framework fig 7a2 also some clay minerals are entirely covered by salt minerals which would not come in direct contact with low salinity fluids before salt dissolution occurs after the invasion of low salinity fluids salt mineral dissolution is induced once low salinity fluids contacts the surface of the salt minerals as shown in fig 7b1 salt dissolution reduces the degree of cementation between other minerals and rock framework leading to mineral detachment and microfracture initiation bennion 2002 the detached mineral fines can migrate and block the narrow pore throats resulting in permeability decline and formation damage fines migration is widely considered as one of the most serious formation damage mechanisms possibly causing irreversible physical damage to permeability pudlo et al 2015 microfractures induced by mineral detachment significantly improve rock permeability while also potentially increasing the risk of lost circulation and exacerbating the degree of lost circulation causing hard to control solid liquid damage to reservoir kang et al 2014 furthermore the invasion of low salinity fluids also results in clay dispersion e g illite and swelling e g the mixed layer illite smectite the dispersed clay minerals are susceptible to fines migration due to fluid drag and the swelled clay minerals can narrow the seepage channels reducing rock permeability and further damaging the formation formation damage caused by clay dispersion is permanent due to mechanical action while mineral swelling is believed to be a reversible process leading to temporary impairment in permeability civan and knapp 1987 as mentioned above the invasion process of low salinity fluids into saline lacustrine rock can be expressed as shown in fig 7c in the initial state saline lacustrine rock is saturated with high salinity formation water and the fluid rock system is in a state of physicochemical equilibrium salt minerals are widely distributed on the surface of the rock framework fig 7c1 as low salinity fluids invade the sample the salinity of the fluid rock system decreases and salt dissolution is gradually triggered fig 7c2 salt dissolution broadens the effective seepage channels and significantly increases porosity and permeability noiriel et al 2004 for saline lacustrine reservoirs sensitive clay minerals coexist with salt minerals with the continuing dissolution of salt minerals more and more clay minerals are exposed along the seepage channels which can potentially induce fluid sensitivity damage wilson et al 2014 as shown in fig 7c3 salt minerals are completely dissolved and clay minerals suffer from swelling and migration when directly in contact with the low salinity fluid which reduces rock porosity and permeability 3 2 2 3d visualization the ct results of the experimental core after core flooding are presented in fig 8 to show the spatial distribution characteristics of the dissolution pores a high resolution electron microscope was utilized to observe the local changes of the two flat surfaces of the core sample as shown in fig 8a after salt dissolution numerous dissolution pores form at the core upstream side in contrast fewer dissolution pores could be distinguished on the downstream side this is caused by direct contact with more low salinity fluids on the upstream side and a higher concentration gradient compared to the downstream side more than 1 000 slice 2d gray images were obtained by x ct scanning with a resolution of 13 μm the first image is shown in fig 8b1 it should be noted that numerous dissolution pores with sizes less than 13 μm were not counted in these images plenty of dissolution pores are observed in the 2d gray images shown as the dark gray areas and the apparent defects created by salt dissolution are observed at the edges of the images fig 8b1 after median filtering and threshold segmentation a 3d volume rendering function in avizo software was adopted to reconstruct the core sample as shown in fig 8b2 three micro interconnected pore channels through the core created by salt dissolution under the current scanning resolution were detected by the axis connectivity function and extracted as shown in fig 8b3 these interconnected pores significantly improve rock conductivity for working fluid invasion or hydrocarbon production the pore size distribution of dissolution pores was calculated using the analysis modules in avizo pore size primarily range from 20 to 100 μm fig 8c the quantity of which accounts for more than 90 of all dissolution pores the maximum radius of dissolution pores is up to 3000 μm the distribution characteristics of dissolution pores can be used to reflect the spatial characteristics of salt minerals because salt minerals generate dissolution pores under low salinity conditions the volume fraction function in avizo software analyzed the surface porosity along the core axis after salt dissolution fig 8d indicating that the absolute surface porosity ranges from 3 80 to 6 05 this does not consider pores smaller than 13 μm this value is much lower than the actual one by about 10 as tested by the cms 300 core measurement system along the core axis as the amount of low salinity fluids in contact with rock decreases the degree of salt dissolution decreases leading to a gradually decreasing surface porosity from top to bottom fig 8d in addition the porosity of interconnected pores i e effective porosity is between 1 21 and 2 83 accounting for about 45 of the absolute porosity and providing all the permeability in the core sample 3 2 3 pore size pore structures of saline lacustrine tight carbonate reservoirs are characterized as a multiscale pore system widely ranging from nano scale to micro scale with poor connectivity pore size significantly influences mineral dissolution and also changes with it beckingham 2017 accurate characterization of the changes in pore size due to dissolution is essential to understand the process and mechanisms of mineral dissolution the results of the hpmi test and n2 adsorption test to the experimental core before and after salt dissolution are presented in fig 9 as shown in fig 9a1 the capillary pressure curve before core flooding has a broader upper right platform indicating that the pore throat size of the rock sample before salt dissolution is relatively concentrated and better sorted the threshold pressure where mercury begins to enter rock samples reaches 44 31 mpa and the maximum mercury intrusion saturation only reaches 60 suggesting poor connectivity between pores before salt dissolution after core flooding the broad upper right platform in the capillary pressure almost disappears and the mercury intake curve shows a continuous upward trend indicating that both the continuity of the pore throat size distribution and connectivity between pores are greatly enhanced by salt dissolution additionally the threshold pressure significantly decreases to less than 1 mpa and maximum mercury intrusion saturation increases by more than 25 the pore system after salt dissolution can provide more space for oil and gas the pore throat size distributions were obtained from the capillary pressure curves fig 9a2 initially the pore system is dominated by nano scale pores and pore throat size distribution is mostly less than 0 05 μm salt dissolution increases the proportion of the pore throats with radii between 0 01 and 10 μm potentially created from the enlargement of existing nano scale pores or the generation of new pores however due to apparatus limitation of the hpmi test larger pore throats in the core samples after salt dissolution have not been effectively characterized which could be conducted by x ray ct technology fig 8c according to the results of the hpmi test the maximum pore throat size after salt dissolution can reach about 150 μm although the enlargement of pore throats can enhance rock conductivity it also exacerbates the invasion of the working fluids because nano scale pores dominate the pore system of the original sample n2 adsorption tests were utilized to better understand the effect of salt dissolution on nanopores fig 9b fig 9b1 shows the adsorption desorption isotherms before and after core flooding experiments classified as a type ii with a type b hysteresis loop anovitz and cole 2015 indicating no obvious changes in the shape de boer 1958 suggested that the different isotherm shapes are closely related to different pore shapes thus no obvious change in the isotherm shape suggests that the shape of the nanopores in the saline lacustrine carbonate reservoir is barely affected by salt dissolution furthermore almost no difference is observed in the size distribution curves of nano scale pores before and after salt dissolution ranging from 0 001 to 0 01 μm fig 9b2 overall salt dissolution appears to have little effect on nano scale pores especially pores with a radius of less than 0 01 μm and the generation of new pores mainly causes the increase in the number of pores with a radius ranging from 0 01 to 10 μm in addition this phenomenon also suggests that salt minerals are scarcely distributed on the surface of nano scale pores 3 3 porosity and permeability evolution porosity evolution during the mineral dissolution process is highly dependent on the total volume of salt dissolution that occurs at each elapsed period according to the ion compositions halite anhydrite and glauberite are the main salt minerals that undergo dissolution thus eq 1 evaluating the temporal porosity during salt dissolution can be expressed as eq 12 temporal permeability is calculated by real time flow rate and pressure difference based on darcy s law 12 φ t φ o 1 v q t c halite t ρ halite c anhydrite t ρ anhydrite c glauberite t ρ glauberite d t the initial porosity and permeability of the core sample before core flooding are 6 33 and 0 0102 md respectively fig 10 a shows the temporal evolution of dimensionless porosity and permeability during the core flooding process the dimensionless parameters are defined as eq 7 the porosity and permeability have a power relationship with the elapsed time with correlation coefficient r2 0 95 under the current conditions of a confining pressure of 7 mpa and a displacement pressure of 3 mpa different pressure combinations lead to different temporal evolution relationship of porosity and permeability with elapsed time nogues et al 2013 additionally the increasing rates of porosity and permeability are calculated by eq 8 to compare the increasing rate of porosity and permeability shown in fig 10b before dimensionless time t 0 65 the increasing rate of porosity is slightly higher than that of permeability as is well known rock porosity is highly dependent on the pore bodies while permeability is essentially controlled by pore throats the result indicates that salt dissolution at this time mainly occurs in disconnected areas or pore bodies which has little effect on permeability but can significantly increase rock porosity between 0 65 and 0 80 porosity increases at almost the same rate as permeability salt dissolution gradually broadens the pore throat channels increasing the permeability rate when dimensionless time is greater than 0 80 salt dissolution further promotes connectivity between pores and widens the seepage channels as a result the rate of increase in permeability is greater than that of porosity the power law relationship between relative permeability and relative porosity during salt dissolution is displayed in fig 10c which is expressed as k k 0 φ φ 0 n doyen 1988 where n is the power law exponent related to the tortuosity fractal dimension guarracino et al 2014 after salt dissolution the calculated ultimate porosity based on eq 12 reaches 13 38 about 2 2 times the initial value however the tested porosity after dissolution is 11 35 close to 1 80 times the initial value slightly lower than the calculated porosity as mentioned in section 3 2 1 during the core flooding process although salt mineral dissolution can significantly increase the rock porosity sensitive clay minerals swell when in contact with a low salinity fluids this results in the reduction of rock porosity to some extent accordingly the porosity evolution of saline lacustrine carbonate rock during low salinity fluid flooding is jointly controlled by the combination of salt dissolution and the adverse effects of clay swelling thus to more accurately estimate the rock porosity evolution due to salt dissolution the effect of clay swelling should be taken into consideration as appropriate furthermore the calculated ultimate permeability reaches 0 71 md about 70 times the initial permeability equal to the tested values the model can be used to calculate the actual flow capacity of saline lacustrine carbonate rock aksu et al 2015 suggested the isothermal swelling coefficient λ to evaluate the swelling ability of clay minerals and modify the porosity during the core flooding process expressed as eq 13 thus the power law relationship between permeability and porosity can be improved as shown in eq 14 this new equation can characterize the temporal evolution of permeability and porosity for saline lacustrine reservoirs during low salinity core flooding 13 φ t φ t 1 λ φ swell φ t swell w swell 14 k k 0 λ swell φ 1 λ swell w swell λ swell φ 0 n where φ is the temporal porosity calculated based on total dissolved volume φ is the modified porosity considering clay swelling during the mineral dissolution process w swell is the content of swelling clay minerals 3 4 response of mechanical properties to salt dissolution mineral dissolution changes the rock pore structure to be more porous and permeable further significantly affecting its mechanical properties to be more deformable liang et al 2008 tran et al 2012 stress sensitivity and triaxial mechanical tests were performed to evaluate the effects of salt dissolution on the mechanical properties of saline lacustrine carbonate rock due to low salinity core flooding fig 11 3 4 1 stress sensitivity stress sensitivity of a rock reflects the rock compressibility and permeability changes due to stress loading fig 11a shows the results of stress sensitivity evaluation of saline lacustrine carbonate rock before and after salt dissolution the trends of the two stress sensitivity curves before and after salt dissolution are entirely different rock permeability generally decreases with the increase in effective stress during stress loading as shown in fig 11a when effective stress is less than 15 mpa rock permeability decreases by about 50 60 the curve trend suggests that rock permeability after salt dissolution decreases faster at this stage owing to the easily compressed larger pores in the range of hundred nano to micron scale created by salt dissolution after an effective stress greater than 15 mpa the change in the stress sensitivity behavior is just the opposite of the first stage the stress sensitivity curve of the core sample after salt dissolution is greater than the curve obtained before indicating that the permeability retention rate is higher than before core flooding according to eq during the stress loading process the stress sensitivity coefficient and permeability loss rate of the experimental core before dissolution are respectively 0 4270 and 88 48 in comparison they are 0 3446 and 69 90 after salt dissolution respectively fig 11c this shows that the degree of stress sensitivity decreases by 19 30 and the permeability retention rate is absolutely improved by 18 58 this indicates that salt dissolution weakens the stress sensitivity of saline lacustrine carbonate rock after stress unloading the permeability recovery rate calculated by eq before dissolution is only 40 91 although it is up to 69 23 after dissolution the permeability recovery rate relatively increases by 69 22 and permeability damage decreases by 56 54 overall salt dissolution can promote permeability recovery after stress unloading and relieve the damage caused by stress sensitivity 3 4 2 rock strength the results of the triaxial mechanical tests of saline lacustrine carbonate rock before and after salt dissolution is shown in fig 11b the stress strain curve after dissolution is less than before dissolution this indicates that the strain of the experimental sample after salt dissolution under the lower stress condition increases this explains the stress sensitivity test results where the decreasing rate of permeability after salt dissolution is greater than before core flooding the elastic modulus characterizes the resistance of solid materials to elastic deformation which decreases by about 43 51 from 28337 20 mpa to 16007 11 mpa fig 11c this indicates that the ability of the rock to resist elastic deformation decreases and the rock is more sensitive to stress loading the compressive strength of rock refers to the strength limit under the application of external forces the reduction of about 61 54 indicates that the saline lacustrine carbonate rock is more easily broken under the stress after salt dissolution additionally the poisson s ratio also decreases by 34 09 fig 11c due to salt dissolution therefore salt dissolution overall reduces the rock strength of saline lacustrine carbonate rock to some extent potentially increasing the risk of borehole instability during drilling fines migration induced by working fluid intrusion and sand production during oil and gas production 4 implications for formation damage control of saline lacustrine reservoir while drilling the invasion of low salinity working fluids into saline lacustrine reservoirs disrupts the physicochemical equilibrium of the formation water rock system consequently resulting in salt mineral dissolution salt dissolution is a common engineering issue encountered in the drilling completion and production of saline lacustrine reservoirs and similar reservoirs yang et al 2020 pilcher and blumstein 2007 austad et al 2015 it has both positive and negative effects on reservoir properties and engineering operations salt dissolution can promote the generation of more pores improve the connectivity between pores and broaden seepage channels which significantly enhances rock conductivity for hydrocarbon production also salt dissolution reduces the content of plastic minerals which reduces plastic deformation under stress loading as a result this could alleviate stress sensitivity damage and improve the rock permeability retention rates during production however our experiments illustrate that salt dissolution can cause clay minerals to be exposed in the seepage channels these exposed clay minerals are prone to fluid sensitivity in a low salinity fluid condition such as swelling dispersion and migration which inevitably causes the seepage channels to shrink or become entirely blocked this then results in a significant decline in permeability wilson et al 2014 alhuraishawy et al 2018 additionally the increased seepage channels due to salt dissolution potentially worsen working fluid loss and induce severe formation damage problems because working fluid loss is widely believed to lead to the most severe types of formation damage zhang et al 2020 kang et al 2014 furthermore excessive salt dissolution significantly weakens rock strength affecting the stability of the wellbore and resulting in reservoir collapse and sand production because salt dissolution is triggered by low salinity fluid invasion controlling fluid invasion or adjusting fluid properties become the essential measures for example during the drilling process of saline lacustrine reservoirs drilling fluid loss is the dominant inducement of salt dissolution that in turn exacerbates the drilling fluid loss generally to effectively control drilling fluid loss the solid particle size distribution should be optimized in advance to plug the pore system according to in situ pore structures under certain stress loading conditions razavi et al 2016 xu et al 2020 however low salinity drilling fluid loss induces salt dissolution resulting in significant pore structure changes this brings a massive challenge for pore structure characterization for saline lacustrine reservoirs pore structures under the dual action of stress loading and salt dissolution should be first determined in the laboratory creating guidance for particle size optimization in drilling fluid drilling fluid loss can be efficiently controlled by a solid phase during the drilling process to control fluid invasion avoid the excessive dissolution of salt dissolution and minimize the related formation damage even though moderate dissolution occurs in addition brine water based drilling fluids are generally prepared by adding a large amount of salt treatment agents based on activity balance between drilling fluids and formation water to completely inhibit salt dissolution overcome the related adverse effects and maintain wellbore stability flak and dearing 2007 with the theory of balanced activity there is theoretically no mass transfer between drilling fluids and rock and correspondingly no salt dissolution in the saline lacustrine rock denney 2011 experimental results in the current work indicate that salt dissolution can positively and negatively affect reservoir properties dissolution can improve the porosity permeability properties of saline lacustrine reservoirs while potentially resulting in formation damage due to clay mineral swelling accordingly the positive effects of salt dissolution can be utilized while restricting the negative effects during drilling therefore it is suggested that moderate salt dissolution is allowed under the precondition that the optimized solid particles in the drilling fluid can effectively plug the pore system after salt dissolution according to this view slightly underbalanced activity between drilling fluids and formation water is recommended by adjusting the salt content in drilling fluids when drilling into the saline lacustrine reservoirs by this method reservoir porosity and permeability can be slightly improved and the cost of salt treatment agents can also be reduced therefore the effect of salt dissolution behavior on saline lacustrine reservoirs should be dialectically understood to fully use its advantages and restrict its disadvantages 5 conclusions low salinity core flooding experiments and several core analysis technologies were conducted to investigate salt dissolution and its effect on the petrophysical properties of saline lacustrine carbonate samples the following conclusions are obtained 1 ion compositions generated from salt dissolution during core flooding experiments are dominated by na ca2 cl and so4 2 the ion compositions indicates that the salt minerals undergoing dissolution in the low salinity fluids include halite anhydrite and glauberite 2 the invasion of low salinity fluids induces salt dissolution to create dissolution pores and microfractures and weakens the stability of clay minerals clay minerals could then be dispersed migrate and swell once exposed salt dissolution considerably develops the connectivity between pores and the number of pores with size in the 0 01 10 μm is dominantly increased it has little effect on the nanopore structure of the saline lacustrine carbonate reservoir 3 rock porosity and permeability are significantly improved by salt dissolution a semi empirical power model expressing porosity permeability evolution for the saline lacustrine reservoir is proposed by considering the salt dissolution and clay swelling during the invasion of low salinity fluids 4 salt dissolution improves the permeability retention recovery rate and slightly reduces the stress sensitivity damage due to the reduction of plastic minerals salt dissolution also significantly

relationship between rock permeability and pressure half life time pressure for pressure attenuation method the volume variation dv 0 of experimental fluid in tiny container in front of core after

2254,limited dispersion and mass transfer because of hydrogeological heterogeneity make it difficult to deliver remedial reagents to desired locations remediation alternatives that overcome mass transfer limitations are required urgently to improve the efficiency of in situ remediation techniques in this study a combination of two dimensional sandbox experiments and numerical simulations was used to explore the migration process of remedial reagents driven by groundwater circulating well gcw the influences of the circulating flow rate concentration of the remedial reagent h2o2 as a model and cycle operation mode on the migration of gcw enhanced remedial reagents were investigated the flow rate of the pumped water can enhance the concentration gradient at the interface of different permeation zones the redistribution of reagents by increased fick diffusion significantly increased the dispersion range the results of parametric sensitivity analysis showed that the aggregation effect of remedial reagents in the low permeability area 10 7 m s and related to the injection site considering remedial reagents attenuation a reactive transport model can better simulate the concentration changes in low permeability regions r 2 0 960 the numerical simulation results showed that the principal component of the hydrodynamic field was tangential to the main axis of the target area the diffusion coefficient of the low permeability region was one order of magnitude lower than that of the high permeability region 10 3 m s thus the low permeability region was less affected by the hydraulic action of the gcw and had a longer retention time for remedial reagents specific aquifer parameters and operating modes are key engineering design factors of a gcw that should be considered in conjunction with other in situ chemical technologies this study provides some new insights for in situ remediation of contanminated aquifers with a gcw and suggests that i the hydraulic circulation driven by gcw can promote the accumulation of injected remedial agents in low permeability areas especially injection point is located near wellbore and ii residence time of reagents in contaminated areas should be comprehensively considered when chemical remediation technology is coupled with gcw the results of this study can be used to improve the delivery efficiency of remedial reagents in contaminated aquifers keywords groundwater circulation well remedial reagents enhanced delivery reactive transport low permeability aquifer data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction groundwater quality worldwide has deteriorated in recent decades owing to rapid industrialization and the mishandling of hazardous chemicals lin et al 2018 němeček et al 2018 tawabini and makkawi 2018 especially the low permeability area as a secondary pollution source can continue to release pollutants which results in incomplete remediation tatti et al 2018 o connor et al 2018 as a low disturbance technology to underground environments in situ chemical remediation technology makes an important contribution to groundwater remediation siegrist et al 2011 lai et al 2021 wei et al 2022 such technologies involve the injection of reagents or redox manipulating materials such as h2o2 wei et al 2022 kmno4 lian et al 2019 ozone khan and carroll 2020 and persulfate zhen et al 2014 into the aquifer for in situ chemical oxidation or reduction delivering these chemical reagents to target regions and ensuring contact with contaminants therefore the key to the efficiency of in situ technology is the effective mass transfer of remedial reagents and their distribution in the contaminated area using hydraulic injection e g gravity feed and pressurized injection schroth et al 2001 soluble remedial reagents are typically delivered to a target treatment zone relying primarily on advective delivery struse et al 2002 cavanagh et al 2014 head et al 2020 in fact in situ injection technique is only suitable for sandy soils with high permeability while the influence on remediation performance is very limited in low permeability clays below 10 7 m s parker et al 2008 cavanagh et al 2014 lian et al 2019 head et al 2020 reagents injected into the area creates a preferential flow path in the high permeability zone zhong et al 2013 furthermore the slow horizontal flow rate of groundwater results in limited lateral dispersion of injected remedial reagents in porous media kanzari et al 2015 therefore migration of remedial reagents into areas with low permeability is problematic the accurate characterization of the migration process of soluble reagents in hypotonic heterogeneous medium is challenging groundwater circulation well gcw with both pumping and injecting can extract contaminated groundwater from an aquifer through one screened section of a dual screened well and then inject the well treated clean groundwater back into the aquifer through a second screened section in the same well chen and knox 1997 ponsin et al 2014 gcw system can form a crossed circulating flow field with both longitudinal and vertical circulations between the injection and extraction screening intervals which is an important method for promoting mass transfer xia et al 2019 ciampi et al 2019 2021 the gcw has shown great potential for coupling with other technologies to enhance aquifer remediation efficiency yuan et al 2021 for example gcw can enhance the longitudinal migration of surfactants mainly because the circulating well can hydraulically control the surfactant effectively and enhance its effective range of action knox et al 1997 alleman et al 2010 the peripheral multilevel injection wells in combination with gcw induced recirculation to inject electron donors and demonstrated it improves the 3d spread of additives throughout the treatment area ciampi et al 2022 in particular gcws can increase vertical groundwater flow to pass through low permeability lenses johnson and simon 2007 and facilitate back diffusion process of solute tatti et al 2018 the circular flow field line generated from the gcw is orthogonal to the main flow line of the low permeability zone which has high economic utility for the treatment of low permeability areas tatti et al 2019 the coupling of gcw and in situ chemical oxidation may effectively solve the problem of the low efficiency of remedial reagent transmission however the delivery features of remedial reagents driven by hydraulics in low permeability aquifers under conditions of hydraulic excitation of gcw was still unclear numerical model of laplace transform finite difference method was developed to characterize the spatiotemporal distribution of non reactive reagent with advection dispersion in gcw induced flow field chen et al 2010 in fact low permeability regions dominated by clay minerals increase aquifer heterogeneity thereby adding uncertainty to the remedial reagent migration process such as flow around lee et al 2014 adsorption reverse diffusion tatti et al 2018 and reactions crincoli et al 2020 the delivery migration of remedial reagents is accompanied by attenuation adsorption and retardation which lead to errors between the numerical simulation results and physical experiments the attenuation reaction and adsorption of water soluble reagents h2o2 persulfate and permanganate may change their migration in aquifers therefore a migration model with reaction terms may better reflect the migration process of solute likely remedial reagent zhu et al 2020 feng et al 2022 moreover the actual remediation efficiency of contaminated aquifers is significantly affected by formation heterogeneity the dispersion coefficient of heterogeneous strata is lower than that of homogeneous strata and decreases with the decreasing of medium particle size weill et al 2017 aquifer seepage model constructed based on basic hydrogeological parameters can use to characterize the remediation efficiency of the gcw thereby effectively optimizing its design parameters ni et al 2011 you and zhan 2013 tu et al 2019 2020 zhu et al 2020 this process is of great significance for developing the application value of gcw in engineering practice there is a large gap between the results of physical simulations based on hydrogeological parameters dispersion coefficient hydraulic conductivity porosity etc in the laboratory and the simulation results of mathematical models blanford et al 2001 yang et al 2005 therefore the hydrogeological constraints and process parameter optimization scheme of the gcw technology should be explored from the perspective of combining models and physical simulation tests physical experiments and mathematical model simulations for describing the groundwater flow and solute delivery regime are important subjects in subsurface hydrology sutton et al 2000 goltz et al 2008 previous studies have somewhat weakened the combination of laboratory testing and numerical simulation in addition non reactive tracers are mostly used for the migration model which is biased for the actual effects of reactive reagent delivery in this study the properties of the remedial reagent concentration field under a gcw driven flow field were investigated using a two dimensional sandbox experiment and numerical simulation water soluble remedial reagents h2o2 and persulfate were selected as a model solute the comsol program was used to establish a finite composition numerical model for reactive transport of remedial reagents in high low permeability region the characteristics of migration in low permeability areas influenced by the gcw across time scales were analyzed furthermore the effects of injection concentration operation modes and parameters of gcw technology on the delivery mechanism of the injected remedial reagents were considered sensitivity analysis was performed on the parameters concerned in gcw system the concentration field of the remedial reagent h2o2 in the vertical circulation flow field was also evaluated this study is expected to provide a theoretical reference for gcws coupling with in situ chemical remediation technology application of groundwater remediation associated with low permeability lenses in contaminated aquifer 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental 2 1 1 laboratory sandbox experiment the experimental apparatus used to perform the test is illustrated in fig 1 and consisted of a two dimensional plexiglass sandbox with dimensions of 100 6 50 cm length width height geometric model parameters of gcw are listed in table s2 the sandbox consisted of three parts with a central part used to reconstruct the aquifer and two small chambers on both sides there were 32 sampling points in the last four rows of the 40 sampling ports on the front of the simulation tank points 10 and 11 were sampled in the low permeability area the diameter of the gcw was 6 cm and it was wrapped with a filter cloth and placed in the fifth column of the simulation tank a peristaltic closed pump gcw was used to simulate a constant groundwater flow rate of 0 045 m d the reconstructed aquifer consisted of fine sand as the high permeability layer 10 3 m s and illite as the low permeability zone dark grey squares in fig 1 10 7 m s the porosity of the fine sand was measured and calculated using a one dimensional column experiment the size of illite was estimated using a reference estimation tatti et al 2018 2 1 2 test procedure setting of four working conditions under the driving of gcw is described in detail in text s1 briefly 75 ml of the remedial reagent 10 mm was injected at the two points corresponding to injection point 2 fig 1b to ensure that the total volume of each injection is 150 ml the transport of h2o2 and persulfate under natural water flow 0 045 m d was separately investigated in the comparative experiment the migration of remedial reagents under gcw with 10 rpm conditions was introduced in the same state the effect of gcw on the migration process of h2o2 as a model remedial reagent was further studied under different concentrations 5 10 and 20 mm pumping flow rates 10 20 and 30 rpm and pumping and injection methods with the forward and reverse flows in all the experiments 2 ml was sampled from 32 sampling ports at set time intervals continuous operation of the gcw was guaranteed during the sampling process the detailed information can be seen in text s1 of supporting materials 2 1 3 chemical analysis persulfate concentration was determined using the iodometric method waclawek et al 2015 briefly the sample solution was diluted 10 times and 5 ml of color developer ki and nahco3 solution was added subsequently the absorbance was measured at 395 nm using a uv vis spectrometer the concentration of h2o2 was determined using the potassium titanium oxalate colorimetric method sellers et al 1980 briefly one ml of sulfuric acid solution 1 3 and 1 ml of 0 05 m potassium titanium oxalate solution were added to the sample solution the absorbance of the solution after the reaction was measured using a spectrophotometer at a wavelength of 402 nm 2 2 data analysis 2 2 1 accumulated concentration of remedial reagent to quantitatively describe the overall characteristics of the reagent concentration in the low permeability aquifer the average concentration at sampling points in this region was defined as the concentration at the corresponding time point 1 c t c x y t d x d y a where c x y t are the reagent concentrations at each spatial point in the low permeability region at different times mol m3 a is the cross sectional area of the low permeability region m2 and c t is the accumulated concentration of the reagent in the low permeability region mol m3 a concentration contour map was drawn using surfer 17 with kriging interpolation each grid node value is based on known data points adjacent to that node and then it compensates for clustered data by giving less weight to the overall prediction the correlation between the measured and model fitted data of various factors reagent concentration pumping water flow rate and operating mode was analyzed using spss 23 2 2 2 groundwater flow model considering the homogeneous and anisotropic aquifer a finite element numerical model was established using comsol 5 6 the conceptual model of groundwater flow associated with gcw system is shown in fig 1b to simplify the mathematical model this section is based on the following assumptions 1 the aquifer is a confined aquifer of equal thickness and extends horizontally indefinitely 2 the aquifer is homogeneous anisotropy 3 the flow field is a stable flow 4 a cylindrical coordinate system is established with the center of the circulating shaft wellbore as the origin 2 k r 2 h r z r 2 k r r h r z r k z 2 h r z z 2 0 3 h r z r 0 0 z d e q 2 π k r r l e d e d e z l e q 2 π k r r l i d i l i z d i 0 l e z d 4 h r

respectively equation 4 indicates that there is no drawdown far from well equations 5 and 6 are the upper and lower no flow boundary conditions respectively the radial and vertical components of the water flow velocity eq 3 are incorporated into the reagent transport equation to describe remedial reagent transport in a vertically circulating flow field the coefficient of determination of the pearson correlation between the head height fitted by the model and the measured value was 0 916 0 972 fig s1 darcy s law was used to simulate the hydrodynamic field of the sandbox the input value used in the model are listed in table s2 2 2 3 reagent mass delivery model numerical simulations can provide an effective tool for the design and implementation of enhanced remediation of contaminated groundwater in heterogeneous aquifers owing to advection and hydrodynamic dispersion processes using gcw technology the numerical simulation of reagent delivery in an aquifer was carried out using the

s and r i is the reaction part where k p is the solid liquid partition coefficient of the low permeability area which exists only in the low permeability region the decay equation of illite to h2o2 obtained by the batch experiment table s3 the equations used in the model were numerically solved in two dimensions using the finite element method the domain was divided into a regular orthogonal grid with a 0 01 m spacing the neumann condition was used for the bottom and side boundaries of the domain the model was validated by reproducing the laboratory test described in section 2 1 2 and comparing the experimental results with the numerical results the calibration phase was performed by varying the hydrodynamic dispersion coefficient and hydraulic conductivity of the media the aquifer parameters used in the numerical delivery model are listed in table 1 2 2 4 parameter sensitivity analysis to further discuss the influence factors of gcw driven h2o2 migration in different regions a single factor sensitivity analysis was carried out for its parameters low permeability areas area around the well and high permeability areas were selected to concisely and clearly illustrate the influence of various factors on the migration process of h2o2 driven by gcw gray correlation analysis was used to process the data to obtain the correlation coefficient the correlation order of each comparative series was established according to the size of the gray weighted correlation degree sensitivity analysis results of h2o2 migration influencing factors driven by gcw were listed in table s4 the greater the correlation coefficient the greater the importance of the factor to the indicator the more detailed information was shown in text s4 of supporting materials 3 results and discussion 3 1 transport of reagents in natural and vertical circulation flow fields the migration process of the reagents in natural and circulating flow fields was investigated the time dependent distributions of the h2o2 and persulfate concentrations in the natural flow field are shown in fig s2 both reagents migrated from the lift top injection point to the right edge of the sandbox within 3 h lateral migration occurs with groundwater flow under the action of convection the remedial reagents can ideally migrate in the flow field set in this study ensuring the feasibility of subsequent studies in the circulating flow field the migration of the high concentration centers of the reagents in the sandbox exhibited different trends with time the horizontal displacement of the high concentration center and a limited vertical migration were observed this indicates that h2o2 migrated mainly in the horizontal flow field persulfate diffuses both horizontally and vertically and has a relatively fast vertical diffusion rate by contrast persulfate could migrate both horizontally and vertically the retardation factor r is defined as the fraction of an analyte in solute transport in an aquifer system glubt and brusseau 2021 the r value of h2o2 r 1 37 was higher than that of persulfate r 1 23 in the one dimensional sand column experiment fig s4a which indicates a faster migration rate of the former the h2o2 molecules tend to form hydrogen bonds with water molecules to aggregate which can increase the residence time in porous media mo et al 1994 du et al 2005 conversely electrostatic repulsion between persulfate and the negatively charged quartz sand surface can reduce the adsorption retention and accelerate migration in the aquifer moreover the remedial reagents injected into the aquifer migrated vertically under the action of gravity the density effect caused by the larger density of persulfate can also be used to explain its faster migration in the vertical direction konz et al 2009 lian et al 2019 subsequently the concentration of reagents was gradually diluted via hydrodynamic dispersion along the tortuous channels of the porous medium as shown in fig 2 an accelerated migration process of both reagents was observed under the created vertical circulating flow field in the aquifer via the gcw in a recent study the biodegradation rate of chloroethane was significantly significantly accelerated through gcw delivery reagents in field scale ciampi et al 2022 in particular reagents were detected in most sandbox formations within 3 h the breakthrough curve results show that increasing the flow rate can reduce the retardation factor thereby accelerating its migration in the aquifer fig s4b in addition to horizontal migration the concentration distribution of h2o2 was detected at the bottom of the sandbox the intermolecular force for the formation of hydrogen bonds was destroyed with increasing flow rate the concentration accumulation areas of the reagents were flushed out and vertical migration was enhanced by the vertical flow field the lower concentration of remedial reagents near the wellbore was mainly due to the dilution of more cycles in the vicinity because the experimental setup did not involve well construction the influence of other factors on the migration of remedial reagents around the well was not considered here in fact the construction of wells at the site scale causes skin effects which may accelerate or slow down the migration of solutes this is mainly owing to an increase or decrease in the permeability of the area close to the circulating well morozov et al 2021 hence the hydrodynamic field is not an ideal symmetrical flow it is worth noting that the concentration distributions of the two reagents in right area in the sandbox are relatively uniform in the natural flow field fig s2 in left area with the low permeability region migration of the reagent exhibited an obvious flow around phenomenon which can be attributed to the hindrance by the low permeability medium this result is consistent with findings of other studies where permanganate has an obvious bypass phenomenon in the low permeability area containing the pollutants and there are many accumulations at the boundary of high and low permeability areas marble et al 2010 tatti et al 2019 however reagents tend to aggregate in the vertical circulating flow field created by the gcw and even enter low permeability regions fig 2 the enhanced vertical migration process during gcw operation may be the key factor driving the reagent to the low permeability region this promising result could be an advantage for in situ remediation of contaminated low permeability aquifers 3 2 factors influencing gcw driven h2o2 delivery the migration process of a reagent after its injection into an aquifer determines its remediation scope and effect in this study the factors influencing gcw driven reagent migration were investigated considering the more obvious vertical migration phenomenon from gcw fig 2a h2o2 was selected as the model to further explore the influence of different factors on the migration of the gcw enhanced reagent reagents may float or sink during migration in the aquifer owing to density differences between the injected solution and groundwater swartz and schwartz 1998 konz et al 2009 first the effect of injected reagent concentration should be considered density effect is common in groundwater solute delivery and aquifer remediation high concentration h2o2 20 mm preferentially migrates in high permeability areas and the time to fill the sand box is shortened fig s5 which is consistent with the migration properties of permanganate lian et al 2019 the enhanced migration of h2o2 driven by gcw was affected by higher concentration the remedial reagent can better migrate to the bottom of the aquifer under the joint action of density effect and vertical gcw driven in addition hydroscouring from gcw can accelerate the back diffusion process of pollutants from contaminated medium in pollution source area ciampi et al 2019 2023 the effective mixing of injected high concentration remediation reagents and pollutants can improve the remediation efficiency of contaminated sites for example for sites where pollutants such as dense non aqueous liquids have accumulated at the bottom of an aquifer a strategy of gcw coupled pulse injection of high concentration remedial reagents could be considered in addition to the influence of the concentration of the remedial reagents the technological parameters of gcw also have an important influence on the migration process jin et al 2015 as shown in fig s6 increasing the flow rate of pumping and injecting into the gcw can increase the radius of influence a significant enhancement in intensity appeared near the wellbore after the gcw was operated for 1 h at 112 5 ml min h2o2 was already distributed in the entire sandbox fig s7 the result indicates that increasing the flow rate of pumping and injecting can achieve the expansion of the range of influence in a relatively short time a significant diffusion in the high permeability region on the right side of the sandbox was observed under a high flow rate of pumping and injecting fig s7 the longitudinal migration rate of the concentration centroid was accelerated and was mainly affected by dispersion godoy et al 2018 the longitudinal dispersion coefficient increased from 0 005 to 0 05 m with the increase in flow velocity therefore increasing the flow rate of the pumping water can effectively enhance the longitudinal migration of the reagent in the high permeability area a higher concentration of aggregation points was detected at the bottom of the sand box fig s7b which appears to be more effective for remediation of similar dnapl contaminated sites the low permeability area illite 10 7 m s exhibited a marked significant aggregation and retention of the remedial reagent with the increase in the flow rate of the pumped water however solute transport in low permeability areas has little effect this is mainly because the hydraulic action of the gcw increases the force interface to the main axis of low permeability the loss of h2o2 increased with the distance between the injection point and wellbore fig s8a this is mainly attributable to the gradual weakening of the solute capture ability of the gcw away from the wellbore under the combined action of the groundwater flow and gcw hydraulics chen et al 2010 2011 zhu et al 2020 therefore both the injection site and circulation method will affect the transmission process of h2o2 and the injection of reagent near the circulation well is more conducive to its uniform distribution in addition to the common forward flow operation mode reverse flow gcw with bottom up circulation mode is often used for the treatment of pollutants kitanidis and mccarty 2012 but the concentration distribution of the reagent in this circulation mode is not clear in this study the results indicated that the range of action of h2o2 was greatly limited under the action of reverse flow fig s9 compared with the forward flow circulation well drive the water flow disturbance during the reverse flow from gcw driving is different in which the radius of influence is reduced so the scope of the remediation reagent is limited and this is proved by the experimental phenomenon in this study which is mainly due to the need to overcome the gravity process to form vertical upward migration fig s9 due to the continuous increase of remediation reagents in low permeability areas fig 4c the reverse flow operation mode seems to have a certain positive effect on the long term treatment of small scale pollution points the operating mode of forward and reverse flow switching may be a viable strategy to reduce the treatment time of polluted aquifers fig 3 shows the correlation degree between each factor and the correlation coefficient the migration of h2o2 near wellbore is mostly affected by the flow rate of the pumped water this is mainly attributed to the strong hydraulic disturbance near the wellbore the slightly greater concentration coefficient r 0 i around the wellbore indicates that the closer distance to wellbore the stronger the hydraulic driving effect the migration of h2o2 in the high permeability area is mainly affected by the injection concentration as shown in fig s5 high concentration h2o2 has a preferential migration phenomenon in the high permeability region the right area of the sandbox the concentration gradient simultaneously accelerates h2o2 longitudinal migration therefore the concentration and a certain injection distance from the circulation well to the contaminated area of h2o2 in the actual site should be considered the ineffective consumption of the injected remediation reagent caused by the multiple cycles can be effectively controlled the migration of h2o2 in the low permeability area was mainly affected by the injection site r 0 i 0 822 the injection above the low permeability area was more conducive to the migration and aggregation of h2o2 in the low peroxide area in gcw in summary the enhanced migration of h2o2 could be attributed to the high concentration of the reagent the increased flow rate of pumping and injecting and the forward direction operating mode of the gcw these influencing factors should be designed according to the actual site from the perspective of economics and environmental effects of the in situ remediation technology 3 3 enhanced delivery and accumulation of h2o2 in the low permeability aquifer by the gcw system in the sandbox experiment the reagents did not reach the bottom of the aquifer effectively in the simulated natural flow field the change in h2o2 concentration in the low permeability aquifer was compared with and without being driven by the gcw fig 4 the entire reagent plume moved downward and then effectively entered the low permeability area driven by the gcw fig 4a low h2o2 concentrations over an order of magnitude were observed in areas of low permeability during the four time intervals with no driving effect only natural water flow this result indicates that it is difficult for h2o2 to migrate from the high permeability region to the low permeability region relying solely on water flow and natural gravity remediation of contaminated low permeability areas is often very problematic because of the lower hydraulic conductivity 1 6 10 7 m s of the low permeability area than that of the surrounding area zinn et al 2004 tatti et al 2016 the driving force created by the natural water flow is difficult to achieve in these areas however one vertical component of hydraulic excitation in the low permeability region could be formed under driven by gcw fig s9 considering enhanced migration knox et al 1997 and effectiveness for remediation tatti et al 2019 of low permeability formations one possibility is provided for the reagent enter the low permeability region a numerical model was used as an effective tool to represent the accumulation and delivery of solutes from high to low permeability aquifers thereby simulating possible field scenarios as shown in fig 5 driven by the pumping and injection of water a water circulation movement formation in aquifer can generate hydraulic excitation the reagent at the injection point will migrate to the porous medium and accumulated in the low permeability area during the process of pumping and injecting in gcw the model inversion proves that the diffusion coefficient of the low permeability region is one order of magnitude lower than that of near region table 1 as reported in the literature the pore scale flow rate of the low permeability region is less affected by gcw hydraulics mohrlok et al 2010 the principal component of the velocity field is tangential to the main axis of a contaminated area tatti et al 2019 groundwater flow can enhance concentration gradient at the interface between different permeability zones increasing redistribution of trapped contaminant by fick diffusion based on the accumulation and release in the low permeability region the migration of h2o2 includes two processes forward and reverse diffusion from the low into the high permeability region fig 6 a under driven by gcw the efficiency of forward diffusion is significantly higher than that of the reverse diffusion one positive effect from the actuation of gcw can form on the migration and retention of reagents which significantly accumulates h2o2 in low permeability aquifer as shown in fig 6 the cumulative concentration of h2o2 region is further calculated by simulation which can be used to reflect the change of the concentration field hydrogen peroxide moving into the low permeability area is less affected by the water flow but the concentration is mainly reduced by the decomposition of the aquifer medium the effect of concentration is particularly pronounced a gradual accumulation process around and within these media occurs during the first 6 h and then is slowly released or decomposed high concentrations of h2o2 dissipated rapidly in the region of low permeability media after 3 h fig 6 conversely low concentration h2o2 is effectively maintained for 8 h after reaching the peak value this is mainly attributable to the fact that the decomposition rate constant of h2o2 by the low permeability medium increases with its concentration the reagent concentration in the low permeability area is continuously increased until the reagent cannot be replenished the accumulation concentration of reagent in the low permeability region eq 1 indicates that reagent aggregation effect occurs in low permeation area that is at the same time the higher the accumulation concentration of reagent in the low permeability area the better the effect of pollutant remediation in the low permeability area the attenuation term of the remedial reagent was added on the basis of the traditional advection dispersion equation ade tatti et al 2019 to validate the model the concentration of h2o2 measured experimentally in the low permeability region was compared with the data obtained from reactive transport model eq 4 as shown in fig 7 the reactive transport model can better fit the experimental data r 2 0 960 the agreement between the values was considered satisfactory for demonstrating the suitability of the model for reproducing the investigated process the reactive transport model with reaction terms is reproducible for the migration of the remedial reagents in the low permeability region considering the high concentration of h2o2 has the phenomenon of self decomposition that is h2o2 will be consumed by the generated oh in system molamahmood et al 2022 chen et al 2022 these results further indicated that the migration in the low permeability region was mainly affected by the attenuation of the reactive term of the remedial reagents therefore multiple injections of low concentrations in the actual repair project of gcw coupled in situ injection of reagents can be considered to ensure stable oxidation or reduction strength in low permeability region in addition increasing the water flow rate of the gcw enhanced the accumulation of h2o2 in the low permeability region fig 8 which accelerated the forward diffusion of h2o2 but little effect was observed in the gcw reverse diffusion system the dispersion coefficient of the aquifer was determined to be reverse diffusion studies have found that in soils with small particle sizes the dispersion coefficient is small klotz et al 1980 godoy et al 2018 consistent with the simulation results the diffusion coefficient in the low permeability region was six to seven orders of magnitude lower than that in the high permeability region table 1 therefore the migration and accumulation of h2o2 in the low permeability region were enhanced by increasing the pumped water flow rate a more obvious enhancing effect can be observed in fig 8c the highest concentration reached 0 6 mmol l to further compare the enhanced effect in the low permeability area under the different operating modes the reverse flow driven by the gcw under the same conditions was adopted the delivery of h2o2 mainly migrated in the vertical direction of the low permeability region and gradually accumulated over time fig s8b the cumulative concentrations of h2o2 in the high and low permeability areas were also simulated fig s10 the maximum value was reached within the first 3 h under forward flow driving and the regional cumulative concentration remained constant during the following 9 h the accumulated concentration of h2o2 showed an increasing trend under the influence of the countercurrent flow and leveled off after 9 h which is consistent with results of the laboratory process fig 8c this was mainly because the reverse flow changed the direction of the flow field fig s9 such that h2o2 preferentially diffuses into the high permeability region the concentration accumulation of the reagent from the upper well screen under reverse flow circulation was slower than that under forward flow the accumulation time of h2o2 in the reverse flow circulation can be prolonged in the low permeability area which has a positive effect on the continuous and stable treatment of contaminated low permeability areas our research was conducted in a two dimensional sandbox which is a simplification of an actual aquifer owing to limitations such as high cost and measurement difficulties of field scale testing laboratory scale experiments are the most widely used methods in aquifer remedial reagent migration studies and are often used to explain phenomena within aquifers that cannot be explained by field scale testing for scale reasons the quantitative analysis results of this study cannot be directly applied to aquifers in this study the decomposition kinetics of h2o2 by other reactive clay minerals in low permeability aquifers were not evaluated in detail further exploration of this issue will be conducted in the future however the data obtained in this study plays a crucial role in the upgrading process from the laboratory to field scale qualitative conclusions regarding the effects of circulating flow rate concentration of remedial reagents and cycle operation mode on the migration behavior of reagents in low permeability areas can be directly used to guide aquifer green remediation 4 conclusions the remediation efficacy of in situ chemical remediation techniques is generally limited by the low mobility of reagents in subsurface aquifers the gcw technology presents an underexplored opportunity to improve the delivery emplacement control of reagents in contaminated aquifers under the hydraulic excitation from gcw in a laboratory study using a sandbox experiment the transmission range of remedial reagents were significantly improved in particular the longitudinal migration of reagents is most pronounced the evolution of concentration distribution map showed that remedial reagents can effectively migrate to the low permeability zone and retain in here under gcw driving the parameter sensitivity analysis results show that injection above the contaminated low permeability zone can help improve remediation efficiency in here the vertical hydraulic action from driving role of gcw can improve both the vertical migration of remediation agents and the reverse diffusion of pollutants and this advantage will help to improve the remediation efficiency of contaminated aquifers vertical transport to cover the bottom area and continuous accumulation in the low permeability area under driving role of gcw were observed the simulation results show that the migration model with the addition of reaction items can approach the physical simulation results based on the simulation results the regional accumulated concentration reflects the characteristics of enhanced h2o2 migration owing to the hydrodynamic cycle driven by gcw the efficiency of forward diffusion from the high to low permeability region is significantly higher than the reverse diffusion efficiency driven by the gcw high and low concentrations of h2o2 rapidly dissipated and reached the peak value in low permeability region after injection 3 h and 8 h respectively compared to the forward flow circulation mode the reverse flow circulation mode is suitable for coatings with a small range of pollutant accumulation this study provides a basis for understanding the advantages of gcw in enhancing the migration of remedial reagents which provides a new solution for the difficulty of governance in low permeability areas the enhanced remediation efficiency of residual pollutants in low permeability regions by coupling gcw with chemical remediation techniques will be explored further the results of this study can provide theoretical guidance for the application of gcw in conjunction with in situ chemical remediation technology in contaminated aquifers for complete remediation of a specific contaminated aquifer the mechanisms of reactive co migration of remedial reagents and pollutants driven by gcw hydraulics need to be carefully studied before being incorporated into remediation efficiency assessment models for example unresolved questions include the decay kinetic constants of remedial reagents as they depend on the depletion of target pollutants the ineffective consumption of non target media and the relationship between accelerated hydraulic action and their own decay credit authorship

2254,limited dispersion and mass transfer because of hydrogeological heterogeneity make it difficult to deliver remedial reagents to desired locations remediation alternatives that overcome mass transfer limitations are required urgently to improve the efficiency of in situ remediation techniques in this study a combination of two dimensional sandbox experiments and numerical simulations was used to explore the migration process of remedial reagents driven by groundwater circulating well gcw the influences of the circulating flow rate concentration of the remedial reagent h2o2 as a model and cycle operation mode on the migration of gcw enhanced remedial reagents were investigated the flow rate of the pumped water can enhance the concentration gradient at the interface of different permeation zones the redistribution of reagents by increased fick diffusion significantly increased the dispersion range the results of parametric sensitivity analysis showed that the aggregation effect of remedial reagents in the low permeability area 10 7 m s and related to the injection site considering remedial reagents attenuation a reactive transport model can better simulate the concentration changes in low permeability regions r 2 0 960 the numerical simulation results showed that the principal component of the hydrodynamic field was tangential to the main axis of the target area the diffusion coefficient of the low permeability region was one order of magnitude lower than that of the high permeability region 10 3 m s thus the low permeability region was less affected by the hydraulic action of the gcw and had a longer retention time for remedial reagents specific aquifer parameters and operating modes are key engineering design factors of a gcw that should be considered in conjunction with other in situ chemical technologies this study provides some new insights for in situ remediation of contanminated aquifers with a gcw and suggests that i the hydraulic circulation driven by gcw can promote the accumulation of injected remedial agents in low permeability areas especially injection point is located near wellbore and ii residence time of reagents in contaminated areas should be comprehensively considered when chemical remediation technology is coupled with gcw the results of this study can be used to improve the delivery efficiency of remedial reagents in contaminated aquifers keywords groundwater circulation well remedial reagents enhanced delivery reactive transport low permeability aquifer data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction groundwater quality worldwide has deteriorated in recent decades owing to rapid industrialization and the mishandling of hazardous chemicals lin et al 2018 němeček et al 2018 tawabini and makkawi 2018 especially the low permeability area as a secondary pollution source can continue to release pollutants which results in incomplete remediation tatti et al 2018 o connor et al 2018 as a low disturbance technology to underground environments in situ chemical remediation technology makes an important contribution to groundwater remediation siegrist et al 2011 lai et al 2021 wei et al 2022 such technologies involve the injection of reagents or redox manipulating materials such as h2o2 wei et al 2022 kmno4 lian et al 2019 ozone khan and carroll 2020 and persulfate zhen et al 2014 into the aquifer for in situ chemical oxidation or reduction delivering these chemical reagents to target regions and ensuring contact with contaminants therefore the key to the efficiency of in situ technology is the effective mass transfer of remedial reagents and their distribution in the contaminated area using hydraulic injection e g gravity feed and pressurized injection schroth et al 2001 soluble remedial reagents are typically delivered to a target treatment zone relying primarily on advective delivery struse et al 2002 cavanagh et al 2014 head et al 2020 in fact in situ injection technique is only suitable for sandy soils with high permeability while the influence on remediation performance is very limited in low permeability clays below 10 7 m s parker et al 2008 cavanagh et al 2014 lian et al 2019 head et al 2020 reagents injected into the area creates a preferential flow path in the high permeability zone zhong et al 2013 furthermore the slow horizontal flow rate of groundwater results in limited lateral dispersion of injected remedial reagents in porous media kanzari et al 2015 therefore migration of remedial reagents into areas with low permeability is problematic the accurate characterization of the migration process of soluble reagents in hypotonic heterogeneous medium is challenging groundwater circulation well gcw with both pumping and injecting can extract contaminated groundwater from an aquifer through one screened section of a dual screened well and then inject the well treated clean groundwater back into the aquifer through a second screened section in the same well chen and knox 1997 ponsin et al 2014 gcw system can form a crossed circulating flow field with both longitudinal and vertical circulations between the injection and extraction screening intervals which is an important method for promoting mass transfer xia et al 2019 ciampi et al 2019 2021 the gcw has shown great potential for coupling with other technologies to enhance aquifer remediation efficiency yuan et al 2021 for example gcw can enhance the longitudinal migration of surfactants mainly because the circulating well can hydraulically control the surfactant effectively and enhance its effective range of action knox et al 1997 alleman et al 2010 the peripheral multilevel injection wells in combination with gcw induced recirculation to inject electron donors and demonstrated it improves the 3d spread of additives throughout the treatment area ciampi et al 2022 in particular gcws can increase vertical groundwater flow to pass through low permeability lenses johnson and simon 2007 and facilitate back diffusion process of solute tatti et al 2018 the circular flow field line generated from the gcw is orthogonal to the main flow line of the low permeability zone which has high economic utility for the treatment of low permeability areas tatti et al 2019 the coupling of gcw and in situ chemical oxidation may effectively solve the problem of the low efficiency of remedial reagent transmission however the delivery features of remedial reagents driven by hydraulics in low permeability aquifers under conditions of hydraulic excitation of gcw was still unclear numerical model of laplace transform finite difference method was developed to characterize the spatiotemporal distribution of non reactive reagent with advection dispersion in gcw induced flow field chen et al 2010 in fact low permeability regions dominated by clay minerals increase aquifer heterogeneity thereby adding uncertainty to the remedial reagent migration process such as flow around lee et al 2014 adsorption reverse diffusion tatti et al 2018 and reactions crincoli et al 2020 the delivery migration of remedial reagents is accompanied by attenuation adsorption and retardation which lead to errors between the numerical simulation results and physical experiments the attenuation reaction and adsorption of water soluble reagents h2o2 persulfate and permanganate may change their migration in aquifers therefore a migration model with reaction terms may better reflect the migration process of solute likely remedial reagent zhu et al 2020 feng et al 2022 moreover the actual remediation efficiency of contaminated aquifers is significantly affected by formation heterogeneity the dispersion coefficient of heterogeneous strata is lower than that of homogeneous strata and decreases with the decreasing of medium particle size weill et al 2017 aquifer seepage model constructed based on basic hydrogeological parameters can use to characterize the remediation efficiency of the gcw thereby effectively optimizing its design parameters ni et al 2011 you and zhan 2013 tu et al 2019 2020 zhu et al 2020 this process is of great significance for developing the application value of gcw in engineering practice there is a large gap between the results of physical simulations based on hydrogeological parameters dispersion coefficient hydraulic conductivity porosity etc in the laboratory and the simulation results of mathematical models blanford et al 2001 yang et al 2005 therefore the hydrogeological constraints and process parameter optimization scheme of the gcw technology should be explored from the perspective of combining models and physical simulation tests physical experiments and mathematical model simulations for describing the groundwater flow and solute delivery regime are important subjects in subsurface hydrology sutton et al 2000 goltz et al 2008 previous studies have somewhat weakened the combination of laboratory testing and numerical simulation in addition non reactive tracers are mostly used for the migration model which is biased for the actual effects of reactive reagent delivery in this study the properties of the remedial reagent concentration field under a gcw driven flow field were investigated using a two dimensional sandbox experiment and numerical simulation water soluble remedial reagents h2o2 and persulfate were selected as a model solute the comsol program was used to establish a finite composition numerical model for reactive transport of remedial reagents in high low permeability region the characteristics of migration in low permeability areas influenced by the gcw across time scales were analyzed furthermore the effects of injection concentration operation modes and parameters of gcw technology on the delivery mechanism of the injected remedial reagents were considered sensitivity analysis was performed on the parameters concerned in gcw system the concentration field of the remedial reagent h2o2 in the vertical circulation flow field was also evaluated this study is expected to provide a theoretical reference for gcws coupling with in situ chemical remediation technology application of groundwater remediation associated with low permeability lenses in contaminated aquifer 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental 2 1 1 laboratory sandbox experiment the experimental apparatus used to perform the test is illustrated in fig 1 and consisted of a two dimensional plexiglass sandbox with dimensions of 100 6 50 cm length width height geometric model parameters of gcw are listed in table s2 the sandbox consisted of three parts with a central part used to reconstruct the aquifer and two small chambers on both sides there were 32 sampling points in the last four rows of the 40 sampling ports on the front of the simulation tank points 10 and 11 were sampled in the low permeability area the diameter of the gcw was 6 cm and it was wrapped with a filter cloth and placed in the fifth column of the simulation tank a peristaltic closed pump gcw was used to simulate a constant groundwater flow rate of 0 045 m d the reconstructed aquifer consisted of fine sand as the high permeability layer 10 3 m s and illite as the low permeability zone dark grey squares in fig 1 10 7 m s the porosity of the fine sand was measured and calculated using a one dimensional column experiment the size of illite was estimated using a reference estimation tatti et al 2018 2 1 2 test procedure setting of four working conditions under the driving of gcw is described in detail in text s1 briefly 75 ml of the remedial reagent 10 mm was injected at the two points corresponding to injection point 2 fig 1b to ensure that the total volume of each injection is 150 ml the transport of h2o2 and persulfate under natural water flow 0 045 m d was separately investigated in the comparative experiment the migration of remedial reagents under gcw with 10 rpm conditions was introduced in the same state the effect of gcw on the migration process of h2o2 as a model remedial reagent was further studied under different concentrations 5 10 and 20 mm pumping flow rates 10 20 and 30 rpm and pumping and injection methods with the forward and reverse flows in all the experiments 2 ml was sampled from 32 sampling ports at set time intervals continuous operation of the gcw was guaranteed during the sampling process the detailed information can be seen in text s1 of supporting materials 2 1 3 chemical analysis persulfate concentration was determined using the iodometric method waclawek et al 2015 briefly the sample solution was diluted 10 times and 5 ml of color developer ki and nahco3 solution was added subsequently the absorbance was measured at 395 nm using a uv vis spectrometer the concentration of h2o2 was determined using the potassium titanium oxalate colorimetric method sellers et al 1980 briefly one ml of sulfuric acid solution 1 3 and 1 ml of 0 05 m potassium titanium oxalate solution were added to the sample solution the absorbance of the solution after the reaction was measured using a spectrophotometer at a wavelength of 402 nm 2 2 data analysis 2 2 1 accumulated concentration of remedial reagent to quantitatively describe the overall characteristics of the reagent concentration in the low permeability aquifer the average concentration at sampling points in this region was defined as the concentration at the corresponding time point 1 c t c x y t d x d y a where c x y t are the reagent concentrations at each spatial point in the low permeability region at different times mol m3 a is the cross sectional area of the low permeability region m2 and c t is the accumulated concentration of the reagent in the low permeability region mol m3 a concentration contour map was drawn using surfer 17 with kriging interpolation each grid node value is based on known data points adjacent to that node and then it compensates for clustered data by giving less weight to the overall prediction the correlation between the measured and model fitted data of various factors reagent concentration pumping water flow rate and operating mode was analyzed using spss 23 2 2 2 groundwater flow model considering the homogeneous and anisotropic aquifer a finite element numerical model was established using comsol 5 6 the conceptual model of groundwater flow associated with gcw system is shown in fig 1b to simplify the mathematical model this section is based on the following assumptions 1 the aquifer is a confined aquifer of equal thickness and extends horizontally indefinitely 2 the aquifer is homogeneous anisotropy 3 the flow field is a stable flow 4 a cylindrical coordinate system is established with the center of the circulating shaft wellbore as the origin 2 k r 2 h r z r 2 k r r h r z r k z 2 h r z z 2 0 3 h r z r 0 0 z d e q 2 π k r r l e d e d e z l e q 2 π k r r l i d i l i z d i 0 l e z d 4 h r

respectively equation 4 indicates that there is no drawdown far from well equations 5 and 6 are the upper and lower no flow boundary conditions respectively the radial and vertical components of the water flow velocity eq 3 are incorporated into the reagent transport equation to describe remedial reagent transport in a vertically circulating flow field the coefficient of determination of the pearson correlation between the head height fitted by the model and the measured value was 0 916 0 972 fig s1 darcy s law was used to simulate the hydrodynamic field of the sandbox the input value used in the model are listed in table s2 2 2 3 reagent mass delivery model numerical simulations can provide an effective tool for the design and implementation of enhanced remediation of contaminated groundwater in heterogeneous aquifers owing to advection and hydrodynamic dispersion processes using gcw technology the numerical simulation of reagent delivery in an aquifer was carried out using the

s and r i is the reaction part where k p is the solid liquid partition coefficient of the low permeability area which exists only in the low permeability region the decay equation of illite to h2o2 obtained by the batch experiment table s3 the equations used in the model were numerically solved in two dimensions using the finite element method the domain was divided into a regular orthogonal grid with a 0 01 m spacing the neumann condition was used for the bottom and side boundaries of the domain the model was validated by reproducing the laboratory test described in section 2 1 2 and comparing the experimental results with the numerical results the calibration phase was performed by varying the hydrodynamic dispersion coefficient and hydraulic conductivity of the media the aquifer parameters used in the numerical delivery model are listed in table 1 2 2 4 parameter sensitivity analysis to further discuss the influence factors of gcw driven h2o2 migration in different regions a single factor sensitivity analysis was carried out for its parameters low permeability areas area around the well and high permeability areas were selected to concisely and clearly illustrate the influence of various factors on the migration process of h2o2 driven by gcw gray correlation analysis was used to process the data to obtain the correlation coefficient the correlation order of each comparative series was established according to the size of the gray weighted correlation degree sensitivity analysis results of h2o2 migration influencing factors driven by gcw were listed in table s4 the greater the correlation coefficient the greater the importance of the factor to the indicator the more detailed information was shown in text s4 of supporting materials 3 results and discussion 3 1 transport of reagents in natural and vertical circulation flow fields the migration process of the reagents in natural and circulating flow fields was investigated the time dependent distributions of the h2o2 and persulfate concentrations in the natural flow field are shown in fig s2 both reagents migrated from the lift top injection point to the right edge of the sandbox within 3 h lateral migration occurs with groundwater flow under the action of convection the remedial reagents can ideally migrate in the flow field set in this study ensuring the feasibility of subsequent studies in the circulating flow field the migration of the high concentration centers of the reagents in the sandbox exhibited different trends with time the horizontal displacement of the high concentration center and a limited vertical migration were observed this indicates that h2o2 migrated mainly in the horizontal flow field persulfate diffuses both horizontally and vertically and has a relatively fast vertical diffusion rate by contrast persulfate could migrate both horizontally and vertically the retardation factor r is defined as the fraction of an analyte in solute transport in an aquifer system glubt and brusseau 2021 the r value of h2o2 r 1 37 was higher than that of persulfate r 1 23 in the one dimensional sand column experiment fig s4a which indicates a faster migration rate of the former the h2o2 molecules tend to form hydrogen bonds with water molecules to aggregate which can increase the residence time in porous media mo et al 1994 du et al 2005 conversely electrostatic repulsion between persulfate and the negatively charged quartz sand surface can reduce the adsorption retention and accelerate migration in the aquifer moreover the remedial reagents injected into the aquifer migrated vertically under the action of gravity the density effect caused by the larger density of persulfate can also be used to explain its faster migration in the vertical direction konz et al 2009 lian et al 2019 subsequently the concentration of reagents was gradually diluted via hydrodynamic dispersion along the tortuous channels of the porous medium as shown in fig 2 an accelerated migration process of both reagents was observed under the created vertical circulating flow field in the aquifer via the gcw in a recent study the biodegradation rate of chloroethane was significantly significantly accelerated through gcw delivery reagents in field scale ciampi et al 2022 in particular reagents were detected in most sandbox formations within 3 h the breakthrough curve results show that increasing the flow rate can reduce the retardation factor thereby accelerating its migration in the aquifer fig s4b in addition to horizontal migration the concentration distribution of h2o2 was detected at the bottom of the sandbox the intermolecular force for the formation of hydrogen bonds was destroyed with increasing flow rate the concentration accumulation areas of the reagents were flushed out and vertical migration was enhanced by the vertical flow field the lower concentration of remedial reagents near the wellbore was mainly due to the dilution of more cycles in the vicinity because the experimental setup did not involve well construction the influence of other factors on the migration of remedial reagents around the well was not considered here in fact the construction of wells at the site scale causes skin effects which may accelerate or slow down the migration of solutes this is mainly owing to an increase or decrease in the permeability of the area close to the circulating well morozov et al 2021 hence the hydrodynamic field is not an ideal symmetrical flow it is worth noting that the concentration distributions of the two reagents in right area in the sandbox are relatively uniform in the natural flow field fig s2 in left area with the low permeability region migration of the reagent exhibited an obvious flow around phenomenon which can be attributed to the hindrance by the low permeability medium this result is consistent with findings of other studies where permanganate has an obvious bypass phenomenon in the low permeability area containing the pollutants and there are many accumulations at the boundary of high and low permeability areas marble et al 2010 tatti et al 2019 however reagents tend to aggregate in the vertical circulating flow field created by the gcw and even enter low permeability regions fig 2 the enhanced vertical migration process during gcw operation may be the key factor driving the reagent to the low permeability region this promising result could be an advantage for in situ remediation of contaminated low permeability aquifers 3 2 factors influencing gcw driven h2o2 delivery the migration process of a reagent after its injection into an aquifer determines its remediation scope and effect in this study the factors influencing gcw driven reagent migration were investigated considering the more obvious vertical migration phenomenon from gcw fig 2a h2o2 was selected as the model to further explore the influence of different factors on the migration of the gcw enhanced reagent reagents may float or sink during migration in the aquifer owing to density differences between the injected solution and groundwater swartz and schwartz 1998 konz et al 2009 first the effect of injected reagent concentration should be considered density effect is common in groundwater solute delivery and aquifer remediation high concentration h2o2 20 mm preferentially migrates in high permeability areas and the time to fill the sand box is shortened fig s5 which is consistent with the migration properties of permanganate lian et al 2019 the enhanced migration of h2o2 driven by gcw was affected by higher concentration the remedial reagent can better migrate to the bottom of the aquifer under the joint action of density effect and vertical gcw driven in addition hydroscouring from gcw can accelerate the back diffusion process of pollutants from contaminated medium in pollution source area ciampi et al 2019 2023 the effective mixing of injected high concentration remediation reagents and pollutants can improve the remediation efficiency of contaminated sites for example for sites where pollutants such as dense non aqueous liquids have accumulated at the bottom of an aquifer a strategy of gcw coupled pulse injection of high concentration remedial reagents could be considered in addition to the influence of the concentration of the remedial reagents the technological parameters of gcw also have an important influence on the migration process jin et al 2015 as shown in fig s6 increasing the flow rate of pumping and injecting into the gcw can increase the radius of influence a significant enhancement in intensity appeared near the wellbore after the gcw was operated for 1 h at 112 5 ml min h2o2 was already distributed in the entire sandbox fig s7 the result indicates that increasing the flow rate of pumping and injecting can achieve the expansion of the range of influence in a relatively short time a significant diffusion in the high permeability region on the right side of the sandbox was observed under a high flow rate of pumping and injecting fig s7 the longitudinal migration rate of the concentration centroid was accelerated and was mainly affected by dispersion godoy et al 2018 the longitudinal dispersion coefficient increased from 0 005 to 0 05 m with the increase in flow velocity therefore increasing the flow rate of the pumping water can effectively enhance the longitudinal migration of the reagent in the high permeability area a higher concentration of aggregation points was detected at the bottom of the sand box fig s7b which appears to be more effective for remediation of similar dnapl contaminated sites the low permeability area illite 10 7 m s exhibited a marked significant aggregation and retention of the remedial reagent with the increase in the flow rate of the pumped water however solute transport in low permeability areas has little effect this is mainly because the hydraulic action of the gcw increases the force interface to the main axis of low permeability the loss of h2o2 increased with the distance between the injection point and wellbore fig s8a this is mainly attributable to the gradual weakening of the solute capture ability of the gcw away from the wellbore under the combined action of the groundwater flow and gcw hydraulics chen et al 2010 2011 zhu et al 2020 therefore both the injection site and circulation method will affect the transmission process of h2o2 and the injection of reagent near the circulation well is more conducive to its uniform distribution in addition to the common forward flow operation mode reverse flow gcw with bottom up circulation mode is often used for the treatment of pollutants kitanidis and mccarty 2012 but the concentration distribution of the reagent in this circulation mode is not clear in this study the results indicated that the range of action of h2o2 was greatly limited under the action of reverse flow fig s9 compared with the forward flow circulation well drive the water flow disturbance during the reverse flow from gcw driving is different in which the radius of influence is reduced so the scope of the remediation reagent is limited and this is proved by the experimental phenomenon in this study which is mainly due to the need to overcome the gravity process to form vertical upward migration fig s9 due to the continuous increase of remediation reagents in low permeability areas fig 4c the reverse flow operation mode seems to have a certain positive effect on the long term treatment of small scale pollution points the operating mode of forward and reverse flow switching may be a viable strategy to reduce the treatment time of polluted aquifers fig 3 shows the correlation degree between each factor and the correlation coefficient the migration of h2o2 near wellbore is mostly affected by the flow rate of the pumped water this is mainly attributed to the strong hydraulic disturbance near the wellbore the slightly greater concentration coefficient r 0 i around the wellbore indicates that the closer distance to wellbore the stronger the hydraulic driving effect the migration of h2o2 in the high permeability area is mainly affected by the injection concentration as shown in fig s5 high concentration h2o2 has a preferential migration phenomenon in the high permeability region the right area of the sandbox the concentration gradient simultaneously accelerates h2o2 longitudinal migration therefore the concentration and a certain injection distance from the circulation well to the contaminated area of h2o2 in the actual site should be considered the ineffective consumption of the injected remediation reagent caused by the multiple cycles can be effectively controlled the migration of h2o2 in the low permeability area was mainly affected by the injection site r 0 i 0 822 the injection above the low permeability area was more conducive to the migration and aggregation of h2o2 in the low peroxide area in gcw in summary the enhanced migration of h2o2 could be attributed to the high concentration of the reagent the increased flow rate of pumping and injecting and the forward direction operating mode of the gcw these influencing factors should be designed according to the actual site from the perspective of economics and environmental effects of the in situ remediation technology 3 3 enhanced delivery and accumulation of h2o2 in the low permeability aquifer by the gcw system in the sandbox experiment the reagents did not reach the bottom of the aquifer effectively in the simulated natural flow field the change in h2o2 concentration in the low permeability aquifer was compared with and without being driven by the gcw fig 4 the entire reagent plume moved downward and then effectively entered the low permeability area driven by the gcw fig 4a low h2o2 concentrations over an order of magnitude were observed in areas of low permeability during the four time intervals with no driving effect only natural water flow this result indicates that it is difficult for h2o2 to migrate from the high permeability region to the low permeability region relying solely on water flow and natural gravity remediation of contaminated low permeability areas is often very problematic because of the lower hydraulic conductivity 1 6 10 7 m s of the low permeability area than that of the surrounding area zinn et al 2004 tatti et al 2016 the driving force created by the natural water flow is difficult to achieve in these areas however one vertical component of hydraulic excitation in the low permeability region could be formed under driven by gcw fig s9 considering enhanced migration knox et al 1997 and effectiveness for remediation tatti et al 2019 of low permeability formations one possibility is provided for the reagent enter the low permeability region a numerical model was used as an effective tool to represent the accumulation and delivery of solutes from high to low permeability aquifers thereby simulating possible field scenarios as shown in fig 5 driven by the pumping and injection of water a water circulation movement formation in aquifer can generate hydraulic excitation the reagent at the injection point will migrate to the porous medium and accumulated in the low permeability area during the process of pumping and injecting in gcw the model inversion proves that the diffusion coefficient of the low permeability region is one order of magnitude lower than that of near region table 1 as reported in the literature the pore scale flow rate of the low permeability region is less affected by gcw hydraulics mohrlok et al 2010 the principal component of the velocity field is tangential to the main axis of a contaminated area tatti et al 2019 groundwater flow can enhance concentration gradient at the interface between different permeability zones increasing redistribution of trapped contaminant by fick diffusion based on the accumulation and release in the low permeability region the migration of h2o2 includes two processes forward and reverse diffusion from the low into the high permeability region fig 6 a under driven by gcw the efficiency of forward diffusion is significantly higher than that of the reverse diffusion one positive effect from the actuation of gcw can form on the migration and retention of reagents which significantly accumulates h2o2 in low permeability aquifer as shown in fig 6 the cumulative concentration of h2o2 region is further calculated by simulation which can be used to reflect the change of the concentration field hydrogen peroxide moving into the low permeability area is less affected by the water flow but the concentration is mainly reduced by the decomposition of the aquifer medium the effect of concentration is particularly pronounced a gradual accumulation process around and within these media occurs during the first 6 h and then is slowly released or decomposed high concentrations of h2o2 dissipated rapidly in the region of low permeability media after 3 h fig 6 conversely low concentration h2o2 is effectively maintained for 8 h after reaching the peak value this is mainly attributable to the fact that the decomposition rate constant of h2o2 by the low permeability medium increases with its concentration the reagent concentration in the low permeability area is continuously increased until the reagent cannot be replenished the accumulation concentration of reagent in the low permeability region eq 1 indicates that reagent aggregation effect occurs in low permeation area that is at the same time the higher the accumulation concentration of reagent in the low permeability area the better the effect of pollutant remediation in the low permeability area the attenuation term of the remedial reagent was added on the basis of the traditional advection dispersion equation ade tatti et al 2019 to validate the model the concentration of h2o2 measured experimentally in the low permeability region was compared with the data obtained from reactive transport model eq 4 as shown in fig 7 the reactive transport model can better fit the experimental data r 2 0 960 the agreement between the values was considered satisfactory for demonstrating the suitability of the model for reproducing the investigated process the reactive transport model with reaction terms is reproducible for the migration of the remedial reagents in the low permeability region considering the high concentration of h2o2 has the phenomenon of self decomposition that is h2o2 will be consumed by the generated oh in system molamahmood et al 2022 chen et al 2022 these results further indicated that the migration in the low permeability region was mainly affected by the attenuation of the reactive term of the remedial reagents therefore multiple injections of low concentrations in the actual repair project of gcw coupled in situ injection of reagents can be considered to ensure stable oxidation or reduction strength in low permeability region in addition increasing the water flow rate of the gcw enhanced the accumulation of h2o2 in the low permeability region fig 8 which accelerated the forward diffusion of h2o2 but little effect was observed in the gcw reverse diffusion system the dispersion coefficient of the aquifer was determined to be reverse diffusion studies have found that in soils with small particle sizes the dispersion coefficient is small klotz et al 1980 godoy et al 2018 consistent with the simulation results the diffusion coefficient in the low permeability region was six to seven orders of magnitude lower than that in the high permeability region table 1 therefore the migration and accumulation of h2o2 in the low permeability region were enhanced by increasing the pumped water flow rate a more obvious enhancing effect can be observed in fig 8c the highest concentration reached 0 6 mmol l to further compare the enhanced effect in the low permeability area under the different operating modes the reverse flow driven by the gcw under the same conditions was adopted the delivery of h2o2 mainly migrated in the vertical direction of the low permeability region and gradually accumulated over time fig s8b the cumulative concentrations of h2o2 in the high and low permeability areas were also simulated fig s10 the maximum value was reached within the first 3 h under forward flow driving and the regional cumulative concentration remained constant during the following 9 h the accumulated concentration of h2o2 showed an increasing trend under the influence of the countercurrent flow and leveled off after 9 h which is consistent with results of the laboratory process fig 8c this was mainly because the reverse flow changed the direction of the flow field fig s9 such that h2o2 preferentially diffuses into the high permeability region the concentration accumulation of the reagent from the upper well screen under reverse flow circulation was slower than that under forward flow the accumulation time of h2o2 in the reverse flow circulation can be prolonged in the low permeability area which has a positive effect on the continuous and stable treatment of contaminated low permeability areas our research was conducted in a two dimensional sandbox which is a simplification of an actual aquifer owing to limitations such as high cost and measurement difficulties of field scale testing laboratory scale experiments are the most widely used methods in aquifer remedial reagent migration studies and are often used to explain phenomena within aquifers that cannot be explained by field scale testing for scale reasons the quantitative analysis results of this study cannot be directly applied to aquifers in this study the decomposition kinetics of h2o2 by other reactive clay minerals in low permeability aquifers were not evaluated in detail further exploration of this issue will be conducted in the future however the data obtained in this study plays a crucial role in the upgrading process from the laboratory to field scale qualitative conclusions regarding the effects of circulating flow rate concentration of remedial reagents and cycle operation mode on the migration behavior of reagents in low permeability areas can be directly used to guide aquifer green remediation 4 conclusions the remediation efficacy of in situ chemical remediation techniques is generally limited by the low mobility of reagents in subsurface aquifers the gcw technology presents an underexplored opportunity to improve the delivery emplacement control of reagents in contaminated aquifers under the hydraulic excitation from gcw in a laboratory study using a sandbox experiment the transmission range of remedial reagents were significantly improved in particular the longitudinal migration of reagents is most pronounced the evolution of concentration distribution map showed that remedial reagents can effectively migrate to the low permeability zone and retain in here under gcw driving the parameter sensitivity analysis results show that injection above the contaminated low permeability zone can help improve remediation efficiency in here the vertical hydraulic action from driving role of gcw can improve both the vertical migration of remediation agents and the reverse diffusion of pollutants and this advantage will help to improve the remediation efficiency of contaminated aquifers vertical transport to cover the bottom area and continuous accumulation in the low permeability area under driving role of gcw were observed the simulation results show that the migration model with the addition of reaction items can approach the physical simulation results based on the simulation results the regional accumulated concentration reflects the characteristics of enhanced h2o2 migration owing to the hydrodynamic cycle driven by gcw the efficiency of forward diffusion from the high to low permeability region is significantly higher than the reverse diffusion efficiency driven by the gcw high and low concentrations of h2o2 rapidly dissipated and reached the peak value in low permeability region after injection 3 h and 8 h respectively compared to the forward flow circulation mode the reverse flow circulation mode is suitable for coatings with a small range of pollutant accumulation this study provides a basis for understanding the advantages of gcw in enhancing the migration of remedial reagents which provides a new solution for the difficulty of governance in low permeability areas the enhanced remediation efficiency of residual pollutants in low permeability regions by coupling gcw with chemical remediation techniques will be explored further the results of this study can provide theoretical guidance for the application of gcw in conjunction with in situ chemical remediation technology in contaminated aquifers for complete remediation of a specific contaminated aquifer the mechanisms of reactive co migration of remedial reagents and pollutants driven by gcw hydraulics need to be carefully studied before being incorporated into remediation efficiency assessment models for example unresolved questions include the decay kinetic constants of remedial reagents as they depend on the depletion of target pollutants the ineffective consumption of non target media and the relationship between accelerated hydraulic action and their own decay credit authorship
