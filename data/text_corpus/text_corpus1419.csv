7095,land use change and climate variability have the potential to alter river flow and groundwater resources dramatically especially by modifying actual evapotranspiration seven catchments with intermittent flow dominated by either winter active perennial pastures 4 catchments or eucalyptus globulus plantations 3 catchments located in 3 geologic settings of southeastern australia were studied for over 6 years to determine the primary controls on water resources groundwater levels in the pasture sites were stable through the 2011 2016 study period while levels in the plantations declined in the same period streamflow occurred mainly during winter annual streamflow showed no difference clearly attributable to pasture versus plantation land use the presence of grass buffers along streams enhances groundwater recharge and saturation dependent overland flow reducing the impacts of the plantations on streamflow site water balances indicated that the average annual actual evapotranspiration was 87 93 of precipitation for pasture catchments and 102 108 of precipitation for plantation catchments actual evapotranspiration greater than precipitation at the plantations was attributed to uptake of groundwater by the root system in parts of the catchments thus change to groundwater storage is a critical component in the water balance actual evapotranspiration from pasture catchments was higher than previously estimated from global pasture and cropping data instead matching global precipitation versus actual evapotranspiration curves for treed catchments abbreviations

groundwater recharge and other components of the hydrologic cycle andréassian 2004 beck et al 2013 bosch and hewlett 1982 campbell and barber 2008 colville and holmes 1972 van lill et al 1980 the negative impacts of these shifts in land use include decreased water supply and degraded water quality at local and regional scales dean et al 2014 2015 the majority of previous investigations have indicated that an increase in tree cover typically affects the catchment water budget by increasing actual evapotranspiration eta decreasing streamflow and decreasing groundwater recharge but there is high variability globally and within specific regions brown et al 2005 mcvicar et al 2007 scott et al 2000 van dijk and keenan 2007 zhang et al 2001 the difficulty in controlling or even characterizing variables such as geologic setting including bedrock geology unconsolidated sediments soils and topography at the catchment scale means generalization of findings to other locations is problematic the interrelationships between variables controlling the water balance such as precipitation p vegetation growth and eta is a challenge to predicting land use change impacts and development of water management policies table 1 summarizes some of the key findings from existing studies on the effect of afforestation and deforestation on water resources including previous work at our sites and this study for completeness a wide variability of responses to land uses is seen in global studies in southeastern australia catchment studies were mainly carried out in the high rainfall native eucalyptus forests with a limited number of studies of pinus plantations bren and hopmans 2007 bren et al 2010 bren 1997 bren and lane 2014 burch et al 1987 cornish and vertessy 2001 and few catchment scale studies on eucalyptus plantations plot scale studies of eta in southeastern australia did not include direct measurement of groundwater or streamflow so they may not apply to catchment scales benyon et al 2007 benyon and doody 2004 benyon et al 2009 2006 only a few catchment studies include monitoring of the groundwater system almeida et al 2016 istanbulluoglu et al 2012a rodríguez suárez et al 2011 silveira et al 2016 therefore the relationships between precipitation and both eta and streamflow typically do not account for the effects of groundwater recharge on the water balance when groundwater is considered the catchments are usually assumed closed with respect to groundwater flow i e the groundwater divide at the top of the catchment corresponds to the surface water divide and groundwater discharges to streams within the catchments as baseflow soil water storage is typically assumed to respond rapidly to changes in vegetation and reach a near steady state but saturated groundwater storage is not usually addressed few studies have taken place in intermittent catchments although several workers have noted a change from perennial to intermittent flow with afforestation brown et al 2013 2005 scott and lesch 1997 scott and prinsloo 2008 scott et al 2000 zhang et al 2012 uptake of groundwater by deep rooted vegetation such as plantation trees can alter the catchment water balance by increasing eta benyon et al 2007 benyon 2002 benyon and doody 2004 benyon et al 2009 2006 streamflow and groundwater flow are expected to be affected by a number of factors related to intermittent flow the limited connection between groundwater and surface water in intermittent streams decreases baseflow compared to perennial systems istanbulluoglu et al 2012b there is likely to be a greater lag in establishment of valley bottom saturation and saturation dependent overland flow in intermittent catchments and the extent of area contributing to saturation dependent flow is likely to be smaller this suggests that the streamflow may be sensitive to changes in the groundwater system induced by land use change this study investigates the interrelated effects of land use geologic settings and precipitation variability on the water yield of small intermittent upland catchments in victoria australia hardwood eucalyptus globulus blue gum plantation was the dominant land use within one catchment at each setting and winter active native perennial pasture was the dominant land use at the other catchments the primary research questions were 1 what are the differences between plantations and pastures in terms of groundwater resources and how important is it to factor groundwater into water balance changes 2 what are the effects of contrasting land uses on streamflow and eta do the water dynamics in our research catchments support the water budget relationships derived from other global studies and particularly studies in southeastern australia 3 how does the geologic setting affect the water balance and relate to the water resource effects of plantations these objectives provide the structural sub headings used in the following methods results and discussion sections the discussion section additionally addresses the implications of the research to water and land use management policy 2 study area 2 1 site description the study area is located in the hopkins and crawford river catchments of the glenelg river basin in southwestern victoria australia fig 1 the study includes seven catchments in three areas named according to the closest adjacent townships gatum farm gf and gatum plantation gp mirranatwa farm mf and mirranatwa plantation mp and digby farm north dfn digby farm south dfs and digby plantation dp the farm catchments are predominantly sheep and cattle grazing of winter active perennial grasses with minor cropping and small treed areas the plantation catchments include varying amounts of pasture and unplanted grassland areas along the valley bottoms gp was planted in 2005 with a stand density of 800 trees ha adelana et al 2015 that decreased to 730 in 2015 mean diameter at breast height over bark at the end of 2016 was 23 8 cm with a mean tree height of 20 m at mp planted in 2008 surveys taken between 2011 and 2015 saw the mean height of trees increase from 8 9 to 13 7 m with the mean diameter at breast height over bark growing from 9 6 to 14 3 cm the number of trees per hectare declined from 1139 to 889 darren shelden macquarie forestry pers comm the plantation at dp was planted in 2001 at a stocking density of 700 to 800 trees ha and was harvested between late 2015 and early 2016 adrian marty elders forestry pers comm the dp catchment includes 55 ha of native eucalyptus forest that was not harvested 2 2 geologic setting and topography the catchment designations geology and physical characteristics are listed in table 2 catchment perimeters and areas were determined using differentially corrected global positioning system gps elevations tied to geoscience australia benchmarks elevations used the australian height datum ahd interpolation between measured locations was performed by hand and guided by topographic maps and field observations catchments were subdivided into valley bottom mid slope and upper slope landscape positions see table 2 based on subjective evaluation of the topographic maps except at dp where only mid slope and valley bottom were used because of the low relief calculation of height above nearest drainage hand is a method to assess the hydrologic effects of topography and to classify landscapes to develop conceptual models gharari et al 2011 nobre et al 2011 rennó et al 2008 the hand analysis calculates the height difference m between each cell in a digital terrain model dtm and the height of the cell where flow from that location first reaches the drainage line we used hand based on a 20 m by 20 m dtm with vertical accuracy of 5 m or better department of environment land water planning 2014 to assess the topographic differences between the monitored catchments the low relief in some locations meant that the boundaries shown in the hand analysis determined from the state wide 20 m by 20 m dtm are less accurate than our more detailed surveyed catchment areas the drainage line cells were defined as those where flow accumulation is from an area 0 1 km2 this value was chosen because it captures drainage networks in each study catchment and is similar to the drainage shown in the state of victoria topographic layers the hand map for each study catchment and histograms of the distribution show similarity in topography and stream drainage for catchments within each geologic setting fig 2 the mirranatwa catchments are the steepest at the gatum sites gp has the drainage extending somewhat farther up the catchment but the differences are considered unlikely to have a major effect on the flow dynamics the relatively flat topography at the digby sites means that large areas of each catchment are near stream level the central part of dfs is dominated by an ellipsoidal area at stream level a smaller area with elevations near the stream is also seen in the center of the dfn catchment the central part of the dp catchment shows drainage on the hand map but was a closed depression until a drain to the north was constructed we interpret these features as being dolines in the underlying port campbell limestone indicating potential recharge areas soil development contrasts between locations the gatum site is dominated by yellow and brown mottled chromosol soil developed over saprolitic gatum ignimbrite rhyolite of the lower devonian rockland volcanics baxter and robinson 2001 the mirranatwa site has yellow and brown solodic soil over weathered granitic devonian victoria valley batholith sibley 1967 the soil type at the digby sites is variable with dp generally being sandier baxter and robinson 2001 described it as a black vertisol developed on late miocene pliocene marine loxton clay and sands that overlie late oligocene to late miocene heytesbury group port campbell limestone depth to limestone is 8 m at dfs and dfn while 60 m at dp perveen 2016 2 3 climate annual historic precipitation from bureau of meteorology bom sites near the study areas are listed in table 2 together with measurements from this study precipitation during the study was greatest in the digby catchments and lowest at mirranatwa the study catchments were established in 2009 2010 at the end of the millennium drought the worst drought on record for southeastern australia with approximately 8 years of below long term average precipitation van dijk et al 2013 yang et al 2017 the drought broke in 2010 with high precipitation widespread flooding continued through the 2011 summer precipitation is winter dominated and annual precipitation in the region is highly variable using data in the period 1984 2017 hamilton airport bom station 090173 february is the hottest month having a mean monthly maximum temperature of 26 8 c daily maximum temperature range 13 8 44 5 c and mean monthly minimum temperature of 11 3 c daily minimum temperature range 2 1 24 7 c july is the coldest month with mean monthly maximum temperature of 12 1 c daily maximum temperature range 6 2 18 7 c and mean monthly minimum temperature of 4 4 c daily minimum temperature range 2 8 11 3 c 3 data collection and analysis 3 1 precipitation precipitation was recorded at 10 minute intervals using tipping bucket rain gauges at gatum mirranatwa digby farm and digby plantation measurements were summed to 30 min and daily values mm d 1 daily precipitation data were supplemented with data from nearby bom stations see fig 1 to infill missing or suspect data when the onsite gauges clogged or data loggers failed this affected a maximum of 5 4 of the data at the dp catchment largely as the result of a logger failure in 2011 correlation of daily data between our gauges and the bom stations was satisfactory r2 0 78 0 95 with the exception of the gatum sites r2 0 44 only one daily measurement at gatum was replaced with bom data so the poor correlation has little effect 3 2 groundwater analysis groundwater levels were measured in wells installed for this study and some pre existing wells locations are shown in fig 2 and construction details are given in the supplementary data the locations and surface elevation were measured with differentially corrected survey grade gps groundwater levels were measured from 2009 or early 2010 through december 2016 and were presented as either depth below ground surface m or elevation above australian height datum m ahd water level measurements were logged at 4 hr intervals with campbell diver instrumentation northwest or troll data loggers measurements were barometrically compensated and corrected to periodic manual measurements visual trend assessment was used to exclude suspect data data that result from data logger failure and where the water levels recovered slowly after purging for sampling were excluded changes in groundwater level were used to calculate changes in annual groundwater storage δsgw m3 y 1 converted to mm y 1 beneath the catchments δsgw was calculated by multiplying the average decline for wells at each landscape position by area and the specific yield unitless estimated from sediment grain size adelana et al 2015 dean et al 2015 perveen 2016 δsgw and other water volumes used in the water balance section 3 4 were converted to mm by dividing by the catchment area applying unit conversion factors and summing over the time of interest e g daily or annual values groundwater outflow from the catchments qgw m3 d 1 converted to mm d 1 was calculated from darcy s law for one dimensional flow 1 q gw kia where k m d 1 is the average hydraulic conductivity of the aquifer estimated from sediment grainsize i unitless is the hydraulic gradient calculated from a planar fit to average january summer groundwater levels in 3 widely spaced wells in each catchment and a m2 is the cross sectional area of groundwater outflow the aquifer depth used to calculate a was estimated from geologic maps and site drilling data a width equal to the catchment width approximately perpendicular to the flow direction was selected as an upper bound to a such that eta calculated from the water balance section 3 4 could be considered as a lower estimate 3 3 streamflow analysis streamflow qsw was measured at flow control weirs at the outlet of each catchment measurements were initiated in 2010 and this study considers the full calendar years 2011 2016 flow data were divided by the respective catchment area and summed over time periods of interest to be expressed as equivalent water depth in mm time 1 intense rain periods caused flow to overtop some of the weirs leading to an underestimation of total flow this particularly affected the flow measured at the gp catchment where the maximum flow rate measurable at the weir was 4 5 mm d 1 because of the logistics of installation the events where the streams overtopped the weirs were generally infrequent and short lived with the exception of the gp catchment in 2016 when flood debris blocked the weir causing slow drainage pipe erosion and or tunnelling by cherax destructor common yabby caused leakage under the mp weir in the period february 2011 to may 2011 accordingly the flow at this site for that time period may be underestimated this predominantly affects the estimation of the timing of flow in 2011 rather than the total flow because the weir was repaired prior to the onset of the wet winter season some of the series had gaps in the data 12 d were missing at gf 18 d at mf 5 d at df and 122 d at dp the days missing at dp were between march and july 2012 and in january 2013 we believe that most of the flows were recorded because these periods commonly do not show large flows streamflow for the different catchments was summarized to daily quarterly and yearly values flow duration curves from 30 minute flow data are presented for the combined 2011 2016 periods 3 4 water balance and evapotranspiration annual actual evapotranspiration eta was calculated from the annual catchment water balance as 2 e t a p q sw q gw δ s gw δ s vz where p is precipitation qsw is streamflow qgw is groundwater outflow δsgw is change in groundwater storage change in water volume below the water table and δsvz is change in vadose zone moisture storage change in water storage between the water table and the ground surface the unsaturated zone and the capillary fringe units for the components of eq 2 are mm time 1 totalled over the measurement period of interest p and qsw were measured qgw and δsgw were determined as discussed in section 3 2 δsvz is assumed to be 0 at the annual and longer timescales although water content possibly decreased as the roots extended into the deeper vadose zone during plantation establishment if the last three terms in eq 2 are neglected as a first approximation qsw approaches 0 at low p and approaches p et0 at high p where et0 is the potential evapotranspiration mcguire and bren 2013 zhang et al 2001 this suggests that a plot of annual qsw versus p may fit a power function of the form 3 q sw a p b where a is expected to be a small positive number because qsw p at low values of p and b is positive the parameters a and b are fit to the data by ordinary least squares equation 3 is equivalent to the midgely pitman curves described in greenwood et al 2014 neglecting the linear form used above a critical threshold of p the role of vegetation type on eta and catchment water balance from our study was compared to that from world wide catchment experiments reviewed by zhang et al 1999 2001 who developed a relationship between long term average annual eta and annual precipitation for forest and grass catchments referred to as the zhang curves 4 et a f 1 2 1410 p 1 2 1410 p p 1410 1 f 1 0 5 1100 p 1 0 5 1100 p p 1100 p where p is the annual precipitation and f is the fraction of forest cover the values 1410 and 1100 in eq 4 relate to the potential evapotranspiration for treed and un treed catchments respectively at low values of annual precipitation eta increases linearly with precipitation and approaches a constant value equal to potential evapotranspiration at high annual precipitation 4 methods 4 1 effects on the groundwater system groundwater level measurements were used to determine groundwater flow directions at the study sites and calculate streamflow for incorporation into the water balance the spatial and temporal variation in depth to the water table across the catchments shows the degree of groundwater stream connectivity seasonal groundwater recharge is indicated by the degree of water table fluctuation dean et al 2015 δsgw indicates the change in the groundwater system resulting from plantation establishment and is included in the water balance 4 2 effects on streamflow and eta the effect of contrasting land uses i e pasture versus plantation on streamflow was evaluated by determining changes in flow at the catchment outlets on time scales that vary from the 30 min data collection interval to average annual values over the 2011 2016 study period the measurements were used to determine the variability in quarterly and annual streamflow within catchments and fit to descriptive precipitation streamflow curves see eq 3 flow duration curves for the catchments compare the relative contributions of peak flow and delayed flow for the catchments and compare the duration of flow between catchments water balance eta was compared between catchments and to that calculated in other studies 4 3 effect of geologic setting the study catchments were set in three different geologic environments to provide understanding of the source of variability in the relationship between precipitation streamflow and eta our hypothesis was that lithology and topography change the relationship between precipitation streamflow and groundwater recharge steeper topography likely enhances streamflow at the expense of infiltration additionally the hydrogeologic setting including depth to groundwater affects the ability of tree roots to reach the water table the interpretation of these effects is necessarily qualitative but forms the basis for conceptualizing catchment models e g dean et al 2016 5 results 5 1 effects on the groundwater system representative catchment summer water table maps for january 2014 near the middle of the study period and when influence of seasonal recharge events on individual wells is minimal are shown in fig 3 the water table contours shown are consistent with intermittent catchments that are not closed with respect to groundwater flow although the well spacing is not sufficient to completely constrain the flow directions in particular groundwater flow at the gp catchment is largely to the south whereas the stream drainage is to the southwest the southerly groundwater flow increases the cross sectional area used to calculate qgw over that of gf the groundwater at the dp catchment is interpreted to converge on a drainage to the east controlled by solution enhanced permeability within the underlying limestone this means that the groundwater gradient in the eastern part of the site converges sharply from the north and south but the gradient to the east is much lower the depth to groundwater along the west east line through the catchment is greater than 25 m groundwater levels at the farm site wells were generally steady except for seasonal fluctuations fig 4 the levels increased from higher precipitation and recharge in 2010 2011 and 2016 and decreased slowly during drier years water table fluctuations at the gf and mf catchments are greatest along the valley bottoms as a result of greater recharge and a shallower depth to groundwater dean et al 2015 the plantation monitoring wells show declining water levels and lower seasonal fluctuation showing that recharge is nearly absent except near the streams and in areas lacking trees the water table decline in mp was slow through 2011 apparently because of the recently planted trees but it is difficult to separate the effect of tree growth from the high precipitation in late 2010 and early 2011 in spite of the maturity in dp the water table continued to decline at least through 2015 in 2016 water levels increased in dp wells 5532 5537 and 5540 because of the high precipitation combined with harvesting of the plantation trees in late 2015 early 2016 the small but continuing water table decline at dp prior to harvesting in late 2015 2016 shows that a new steady state was not reached within the harvest cycle of 14 years 5 2 effects on streamflow and eta catchment flow is dynamic with sharp peaks associated with rain events fig 5 flow peaks typically occur within 4 h of precipitation peaks late spring through late autumn flow is only associated with large rain events more continuous flow occurs during the winter except in 2015 which was very dry resulting in minimal winter flow annual total flow in all catchments is very low when annual precipitation is below 400 to 600 mm y 1 table 3 fig 6 annual and mean streamflow over the 6 year period was lower at the gp and dp compared to gf and both dfn and dfs however it was almost identical in the case of the two sites at mirranatwa mp and mf see table 3 flow at gp is lower than gf when precipitation is less than 800 mm y 1 streamflow at gp in 2016 the wettest year apparently exceeded that of gf but this may be caused by the difficulty of measuring large flows accurately the similarity in average streamflow for the mirranatwa catchments is largely because of the much higher peak flow for mp offsetting mf s higher flow between intense rain events the mirranatwa catchments were better fit by linear regression than by power functions fig 6 showed that the flow in the winter quarter q3 between july and september is linearly correlated between catchments for each geologic setting during the other quarters the plantation flow often plots above the q3 trend in response to intense rain events following periods of no flow this can be explained by a proportionally greater effect of infiltration excess overland flow at the plantations from differences in under story vegetation or soil hydrophobicity the timing of flow was highly variable from year to year fig 7 winter flow was continuous in the july september q3 period most years but could start as early as april and extend as late as november depending on the catchment and year flow duration curves constructed from the 30 min measurements fig 8 show that the period of catchment flow ranged from 18 of the time at dfs to a maximum of 45 at gf 75 of the flow volume occurred in less than 10 of the time period for every catchment the flow duration curves have high slope at the high flow periods and become steep again when the catchments cease flowing the latter sudden drop in flow likely results from nonlinearity in the drainage chapman 1999 the shallow slope in the center of the flow duration curves is commonly attributed to groundwater baseflow although other delayed flow such as drainage of surface water storage or perched flow may also contribute the curves show higher delayed flow at farm catchments than at plantations the flow duration does not appear to be affected by the declining groundwater levels in the plantations see table 3 the most likely explanation is that the annual flow duration is controlled by the extent of water storage along the valley bottom rather than groundwater baseflow this storage may be in near stream soils or farm dams possibly supplemented by flow in perched aquifers water levels measured in some of the wells that were installed at gf and mf during early 1990s are still much deeper than the depths before the millennium drought thus connectivity between the groundwater and surface water in the pastures may still be affected by the drought eta in the water balance see eq 2 makes up 87 to 108 of the precipitation table 4 all plantation catchments had higher calculated eta than the farm catchments in comparable geologic settings however this did not directly translate to a reduction in streamflow because of differences in δsgw and qgw the calculated eta for the plantations was greater than 100 because of a loss of groundwater from storage in the plantation catchments the importance of δsgw in evaluating eta and catchment baseflow has previously been noted istanbulluoglu et al 2012b groundwater storage loss within the plantation catchments cannot be explained by baseflow to the streams or qgw because δsgw is greater than qsw qgw even though our calculation was designed to place an upper bound on qgw thus the δsgw is best explained by direct uptake of groundwater by the trees this uptake is greatest in the mid slope position higher in the catchment the water table appears to be too deep for access by the tree roots lower in the catchment much of the land is not treed and the water table is affected by focused recharge in the valley bottom it appears that higher salinity in the valley bottom is detrimental to growth and limits the groundwater uptake dean et al 2016 although some eucalyptus species are known to tolerate saline groundwater benyon et al 1999 feikema et al 2010 plantation water balance eta higher than that calculated from the zhang curves is largely explained by inclusion of groundwater components of the water balance table 4 the difference in eta calculated for plantation versus farm catchments ranges from 14 for gatum and mirranatwa to 21 for digby dfn versus dp the difference calculated from the zhang curve ranges from 16 to 17 at gatum and mirranatwa to 25 at digby however if eta is calculated from only p qsw as used for the zhang data the difference in eta between farm and plantation catchments at gatum and mirranatwa is less than 2 p qsw is still 19 higher at dp than at dfn because of the low streamflow from the dp s central depression 5 3 effect of geologic setting the subsurface limestone karst at the digby sites had a large effect on the groundwater and surface water systems other sites illustrate features related to groundwater flow direction artesian conditions and perched flow the runoff at digby is largely controlled by flow in the underlying karstic limestone although the water table is in the upper clays and sands the relationship between annual precipitation and streamflow at the digby farm sites is highly variable years with precipitation between 700 and 800 mm y 1 have streamflow varying by more than three times see fig 6 the variability is controlled by both the timing of precipitation within the year and the continued effects from previous years precipitation level the flow duration curve at dfs is much shorter than at dfn but the shape during high flow periods is nearly identical see fig 8 thus peak overland flow is largely unaffected by the geologic differences the annual flow at dp is considerably lower than at the digby farm catchments during wet years in spite of slightly higher precipitation fig 6 dp flow tends to be less continuous than dfn but more continuous than dfs most years fig 7 the deep water table in the center of the dp catchment means that there is no groundwater connectivity to produce saturation dependent overland flow the surface depression holds runoff to drain slowly extending the flow duration curve fig 8 the doline may focus recharge to the aquifer mitigating the effect of the plantation eta on the water budget the geologic setting has more subtle effects at the mirranatwa sites the aquifer at the mp weir is strongly artesian with head above the land surface the water level contours in fig 3 suggest that this is largely due to pressure induced by the granite at higher elevation to the northwest not shown and the potential for preferential fracture flow dean et al 2014 the upward gradient near the mp stream prolongs saturation of the sediments contributing to the longer but lower flow duration curve at mp compared to mf fig 8 this interpretation is supported by radon measurements dean et al 2015 the head in well 2292 near the mp weir remains artesian but is declining so the conditions contributing to the extended flow duration may not persist as the plantation matures fig 4 this suggests the curve may reach a tipping point where the aquifer cannot support streamflow through baseflow or saturation dependant overland flow alternatively the artesian head might mitigate impacts on flow duration through the entire growth and harvest cycle it is unclear how the local geology relates to the extremely large streamflow response to high precipitation at gp in 2016 the rapid response to precipitation events and the observed debris near the weir indicate enhanced overland flow this suggests waterlogging is induced by lateral flow within the soil b horizon and within the kaolinized pallid zone on top of the weathered ignimbrites as observed at gf by brouwer and fitzpatrick 2002 6 discussion 6 1 groundwater flow direction and level trends the plantation catchment groundwater levels declined markedly in most monitoring wells away from the stream lines whereas the levels did not change significantly in the farm catchment monitoring wells in addition the seasonal fluctuation was higher in farm wells the decreased seasonality and declining water levels in the plantations are consistent with a decrease in groundwater recharge as a result of increased eta by the trees this decrease in groundwater recharge is in agreement with previous research amdan et al 2013 fan et al 2014 rodríguez suárez et al 2011 although no decrease was seen by silveira et al 2016 the change in δsgw is seldom included in catchment water balance calculations however it can be significant where the catchments are not closed to groundwater i e where groundwater is not discharged as baseflow that is incorporated into streamflow the un treed buffer left along drainage lines in the plantations results in recharge on the lower slopes similar to that in the pasture catchments runoff concentrates the recharge in the lower landscape dean et al 2015 flow in perched water tables can also concentrate recharge in the lower landscape water levels at or near the surface in valley bottom monitoring wells suggest hydraulic connection between groundwater and surface water causing saturation dependent overland flow during and shortly after winter precipitation saturation dependent overland flow will promote high streamflow during rain events 6 2 streamflow and eta most previous research has concluded that streamflow declines with afforestation as a result of greater eta see table 1 however large variability in the precipitation streamflow relationship has been noted and the findings of decreased streamflow are not universal we did not see an indication of decreased streamflow in the plantation catchments this is in contrast to the work of silveira et al 2016 where streamflow increased with afforestation but no effect on recharge was seen our results support previous findings that eta is increased where groundwater is accessible to the tree roots and suggest that the depths where this occurs may be greater than indicated by plot studies benyon 2002 benyon and doody 2004 benyon et al 2009 benyon et al 2006 the higher eta for our pasture catchments compared to the zhang et al 1999 un treed catchment curve is in agreement with their pasture and crop data from australia fig 9 this high eta for the pasture was not expected and means that afforestation only has a small effect on the water balance unless plantation eta is supplemented by groundwater uptake conversely dye 2013 noted that the extremely low water use of the native fynbos in south africa exaggerates the difference in water use between fynbos and pinus plantations suggesting caution is needed in applying results between landscapes with different pre existing vegetation the cause of the high pasture eta for the australian setting is unknown a relative increase in plantation streamflow compared to pasture flow was attributed to overland flow in three specific situations in our study to our knowledge this has not been observed in previous catchment investigations the first is the annual flow in the gp catchment in 2016 which was close to that in gf this suggests that during periods of intense rainfall the increased eta of trees has little effect on runoff this contrasts with the zhang curve model where qsw for treed catchments is predicted to remain below that of un treed catchments trees likely increase leaf and litter interception and drier soil may delay the start of infiltration dependent overland flow but once the system is wet there will be no further effect on runoff thus the precipitation streamflow relationship will depend not only on the amount of precipitation but on the intensity the second case is the relatively higher plantation response to intense summer rains this is consistent with soil hydrophobicity seen in eucalyptus plantations and forests dry hydrophobic soils will enhance runoff and will become less hydrophobic in wetter seasons burch et al 1987 burch et al 1989 doerr et al 2003 2000 ferreira et al 2000 infiltration tests at the gatum site showed higher infiltration for the farm pasture than for the plantation reynolds 2010 this makes little difference in annual streamflow but may be important ecologically in helping the persistence in remnant surface water pools in intermittent ephemeral streams the final situation is the greater runoff that may be induced by deep ripping of soil during plantation establishment as described by dean et al 2016 this suggests that design changes might be useful in improving catchment water management e g by channelling runoff downslope for greater water yield or conversely by delaying runoff to decrease peak flows 6 3 effect of geologic setting differences in geologic setting alter the groundwater recharge affect connectivity between groundwater and surface water and increase the variability in catchment flow in response to precipitation the water table decline noted in our plantation catchments implies that flow duration in these intermittent catchments may ultimately become shorter although the variability in precipitation dominates the inter annual flow variability thus the impacts may be different in regions with more consistent precipitation and for plantations with longer harvest cycles the nonlinearity in precipitation versus annual flow complicates inter catchment comparison and indicates that extrapolation of flow relationships such as those used in paired catchment studies may not be appropriate because the nonlinear relationship cannot always be predicted from a limited measurement period land use impacts of plantation development have been studied in the south australia karst where the impact of direct uptake of groundwater was documented colville and holmes 1972 holmes and colville 1970 our study shows the influence of subsurface limestone even when covered by other sedimentary formations the karst topography controls the depth to groundwater and ability for direct groundwater use by trees the development of saturation dependent overland flow and may induce focused recharge along streams and in depressions karst areas may need special consideration because their precipitation streamflow relationship is highly variable and dependent on local conditions 6 4 policy implications the state of victoria has developed strategies to manage the water resource impacts of land use change but these have not yet been enacted department of sustainability and environment 2011a b the policy recognizes potential streamflow and groundwater impacts but much of the focus has been on streamflow south australian policy in contrast has focused more on groundwater use by plantations new plantations in southeastern south australia may be licensed to use groundwater users because of the shallow water table and minimal surface water use greenwood 2013 our investigation indicates that groundwater use by plantations in victoria is significant in keeping with previous work benyon and doody 2004 but the maximum depth to groundwater for uptake by trees has not been established the larger eta in the plantation catchments however was not seen to have a major effect on the streamflow because baseflow is already minimal as a result of the seasonal nature of the precipitation and only seasonal connectivity between groundwater and surface water thus we suggest that policy development in victoria should increase focus on areas where the groundwater resource is of significant importance this is particularly true in freshwater aquifer recharge areas as recharge will be reduced by the increased eta of plantations the variability of pasture and plantation streamflow in different geologic settings presents a challenge in developing water management policy the site specific nature of the land use impacts suggests that flexibility may be possible within management areas if the industry can show that a proposed plantation development is unlikely to have major impact the high pasture water use calculated from water balance for our study and others in australia shows that the baseline pasture water use has not always been properly considered in evaluating the effects of afforestation the discrepancy from global curves indicates that those curves are not appropriate for evaluating the effects of land use changes in australia 7 conclusion our investigation demonstrated a large effect of plantations on the groundwater system with a major reduction in groundwater recharge and a loss of groundwater storage but there was no clear effect on streamflow consideration of groundwater levels and flow directions indicated that the intermittent stream catchments were not closed to groundwater flow and that baseflow to streams was small thus the change in δsgw must be considered in the water balance calculation of eta the reduced recharge and uptake of groundwater by tree roots led to a loss of groundwater storage however apportioning groundwater flux within the catchment between baseflow streamflow and uptake by deep rooted vegetation remains challenging most global studies have shown high eta in forests and plantations and thus increased water use caused by plantation establishment this study does not contradict the high eta in plantation systems but instead indicates that eta for pastures in the 500 to 1000 mm y 1 annual precipitation region of southeast australia is higher than for pastures in equivalent precipitation

7095,land use change and climate variability have the potential to alter river flow and groundwater resources dramatically especially by modifying actual evapotranspiration seven catchments with intermittent flow dominated by either winter active perennial pastures 4 catchments or eucalyptus globulus plantations 3 catchments located in 3 geologic settings of southeastern australia were studied for over 6 years to determine the primary controls on water resources groundwater levels in the pasture sites were stable through the 2011 2016 study period while levels in the plantations declined in the same period streamflow occurred mainly during winter annual streamflow showed no difference clearly attributable to pasture versus plantation land use the presence of grass buffers along streams enhances groundwater recharge and saturation dependent overland flow reducing the impacts of the plantations on streamflow site water balances indicated that the average annual actual evapotranspiration was 87 93 of precipitation for pasture catchments and 102 108 of precipitation for plantation catchments actual evapotranspiration greater than precipitation at the plantations was attributed to uptake of groundwater by the root system in parts of the catchments thus change to groundwater storage is a critical component in the water balance actual evapotranspiration from pasture

groundwater recharge and other components of the hydrologic cycle andréassian 2004 beck et al 2013 bosch and hewlett 1982 campbell and barber 2008 colville and holmes 1972 van lill et al 1980 the negative impacts of these shifts in land use include decreased water supply and degraded water quality at local and regional scales dean et al 2014 2015 the majority of previous investigations have indicated that an increase in tree cover typically affects the catchment water budget by increasing actual evapotranspiration eta decreasing streamflow and decreasing groundwater recharge but there is high variability globally and within specific regions brown et al 2005 mcvicar et al 2007 scott et al 2000 van dijk and keenan 2007 zhang et al 2001 the difficulty in controlling or even characterizing variables such as geologic setting including bedrock geology unconsolidated sediments soils and topography at the catchment scale means generalization of findings to other locations is problematic the interrelationships between variables controlling the water balance such as precipitation p vegetation growth and eta is a challenge to predicting land use change impacts and development of water management policies table 1 summarizes some of the key findings from existing studies on the effect of afforestation and deforestation on water resources including previous work at our sites and this study for completeness a wide variability of responses to land uses is seen in global studies in southeastern australia catchment studies were mainly carried out in the high rainfall native eucalyptus forests with a limited number of studies of pinus plantations bren and hopmans 2007 bren et al 2010 bren 1997 bren and lane 2014 burch et al 1987 cornish and vertessy 2001 and few catchment scale studies on eucalyptus plantations plot scale studies of eta in southeastern australia did not include direct measurement of groundwater or streamflow so they may not apply to catchment scales benyon et al 2007 benyon and doody 2004 benyon et al 2009 2006 only a few catchment studies include monitoring of the groundwater system almeida et al 2016 istanbulluoglu et al 2012a rodríguez suárez et al 2011 silveira et al 2016 therefore the relationships between precipitation and both eta and streamflow typically do not account for the effects of groundwater recharge on the water balance when groundwater is considered the catchments are usually assumed closed with respect to groundwater flow i e the groundwater divide at the top of the catchment corresponds to the surface water divide and groundwater discharges to streams within the catchments as baseflow soil water storage is typically assumed to respond rapidly to changes in vegetation and reach a near steady state but saturated groundwater storage is not usually addressed few studies have taken place in intermittent catchments although several workers have noted a change from perennial to intermittent flow with afforestation brown et al 2013 2005 scott and lesch 1997 scott and prinsloo 2008 scott et al 2000 zhang et al 2012 uptake of groundwater by deep rooted vegetation such as plantation trees can alter the catchment water balance by increasing eta benyon et al 2007 benyon 2002 benyon and doody 2004 benyon et al 2009 2006 streamflow and groundwater flow are expected to be affected by a number of factors related to intermittent flow the limited connection between groundwater and surface water in intermittent streams decreases baseflow compared to perennial systems istanbulluoglu et al 2012b there is likely to be a greater lag in establishment of valley bottom saturation and saturation dependent overland flow in intermittent catchments and the extent of area contributing to saturation dependent flow is likely to be smaller this suggests that the streamflow may be sensitive to changes in the groundwater system induced by land use change this study investigates the interrelated effects of land use geologic settings and precipitation variability on the water yield of small intermittent upland catchments in victoria australia hardwood eucalyptus globulus blue gum plantation was the dominant land use within one catchment at each setting and winter active native perennial pasture was the dominant land use at the other catchments the primary research questions were 1 what are the differences between plantations and pastures in terms of groundwater resources and how important is it to factor groundwater into water balance changes 2 what are the effects of contrasting land uses on streamflow and eta do the water dynamics in our research catchments support the water budget relationships derived from other global studies and particularly studies in southeastern australia 3 how does the geologic setting affect the water balance and relate to the water resource effects of plantations these objectives provide the structural sub headings used in the following methods results and discussion sections the discussion section additionally addresses the implications of the research to water and land use management policy 2 study area 2 1 site description the study area is located in the hopkins and crawford river catchments of the glenelg river basin in southwestern victoria australia fig 1 the study includes seven catchments in three areas named according to the closest adjacent townships gatum farm gf and gatum plantation gp mirranatwa farm mf and mirranatwa plantation mp and digby farm north dfn digby farm south dfs and digby plantation dp the farm catchments are predominantly sheep and cattle grazing of winter active perennial grasses with minor cropping and small treed areas the plantation catchments include varying amounts of pasture and unplanted grassland areas along the valley bottoms gp was planted in 2005 with a stand density of 800 trees ha adelana et al 2015 that decreased to 730 in 2015 mean diameter at breast height over bark at the end of 2016 was 23 8 cm with a mean tree height of 20 m at mp planted in 2008 surveys taken between 2011 and 2015 saw the mean height of trees increase from 8 9 to 13 7 m with the mean diameter at breast height over bark growing from 9 6 to 14 3 cm the number of trees per hectare declined from 1139 to 889 darren shelden macquarie forestry pers comm the plantation at dp was planted in 2001 at a stocking density of 700 to 800 trees ha and was harvested between late 2015 and early 2016 adrian marty elders forestry pers comm the dp catchment includes 55 ha of native eucalyptus forest that was not harvested 2 2 geologic setting and topography the catchment designations geology and physical characteristics are listed in table 2 catchment perimeters and areas were determined using differentially corrected global positioning system gps elevations tied to geoscience australia benchmarks elevations used the australian height datum ahd interpolation between measured locations was performed by hand and guided by topographic maps and field observations catchments were subdivided into valley bottom mid slope and upper slope landscape positions see table 2 based on subjective evaluation of the topographic maps except at dp where only mid slope and valley bottom were used because of the low relief calculation of height above nearest drainage hand is a method to assess the hydrologic effects of topography and to classify landscapes to develop conceptual models gharari et al 2011 nobre et al 2011 rennó et al 2008 the hand analysis calculates the height difference m between each cell in a digital terrain model dtm and the height of the cell where flow from that location first reaches the drainage line we used hand based on a 20 m by 20 m dtm with vertical accuracy of 5 m or better department of environment land water planning 2014 to assess the topographic differences between the monitored catchments the low relief in some locations meant that the boundaries shown in the hand analysis determined from the state wide 20 m by 20 m dtm are less accurate than our more detailed surveyed catchment areas the drainage line cells were defined as those where flow accumulation is from an area 0 1 km2 this value was chosen because it captures drainage networks in each study catchment and is similar to the drainage shown in the state of victoria topographic layers the hand map for each study catchment and histograms of the distribution show similarity in topography and stream drainage for catchments within each geologic setting fig 2 the mirranatwa catchments are the steepest at the gatum sites gp has the drainage extending somewhat farther up the catchment but the differences are considered unlikely to have a major effect on the flow dynamics the relatively flat topography at the digby sites means that large areas of each catchment are near stream level the central part of dfs is dominated by an ellipsoidal area at stream level a smaller area with elevations near the stream is also seen in the center of the dfn catchment the central part of the dp catchment shows drainage on the hand map but was a closed depression until a drain to the north was constructed we interpret these features as being dolines in the underlying port campbell limestone indicating potential recharge areas soil development contrasts between locations the gatum site is dominated by yellow and brown mottled chromosol soil developed over saprolitic gatum ignimbrite rhyolite of the lower devonian rockland volcanics baxter and robinson 2001 the mirranatwa site has yellow and brown solodic soil over weathered granitic devonian victoria valley batholith sibley 1967 the soil type at the digby sites is variable with dp generally being sandier baxter and robinson 2001 described it as a black vertisol developed on late miocene pliocene marine loxton clay and sands that overlie late oligocene to late miocene heytesbury group port campbell limestone depth to limestone is 8 m at dfs and dfn while 60 m at dp perveen 2016 2 3 climate annual historic precipitation from bureau of meteorology bom sites near the study areas are listed in table 2 together with measurements from this study precipitation during the study was greatest in the digby catchments and lowest at mirranatwa the study catchments were established in 2009 2010 at the end of the millennium drought the worst drought on record for southeastern australia with approximately 8 years of below long term average precipitation van dijk et al 2013 yang et al 2017 the drought broke in 2010 with high precipitation widespread flooding continued through the 2011 summer precipitation is winter dominated and annual precipitation in the region is highly variable using data in the period 1984 2017 hamilton airport bom station 090173 february is the hottest month having a mean monthly maximum temperature of 26 8 c daily maximum temperature range 13 8 44 5 c and mean monthly minimum temperature of 11 3 c daily minimum temperature range 2 1 24 7 c july is the coldest month with mean monthly maximum temperature of 12 1 c daily maximum temperature range 6 2 18 7 c and mean monthly minimum temperature of 4 4 c daily minimum temperature range 2 8 11 3 c 3 data collection and analysis 3 1 precipitation precipitation was recorded at 10 minute intervals using tipping bucket rain gauges at gatum mirranatwa digby farm and digby plantation measurements were summed to 30 min and daily values mm d 1 daily precipitation data were supplemented with data from nearby bom stations see fig 1 to infill missing or suspect data when the onsite gauges clogged or data loggers failed this affected a maximum of 5 4 of the data at the dp catchment largely as the result of a logger failure in 2011 correlation of daily data between our gauges and the bom stations was satisfactory r2 0 78 0 95 with the exception of the gatum sites r2 0 44 only one daily measurement at gatum was replaced with bom data so the poor correlation has little effect 3 2 groundwater analysis groundwater levels were measured in wells installed for this study and some pre existing wells locations are shown in fig 2 and construction details are given in the supplementary data the locations and surface elevation were measured with differentially corrected survey grade gps groundwater levels were measured from 2009 or early 2010 through december 2016 and were presented as either depth below ground surface m or elevation above australian height datum m ahd water level measurements were logged at 4 hr intervals with campbell diver instrumentation northwest or troll data loggers measurements were barometrically compensated and corrected to periodic manual measurements visual trend assessment was used to exclude suspect data data that result from data logger failure and where the water levels recovered slowly after purging for sampling were excluded changes in groundwater level were used to calculate changes in annual groundwater storage δsgw m3 y 1 converted to mm y 1 beneath the catchments δsgw was calculated by multiplying the average decline for wells at each landscape position by area and the specific yield unitless estimated from sediment grain size adelana et al 2015 dean et al 2015 perveen 2016 δsgw and other water volumes used in the water balance section 3 4 were converted to mm by dividing by the catchment area applying unit conversion factors and summing over the time of interest e g daily or annual values groundwater outflow from the catchments qgw m3 d 1 converted to mm d 1 was calculated from darcy s law for one dimensional flow 1 q gw kia where k m d 1 is the average hydraulic conductivity of the aquifer estimated from sediment grainsize i unitless is the hydraulic gradient calculated from a planar fit to average january summer groundwater levels in 3 widely spaced wells in each catchment and a m2 is the cross sectional area of groundwater outflow the aquifer depth used to calculate a was estimated from geologic maps and site drilling data a width equal to the catchment width approximately perpendicular to the flow direction was selected as an upper bound to a such that eta calculated from the water balance section 3 4 could be considered as a lower estimate 3 3 streamflow analysis streamflow qsw was measured at flow control weirs at the outlet of each catchment measurements were initiated in 2010 and this study considers the full calendar years 2011 2016 flow data were divided by the respective catchment area and summed over time periods of interest to be expressed as equivalent water depth in mm time 1 intense rain periods caused flow to overtop some of the weirs leading to an underestimation of total flow this particularly affected the flow measured at the gp catchment where the maximum flow rate measurable at the weir was 4 5 mm d 1 because of the logistics of installation the events where the streams overtopped the weirs were generally infrequent and short lived with the exception of the gp catchment in 2016 when flood debris blocked the weir causing slow drainage pipe erosion and or tunnelling by cherax destructor common yabby caused leakage under the mp weir in the period february 2011 to may 2011 accordingly the flow at this site for that time period may be underestimated this predominantly affects the estimation of the timing of flow in 2011 rather than the total flow because the weir was repaired prior to the onset of the wet winter season some of the series had gaps in the data 12 d were missing at gf 18 d at mf 5 d at df and 122 d at dp the days missing at dp were between march and july 2012 and in january 2013 we believe that most of the flows were recorded because these periods commonly do not show large flows streamflow for the different catchments was summarized to daily quarterly and yearly values flow duration curves from 30 minute flow data are presented for the combined 2011 2016 periods 3 4 water balance and evapotranspiration annual actual evapotranspiration eta was calculated from the annual catchment water balance as 2 e t a p q sw q gw δ s gw δ s vz where p is precipitation qsw is streamflow qgw is groundwater outflow δsgw is change in groundwater storage change in water volume below the water table and δsvz is change in vadose zone moisture storage change in water storage between the water table and the ground surface the unsaturated zone and the capillary fringe units for the components of eq 2 are mm time 1 totalled over the measurement period of interest p and qsw were measured qgw and δsgw were determined as discussed in section 3 2 δsvz is assumed to be 0 at the annual and longer timescales although water content possibly decreased as the roots extended into the deeper vadose zone during plantation establishment if the last three terms in eq 2 are neglected as a first approximation qsw approaches 0 at low p and approaches p et0 at high p where et0 is the potential evapotranspiration mcguire and bren 2013 zhang et al 2001 this suggests that a plot of annual qsw versus p may fit a power function of the form 3 q sw a p b where a is expected to be a small positive number because qsw p at low values of p and b is positive the parameters a and b are fit to the data by ordinary least squares equation 3 is equivalent to the midgely pitman curves described in greenwood et al 2014 neglecting the linear form used above a critical threshold of p the role of vegetation type on eta and catchment water balance from our study was compared to that from world wide catchment experiments reviewed by zhang et al 1999 2001 who developed a relationship between long term average annual eta and annual precipitation for forest and grass catchments referred to as the zhang curves 4 et a f 1 2 1410 p 1 2 1410 p p 1410 1 f 1 0 5 1100 p 1 0 5 1100 p p 1100 p where p is the annual precipitation and f is the fraction of forest cover the values 1410 and 1100 in eq 4 relate to the potential evapotranspiration for treed and un treed catchments respectively at low values of annual precipitation eta increases linearly with precipitation and approaches a constant value equal to potential evapotranspiration at high annual precipitation 4 methods 4 1 effects on the groundwater system groundwater level measurements were used to determine groundwater flow directions at the study sites and calculate streamflow for incorporation into the water balance the spatial and temporal variation in depth to the water table across the catchments shows the degree of groundwater stream connectivity seasonal groundwater recharge is indicated by the degree of water table fluctuation dean et al 2015 δsgw indicates the change in the groundwater system resulting from plantation establishment and is included in the water balance 4 2 effects on streamflow and eta the effect of contrasting land uses i e pasture versus plantation on streamflow was evaluated by determining changes in flow at the catchment outlets on time scales that vary from the 30 min data collection interval to average annual values over the 2011 2016 study period the measurements were used to determine the variability in quarterly and annual streamflow within catchments and fit to descriptive precipitation streamflow curves see eq 3 flow duration curves for the catchments compare the relative contributions of peak flow and delayed flow for the catchments and compare the duration of flow between catchments water balance eta was compared between catchments and to that calculated in other studies 4 3 effect of geologic setting the study catchments were set in three different geologic environments to provide understanding of the source of variability in the relationship between precipitation streamflow and eta our hypothesis was that lithology and topography change the relationship between precipitation streamflow and groundwater recharge steeper topography likely enhances streamflow at the expense of infiltration additionally the hydrogeologic setting including depth to groundwater affects the ability of tree roots to reach the water table the interpretation of these effects is necessarily qualitative but forms the basis for conceptualizing catchment models e g dean et al 2016 5 results 5 1 effects on the groundwater system representative catchment summer water table maps for january 2014 near the middle of the study period and when influence of seasonal recharge events on individual wells is minimal are shown in fig 3 the water table contours shown are consistent with intermittent catchments that are not closed with respect to groundwater flow although the well spacing is not sufficient to completely constrain the flow directions in particular groundwater flow at the gp catchment is largely to the south whereas the stream drainage is to the southwest the southerly groundwater flow increases the cross sectional area used to calculate qgw over that of gf the groundwater at the dp catchment is interpreted to converge on a drainage to the east controlled by solution enhanced permeability within the underlying limestone this means that the groundwater gradient in the eastern part of the site converges sharply from the north and south but the gradient to the east is much lower the depth to groundwater along the west east line through the catchment is greater than 25 m groundwater levels at the farm site wells were generally steady except for seasonal fluctuations fig 4 the levels increased from higher precipitation and recharge in 2010 2011 and 2016 and decreased slowly during drier years water table fluctuations at the gf and mf catchments are greatest along the valley bottoms as a result of greater recharge and a shallower depth to groundwater dean et al 2015 the plantation monitoring wells show declining water levels and lower seasonal fluctuation showing that recharge is nearly absent except near the streams and in areas lacking trees the water table decline in mp was slow through 2011 apparently because of the recently planted trees but it is difficult to separate the effect of tree growth from the high precipitation in late 2010 and early 2011 in spite of the maturity in dp the water table continued to decline at least through 2015 in 2016 water levels increased in dp wells 5532 5537 and 5540 because of the high precipitation combined with harvesting of the plantation trees in late 2015 early 2016 the small but continuing water table decline at dp prior to harvesting in late 2015 2016 shows that a new steady state was not reached within the harvest cycle of 14 years 5 2 effects on streamflow and eta catchment flow is dynamic with sharp peaks associated with rain events fig 5 flow peaks typically occur within 4 h of precipitation peaks late spring through late autumn flow is only associated with large rain events more continuous flow occurs during the winter except in 2015 which was very dry resulting in minimal winter flow annual total flow in all catchments is very low when annual precipitation is below 400 to 600 mm y 1 table 3 fig 6 annual and mean streamflow over the 6 year period was lower at the gp and dp compared to gf and both dfn and dfs however it was almost identical in the case of the two sites at mirranatwa mp and mf see table 3 flow at gp is lower than gf when precipitation is less than 800 mm y 1 streamflow at gp in 2016 the wettest year apparently exceeded that of gf but this may be caused by the difficulty of measuring large flows accurately the similarity in average streamflow for the mirranatwa catchments is largely because of the much higher peak flow for mp offsetting mf s higher flow between intense rain events the mirranatwa catchments were better fit by linear regression than by power functions fig 6 showed that the flow in the winter quarter q3 between july and september is linearly correlated between catchments for each geologic setting during the other quarters the plantation flow often plots above the q3 trend in response to intense rain events following periods of no flow this can be explained by a proportionally greater effect of infiltration excess overland flow at the plantations from differences in under story vegetation or soil hydrophobicity the timing of flow was highly variable from year to year fig 7 winter flow was continuous in the july september q3 period most years but could start as early as april and extend as late as november depending on the catchment and year flow duration curves constructed from the 30 min measurements fig 8 show that the period of catchment flow ranged from 18 of the time at dfs to a maximum of 45 at gf 75 of the flow volume occurred in less than 10 of the time period for every catchment the flow duration curves have high slope at the high flow periods and become steep again when the catchments cease flowing the latter sudden drop in flow likely results from nonlinearity in the drainage chapman 1999 the shallow slope in the center of the flow duration curves is commonly attributed to groundwater baseflow although other delayed flow such as drainage of surface water storage or perched flow may also contribute the curves show higher delayed flow at farm catchments than at plantations the flow duration does not appear to be affected by the declining groundwater levels in the plantations see table 3 the most likely explanation is that the annual flow duration is controlled by the extent of water storage along the valley bottom rather than groundwater baseflow this storage may be in near stream soils or farm dams possibly supplemented by flow in perched aquifers water levels measured in some of the wells that were installed at gf and mf during early 1990s are still much deeper than the depths before the millennium drought thus connectivity between the groundwater and surface water in the pastures may still be affected by the drought eta in the water balance see eq 2 makes up 87 to 108 of the precipitation table 4 all plantation catchments had higher calculated eta than the farm catchments in comparable geologic settings however this did not directly translate to a reduction in streamflow because of differences in δsgw and qgw the calculated eta for the plantations was greater than 100 because of a loss of groundwater from storage in the plantation catchments the importance of δsgw in evaluating eta and catchment baseflow has previously been noted istanbulluoglu et al 2012b groundwater storage loss within the plantation catchments cannot be explained by baseflow to the streams or qgw because δsgw is greater than qsw qgw even though our calculation was designed to place an upper bound on qgw thus the δsgw is best explained by direct uptake of groundwater by the trees this uptake is greatest in the mid slope position higher in the catchment the water table appears to be too deep for access by the tree roots lower in the catchment much of the land is not treed and the water table is affected by focused recharge in the valley bottom it appears that higher salinity in the valley bottom is detrimental to growth and limits the groundwater uptake dean et al 2016 although some eucalyptus species are known to tolerate saline groundwater benyon et al 1999 feikema et al 2010 plantation water balance eta higher than that calculated from the zhang curves is largely explained by inclusion of groundwater components of the water balance table 4 the difference in eta calculated for plantation versus farm catchments ranges from 14 for gatum and mirranatwa to 21 for digby dfn versus dp the difference calculated from the zhang curve ranges from 16 to 17 at gatum and mirranatwa to 25 at digby however if eta is calculated from only p qsw as used for the zhang data the difference in eta between farm and plantation catchments at gatum and mirranatwa is less than 2 p qsw is still 19 higher at dp than at dfn because of the low streamflow from the dp s central depression 5 3 effect of geologic setting the subsurface limestone karst at the digby sites had a large effect on the groundwater and surface water systems other sites illustrate features related to groundwater flow direction artesian conditions and perched flow the runoff at digby is largely controlled by flow in the underlying karstic limestone although the water table is in the upper clays and sands the relationship between annual precipitation and streamflow at the digby farm sites is highly variable years with precipitation between 700 and 800 mm y 1 have streamflow varying by more than three times see fig 6 the variability is controlled by both the timing of precipitation within the year and the continued effects from previous years precipitation level the flow duration curve at dfs is much shorter than at dfn but the shape during high flow periods is nearly identical see fig 8 thus peak overland flow is largely unaffected by the geologic differences the annual flow at dp is considerably lower than at the digby farm catchments during wet years in spite of slightly higher precipitation fig 6 dp flow tends to be less continuous than dfn but more continuous than dfs most years fig 7 the deep water table in the center of the dp catchment means that there is no groundwater connectivity to produce saturation dependent overland flow the surface depression holds runoff to drain slowly extending the flow duration curve fig 8 the doline may focus recharge to the aquifer mitigating the effect of the plantation eta on the water budget the geologic setting has more subtle effects at the mirranatwa sites the aquifer at the mp weir is strongly artesian with head above the land surface the water level contours in fig 3 suggest that this is largely due to pressure induced by the granite at higher elevation to the northwest not shown and the potential for preferential fracture flow dean et al 2014 the upward gradient near the mp stream prolongs saturation of the sediments contributing to the longer but lower flow duration curve at mp compared to mf fig 8 this interpretation is supported by radon measurements dean et al 2015 the head in well 2292 near the mp weir remains artesian but is declining so the conditions contributing to the extended flow duration may not persist as the plantation matures fig 4 this suggests the curve may reach a tipping point where the aquifer cannot support streamflow through baseflow or saturation dependant overland flow alternatively the artesian head might mitigate impacts on flow duration through the entire growth and harvest cycle it is unclear how the local geology relates to the extremely large streamflow response to high precipitation at gp in 2016 the rapid response to precipitation events and the observed debris near the weir indicate enhanced overland flow this suggests waterlogging is induced by lateral flow within the soil b horizon and within the kaolinized pallid zone on top of the weathered ignimbrites as observed at gf by brouwer and fitzpatrick 2002 6 discussion 6 1 groundwater flow direction and level trends the plantation catchment groundwater levels declined markedly in most monitoring wells away from the stream lines whereas the levels did not change significantly in the farm catchment monitoring wells in addition the seasonal fluctuation was higher in farm wells the decreased seasonality and declining water levels in the plantations are consistent with a decrease in groundwater recharge as a result of increased eta by the trees this decrease in groundwater recharge is in agreement with previous research amdan et al 2013 fan et al 2014 rodríguez suárez et al 2011 although no decrease was seen by silveira et al 2016 the change in δsgw is seldom included in catchment water balance calculations however it can be significant where the catchments are not closed to groundwater i e where groundwater is not discharged as baseflow that is incorporated into streamflow the un treed buffer left along drainage lines in the plantations results in recharge on the lower slopes similar to that in the pasture catchments runoff concentrates the recharge in the lower landscape dean et al 2015 flow in perched water tables can also concentrate recharge in the lower landscape water levels at or near the surface in valley bottom monitoring wells suggest hydraulic connection between groundwater and surface water causing saturation dependent overland flow during and shortly after winter precipitation saturation dependent overland flow will promote high streamflow during rain events 6 2 streamflow and eta most previous research has concluded that streamflow declines with afforestation as a result of greater eta see table 1 however large variability in the precipitation streamflow relationship has been noted and the findings of decreased streamflow are not universal we did not see an indication of decreased streamflow in the plantation catchments this is in contrast to the work of silveira et al 2016 where streamflow increased with afforestation but no effect on recharge was seen our results support previous findings that eta is increased where groundwater is accessible to the tree roots and suggest that the depths where this occurs may be greater than indicated by plot studies benyon 2002 benyon and doody 2004 benyon et al 2009 benyon et al 2006 the higher eta for our pasture catchments compared to the zhang et al 1999 un treed catchment curve is in agreement with their pasture and crop data from australia fig 9 this high eta for the pasture was not expected and means that afforestation only has a small effect on the water balance unless plantation eta is supplemented by groundwater uptake conversely dye 2013 noted that the extremely low water use of the native fynbos in south africa exaggerates the difference in water use between fynbos and pinus plantations suggesting caution is needed in applying results between landscapes with different pre existing vegetation the cause of the high pasture eta for the australian setting is unknown a relative increase in plantation streamflow compared to pasture flow was attributed to overland flow in three specific situations in our study to our knowledge this has not been observed in previous catchment investigations the first is the annual flow in the gp catchment in 2016 which was close to that in gf this suggests that during periods of intense rainfall the increased eta of trees has little effect on runoff this contrasts with the zhang curve model where qsw for treed catchments is predicted to remain below that of un treed catchments trees likely increase leaf and litter interception and drier soil may delay the start of infiltration dependent overland flow but once the system is wet there will be no further effect on runoff thus the precipitation streamflow relationship will depend not only on the amount of precipitation but on the intensity the second case is the relatively higher plantation response to intense summer rains this is consistent with soil hydrophobicity seen in eucalyptus plantations and forests dry hydrophobic soils will enhance runoff and will become less hydrophobic in wetter seasons burch et al 1987 burch et al 1989 doerr et al 2003 2000 ferreira et al 2000 infiltration tests at the gatum site showed higher infiltration for the farm pasture than for the plantation reynolds 2010 this makes little difference in annual streamflow but may be important ecologically in helping the persistence in remnant surface water pools in intermittent ephemeral streams the final situation is the greater runoff that may be induced by deep ripping of soil during plantation establishment as described by dean et al 2016 this suggests that design changes might be useful in improving catchment water management e g by channelling runoff downslope for greater water yield or conversely by delaying runoff to decrease peak flows 6 3 effect of geologic setting differences in geologic setting alter the groundwater recharge affect connectivity between groundwater and surface water and increase the variability in catchment flow in response to precipitation the water table decline noted in our plantation catchments implies that flow duration in these intermittent catchments may ultimately become shorter although the variability in precipitation dominates the inter annual flow variability thus the impacts may be different in regions with more consistent precipitation and for plantations with longer harvest cycles the nonlinearity in precipitation versus annual flow complicates inter catchment comparison and indicates that extrapolation of flow relationships such as those used in paired catchment studies may not be appropriate because the nonlinear relationship cannot always be predicted from a limited measurement period land use impacts of plantation development have been studied in the south australia karst where the impact of direct uptake of groundwater was documented colville and holmes 1972 holmes and colville 1970 our study shows the influence of subsurface limestone even when covered by other sedimentary formations the karst topography controls the depth to groundwater and ability for direct groundwater use by trees the development of saturation dependent overland flow and may induce focused recharge along streams and in depressions karst areas may need special consideration because their precipitation streamflow relationship is highly variable and dependent on local conditions 6 4 policy implications the state of victoria has developed strategies to manage the water resource impacts of land use change but these have not yet been enacted department of sustainability and environment 2011a b the policy recognizes potential streamflow and groundwater impacts but much of the focus has been on streamflow south australian policy in contrast has focused more on groundwater use by plantations new plantations in southeastern south australia may be licensed to use groundwater users because of the shallow water table and minimal surface water use greenwood 2013 our investigation indicates that groundwater use by plantations in victoria is significant in keeping with previous work benyon and doody 2004 but the maximum depth to groundwater for uptake by trees has not been established the larger eta in the plantation catchments however was not seen to have a major effect on the streamflow because baseflow is already minimal as a result of the seasonal nature of the precipitation and only seasonal connectivity between groundwater and surface water thus we suggest that policy development in victoria should increase focus on areas where the groundwater resource is of significant importance this is particularly true in freshwater aquifer recharge areas as recharge will be reduced by the increased eta of plantations the variability of pasture and plantation streamflow in different geologic settings presents a challenge in developing water management policy the site specific nature of the land use impacts suggests that flexibility may be possible within management areas if the industry can show that a proposed plantation development is unlikely to have major impact the high pasture water use calculated from water balance for our study and others in australia shows that the baseline pasture water use has not always been properly considered in evaluating the effects of afforestation the discrepancy from global curves indicates that those curves are not appropriate for evaluating the effects of land use changes in australia 7 conclusion our investigation demonstrated a large effect of plantations on the groundwater system with a major reduction in groundwater recharge and a loss of groundwater storage but there was no clear effect on streamflow consideration of groundwater levels and flow directions indicated that the intermittent stream catchments were not closed to groundwater flow and that baseflow to streams was small thus the change in δsgw must be considered in the water balance calculation of eta the reduced recharge and uptake of groundwater by tree roots led to a loss of groundwater storage however apportioning groundwater flux within the catchment between baseflow streamflow and uptake by deep rooted vegetation remains challenging most global studies have shown high eta in forests and plantations and thus increased water use caused by plantation establishment this study does not contradict the high eta in plantation systems but instead indicates that eta for pastures in the 500 to 1000 mm y 1 annual precipitation region of southeast australia is higher than for pastures in equivalent precipitation regions elsewhere in the world the explanation for the high pasture eta in southeastern australia has not been established acknowledgments this study was initiated and funded by the victoria

7096,the three gorges reservoir tgr is the world s largest hydrological project however the response of thallium tl in tgr sediments to reservoir operation remains highly uncertain here we investigated the pollution characteristics of tl in tgr sediments during five consecutive water seasons geochemical baseline concentrations gbcs were used to distinguish the anthropogenic input of tl and to quantitatively estimate the tl anthropogenic contribution in tgr sediments the results showed that the average tl concentration in tgr sediments was 0 72 0 14 mg kg ranging from 0 26 to 1 07 mg kg during five consecutive water seasons the average tl content in tributary sediment was higher than that in mainstream sediment in the mainstream tl in tgr sediments showed an accumulation tendency from the upstream to downstream additionally the temporal variation revealed that the mean value of tl in tgr sediments in the dry season was higher than that in the wet season during 2015 2016 furthermore the average gbcs of tl 0 71 mg kg was higher than background values bvs in the yangtze river sediments using the gbcs of different water seasons to calculate the anthropogenic input of tl in the tgr the average anthropogenic contribution was found to be approximately 6 43 2 81 9 12 the assessment results by two different methods geo accumulation index and potential ecological risk index used gbcs as the bvs indicating that tgr sediments were at uncontaminated level and close to the low ecological risk respectively comparing to the gbc of tl the assessment of tl pollution in tgr using bvs in the yangtze river sediments may be over evaluated this study is beneficial for assessing tl pollution in tgr sediments response to consecutive water seasons and estimating the anthropogenic contribution of tl keywords thallium sediments three gorges reservoir geochemical baseline consecutive water seasons pollution assessment 1 introduction thallium tl is a non essential element found in trace amounts in the earth s crust with average concentrations of 0 1 1 7 mg kg peter and viraraghavan 2005 due to its acute and chronic toxicity tl is considered a priority toxic pollutant kazantzis 2000 peter and viraraghavan 2005 emissions from anthropogenic industrial activities e g coal combustion and ferrous and non ferrous mining smelting lead to the increase of tl concentrations in the environment karbowska 2016 kazantzis 2000 peter and viraraghavan 2005 therefore in order to control environmental contamination by tl several governments have established water standards for tl the maximum contaminant level in drinking water is 0 1 μg l in china cns 2006 0 8 μg l in canada ccme 2003 and 2 μg l in the usa usepa 1992 compared with tl in water limited research has been conducted on tl in sediments and the relevant sediments standards are lacking sediments in water environments can act as sources and sinks of trace metals and metals in the sediment can be released into the water body hence a better understanding of the anthropogenic impacts and geochemical behavior of tl in sediments would be worthwhile the three gorges reservoir tgr is the world s largest hydrological project it sustains the environment in the middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river and is important to national drinking water security after the completion of the project the water level fluctuates between 145 and 175 m the tgr operation follows characteristics of anti seasonal water level variations with high water levels in winter dry season and low levels in summer wet season bing et al 2016 in recent years water contamination issues regarding trace metals in tgr sediments have been increasingly highlighted in comparison with the common monitored trace metals e g cu zn pb and cd han et al 2015 tang et al 2014 wang et al 2012 limited research has been focused on the pollution status of tl in tgr sediments han et al 2015 and jia et al 2014 reported on the concentrations and distributions of tl in sediments of several tributaries of the tgr another study investigated tl concentrations in sediments of the entire tgr and found that the mean tl concentration was 0 58 mg kg in the dry season gao et al 2014 however the response of tl environmental behavior in tgr sediments to consecutive water seasons remains uncertain in fact reservoir operation could affect the migration and transformation of trace metals in tgr sediments bing et al 2016 holbach et al 2014 the geo accumulation index igeo enrichment factor ef and potential ecological risk parameter er have often been used to quantitatively assess the trace metal contamination in sediments gao et al 2015 han et al 2015 the selection of background values bvs is important for the pollution assessment by these methods most previous studies selected bvs in soils and sediments in china or the yangtze river as background reference values in the tgr however the bvs of trace metals for soils and sediments mainly depend on local geological properties such as the crustal composition jiang et al 2013 multiple bvs are required across a large area as the use of a single regional bv has the disadvantage of disregarding the variability of trace metal contents due to geological conditions covelli and fontolan 1997 fukue et al 2006 consequently previous studies may not have provided accurate assessments of the pollution status in tgr sediments furthermore it is necessary to select suitable bvs for assessing trace metal pollution in the tgr geochemical baseline concentrations gbcs are defined as the natural levels of trace metals in soils bech et al 2005 galán et al 2008 tian et al 2017 and sediments liu et al 2013 studies have been conducted to determine the gbcs of trace metals in different regions and these have been successfully applied to the assessment of trace metal pollution martin et al 2016 tian et al 2017 therefore gbcs should be established for tgr in particular this could lead to more suitable assessments for tl in tgr sediments this study was the attempt to use the gbcs to assess tl contamination in the entire tgr area during the consecutive water seasons the objectives of this study were 1 to clarify the spatial and temporal variation of tl in tgr sediments for five consecutive water seasons 2 to establish the gbcs for tl in tgr sediments and 3 to evaluate the pollution status of tl in tgr sediments using gbcs 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and sample collection the tgr is located in the main stem of the yangtze river in china and it covers an area of 58 000 km2 including a water area of 1080 km2 stone 2008 zhao et al 2017 the backwater of the tgr is approximately 660 km long and forms a typical river type reservoir from the three gorges dam tgd to jiangjin city in chongqing municipality bing et al 2016 the tgr area is located in western hubei province yichang city to the east of chongqing city 28 32 31 44 n and 105 44 111 39 e fig 1 the climate in the tgr area is primarily of the humid subtropical monsoonal type the mean annual temperature ranges from 16 5 to 19 0 c and the annual mean precipitation is approximately 1000 1200 mm with 80 falling during april october period bao et al 2015 ye et al 2013 the water operation of this project is of the anti season type characterized by a high water level 175 m in winter dry season and a low water level 145 m in summer wet season a total of 240 sediment samples were collected during five consecutive water seasons including 2015 wet season 2015 dry season 2016 wet season 2016 dry season and 2017 wet season respectively for each water season 48 sampling sites were located in the mainstream from upstream to downstream and tributaries of tgr thirty seven sediment samples s1 s37 were collected from the mainstream namely from the upstream to the front of the tgr dam eleven sediment samples t1 t11 were collected from major tributaries fig 1 in this study the upstream area of the mainstream was defined ranging from jiangbei district to fengdu town s37 s32 guo et al 2016 the mid stream area was defined ranging from fengdu town to fengjie town s32 s17 and the downstream area was demarcated as that from fengjie town to yichang city s17 s1 guo et al 2016 the tributaries of the study area included the wujiang qutang pengxi modao meixi daning yandu qinggan and xiangxi rivers fig 1 sediment samples were taken from the middle of the stream at each sampling site approximately 1 kg of sediment was collected in clean polyethylene bags and immediately transported to the laboratory the sediment samples were then freeze dried and gently crushed and ground in an agate mortar the crushed samples were then passed through an acid cleaned 0 25 mm nylon sieve for further analysis 2 2 analysis of metal concentrations a strong acid digestion method was used to analyze the total tl and li concentrations in the tgr sediments the details of this method have been provided in a previous report xu et al 2016 tl concentrations were analyzed using an inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer perkinelmer elan drc e usa the accuracy of the analytical procedures was controlled by certified reference materials namely gsd 10 gbw07310 and gsd 1a gbw07301a which were purchased from the chinese institute of geophysical and geochemical exploration these two sediment standard materials were analyzed using the same procedure as those for the tgr sediments and analysis results agreed with the certified values table s1 the recovery of the sediment standard materials ranged from 95 2 to 97 0 the limit of analysis detection in this study was 0 05 mg kg for tl 2 3 assessment of sediment pollution in this study the gbcs igeo and er were employed to evaluate the tl contamination in the tgr sediments 2 3 1 geochemical baseline concentration gbc of tl in tgr sediments the calculation of the gbc requires a normalization method based on a linear regression equation obtained from the correlation of concentrations between the element in question in this case tl and a conservative reference element teng and ni 2007 this study used lithium li as the conservative reference normalizing element because it is the best representative to fine particle size of the sediments teng and ni 2007 the equation defining the geochemical baseline model is as follows 1 c m a c n b where cm is the concentration of tl mg kg cn is the concentration of li mg kg and a and b are the regression constants in the x y scatterplot described by eq 1 data within the 95 confidence limit were characterized as naturally sourced data outside the 95 confidence limit were characterized as having anthropogenic sources teng and ni 2007 data from the anthropogenic sources were then removed and a linear regression was fitted to the remaining data from natural sources with new regression constants c and d we subsequently arrived at the following equation 2 b m c c n d where bm is the gbc of tl mg kg in the study area c n is the normalized average of li mg kg and c and d are the new regression constants using the normalized average li concentration the naturally sourced tl concentration was obtained this tl value was defined as the gbc of tl 2 3 2 igeo of tl in tgr sediments to evaluate the tl pollution in tgr sediments igeo was calculated for each sample this index has been widely applied to assess the pollution level of trace metals in sediments and soils han et al 2017 igeo was originally proposed by müller 1969 and can be defined as follows 3 i geo log 2 c n 1 5 b n where cn represents tl concentration in the sediment mg kg bn denotes the background concentration of tl mg kg and 1 5 corresponds to possible variation of crustal contribution in sediment mainly by weathering or bank erosion in the rivers a positive igeo generally indicates the contribution of anthropogenic activities contamination categories based on igeo are classified as follows uncontaminated igeo 0 uncontaminated to moderately contaminated 0 igeo 1 moderately contaminated 1 igeo 2 moderately to strongly contaminated 2 igeo 3 strongly contaminated 3 igeo 4 strongly to extremely contaminated 4 igeo 5 and extremely contaminated igeo 5 2 3 3 er of tl in tgr sediments the er was proposed by häkanson 1980 the single factor pollution parameter cr and er were calculated as follows 4 c r c x c 0 5 e r t r c r where cx represents the tl concentrations in the sediments and c0 is the regional background value of tl in the sediments the tl concentration in the yangtze river sediments 0 49 mg kg and the gbcs of tl for different seasons were used in this study table 1 according to gao et al 2008 the constant value for the toxic response factor tr is 40 the cr er and their corresponding classifications are listed in table s3 2 4 statistical analysis all statistical analyses in this study were performed using spss 17 0 and origin pro 2017 for windows software packages 3 results and discussion 3 1 spatial and temporal variations of tl in tgr surface sediments 3 1 1 spatial distribution of tl in tgr surface sediments the tl concentrations in tgr sediments collected during five water seasons are presented in table 1 the average tl concentration was 0 72 0 14 mg kg ranging from 0 26 to 1 07 mg kg in these water seasons which was higher than that in yangtze river sediments 0 49 mg kg chi and yan 2007 in addition the mean value of tl in tgr sediments was slightly higher than those values in previous studies gao et al 2014 han et al 2015 jia et al 2014 these results indicated that tl may have a certain degree of enrichment in the tgr sediments compared with the soil bvs the average value was 1 24 times that of the soil bvs in hubei province 0 58 mg kg cnemc 1990 the obtained average concentration in tgr sediments was also higher than that of the soil bv in china 0 62 mg kg chi and yan 2007 compared to other reservoirs in china the tl content in tgr sediments was higher than that of the miyun reservoir 0 49 mg kg located in northern china han et al 2017 the spatial distribution patterns of tl concentrations in tgr sediments are presented in fig 2 the results showed that the average tl concentrations in the tributary sediments 0 77 0 14 mg kg were slightly higher than those in the mainstream sediments 0 71 0 14 mg kg in terms of the mainstream the spatial distribution trend of tl in tgr sediments was in the following order upstream mid stream downstream fig 2 this phenomenon can be explained as follows due to the barrier effect of the tgd on water flow the water flow velocity of the reservoir decreases from upstream to downstream resulting in the deposition of fine particles in the lower reaches moreover metals in water are easily enriched in fine particulate matter because of the large surface area this phenomenon was also noted in other studies gao et al 2015 zhao et al 2017 tl concentrations in sediments of different tgr tributaries did not show obvious spatial distribution tendencies because of the complex interaction between the mainstream and tributaries during different water seasons the highest tl contents were found in different sampling sites during five water seasons 2015 2017 the highest tl concentrations appeared at s14 in the 2015 wet season 0 94 mg kg s5 in the 2015 dry season 0 80 mg kg s12 in the 2016 wet season 0 81 mg kg s3 in the 2016 dry season 1 02 mg kg and s2 in the 2017 wet season 0 96 mg kg in general these sampling sites were located in the lower branch of the mainstream in the tgr this phenomenon might be attributed to the following two reasons firstly the hydrological regime principally influenced sediment redistribution and trace metal enrichment as mentioned earlier the water flow velocity of the reservoir decreased from upstream to downstream and this resulted in the deposition of fine particles in the lower reaches friedl and wuest 2002 secondly the rapid development of the mining industry may be responsible for increased tl concentrations for example sample s5 was collected near the coal mining town of zigui coal mined at zigui contains high quantities of sulfide minerals which usually contain high concentrations in sulfide minerals xiao et al 2012 hence tl may be released during mining activity 3 1 2 temporal variation of tl in tgr sediments temporal variation of tl in tgr sediments during 2015 2016 is presented in fig 3 in the mainstream the average tl concentration in sediments was higher in the dry season than that in the wet season in the same year this result may be attributed to the release of metals from the soils in the water level fluctuation zones after water impoundment during the dry season previous studies have also found that metals could accumulate in the tgr riparian zone bing et al 2016 pei et al 2018 and these metals may have a potential release risk from the water level fluctuation riparian zones the average tl concentrations in the mainstream and tributary sediments in 2016 0 76 mg kg and 0 85 mg kg respectively were higher than the corresponding ones in 2015 0 62 mg kg and 0 64 mg kg respectively 3 2 gbc of tl in tgr sediments li was selected as the inert element to calculate the gbc of tl in tgr sediments the relationships between li and tl concentrations in these sediments during the five water seasons are presented in fig s1 all points that fell outside the 95 confidence band were removed fig s1 and fig s2 the remaining data points were used to develop the gbcs to improve the correlation coefficients table 2 the correlation coefficients of five water seasons ranged from 0 9600 to 0 9962 five gbcs of tl were calculated for each of the five water seasons in terms of eq 2 the results showed that the gbcs of tl in tgr sediments were 0 64 mg kg for the 2015 wet season 0 62 mg kg for the 2015 dry season 0 66 mg kg for the 2016 wet season 0 83 mg kg for the 2016 dry season and 0 76 mg kg for the 2017 wet season respectively table 2 these results suggested that the gbcs of tl in tgr sediments fluctuated during the consecutively monitored water seasons in general the average of these values in tgr sediments among the five water seasons was 0 71 mg kg which exceeds the bvs in both yangtze river sediments 0 49 mg kg and yellow river sediments 0 45 mg kg chi and yan 2007 it was also higher than the mean bvs for soils in china 0 62 mg kg and hubei 0 58 mg kg cnemc 1990 the contribution rates of the anthropogenic input of tl were calculated using gbcs in five water seasons in the tgr according to the linear regression in table 2 the predictive values of baseline tl concentrations at each sampling site were calculated this baseline concentration was then used to determine a difference for each sampling sites sampling sites with positive values indicated contributions by anthropogenic activities fig 4 the contribution rates of anthropogenic input could be calculated by these positive values as follows 6 contribution rate c m b m b m 100 where the bm is the gbc values of tl at each sampling sites mg kg cm is the concentration of tl mg kg at each sampling site and the contribution rate is 0 indicating anthropogenic input the results for the contribution rates of anthropogenic input at each sampling site are presented in fig 4 and table s2 the percentage of sampling sites with positive values was 56 25 for the 2015 wet season 47 92 for the 2015 dry season 52 08 for the 2016 wet season 54 17 for the 2016 dry season and 53 19 for the 2017 wet season respectively table s1 the results revealed that approximately 50 of the sampling sites were influenced by anthropogenic activities the average contribution rates of anthropogenic inputs at these sampling sites ranged from 2 81 to 9 12 table 1 implying that anthropogenic activities may result in slight tl accumulation in tgr sediments 3 3 evaluation of potential ecological risk caused by tl in tgr sediments 3 3 1 igeo igeo is an important geochemical criterion for evaluating metal contamination in sediments and has been used since the late 1960s müller 1969 previous studies on sediment pollution in the tgr sediments typically used bvs in the yangtze river han et al 2015 zhao et al 2017 the tl bv in yangtze river sediments is 0 49 mg kg chi and yan 2007 based on this bv the results of the calculated igeo values for tl for each water season are presented in fig 5 a the average igeo values during the five water seasons were 0 24 for the 2015 wet season 0 27 for the 2015 dry season 0 12 for the 2016 wet season 0 22 for the 2016 dry season and 0 11 for the 2017 wet season respectively table 1 the average igeo values for the 2015 wet season 2015 dry season and 2016 wet season were negative igeo 0 indicating that tgr sediments were uncontaminated with tl in these 2015 and 2016 water seasons however the average igeo values for the 2016 dry season and 2017 wet season were 0 22 and 0 11 0 igeo 1 respectively indicating that these two water seasons should be ranked as uncontaminated to moderately contaminated with regard to tl to better respond to the assessment of these two water seasons hot spot maps were drawn in fig 5a for the 2016 dry season 83 78 and 100 of the sampling sites showed red colors in the mainstream and tributaries respectively indicating that the igeo values exceeded zero fig 5a for the 2017 wet season 75 68 and 99 0 of the sampling sites in the mainstream and tributaries showed igeo values greater than zero respectively fig 5a fig 5a indicates that most of the sites marked in red were in the mid stream and downstream of the mainstream and in the tributaries 3 3 2 potential ecological risk cr and er were calculated using the bv of yangtze river sediments 0 49 mg kg chi and yan 2007 the assessment results were shown in fig 5c e and table 1 for the single pollution indexes table 1 the average cr in each of these water seasons was 1 29 1 27 1 41 1 76 and 1 64 respectively which are classified as moderate level 1 cr 3 table s3 high cr values were mainly noted for 2016 and 2017 denoted in red in fig 5e the average cr values in the mainstream sediments were lower than those in the tributary sediments fig 5e the average er values for tl were listed in table 1 the corresponding average er in each of the water seasons was 51 77 50 75 56 58 70 45 scale and 64 04 respectively these average er values are categorized as moderate ecological risk the er values of tl displayed results similar to those obtained for cr fig 5c moreover the results of the potential ecological risk assessment suggested that approximately 62 5 70 2 sampling sites in the 2016 dry season and 2017 wet season could be classified as posing moderate ecological risks fig 5c and e 3 3 3 application of gbc to assess potential risk from tl contamination based on the gbc of tl in tgr sediments igeo cr and er were re calculated as shown in table 1 a comparison of the calculation results is presented in the heat map in fig 5 the main color style of the assessments methods igeo cr and er was blue indicating a low tl pollution degree at each sampling site compared with the assessments based on the bvs in yangtze river sediments most of the sampling sites were at an uncontaminated level in terms of tl gbc in tgr sediments fig 5b d and f for example the average igeo values of tl in the 2016 dry season and 2017 wet season changed from 0 22 to 0 54 and 0 11 to 0 52 respectively using the gbcs table 1 and fig s3 similar changes were also observed for the er values table 1 and fig s3 the potential ecological risk was close to low ecological risk comparing with the assessment using bvs in the yangtze river moderate ecological risk the different results of the assessment may be attributed to the following two reasons 1 bvs in the yangtze sediment did not reflect the natural variation of the tgr sediment 2 assessment using bvs at different scales could misestimate pollution status of trace metals in sediments covelli and fontolan 1997 fukue et al 2006 in fact bvs in the tgr and yangtze sediment were at different scales tgr is a part of yangtze therefore tl assessment using large scale bvs could over estimate risks pose by tl concentrations in tgr sediments 4 conclusions in this study the average concentration of tl 0 72 0 14 mg kg in tgr sediments from five consecutive water seasons was higher than the bvs in yangtze river sediments in terms of the spatial distribution the average concentration of tl in the mainstream sediments was lower than that in the tributary sediments the tl concentrations in the mainstream sediments of the tgr occurred in the following sequence upstream mid stream downstream for the temporal variation the mean content of tl in tgr sediments during the dry season was higher than that in the wet season inter annual variations of tl in the sediments exhibited an increasing tendency from 2015 to 2016 in addition the average gbc of tl was 0 71 mg kg ranging from 0 62 to 0 83 mg kg these gbc values from the different water seasons were used to calculate the influence of anthropogenic activities in the study area the average contribution rate of anthropogenic input was 6 43 ranged from 2 81 to 9 12

7096,the three gorges reservoir tgr is the world s largest hydrological project however the response of thallium tl in tgr sediments to reservoir operation remains highly uncertain here we investigated the pollution characteristics of tl in tgr sediments during five consecutive water seasons geochemical baseline concentrations gbcs were used to distinguish the anthropogenic input of tl and to quantitatively estimate the tl anthropogenic contribution in tgr sediments the results showed that the average tl concentration in tgr sediments was 0 72 0 14 mg kg ranging from 0 26 to 1 07 mg kg during five consecutive water seasons the average tl content in tributary sediment was higher than that in mainstream sediment in the mainstream tl in tgr sediments showed an accumulation tendency from the upstream to downstream additionally the temporal variation revealed that the mean value of tl in tgr sediments in the dry season was higher than that in the wet season during 2015 2016 furthermore the average gbcs of tl 0 71 mg kg was higher than background values bvs in the yangtze river sediments using the gbcs of different water seasons to calculate the anthropogenic input of tl in the tgr the average anthropogenic contribution was found to be approximately 6 43 2 81 9 12 the assessment results by two different methods geo accumulation index and potential ecological risk index used gbcs as the bvs indicating that tgr sediments were at uncontaminated level and close to the low ecological risk respectively comparing to the gbc of tl the assessment of tl pollution in tgr using bvs in the yangtze river sediments may be over evaluated this study is beneficial for assessing tl pollution in tgr sediments response to consecutive water seasons and estimating the anthropogenic contribution of tl keywords thallium sediments three gorges reservoir geochemical baseline consecutive water seasons pollution assessment 1 introduction thallium tl is a non essential element found in trace amounts in the earth s crust with average concentrations of 0 1 1 7 mg kg peter and viraraghavan 2005 due to its acute and chronic toxicity tl is considered a priority toxic pollutant kazantzis 2000 peter and viraraghavan 2005 emissions from anthropogenic industrial activities e g coal combustion and ferrous and non ferrous mining smelting lead to the increase of tl concentrations in the environment karbowska 2016 kazantzis 2000 peter and viraraghavan 2005 therefore in order to control environmental contamination by tl several governments have established water standards for tl the maximum contaminant level in drinking water is 0 1 μg l in china cns 2006 0 8 μg l in canada ccme 2003 and 2 μg l in the usa usepa 1992 compared with tl in water limited research has been conducted on tl in sediments and the relevant sediments standards are lacking sediments in water environments can act as sources and sinks of trace metals and metals in the sediment can be released into the water body hence a better understanding of the anthropogenic impacts and geochemical behavior of tl in sediments would be worthwhile the three gorges reservoir tgr is the world s largest hydrological project it sustains the environment in the middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river and is important to national drinking water security after the completion of the project the water level fluctuates between 145 and 175 m the tgr operation follows characteristics of anti seasonal water level variations with high water levels in winter dry season and low levels in summer wet season bing et al 2016 in recent years water contamination issues regarding trace metals in tgr sediments have been increasingly highlighted in comparison with the common monitored trace metals e g cu zn pb and cd han et al 2015 tang et al 2014 wang et al 2012 limited research has been focused on the pollution status of tl in tgr sediments han et al 2015 and jia et al 2014 reported on the concentrations and distributions of tl in sediments of several tributaries of the tgr another study investigated tl concentrations in sediments of the entire tgr and found that the mean tl concentration was 0 58 mg kg in the dry season gao et al 2014 however the response of tl environmental behavior in tgr sediments to consecutive water seasons remains uncertain in fact reservoir operation could affect the migration and transformation of trace metals in tgr sediments bing et al 2016 holbach et al 2014 the geo accumulation index igeo enrichment factor ef and potential ecological risk parameter er have often been used to quantitatively assess the trace metal contamination in sediments gao et al 2015 han et al 2015 the selection of background values bvs is important for the pollution assessment by these methods most previous studies selected bvs in soils and sediments in china or the yangtze river as background reference values in the tgr however the bvs of trace metals for soils and sediments mainly depend on local geological properties such as the crustal composition jiang et al 2013 multiple bvs are required across a large area as the use of a single regional bv has the disadvantage of disregarding the variability of trace metal contents due to geological conditions covelli and fontolan 1997 fukue et al 2006 consequently previous studies may not have provided accurate assessments of the pollution status in tgr sediments furthermore it is necessary to select suitable bvs for assessing trace metal pollution in the tgr geochemical baseline concentrations gbcs are defined as the natural levels of trace metals in soils bech et al 2005 galán et al 2008 tian et al 2017 and sediments liu et al 2013 studies have been conducted to determine the gbcs of trace metals in different regions and these have been successfully applied to the assessment of trace metal pollution martin et al 2016 tian et al 2017 therefore gbcs should be established for tgr in particular this could lead to more suitable assessments for tl in tgr sediments this study was the attempt to use the gbcs to assess tl contamination in the entire tgr area during the consecutive water seasons the objectives of this study were 1 to clarify the spatial and temporal variation of tl in tgr sediments for five consecutive water seasons 2 to establish the gbcs for tl in tgr sediments and 3 to evaluate the pollution status of tl in tgr sediments using gbcs 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and sample collection the tgr is located in the main stem of the yangtze river in china and it covers an area of 58 000 km2 including a water area of 1080 km2 stone 2008 zhao et al 2017 the backwater of the tgr is approximately 660 km long and forms a typical river type reservoir from the three gorges dam tgd to jiangjin city in chongqing municipality bing et al 2016 the tgr area is located in western hubei province yichang city to the east of chongqing city 28 32 31 44 n and 105 44 111 39 e fig 1 the climate in the tgr area is primarily of the humid subtropical monsoonal type the mean annual temperature ranges from 16 5 to 19 0 c and the annual mean precipitation is approximately 1000 1200 mm with 80 falling during april october period bao et al 2015 ye et al 2013 the water operation of this project is of the anti season type characterized by a high water level 175 m in winter dry season and a low water level 145 m in summer wet season a total of 240 sediment samples were collected during five consecutive water seasons including 2015 wet season 2015 dry season 2016 wet season 2016 dry season and 2017 wet season respectively for each water season 48 sampling sites were located in the mainstream from upstream to downstream and tributaries of tgr thirty seven sediment samples s1 s37 were collected from the mainstream namely from the upstream to the front of the tgr dam eleven sediment samples t1 t11 were collected from major tributaries fig 1 in this study the upstream area of the mainstream was defined ranging from jiangbei district to fengdu town s37 s32 guo et al 2016 the mid stream area was defined ranging from fengdu town to fengjie town s32 s17 and the downstream area was demarcated as that from fengjie town to yichang city s17 s1 guo et al 2016 the tributaries of the study area included the wujiang qutang pengxi modao meixi daning yandu qinggan and xiangxi rivers fig 1 sediment samples were taken from the middle of the stream at each sampling site approximately 1 kg of sediment was collected in clean polyethylene bags and immediately transported to the laboratory the sediment samples were then freeze dried and gently crushed and ground in an agate mortar the crushed samples were then passed through an acid cleaned 0 25 mm nylon sieve for further analysis 2 2 analysis of metal concentrations a strong acid digestion method was used to analyze the total tl and li concentrations in the tgr sediments the details of this method have been provided in a previous report xu et al 2016 tl concentrations were analyzed using an inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer perkinelmer elan drc e usa the accuracy of the analytical procedures was controlled by certified reference materials namely gsd 10 gbw07310 and gsd 1a gbw07301a which were purchased from the chinese institute of geophysical and geochemical exploration these two sediment standard materials were analyzed using the same procedure as those for the tgr sediments and analysis results agreed with the certified values table s1 the recovery of the sediment standard materials ranged from 95 2 to 97 0 the limit of analysis detection in this study was 0 05 mg kg for tl 2 3 assessment of sediment pollution in this study the gbcs igeo and er were employed to evaluate the tl contamination in the tgr sediments 2 3 1 geochemical baseline concentration gbc of tl in tgr sediments the calculation of the gbc requires a normalization method based on a linear regression equation obtained from the correlation of concentrations between the element in question in this case tl and a conservative reference element teng and ni 2007 this study used lithium li as the conservative reference normalizing element because it is the best representative to fine particle size of the sediments teng and ni 2007 the equation defining the geochemical baseline model is as follows 1 c m a c n b where cm is the concentration of tl mg kg cn is the concentration of li mg kg and a and b are the regression constants in the x y scatterplot described by eq 1 data within the 95 confidence limit were characterized as naturally sourced data outside the 95 confidence limit were characterized as having anthropogenic sources teng and ni 2007 data from the anthropogenic sources were then removed and a linear regression was fitted to the remaining data from natural sources with new regression constants c and d we subsequently arrived at the following equation 2 b m c c n d where bm is the gbc of tl mg kg in the study area c n is the normalized average of li mg kg and c and d are the new regression constants using the normalized average li concentration the naturally sourced tl concentration was obtained this tl value was defined as the gbc of tl 2 3 2 igeo of tl in tgr sediments to evaluate the tl pollution in tgr sediments igeo was calculated for each sample this index has been widely applied to assess the pollution level of trace metals in sediments and soils han et al 2017 igeo was originally proposed by müller 1969 and can be defined as follows 3 i geo log 2 c n 1 5 b n where cn represents tl concentration in the sediment mg kg bn denotes the background concentration of tl mg kg and 1 5 corresponds to possible variation of crustal contribution in sediment mainly by weathering or bank erosion in the rivers a positive igeo generally indicates the contribution of anthropogenic activities contamination categories based on igeo are classified as follows uncontaminated igeo 0 uncontaminated to moderately contaminated 0 igeo 1 moderately contaminated 1 igeo 2 moderately to strongly contaminated 2 igeo 3 strongly contaminated 3 igeo 4 strongly to extremely contaminated 4 igeo 5 and extremely contaminated igeo 5 2 3 3 er of tl in tgr sediments the er was proposed by häkanson 1980 the single factor pollution parameter cr and er were calculated as follows 4 c r c x c 0 5 e r t r c r where cx represents the tl concentrations in the sediments and c0 is the regional background value of tl in the sediments the tl concentration in the yangtze river sediments 0 49 mg kg and the gbcs of tl for different seasons were used in this study table 1 according to gao et al 2008 the constant value for the toxic response factor tr is 40 the cr er and their corresponding classifications are listed in table s3 2 4 statistical analysis all statistical analyses in this study were performed using spss 17 0 and origin pro 2017 for windows software packages 3 results and discussion 3 1 spatial and temporal variations of tl in tgr surface sediments 3 1 1 spatial distribution of tl in tgr surface sediments the tl concentrations in tgr sediments collected during five water seasons are presented in table 1 the average tl concentration was 0 72 0 14 mg kg ranging from 0 26 to 1 07 mg kg in these water seasons which was higher than that in yangtze river sediments 0 49 mg kg chi and yan 2007 in addition the mean value of tl in tgr sediments was slightly higher than those values in previous studies gao et al 2014 han et al 2015 jia et al 2014 these results indicated that tl may have a certain degree of enrichment in the tgr sediments compared with the soil bvs the average value was 1 24 times that of the soil bvs in hubei province 0 58 mg kg cnemc 1990 the obtained average concentration in tgr sediments was also higher than that of the soil bv in china 0 62 mg kg chi and yan 2007 compared to other reservoirs in china the tl content in tgr sediments was higher than that of the miyun reservoir 0 49 mg kg located in northern china han et al 2017 the spatial distribution patterns of tl concentrations in tgr sediments are presented in fig 2 the results showed that the average tl concentrations in the tributary sediments 0 77 0 14 mg kg were slightly higher than those in the mainstream sediments 0 71 0 14 mg kg in terms of the mainstream the spatial distribution trend of tl in tgr sediments was in the following order upstream mid stream downstream fig 2 this phenomenon can be explained as follows due to the barrier effect of the tgd on water flow the water flow velocity of the reservoir decreases from upstream to downstream resulting in the deposition of fine particles in the lower reaches moreover metals in water are easily enriched in fine particulate matter because of the large surface area this phenomenon was also noted in other studies gao et al 2015 zhao et al 2017 tl concentrations in sediments of different tgr tributaries did not show obvious spatial distribution tendencies because of the complex interaction between the mainstream and tributaries during different water seasons the highest tl contents were found in different sampling sites during five water seasons 2015 2017 the highest tl concentrations appeared at s14 in the 2015 wet season 0 94 mg kg s5 in the 2015 dry season 0 80 mg kg s12 in the 2016 wet season 0 81 mg kg s3 in the 2016 dry season 1 02 mg kg and s2 in the 2017 wet season 0 96 mg kg in general these sampling sites were located in the lower branch of the mainstream in the tgr this phenomenon might be attributed to the following two reasons firstly the hydrological regime principally influenced sediment redistribution and trace metal enrichment as mentioned earlier the water flow velocity of the reservoir decreased from upstream to downstream and this resulted in the deposition of fine particles in the lower reaches friedl and wuest 2002 secondly the rapid development of the mining industry may be responsible for increased tl concentrations for example sample s5 was collected near the coal mining town of zigui coal mined at zigui contains high quantities of sulfide minerals which usually contain high concentrations in sulfide minerals xiao et al 2012 hence tl may be released during mining activity 3 1 2 temporal variation of tl in tgr sediments temporal variation of tl in tgr sediments during 2015 2016 is presented in fig 3 in the mainstream the average tl concentration in sediments was higher in the dry season than that in the wet season in the same year this result may be attributed to the release of metals from the soils in the water level fluctuation zones after water impoundment during the dry season previous studies have also found that metals could accumulate in the tgr riparian zone bing et al 2016 pei et al 2018 and these metals may have a potential release risk from the water level fluctuation riparian zones the average tl concentrations in the mainstream and tributary sediments in 2016 0 76 mg kg and 0 85 mg kg respectively were higher than the corresponding ones in 2015 0 62 mg kg and 0 64 mg kg respectively 3 2 gbc of tl in tgr sediments li was selected as the inert element to calculate the gbc of tl in tgr sediments the relationships between li and tl concentrations in these sediments during the five water seasons are presented in fig s1 all points that fell outside the 95 confidence band were removed fig s1 and fig s2 the remaining data points were used to develop the gbcs to improve the correlation coefficients table 2 the correlation coefficients of five water seasons ranged from 0 9600 to 0 9962 five gbcs of tl were calculated for each of the five water seasons in terms of eq 2 the results showed that the gbcs of tl in tgr sediments were 0 64 mg kg for the 2015 wet season 0 62 mg kg for the 2015 dry season 0 66 mg kg for the 2016 wet season 0 83 mg kg for the 2016 dry season and 0 76 mg kg for the 2017 wet season respectively table 2 these results suggested that the gbcs of tl in tgr sediments fluctuated during the consecutively monitored water seasons in general the average of these values in tgr sediments among the five water seasons was 0 71 mg kg which exceeds the bvs in both yangtze river sediments 0 49 mg kg and yellow river sediments 0 45 mg kg chi and yan 2007 it was also higher than the mean bvs for soils in china 0 62 mg kg and hubei 0 58 mg kg cnemc 1990 the contribution rates of the anthropogenic input of tl were calculated using gbcs in five water seasons in the tgr according to the linear regression in table 2 the predictive values of baseline tl concentrations at each sampling site were calculated this baseline concentration was then used to determine a difference for each sampling sites sampling sites with positive values indicated contributions by anthropogenic activities fig 4 the contribution rates of anthropogenic input could be calculated by these positive values as follows 6 contribution rate c m b m b m 100 where the bm is the gbc values of tl at each sampling sites mg kg cm is the concentration of tl mg kg at each sampling site and the contribution rate is 0 indicating anthropogenic input the results for the contribution rates of anthropogenic input at each sampling site are presented in fig 4 and table s2 the percentage of sampling sites with positive values was 56 25 for the 2015 wet season 47 92 for the 2015 dry season 52 08 for the 2016 wet season 54 17 for the 2016 dry season and 53 19 for the 2017 wet season respectively table s1 the results revealed that approximately 50 of the sampling sites were influenced by anthropogenic activities the average contribution rates of anthropogenic inputs at these sampling sites ranged from 2 81 to 9 12 table 1 implying that anthropogenic activities may result in slight tl accumulation in tgr sediments 3 3 evaluation of potential ecological risk caused by tl in tgr sediments 3 3 1 igeo igeo is an important geochemical criterion for evaluating metal contamination in sediments and has been used since the late 1960s müller 1969 previous studies on sediment pollution in the tgr sediments typically used bvs in the yangtze river han et al 2015 zhao et al 2017 the tl bv in yangtze river sediments is 0 49 mg kg chi and yan 2007 based on this bv the results of the calculated igeo values for tl for each water season are presented in fig 5 a the average igeo values during the five water seasons were 0 24 for the 2015 wet season 0 27 for the 2015 dry season 0 12 for the 2016 wet season 0 22 for the 2016 dry season and 0 11 for the 2017 wet season respectively table 1 the average igeo values for the 2015 wet season 2015 dry season and 2016 wet season were negative igeo 0 indicating that tgr sediments were uncontaminated with tl in these 2015 and 2016 water seasons however the average igeo values for the 2016 dry season and 2017 wet season were 0 22 and 0 11 0 igeo 1 respectively indicating that these two water seasons should be ranked as uncontaminated to moderately contaminated with regard to tl to better respond to the assessment of these two water seasons hot spot maps were drawn in fig 5a for the 2016 dry season 83 78 and 100 of the sampling sites showed red colors in the mainstream and tributaries respectively indicating that the igeo values exceeded zero fig 5a for the 2017 wet season 75 68 and 99 0 of the sampling sites in the mainstream and tributaries showed igeo values greater than zero respectively fig 5a fig 5a indicates that most of the sites marked in red were in the mid stream and downstream of the mainstream and in the tributaries 3 3 2 potential ecological risk cr and er were calculated using the bv of yangtze river sediments 0 49 mg kg chi and yan 2007 the assessment results were shown in fig 5c e and table 1 for the single pollution indexes table 1 the average cr in each of these water seasons was 1 29 1 27 1 41 1 76 and 1 64 respectively which are classified as moderate level 1 cr 3 table s3 high cr values were mainly noted for 2016 and 2017 denoted in red in fig 5e the average cr values in the mainstream sediments were lower than those in the tributary sediments fig 5e the average er values for tl were listed in table 1 the corresponding average er in each of the water seasons was 51 77 50 75 56 58 70 45 scale and 64 04 respectively these average er values are categorized as moderate ecological risk the er values of tl displayed results similar to those obtained for cr fig 5c moreover the results of the potential ecological risk assessment suggested that approximately 62 5 70 2 sampling sites in the 2016 dry season and 2017 wet season could be classified as posing moderate ecological risks fig 5c and e 3 3 3 application of gbc to assess potential risk from tl contamination based on the gbc of tl in tgr sediments igeo cr and er were re calculated as shown in table 1 a comparison of the calculation results is presented in the heat map in fig 5 the main color style of the assessments methods igeo cr and er was blue indicating a low tl pollution degree at each sampling site compared with the assessments based on the bvs in yangtze river sediments most of the sampling sites were at an uncontaminated level in terms of tl gbc in tgr sediments fig 5b d and f for example the average igeo values of tl in the 2016 dry season and 2017 wet season changed from 0 22 to 0 54 and 0 11 to 0 52 respectively using the gbcs table 1 and fig s3 similar changes were also observed for the er values table 1 and fig s3 the potential ecological risk was close to low ecological risk comparing with the assessment using bvs in the yangtze river moderate ecological risk the different results of the assessment may be attributed to the following two reasons 1 bvs in the yangtze sediment did not reflect the natural variation of the tgr sediment 2 assessment using bvs at different scales could misestimate pollution status of trace metals in sediments covelli and fontolan 1997 fukue et al 2006 in fact bvs in the tgr and yangtze sediment were at different scales tgr is a part of yangtze therefore tl assessment using large scale bvs could over estimate risks pose by tl concentrations in tgr sediments 4 conclusions in this study the average concentration of tl 0 72 0 14 mg kg in tgr sediments from five consecutive water seasons was higher than the bvs in yangtze river sediments in terms of the spatial distribution the average concentration of tl in the mainstream sediments was lower than that in the tributary sediments the tl concentrations in the mainstream sediments of the tgr occurred in the following sequence upstream mid stream downstream for the temporal variation the mean content of tl in tgr sediments during the dry season was higher than that in the wet season inter annual variations of tl in the sediments exhibited an increasing tendency from 2015 to 2016 in addition the average gbc of tl was 0 71 mg kg ranging from 0 62 to 0 83 mg kg these gbc values from the different water seasons were used to calculate the influence of anthropogenic activities in the study area the average contribution rate of anthropogenic input was 6 43 ranged from 2 81 to 9 12 revealing that anthropogenic activities led to slight tl accumulation in tgr sediments pollution assessment of tl calculated by igeo er and cr using the gbcs suggested that the igeo attributed to the uncontaminated level and the potential ecological risk of tl was close to the low ecological risk in fact the traditional bvs did not reflect the natural variation of the sediment and tl assessment using bvs at different scales incorrectly estimated tl risks in tgr sediments specifially the assessments using only the bvs in yangtze river sediments may over evaluate tl pollution in contrast gbcs

7097,traditional methods for the calculation of rating curves from measurements of water level and discharge are criticised as being limited and complicated to implement such that manual methods are still often used two methods for automatic computation are developed using least squares approximation one based on polynomials and the other on piecewise continuous splines computational problems are investigated and procedures recommended to overcome them both methods are found to work well and once the parameters for a gauging station have been determined rating data can be processed automatically for some streams ephemeral changes of resistance may be important evidenced by scattered or loopy data for such cases the approximation methods can be used to generate a rating envelope as well allowing the routine calculation also of maximum and minimum expected flows criticism is made of current shift curve practices finally the approximation methods allow the specification of weights for the data points enabling the filtering of data especially decreasing the importance of points with age and allowing the computation of a rating curve for any time in the past or present keywords discharge measurement streamgauging rating curves rivers velocity measurements 1 introduction a rating curve is a relationship between the discharge q of a stream and h the stage or surface elevation so that when routine measurements of stage at a gauging station are made the flow can be estimated the curve is calculated from a number of h q rating data points from that station using relatively infrequent measurements of the velocity distribution cross section and stage of the stream the problem of the automatic calculation of rating curves has received relatively little research attention the main problem seems to be the perceived success and almost universal use of the power function 1 q c h h 0 μ where c h 0 and μ are constants and which is a straight line on log q log h h 0 axes the reasons for it being a problem include on one hand it is too simple with only three parameters and is limited in its accuracy and generality on the other hand it is too complicated such that the three parameters occur nonlinearly and solving for them is difficult such that manual methods are often used the power function and its representation as a straight line on logarithmic axes appears ubiquitously in books standards and lecture notes whereas it is sometimes a convenient approximation to the relationship q h over the whole range of data in general it is not it is an over simplification of the real hydraulics at many gauging stations such a formula is valid for an infinitely wide weir in infinitely deep water or for uniform flow in an infinitely wide rectangular channel there is no reason for a real rating curve to follow such a function closely insufficient knowledge of hydraulics has led to a too great belief in the power function on one hand by practitioners and on the other by theoreticians in related disciplines this has led to complicated procedures in some organisations where sequences of power functions are used and a great deal of trouble goes into the laborious manual fitting of piecewise continuous straight lines on logarithmic axes by adjusting the offsets h 0 for each on different vertical log h h 0 axes the more general representation of q by a polynomial of higher degree m has been in the background for some time 2 q a 0 a 1 h a 2 h 2 a m h m m 0 m a m h m where a 0 a 1 a m are coefficients it was presented by herschy in the first edition of his book in 1985 most recently in herschy 2009 p195 in international standard 7066 2 1988 and in morgenschweis 2010 p384 standard linear least squares methods can be used to determine the coefficients mirza 2003 used it successfully with just m 3 and in that scholarly work gave considerable attention to statistical matters reading those sources and water industry websites but also reading between the lines it seems that the approximation by polynomials despite its promise has not often been adopted and usually only implemented to low degree herschy wrote in the first edition of his book in 1985 and 24 years later again in the third edition herschy 2009 p195 however some user experience is still required with this method before it is accepted as an alternative to the existing methods implying that its use has been languishing fenton and keller 2001 section 6 3 2 suggested writing the polynomial for q raised to the power ν specified a priori 3 q ν a 0 a 1 h a 2 h 2 a m h m m 0 m a m h m which is actually a simple generalisation of the power function eq 1 written in the form q a 0 a 1 h 1 ν to q a 0 a 1 h a 2 h 2 1 ν they recommended a value of ν 1 2 on the basis of that being the mean value in the hydraulic discharge formulae for a sequence of weir and channel cross sections that modelled local and channel control fenton 2001 the use of such a fractional value of ν has two effects 1 for small flows h and q small the data usually is such that 4 q ν a 0 a 1 h with ν 1 2 is a surprisingly good approximation when compared with power function approximations in which ν is a free parameter as shown in fenton 2015b section 3 4 in this small flow limit the more general polynomial approximation just has to simulate nearly linear variation which it can easily do 2 for larger flows when the higher degree terms in eq 3 become important the use of q ν means that the magnitude of the dependent variable to be approximated is numerically much smaller so that instead of a range of say q 1 to 10 4 m 3 s 1 for ν 1 2 a numerical range q 1 2 1 to 10 2 has to be approximated this is a simple version of a power transformation used in more formal data analysis applications to stabilise variance and to make the data more normal distribution like in recent years there have been a number of papers with a quite different way of looking at the problem using bayesian statistics le coz et al 2014 provided an excellent survey both of that field and the rating curve problem generally however all the papers they referred to used either a single power function or two or more of them each in the belief that they were following hydraulic principles it is the assertion here that there is little fundamental about the power function or the application of hydraulic theory and here a rather different path will be followed treating the problem as one of data approximation in that spirit coxon et al 2015 used lowess locally weighted scatterplot smoothing to obtain rating curves for a huge number of sites the method considered each stage discharge measurement as the central point in a subset of the data points the estimate of the discharge for the data point and its variance was generated by fitting a weighted linear regression to the selected data weights were dependent upon the differences in stage and gave most weight to data closest to the central measurement to account for outlier points two passes were made then a weight function was used to weight each data point according to how far the point was from the first fitted line reducing the impact of those furthest from it the procedure could be used to satisfy the goal in this work of developing methods for practical automatic computation it seems good in principle but there are a number of adjustable parameters and the reduction of importance of outlying points might deny the importance of some causative processes and trends at work it functioned well for the demanding application that coxon et al required of it where the main thrust was the quantification of uncertainty rather than the generation of approximations fenton 2015b hereafter referred to as report i considered several aspects of the problem of the automatic generation of rating curves the present paper is based on that report which contains more detail here first the application of polynomial approximation methods is treated at length several mathematical reasons for problems associated with them are given with physical explanations and methods for overcoming them it is considered imperative to use series of chebyshev polynomials rather than the simple polynomials shown above which are series of monomials h m also it is desirable to approximate not values of discharge q but q ν where ν is a fractional exponent as in eq 3 it is usually able to be taken to be 1 2 but in extreme cases can be calculated by a method that is presented other than ν the degree m of the polynomial series is the only free parameter it is possible to use large values of m but if the data has gaps there will usually be one degree beyond which large fluctuations occur in between accurate approximation of the data points to overcome that problem an alternative approximation method is developed using piecewise continuous splines in which case the parameters of the problem are the number and stage values of knot points between which simple quadratic or cubic spline functions are used a simple automatic method is suggested for the placing of those knots just requiring there to be the same number of data points in each interval this usually works well otherwise in difficult cases the values of stage for the knot points can be specified results for both the polynomial method and the approximating spline method are presented they are both found to perform well and have the potential to be standard procedures for rating curve generation then possible reasons for scatter of rating points are discussed for such data the methods can be modified to calculate additionally a rating envelope giving likely maximum and minimum flow rating curves for discrepant points it is suggested that current use of shift curves should be re examined finally the approximation methods are simply modified to allow the importance of data points to decrease with age this allows the generation of a rating curve on any date in the past also thereby determining any relatively slow long term changes in the stream 2 polynomial approximation eq 3 is now generalised by considering the approximating function to be made up not of a series of monomials h m but of more general functions f m h 5 q ν m 0 m a m f m h a 0 f 0 h a 1 f 1 h a m f m h in application the functions are specified a priori and the unknown coefficients a m found by least squares fitting to data points h n q n ν for n 1 n each of the functions applies over the whole data range of h and so methods using them are global ones as distinct from those in section 3 below where piecewise continuous local functions are used we will consider the functions f m h each to be a polynomial of degree m so that the sum of such polynomials in eq 5 including the last one at m m is also a polynomial of degree m and we can refer to methods using them as polynomial approximation it will be found that chebyshev polynomials for the f m h are particularly useful there are three problems here with the approximation the rapid variation of data at the low flow end the large range of discharge q and the ability of the approximating functions to describe arbitrary variations these problems will be overcome as is now described 2 1 exponent ν 2 1 1 usual adequacy of ν 1 2 traditionally the power function has often been required to model all the data by writing it in the form of eq 4 q ν a 0 a 1 h while it incorporates the usual rapid variation and large curvature on q h axes at low flows it is obvious that it is a limited approximation to the whole rating curve problem concerning the actual value of ν to use report i fig 2 showed that for each of seven different stations selected randomly adopting ν 1 2 gave agreement with scattered data at the low flow end that was just as satisfactory as results from fitting a value of ν mcmahon and peel submitted for publication used the polynomial approximation methods of report i and this work to obtain 622 rating curves from 171 australian bureau of meteorology hydrologic reference stations they found that the methods worked well with the exception of about 0 5 of the stations where there was difficulty approximating the low flow data as exemplified by the dotted line in fig 1 here in such cases it is better to determine the actual value of ν from the low flow data and use that as is now described 2 1 2 calculating ν when necessary to do this one can use any of several methods outlined in report i section 3 2 the recommended method is to use the function q ν a 0 a 1 h eq 4 and solving for a 0 a 1 and ν by nonlinear least squares approximation of the points at the low flow end minimising 6 ε 2 n a 0 a 1 h n q n ν 2 as two of the unknowns a 0 and a 1 occur linearly in eq 4 and hence in the error contribution here this form is computationally simpler than solving for the three unknowns in the highly nonlinear and embedded form of eq 1 q c h h 0 μ when problems with complex values can occur if the term in brackets becomes negative as part of the iterative solution procedure it is not recommended to use all points to determine ν its value is best determined from the low flow data when the simple linear approximation used in eqs 4 and 6 is adequate in that limited range to determine how many of the points to use in determining ν the author has experimented and as a rough guide found using about one third of all the data points usually satisfactory but this can be varied to suit the circumstances determined by plotting results always ν has a value rather less than unity its precise value is not so important in its other useful function that of providing a power transformation for the larger flow data to be explained in section 2 1 3 below fig 1 shows the results for a case where it was necessary to calculate ν the most extreme one found the physical nature of the purely local control is shown in the photograph it is a compound v notch weir on the rating curve plot it can be seen that fitting a polynomial in the form of eq 3 with m 3 did not work well with ν 1 2 using the method described immediately above to determine ν from low flow data gave ν 0 136 significantly different with that value the subsequent polynomial approximation of eq 3 worked rather better as shown however the data shows a certain oscillation due to the irregular nature of the structure better results were obtained using spline approximation an alternative method to be described below which still worked well simply with ν 1 2 taking a higher degree polynomial with m 4 gave very poor results with large oscillations 2 1 3 the role of ν as a power transformation the use of a value of ν which is less than unity solves another problem with the approximation of rating data and that is the large variation in the magnitude of q it can easily vary by a factor of 10 4 between lower and upper ends even in a small problem such as shown in fig 1 the polynomial has to approximate variation of that magnitude with a similar relative accuracy overall one way of overcoming this which was tried was to approximate values of log q and use a polynomial for that quantity this expanded the low flow region and contracted the high flow region as required but sometimes too much so and is not recommended instead using a fractional value of ν with q ν which also gives a much smaller numerical range to approximate for example q 1 2 varying by a factor 10 2 has been found to be satisfactory whether a small calculated value such as ν 0 136 in fig 1 or the commonly assumed value ν 1 2 in this work it was found to eliminate problems that otherwise occurred if ν 1 were simply used 2 2 global basis functions in the approximating series whereas the previous two difficulties of describing both low flows and overall flows varying by several orders of magnitude are ones of accuracy and are obvious the worst problems associated with polynomial approximation are not obvious and are to do with the approximating properties of the functions f m h in eq 5 we present a hierarchy of approaches in increasing levels of power and desirability starting from the conventional and immediately obvious one they are illustrated in fig 2 a f m h m as suggested in books and standards shown in eqs 2 and 3 and represented in fig 2 a this is a very fragile form if the numerical values of h are large for example using elevation above sea level when the range of h might be something like h 100 m to h 110 m as illustrated for example or if the stage is specified in centimetres as is the practice in some countries over that relatively small range of stages each monomial term h m looks rather like all the others with little apparent curvature to describe any general variation with finite curvature the individual contributions in the series would have to struggle with large coefficients a m b f m h h min m where h min the minimum of all stages measured has been subtracted the effects are shown in fig 2 b and now the individual functions show more diverse behaviour common practice is to use a stage datum for rating curves just below the minimum so this is effectively what might be used in practice however in section 6 3 of report i an example was presented that showed using the monomial functions in the form of both a and b with and without subtraction of h min individual contributions in the series of approximating terms had remarkable values of 10 000 times that of the final sum although plotting and use of results was possible it would be extremely fragile if passing coefficient values between programs and computers as they would have to be specified to very high levels of precision c f m y m where y is a scaled variable in the interval 1 1 7 y 1 2 h h min h max h min where h max is the maximum of all the stage measurements fig 2 c shows how the first 4 or 5 such monomials are quite different providing good grounds for approximation however for larger values of m they all start to look similar to each other making higher degree approximation more difficult in report i using y was found to give rather better results than the first two possibilities of a and b however not as good as the following fourth alternative d f m t m y still using y but as the argument of a chebyshev polynomial of degree m which can be simply evaluated by t m y cos m arccos y or recursively from t 0 y 1 t 1 y y and for all m 2 t m y 2 yt m 1 y t m 2 y fig 2 d shows that they all behave quite differently from each other and hence can describe arbitrarily varying quantities without the problems noted above they are simply implemented using the formulae given here 2 3 recommended formulation and solution for the coefficients from the above it is recommended to use the formulation 8 q ν m 0 m a m t m y it is highly desirable to use a fractional value of ν for which a value of 1 2 can usually be assumed in exceptional cases ν can be determined using the procedure described in section 2 1 2 in view of the evidence cited in section 2 2 b it is considered imperative to use polynomials which have an orthogonal nature capable of efficient description of arbitrarily varying data in any further reference to polynomial approximation in this work it is always chebyshev polynomials that have been used each t m is a polynomial of degree m so that the sum of the different chebyshev polynomials to m m is itself a polynomial of degree m while it can be called a chebyshev series it cannot be called a chebyshev polynomial itself the number of terms in the series and the degree m of the polynomial might typically be in the range from 3 to 10 the coefficients a m can be obtained by least squares methods minimising the sum of the weighted squares of the errors of the approximation over n data points 9 ε 2 n 1 n w n m 0 m a m t m y n q n ν 2 where the y n are obtained from the h n from eq 7 the w n are the weights for each rating point giving the freedom to weight some points more if one wanted the rating curve to approximate them more closely or they could be set to be a decaying function of the age of the data point so that the effects of changes with time could be examined or a less trusted data point could be given a smaller weight often however all the w n will be 1 two ways of calculating the a m are considered here a normal equations following the standard least squares procedure the total error in eq 9 is differentiated with respect to each of the unknown a m m 0 m and set to zero so that error is at a minimum thus giving a system of m 1 equations in the m 1 unknowns the so called normal equations for the a m interpreted in a matrix equation sense the equations can be written a jm a m b j where to evaluate the elements in those matrices here abandoning the usual convention that matrix row and column numbering starts at 1 for j from 0 to m b j n 1 n w n q n ν t j y n for m from 0 to m a jm n 1 n w n t j y n t m y n the equations and the matrix are famously poorly conditioned unless care is taken to use functions which have some form of orthogonal nature as has been done here while the chebyshev polynomials are orthogonal under integration and summation with certain special weights in the present case summing over an arbitrary sequence of y n they are not strictly orthogonal but show sufficient diversity of behaviour that the matrix is not particularly poorly conditioned here no problems were found using this method to obtain solutions b optimisation methods these minimise ε 2 in eq 9 using common software such as the solver module in spreadsheets or other software packages they are simple to implement without a great deal of knowledge of the program details the methods used internally might be gradient methods such as a multi dimensional newton s method numerical solution does not seem to be difficult in the present work because the a m occur linearly in the approximating function 8 and also because of the efficient nature of the approximating basis chebyshev polynomials 2 4 degree of approximation m with polynomial approximation there are few freedoms of choice the use of chebyshev polynomials is considered mandatory here to guard against series with very poor convergence properties then having decided to approximate in terms of a certain value of ν probably 1 2 the only computational parameter remaining is the degree of approximation m fig 3 shows a typical result from polynomial approximation for a data set with gaps as m increases to from 2 to 3 to 4 and 5 better agreement is obtained here coincidentally the latter two agreeing for higher degree m 6 however the polynomials have begun to oscillate between the data points and the results are unacceptable for data with no large gaps one can use higher degrees but sooner or later the degree of approximation becomes too high and unacceptable oscillations appear in practice one could determine the appropriate value of m for a particular station visually based on evidence such as the figure here it need only be done once 2 5 quantification of goodness of fit it would be better to have a more automatic procedure to measure how well a particular function approximated the data such as the statistical coefficient of determination r 2 the author investigated this problem at some length considering two error criteria the first was the sum of the squares of the errors at each data point the numerical value of ε 2 defined in eq 9 which could be used to obtain a value of r 2 this did not work well as it did not detect over fitting when a higher degree of approximation fitted the data points better but allowed severe fluctuations between them as shown in fig 3 to try to identify that problem a second error criterion was investigated which was the integral of the absolute magnitude of the curvature of the approximating function over the whole curve unfortunately both error criteria behaved differently for different stations and no recommendation can be made here criteria such as r 2 also do not show where omitted variable bias exists in the rating curve case there are several such variables including those that are discussed in this work unsteadiness and channel changes both short and long term in view of these problems no goodness of fit results will be presented here either for the polynomial representation or for the approximating spline method about to be described 2 6 extrapolation the methods in this work approximate data over a finite range they must not be used for extrapolation beyond either end of the data 3 approximating splines a different approach was developed in report i section 8 using piecewise continuous approximation in the form of spline functions where rather than interpolating as in their usual application they were required to perform least squares approximation the method is in a sense both local and partly global in that a sequence of local polynomials is used each of which approximates just part of the range of data but which is required to merge smoothly with its two neighbours so that they and their approximated data points also have some influence it seems to be relatively simple to have a readily understandable physical significance and a good level of continuity other than the degree of the splines second or third which seem to make little difference the only adjustable quantities are the values of stage used as knot points marking the boundaries between successive splines consider a number of data pairs h n q n ν for n 1 2 n let the range of stages h min h max be subdivided into j intervals by j 1 knot points at each of which the stage is h j j 1 j 1 and h 0 h min and h j h max they must be separate and ordered such that h j 1 h j for all the j the points are to be approximated over each interval by a polynomial of degree m 2 or 3 so for j 1 j 1 and h j h h j 1 10 p j h h j m 0 m c j m h h j m where p j h h j is the polynomial of degree m which holds between stage knot points h j and h j 1 expressed as a function of h h j the height of stage h above the preceding knot point at each knot there are continuity conditions between the polynomials on either side agreeing in value and first derivative for quadratic splines and additionally the second derivative for cubic splines the h j may be set as data or automatically allocated such that there are the same number of data points in each interval for example described below the program calculates all the coefficients so that the sum of the squares of the differences between data points and functions are minimised only those data points falling within a certain interval contribute to the total sum using the function for that interval it is not necessary to scale the h as recommended for polynomial approximation in section 2 as it only appears as the local shifted value h h j and the degree of the polynomial is low anyway the details of those operations are as follows the sum of the squares of the errors is minimised using the polynomials as given in eq 10 as 11 ε 2 j 1 j n i j w n m 0 m c j m h n h j m q n ν 2 where i j is the set of data point reference numbers in interval j the summations are a mathematical statement of the obvious over all the intervals consider every data point in that interval and calculate its contribution to the total error using the polynomial for that interval the spline nature of the approximation requires the satisfaction across each interior knot of the continuity of function value plus all derivatives up to m 1 at the knot points giving extra conditions on all the coefficients c j m from eqs 10 at left and right of each interior knot point and using δ j h j 1 h j for the interval length the conditions become for j 2 j 12 c j 1 0 m 0 m c j m δ j m c j 1 1 m 1 m mc j m δ j m 1 and c j 1 2 c j 2 3 c j 3 δ j if m 3 the solution procedure to determine the unknown c j m by minimising ε 2 in eq 11 is first to use the continuity eqs 12 to eliminate those variables on the left sides then to solve for the remaining c j m as for polynomial approximation differentiation leading to the normal equations could be used but it is simpler to use optimisation software which was the case in this work because of the high degree of continuity enforced by equations 12 the net number of unknowns is not large just j m in the present work quadratic splines m 2 were found to be satisfactory and j might have a maximum value of say 10 to allocate the knot points h j they could simply be equally spaced between minimum and maximum values another automatic method that which was used here was simply programmed and which often worked well was where knot points were calculated such that there were approximately the same number of data points in all intervals however the knots can also simply be assigned as data such hand adjustment of the knot positions was sometimes useful to describe regions of high curvature it was usually found necessary to place a knot point near isolated data points for extreme floods it should be emphasised that only the values of the stage knot points h j were specified there was no attempt to pin the approximation by specifying the discharge there the approximating spline method worked well in all the examples considered with occasional improvement by hand allocation of knot points it never failed badly unlike the polynomial method if too high a degree m were used as in fig 3 4 plotting of rating curves horizontal discharge axis in this work as described above using q 1 2 q proved very helpful for computations however using it as a plotting co ordinate caused the low flow region to be too condensed for display purposes attempts were made instead to use log q for the computations but this caused the high flow region to be too condensed with difficulties of approximation the hybrid solution was adopted of obtaining solutions using q 1 2 but for plotting the traditional horizontal scale of log q has been mostly used here with its ability to represent variation of several orders of magnitude the exception is the use of q in fig 3 vertical stage axis use of logarithmic scales for stage has often made representation and understanding difficult and caused errors report i section 4 3 reported on an elementary mathematical mistake in current software using logarithmic axes unless one were using the traditional power function of eq 1 with h h 0 there is little reason to use a logarithmic scale for stage as it typically varies from a value close to zero opening out unreasonably on the logarithmic scale to at most about 10 m tradition is that the stage has an arbitrary local datum somewhere below the lowest possible water level so that stages plotted are typically in the range of greater than 0 m to something like 10 m or rather less but where they have no external physical significance use of the transformed variable y eq 7 or the spline method mean that there is no advantage to specifying and using these traditional local values of stage it would be possible to use the actual elevation above mean sea level which would have certain advantages as that is often important in water engineering there would no longer be such a need to maintain an arbitrary local benchmark and refer measurements to that especially if satellite navigation systems could be directly used for water level measurements 5 results to examine the performance of the methods described above data from seven sites were considered three from australia two from bangladesh and two from the united states of america wherever necessary results were converted to si units results have already been shown for one in fig 1 and another in fig 3 using polynomial approximation only results for that and another five are shown in fig 4 in each case two rating curves are presented one from polynomial approximation the other from approximating splines all have been obtained using ν 1 2 thus approximating values of q 1 2 in all cases the polynomial degree m shown on each figure was chosen as the smallest value that was compatible with accuracy often increasing m by a single degree beyond that led to unacceptable fluctuations as has been seen in fig 3 which is for the same station as fig 4 e for the spline method all results are for quadratic splines m 2 no advantage was found using cubic splines m 3 in the first four cases in fig 4 automatic allocation of knot points was used with about the same number of data points in each interval in the two remaining examples and in fig 1 especially at large flows where there were few data points the knot points h j were allocated manually by specifying in a data file the method used is shown on each figure a avon river at stratford vic australia site number 225201a 2012 06 05 to 2015 04 24 there is a large gap in this data the polynomial approximation of low degree m 3 and the quadratic splines with only three intervals have worked well both giving a similar plausible bridging of the gap there are actually two points close together for the highest flows using higher degree polynomials showed over fitting with the result that both points were almost interpolated with large oscillations between data points b brahmaputra river bangladesh 1992 the data was taken from mirza 2003 by digitising a fairly small figure so the accuracy here might be questionable both methods handle this fairly simple problem quite well it might be thought that neither method has treated the two points at h 19 m q 40 000 m 3 s 1 well but it should be remembered that the approximations are for discharge plotted horizontally and so they actually perform quite well in passing between those two points and the three or four points on the other side of the curves with roughly the same stage c choctawhatchee river near bellwood al usa usgs station 02361500 2000 12 07 to 2015 05 22 the only real problem for approximation seems to be for the lowest flows where there is a quite characteristic scatter of points both methods seem to perform satisfactorily d ganges river bangladesh 1992 the data was also digitised from a small figure in mirza 2003 this is a demanding problem if one accepts that the fine structure lumps in the data are real it has been chosen here to do that as a test of the model although it might be over fitting it if one knew the reliability of the data it might have been possible to use a smoother approximation with a polynomial of lesser degree and or splines with fewer intervals both polynomials and splines with high levels of approximation have performed well in describing the complicated variation the polynomial can do this because the data points are uniformly distributed the splines have performed well even if the placement of the knots has yet again been performed automatically and there are actually few data points in each interval e gwydir river at pallamallawa nsw australia site number 418001 1991 01 05 to 1998 07 29 again this shows data with some large gaps using splines automatic allocation of equally populated intervals did not give such good results for high flows so for the first time in this figure knots were allocated by hand placing one at 8 m which caused the splines to pass very close to the high flow points as shown some of those data points were obtained partly from a boat floating above flooded agricultural land possibly a rougher approximation would have been more justified in any case with splines one has quite a lot of power to experiment with point placement f noxubee river near geiger al usa usgs station 02448500 1970s this data set shows three regions of local channel and overbank control the polynomial method has worked well here but with a high degree of approximation necessary to pick up the points of high curvature which has led to some possible over fitting the spline approximations have worked well also with only five hand allocated knots this is a site where the greater freedom to allocate spline knot points has been of benefit 6 scattered and looped data the problem of the scatter of data points is now considered two main causes will be identified and two different ways of representing the data firstly short term changes in the stream will be considered it is suggested that this scatter can be incorporated and quantified by the computation of a rating envelope so that maximum and minimum expected flows can also be calculated and published secondly long term stream changes can be identified and described by a procedure that enables the calculation of a rating curve also for any date in the past 6 1 a model of a rating curve determined by channel resistance a model of a stream is now developed to try to understand how channel changes affect rating curves this will apply to both channel and overbank control where the boundary resistance of the stream determines the rating it is assumed that in the vicinity of the gauging station the long wave equations hold a pair of partial differential equations one expressing volume conservation the other momentum conservation fenton 2015a sections 1 4 1 5 showed for waves of a sufficiently long period that the time derivative in the momentum conservation equation can be neglected obviously enough but not so obviously also that fluid inertia terms can be neglected in that limit leaving the only terms in the equation those due to resistance and gravity surprisingly even for high froude number flows modelling the resistance here by the gauckler manning equation then gives the momentum equation in the form in which the only approximation is that wave motions are long typical of flood waves and of course also valid for steady flow 13 q 1 n a 5 3 p 2 3 s η where n is manning s resistance coefficient a is stream cross sectional area p is its wetted perimeter and s η η x is the magnitude of the slope of the free surface where η is the surface elevation which might also be a function of time t for the special case of a steady uniform flow s η s 0 the bed slope and the expression becomes the usual statement of the gauckler manning equation it is surprising that the expression here is such a simple and general extension of that familiar form we consider the different terms on the right of eq 13 to see how different channel quantities affect the rating resistance coefficient n this might be able to change relatively quickly and its value can depend on the recent flow history due to the following effects small changes in bed grain arrangement and armouring can have a finite effect and could occur quite quickly if for example overlying particles with high resistance are swept away by an increase in flow or start to deposit in interstices bed forms ripples dunes anti dunes etc if conditions are right for the development or changing of bed forms the effects on resistance could be important this would take longer than for bed grain re arrangement as more material has to be transported this has been treated by simons and richardson 1962 sediment transport if the bed grains are moving then the stress required to move them appears additionally whether they are moving along the bed rolling jumping or carried suspended in the flow it could be quite variable depending on the different thresholds of movement vegetation grasses reeds trees standing in the water etc this would have a more slowly varying effect partly continuous and possibly seasonal the relative change in rated discharge due to a change δ n is obtained by the differential of eq 13 with respect to n giving δ q q δ n n which might not be small fenton 2015a section 1 6 2 showed the wide scatter of channel resistance coefficients in a large field study and hypothesised that some of that was due simply to different arrangements of bed particles fig 6 below shows a situation where a range of variation q in a large alluvial river over three years was some 25 50 that may also be partly due to fill and scour however the rapidity of change in the data suggested it was mainly due to resistance changes geometric term a 5 3 p 2 3 effects of bed fill or scour as a model we consider the channel to be rectangular of width b such that a b h z where z is the bed elevation and to be wide such that p b so that the term becomes a 5 3 p 2 3 b h z 5 3 the relative change in rated discharge due to a change δ z in the bed level due to scour or fill is then δ q q 5 3 δ z h z in which h z is the water depth at the gauging station it is asserted here that that relative amount of scour or fill δ z depth is usually small in this case because finite amounts of material have to be moved to effect the change in bed elevation such changes to the rating will be relatively slow they may be of a consistent long term nature leading to gradual change in the rating curve a method to identify and calculate such change will be presented in section 6 4 unsteady surface slope changes the last term in eq 13 is the surface slope which for a change δ s η gives the differential δ q q 1 2 δ s η s η the slope might change because of long term downstream channel changes however there can be rapid changes as a flood wave passes which could have a finite effect on the rating but only at times immediately before and after a flood peak when the surface slope is sufficiently different from the mean bed slope some important data are obtained during floods when there may be unsteady effects which it would be good to correct and of course subsequent routine computation of discharge should ideally be corrected for unsteadiness around flood peaks the problem was considered at some length in fenton and keller 2001 section 4 which included an extra correction to the jones method which obtains an estimate of s η by assuming that the flood is propagating as a wave without change however effects of changing resistance described above are also important but unable to be quantified so that unsteadiness will not be considered further here 6 2 scattered data and results due to a moveable bed let us consider the mechanism by which changes in resistance cause the data to be scattered fig 5 shows rating curve axes stage versus discharge three dashed lines represent hypothetical rating curves for a stream with different constant resistance values the dotted line represents a hypothetical flood event showing the actual relationship between stage and discharge at each time we now consider such an event in detail the initial point a is for a low flow over a bed with relatively small resistance after a period of steady flow during which the bed has been steadily armoured and smoothed the flood event then begins the flow increases quickly in time but initially not enough to change the nature of the bed and the flood trajectory follows a curve corresponding to the initial resistance after some distance on the figure the bed is no longer stable grains move are exposed and bed forms might develop accordingly the resistance is greater and the trajectory crosses contours of increasing resistance there may also be unsteady effects due to the front of the flood being steeper and the instantaneous flow being greater which mimic the effects of changing resistance after the flood peak with maximum discharge and high transport resistance continues to increase a little time later the stage is a maximum subsequently the flow continues to decrease but the transport rate is still enough for resistance to increase gradually however that stops and the flow gradually decreases at point b with relatively low flow with the disturbed bed still in place the resistance is still high now gradually over time the sediment transport acts to reduce the bed forms and pack the bed grains so that resistance is less as time passes the bed will gradually be worked back to a low resistance state as initially but where the more or less steady flow as at point c might be different from the initial one the path has followed a loop with two discharges for each stage and vice versa before and after the flow maximum this is often described as a looped rating curve however it is really just a trajectory a path in time on rating axes that may be more or less looped a rating point obtained during such an event could be anywhere on it if we consider a long period of time with many such flow events the space between the upper and lower constant resistance curves will contain many such flow trajectories and many individual rating points obtained at moments on those trajectories leading to a scatter of points between the bounds the more stable the bed the less the scatter usually rating measurements are not made frequently enough for any trajectory to be identified and the rating points seem randomly scattered by approximating all data points as described above we obtain what we call the rating curve if a new rating point were found to be discrepant from established results it might be possible to correct for any effects of unsteadiness as described above but as suggested there effects of changing resistance due to changing bed composition and bed forms might also be important we do not know those conditions and do not know how much to correct the conventional shift curve approach is to arbitrarily distort the rating curve locally by a straight line on logarithmic axes to pass through the new point sauer 2002 section 8 wmo 2010 section 1 12 the view here is that even a short time after the discrepant measurement when resistance in the stream is still the same the flow might be quite different and be far from the shifted interval so that the shift is not relevant the next time that the interval of the shifted curve is visited by a flow event conditions in the stream might be quite different and the previous discrepant point and shift no longer have a special relevance accordingly there is little need to ascribe great importance to a discrepant data point not agreeing with the rating curve the view here is that it is an approximating curve passing through a more or less scattered cloud of points where at least some of that scatter is due to fluctuations in the preceding flows and instantaneous state of the bed when each point was determined now considering the subsequent regular routine measurements of stage to estimate flows each measurement might be made at any point on the continuing trajectory but should fall within the band of resistance values as modelled in the figure this ephemeral nature of the resistance in mobile bed streams means that it is not possible to predict accurately the flow at any later time it is not known what flows and bed changes will occur in the future up until the moment a routine stage measurement is made and the rating curve required to give a corresponding flow this existence of a certain level of uncertainty for some rating sites suggests the concept and different treatment of the next section using the approximation methods developed here to calculate curves for not just the likely mean discharge but also for minimum and maximum possible values of course the data for many sites shows little scatter in the small sample presented in this paper of the six run of river results shown in fig 4 about three show evidence of significant scatter a single rating curve might still be considered satisfactory but augmentation by maximum and minimum flow curves might be useful 6 3 a generalisation for scattered data the rating envelope maxima and minima the existence of a finite band of results leads to an extension of the idea of a single rating curve the calculation of a rating envelope inside of which all or most of the individual rating points fall and to provide expressions for curves approximating both upper and lower bounds as well as the conventional rating curve approximating all points the effects of long term changes would have to be subtracted however possibly using time decaying weights as described in the following section for gauging stations where data is scattered rather than being a problem this can be viewed as providing extra information as to the range of discharges that can be expected it would make some sense also to publish routinely the minimum and maximum flows expected for each stage reading in keeping with the approach in this work methods of data approximation can be used to calculate the upper and lower envelopes the method suggested here is first to calculate the approximation to all the points the rating curve and then to delete those points which lie below it then to approximate the remaining points again deleting those points which lie below it and repeat the process of approximation and deletion as many times as necessary to give the upper envelope a fit to the uppermost points then this procedure would be repeated for the lower envelope successively deleting all points above each curve as approximately half the data points are lost with each pass the number of passes is limited the two data points with the smallest and largest values of independent variable h might always be retained to ensure that the final envelope would extend from the smallest to largest values of stage in practice what one would be doing is approximating the 1 8 or 1 16 say of all data points those which lie furthest from the approximation to all the points in the spirit of approximation it can be called an envelope even if some points might still lie outside it fig 6 shows an example for three years of gaugings from the red river viet nam the flood hydrographs for those years shown in report i section 11 3 were quite characteristic with the main events being more seasonal rather than with individual events the flows coming off the high mountains in southern china the flow trajectory has several large loops barely identifiable in the figure here the procedure described above for computing envelopes was applied using polynomial approximation with degree m 6 four passes of the halving procedure for each of the upper and lower envelopes were applied so starting with 217 data points at the end there were about 217 2 4 15 for each envelope it can be seen that the method worked well giving mean maximum and minimum rating curves 6 4 identification of long term changes and calculation of a rating curve for any day in the past or present a feature of both approximation methods using polynomials and piecewise continuous splines is that the importance of each data point can be weighted for example less weight might be given to a point whose accuracy was doubtful or points can be weighted according to their age so that the oldest points have the smallest contributions and the most recent gaugings can be rationally incorporated to give the most recent rating curve in fact the rating curve can be constructed for any day now or in the past for that day t 0 say one could assume that points more recent than that would have zero weight and those older have a weight which is a function of their age thus if t n is the time when point n was established then in the sums of squares eqs 9 11 the weights are given by 14 w n f t 0 t n if t 0 t n 0 otherwise where f t 0 t n is a function of the age of the data t 0 t n at the date of the rating curve to be calculated here all rating points later than t 0 have been assigned a weight of zero it might not be too outrageous in fact if data were scarce also to include later rating points in some manner as providing some information at least this will not be pursued here the simplest method of diminishing the importance of older points would be to ignore all points with an age greater than a certain amount the author tried this but for high flows where there were not enough points to define the curve properly poor results were obtained a better method seems to be to use a smoother function decaying into the past to keep all the points to some extent in determining the shape of the curve a good example is the exponential weight factor f t 0 t n exp α t 0 t n where α is a decay constant writing τ 1 2 for the half life the age at which the weight decays by a factor of 1 2 then the expression can be written 15 f t 0 t n 1 2 t 0 t n τ 1 2 this was applied to 31 years of data from usgs station 02448500 on the noxubee river near geiger al usa with results shown in fig 7 the polynomial method with a degree m 3 was used with a q 1 2 fit and with a half life of τ 1 2 2 years found to work well the results show how the rating curve and presumably the bed has generally moved steadily down over 31 years 7 conclusions it has been asserted that the problem of rating curve generation benefits little from simple hydraulic formulae and is essentially one of data approximation for which least squares methods can be used they too have their problems if used without knowledge and overcoming of intrinsic computational difficulties two methods have been developed and applied both use a power transformation of discharges one uses polynomial approximation in which it is necessary to scale the stage and then to use a polynomial which is a series of chebyshev polynomials these have much better numerical properties than simple polynomials and are easily implemented the only important parameter is the degree of polynomial however monitoring of results for different degrees is necessary as there is usually one degree beyond which the results show unacceptable oscillations the other method developed here uses piecewise continuous splines together with least squares approximation this requires possibly just the input of the number of computational knot points depending on the results some specification and manipulation of knot point stage values might be necessary the spline approach is more robust and flexible but is slightly more complicated to program as the natures of the polynomial and spline approximations are different but programming details of the solution methods are similar the use of both would be convenient and would provide a test and check on results the nature of scattered rating data at some stations has been discussed and it has been shown that the scatter of data points in mobile bed streams might be predominantly due to changes in resistance in the stream those changes can be ephemeral depending on the arrangement of bed grains or of bed forms so that we never really know what the immediate resistance and hence the rating is a method has been developed to compute upper and lower bounds to the rating data giving an envelope to scattered data so that for routine stage measurements not only the most likely mean discharge but also the possible maximum and minimum values could be published it is suggested that if a discrepant rating point is determined there is no point in locally distorting the rating curve by using a shift curve as the next time that the interval of validity of the shift is visited by a flow event conditions in the stream might be quite different both approximation methods developed here allow the specification of a weight for each data point which can be specified as diminishing with age of the data such that the methods can be used to generate the present rating curve or that on any particular day in the past an incidental practical benefit of the approaches here is the possibility of no longer using an arbitrary local datum for rating data and curves instead using the actual elevation above mean sea level thereby merging more with other hydraulic applications that might use the results 
7097,traditional methods for the calculation of rating curves from measurements of water level and discharge are criticised as being limited and complicated to implement such that manual methods are still often used two methods for automatic computation are developed using least squares approximation one based on polynomials and the other on piecewise continuous splines computational problems are investigated and procedures recommended to overcome them both methods are found to work well and once the parameters for a gauging station have been determined rating data can be processed automatically for some streams ephemeral changes of resistance may be important evidenced by scattered or loopy data for such cases the approximation methods can be used to generate a rating envelope as well allowing the routine calculation also of maximum and minimum expected flows criticism is made of current shift curve practices finally the approximation methods allow the specification of weights for the data points enabling the filtering of data especially decreasing the importance of points with age and allowing the computation of a rating curve for any time in the past or present keywords discharge measurement streamgauging rating curves rivers velocity measurements 1 introduction a rating curve is a relationship between the discharge q of a stream and h the stage or surface elevation so that when routine measurements of stage at a gauging station are made the flow can be estimated the curve is calculated from a number of h q rating data points from that station using relatively infrequent measurements of the velocity distribution cross section and stage of the stream the problem of the automatic calculation of rating curves has received relatively little research attention the main problem seems to be the perceived success and almost universal use of the power function 1 q c h h 0 μ where c h 0 and μ are constants and which is a straight line on log q log h h 0 axes the reasons for it being a problem include on one hand it is too simple with only three parameters and is limited in its accuracy and generality on the other hand it is too complicated such that the three parameters occur nonlinearly and solving for them is difficult such that manual methods are often used the power function and its representation as a straight line on logarithmic axes appears ubiquitously in books standards and lecture notes whereas it is sometimes a convenient approximation to the relationship q h over the whole range of data in general it is not it is an over simplification of the real hydraulics at many gauging stations such a formula is valid for an infinitely wide weir in infinitely deep water or for uniform flow in an infinitely wide rectangular channel there is no reason for a real rating curve to follow such a function closely insufficient knowledge of hydraulics has led to a too great belief in the power function on one hand by practitioners and on the other by theoreticians in related disciplines this has led to complicated procedures in some organisations where sequences of power functions are used and a great deal of trouble goes into the laborious manual fitting of piecewise continuous straight lines on logarithmic axes by adjusting the offsets h 0 for each on different vertical log h h 0 axes the more general representation of q by a polynomial of higher degree m has been in the background for some time 2 q a 0 a 1 h a 2 h 2 a m h m m 0 m a m h m where a 0 a 1 a m are coefficients it was presented by herschy in the first edition of his book in 1985 most recently in herschy 2009 p195 in international standard 7066 2 1988 and in morgenschweis 2010 p384 standard linear least squares methods can be used to determine the coefficients mirza 2003 used it successfully with just m 3 and in that scholarly work gave considerable attention to statistical matters reading those sources and water industry websites but also reading between the lines it seems that the approximation by polynomials despite its promise has not often been adopted and usually only implemented to low degree herschy wrote in the first edition of his book in 1985 and 24 years later again in the third edition herschy 2009 p195 however some user experience is still required with this method before it is accepted as an alternative to the existing methods implying that its use has been languishing fenton and keller 2001 section 6 3 2 suggested writing the polynomial for q raised to the power ν specified a priori 3 q ν a 0 a 1 h a 2 h 2 a m h m m 0 m a m h m which is actually a simple generalisation of the power function eq 1 written in the form q a 0 a 1 h 1 ν to q a 0 a 1 h a 2 h 2 1 ν they recommended a value of ν 1 2 on the basis of that being the mean value in the hydraulic discharge formulae for a sequence of weir and channel cross sections that modelled local and channel control fenton 2001 the use of such a fractional value of ν has two effects 1 for small flows h and q small the data usually is such that 4 q ν a 0 a 1 h with ν 1 2 is a surprisingly good approximation when compared with power function approximations in which ν is a free parameter as shown in fenton 2015b section 3 4 in this small flow limit the more general polynomial approximation just has to simulate nearly linear variation which it can easily do 2 for larger flows when the higher degree terms in eq 3 become important the use of q ν means that the magnitude of the dependent variable to be approximated is numerically much smaller so that instead of a range of say q 1 to 10 4 m 3 s 1 for ν 1 2 a numerical range q 1 2 1 to 10 2 has to be approximated this is a simple version of a power transformation used in more formal data analysis applications to stabilise variance and to make the data more normal distribution like in recent years there have been a number of papers with a quite different way of looking at the problem using bayesian statistics le coz et al 2014 provided an excellent survey both of that field and the rating curve problem generally however all the papers they referred to used either a single power function or two or more of them each in the belief that they were following hydraulic principles it is the assertion here that there is little fundamental about the power function or the application of hydraulic theory and here a rather different path will be followed treating the problem as one of data approximation in that spirit coxon et al 2015 used lowess locally weighted scatterplot smoothing to obtain rating curves for a huge number of sites the method considered each stage discharge measurement as the central point in a subset of the data points the estimate of the discharge for the data point and its variance was generated by fitting a weighted linear regression to the selected data weights were dependent upon the differences in stage and gave most weight to data closest to the central measurement to account for outlier points two passes were made then a weight function was used to weight each data point according to how far the point was from the first fitted line reducing the impact of those furthest from it the procedure could be used to satisfy the goal in this work of developing methods for practical automatic computation it seems good in principle but there are a number of adjustable parameters and the reduction of importance of outlying points might deny the importance of some causative processes and trends at work it functioned well for the demanding application that coxon et al required of it where the main thrust was the quantification of uncertainty rather than the generation of approximations fenton 2015b hereafter referred to as report i considered several aspects of the problem of the automatic generation of rating curves the present paper is based on that report which contains more detail here first the application of polynomial approximation methods is treated at length several mathematical reasons for problems associated with them are given with physical explanations and methods for overcoming them it is considered imperative to use series of chebyshev polynomials rather than the simple polynomials shown above which are series of monomials h m also it is desirable to approximate not values of discharge q but q ν where ν is a fractional exponent as in eq 3 it is usually able to be taken to be 1 2 but in extreme cases can be calculated by a method that is presented other than ν the degree m of the polynomial series is the only free parameter it is possible to use large values of m but if the data has gaps there will usually be one degree beyond which large fluctuations occur in between accurate approximation of the data points to overcome that problem an alternative approximation method is developed using piecewise continuous splines in which case the parameters of the problem are the number and stage values of knot points between which simple quadratic or cubic spline functions are used a simple automatic method is suggested for the placing of those knots just requiring there to be the same number of data points in each interval this usually works well otherwise in difficult cases the values of stage for the knot points can be specified results for both the polynomial method and the approximating spline method are presented they are both found to perform well and have the potential to be standard procedures for rating curve generation then possible reasons for scatter of rating points are discussed for such data the methods can be modified to calculate additionally a rating envelope giving likely maximum and minimum flow rating curves for discrepant points it is suggested that current use of shift curves should be re examined finally the approximation methods are simply modified to allow the importance of data points to decrease with age this allows the generation of a rating curve on any date in the past also thereby determining any relatively slow long term changes in the stream 2 polynomial approximation eq 3 is now generalised by considering the approximating function to be made up not of a series of monomials h m but of more general functions f m h 5 q ν m 0 m a m f m h a 0 f 0 h a 1 f 1 h a m f m h in application the functions are specified a priori and the unknown coefficients a m found by least squares fitting to data points h n q n ν for n 1 n each of the functions applies over the whole data range of h and so methods using them are global ones as distinct from those in section 3 below where piecewise continuous local functions are used we will consider the functions f m h each to be a polynomial of degree m so that the sum of such polynomials in eq 5 including the last one at m m is also a polynomial of degree m and we can refer to methods using them as polynomial approximation it will be found that chebyshev polynomials for the f m h are particularly useful there are three problems here with the approximation the rapid variation of data at the low flow end the large range of discharge q and the ability of the approximating functions to describe arbitrary variations these problems will be overcome as is now described 2 1 exponent ν 2 1 1 usual adequacy of ν 1 2 traditionally the power function has often been required to model all the data by writing it in the form of eq 4 q ν a 0 a 1 h while it incorporates the usual rapid variation and large curvature on q h axes at low flows it is obvious that it is a limited approximation to the whole rating curve problem concerning the actual value of ν to use report i fig 2 showed that for each of seven different stations selected randomly adopting ν 1 2 gave agreement with scattered data at the low flow end that was just as satisfactory as results from fitting a value of ν mcmahon and peel submitted for publication used the polynomial approximation methods of report i and this work to obtain 622 rating curves from 171 australian bureau of meteorology hydrologic reference stations they found that the methods worked well with the exception of about 0 5 of the stations where there was difficulty approximating the low flow data as exemplified by the dotted line in fig 1 here in such cases it is better to determine the actual value of ν from the low flow data and use that as is now described 2 1 2 calculating ν when necessary to do this one can use any of several methods outlined in report i section 3 2 the recommended method is to use the function q ν a 0 a 1 h eq 4 and solving for a 0 a 1 and ν by nonlinear least squares approximation of the points at the low flow end minimising 6 ε 2 n a 0 a 1 h n q n ν 2 as two of the unknowns a 0 and a 1 occur linearly in eq 4 and hence in the error contribution here this form is computationally simpler than solving for the three unknowns in the highly nonlinear and embedded form of eq 1 q c h h 0 μ when problems with complex values can occur if the term in brackets becomes negative as part of the iterative solution procedure it is not recommended to use all points to determine ν its value is best determined from the low flow data when the simple linear approximation used in eqs 4 and 6 is adequate in that limited range to determine how many of the points to use in determining ν the author has experimented and as a rough guide found using about one third of all the data points usually satisfactory but this can be varied to suit the circumstances determined by plotting results always ν has a value rather less than unity its precise value is not so important in its other useful function that of providing a power transformation for the larger flow data to be explained in section 2 1 3 below fig 1 shows the results for a case where it was necessary to calculate ν the most extreme one found the physical nature of the purely local control is shown in the photograph it is a compound v notch weir on the rating curve plot it can be seen that fitting a polynomial in the form of eq 3 with m 3 did not work well with ν 1 2 using the method described immediately above to determine ν from low flow data gave ν 0 136 significantly different with that value the subsequent polynomial approximation of eq 3 worked rather better as shown however the data shows a certain oscillation due to the irregular nature of the structure better results were obtained using spline approximation an alternative method to be described below which still worked well simply with ν 1 2 taking a higher degree polynomial with m 4 gave very poor results with large oscillations 2 1 3 the role of ν as a power transformation the use of a value of ν which is less than unity solves another problem with the approximation of rating data and that is the large variation in the magnitude of q it can easily vary by a factor of 10 4 between lower and upper ends even in a small problem such as shown in fig 1 the polynomial has to approximate variation of that magnitude with a similar relative accuracy overall one way of overcoming this which was tried was to approximate values of log q and use a polynomial for that quantity this expanded the low flow region and contracted the high flow region as required but sometimes too much so and is not recommended instead using a fractional value of ν with q ν which also gives a much smaller numerical range to approximate for example q 1 2 varying by a factor 10 2 has been found to be satisfactory whether a small calculated value such as ν 0 136 in fig 1 or the commonly assumed value ν 1 2 in this work it was found to eliminate problems that otherwise occurred if ν 1 were simply used 2 2 global basis functions in the approximating series whereas the previous two difficulties of describing both low flows and overall flows varying by several orders of magnitude are ones of accuracy and are obvious the worst problems associated with polynomial approximation are not obvious and are to do with the approximating properties of the functions f m h in eq 5 we present a hierarchy of approaches in increasing levels of power and desirability starting from the conventional and immediately obvious one they are illustrated in fig 2 a f m h m as suggested in books and standards shown in eqs 2 and 3 and represented in fig 2 a this is a very fragile form if the numerical values of h are large for example using elevation above sea level when the range of h might be something like h 100 m to h 110 m as illustrated for example or if the stage is specified in centimetres as is the practice in some countries over that relatively small range of stages each monomial term h m looks rather like all the others with little apparent curvature to describe any general variation with finite curvature the individual contributions in the series would have to struggle with large coefficients a m b f m h h min m where h min the minimum of all stages measured has been subtracted the effects are shown in fig 2 b and now the individual functions show more diverse behaviour common practice is to use a stage datum for rating curves just below the minimum so this is effectively what might be used in practice however in section 6 3 of report i an example was presented that showed using the monomial functions in the form of both a and b with and without subtraction of h min individual contributions in the series of approximating terms had remarkable values of 10 000 times that of the final sum although plotting and use of results was possible it would be extremely fragile if passing coefficient values between programs and computers as they would have to be specified to very high levels of precision c f m y m where y is a scaled variable in the interval 1 1 7 y 1 2 h h min h max h min where h max is the maximum of all the stage measurements fig 2 c shows how the first 4 or 5 such monomials are quite different providing good grounds for approximation however for larger values of m they all start to look similar to each other making higher degree approximation more difficult in report i using y was found to give rather better results than the first two possibilities of a and b however not as good as the following fourth alternative d f m t m y still using y but as the argument of a chebyshev polynomial of degree m which can be simply evaluated by t m y cos m arccos y or recursively from t 0 y 1 t 1 y y and for all m 2 t m y 2 yt m 1 y t m 2 y fig 2 d shows that they all behave quite differently from each other and hence can describe arbitrarily varying quantities without the problems noted above they are simply implemented using the formulae given here 2 3 recommended formulation and solution for the coefficients from the above it is recommended to use the formulation 8 q ν m 0 m a m t m y it is highly desirable to use a fractional value of ν for which a value of 1 2 can usually be assumed in exceptional cases ν can be determined using the procedure described in section 2 1 2 in view of the evidence cited in section 2 2 b it is considered imperative to use polynomials which have an orthogonal nature capable of efficient description of arbitrarily varying data in any further reference to polynomial approximation in this work it is always chebyshev polynomials that have been used each t m is a polynomial of degree m so that the sum of the different chebyshev polynomials to m m is itself a polynomial of degree m while it can be called a chebyshev series it cannot be called a chebyshev polynomial itself the number of terms in the series and the degree m of the polynomial might typically be in the range from 3 to 10 the coefficients a m can be obtained by least squares methods minimising the sum of the weighted squares of the errors of the approximation over n data points 9 ε 2 n 1 n w n m 0 m a m t m y n q n ν 2 where the y n are obtained from the h n from eq 7 the w n are the weights for each rating point giving the freedom to weight some points more if one wanted the rating curve to approximate them more closely or they could be set to be a decaying function of the age of the data point so that the effects of changes with time could be examined or a less trusted data point could be given a smaller weight often however all the w n will be 1 two ways of calculating the a m are considered here a normal equations following the standard least squares procedure the total error in eq 9 is differentiated with respect to each of the unknown a m m 0 m and set to zero so that error is at a minimum thus giving a system of m 1 equations in the m 1 unknowns the so called normal equations for the a m interpreted in a matrix equation sense the equations can be written a jm a m b j where to evaluate the elements in those matrices here abandoning the usual convention that matrix row and column numbering starts at 1 for j from 0 to m b j n 1 n w n q n ν t j y n for m from 0 to m a jm n 1 n w n t j y n t m y n the equations and the matrix are famously poorly conditioned unless care is taken to use functions which have some form of orthogonal nature as has been done here while the chebyshev polynomials are orthogonal under integration and summation with certain special weights in the present case summing over an arbitrary sequence of y n they are not strictly orthogonal but show sufficient diversity of behaviour that the matrix is not particularly poorly conditioned here no problems were found using this method to obtain solutions b optimisation methods these minimise ε 2 in eq 9 using common software such as the solver module in spreadsheets or other software packages they are simple to implement without a great deal of knowledge of the program details the methods used internally might be gradient methods such as a multi dimensional newton s method numerical solution does not seem to be difficult in the present work because the a m occur linearly in the approximating function 8 and also because of the efficient nature of the approximating basis chebyshev polynomials 2 4 degree of approximation m with polynomial approximation there are few freedoms of choice the use of chebyshev polynomials is considered mandatory here to guard against series with very poor convergence properties then having decided to approximate in terms of a certain value of ν probably 1 2 the only computational parameter remaining is the degree of approximation m fig 3 shows a typical result from polynomial approximation for a data set with gaps as m increases to from 2 to 3 to 4 and 5 better agreement is obtained here coincidentally the latter two agreeing for higher degree m 6 however the polynomials have begun to oscillate between the data points and the results are unacceptable for data with no large gaps one can use higher degrees but sooner or later the degree of approximation becomes too high and unacceptable oscillations appear in practice one could determine the appropriate value of m for a particular station visually based on evidence such as the figure here it need only be done once 2 5 quantification of goodness of fit it would be better to have a more automatic procedure to measure how well a particular function approximated the data such as the statistical coefficient of determination r 2 the author investigated this problem at some length considering two error criteria the first was the sum of the squares of the errors at each data point the numerical value of ε 2 defined in eq 9 which could be used to obtain a value of r 2 this did not work well as it did not detect over fitting when a higher degree of approximation fitted the data points better but allowed severe fluctuations between them as shown in fig 3 to try to identify that problem a second error criterion was investigated which was the integral of the absolute magnitude of the curvature of the approximating function over the whole curve unfortunately both error criteria behaved differently for different stations and no recommendation can be made here criteria such as r 2 also do not show where omitted variable bias exists in the rating curve case there are several such variables including those that are discussed in this work unsteadiness and channel changes both short and long term in view of these problems no goodness of fit results will be presented here either for the polynomial representation or for the approximating spline method about to be described 2 6 extrapolation the methods in this work approximate data over a finite range they must not be used for extrapolation beyond either end of the data 3 approximating splines a different approach was developed in report i section 8 using piecewise continuous approximation in the form of spline functions where rather than interpolating as in their usual application they were required to perform least squares approximation the method is in a sense both local and partly global in that a sequence of local polynomials is used each of which approximates just part of the range of data but which is required to merge smoothly with its two neighbours so that they and their approximated data points also have some influence it seems to be relatively simple to have a readily understandable physical significance and a good level of continuity other than the degree of the splines second or third which seem to make little difference the only adjustable quantities are the values of stage used as knot points marking the boundaries between successive splines consider a number of data pairs h n q n ν for n 1 2 n let the range of stages h min h max be subdivided into j intervals by j 1 knot points at each of which the stage is h j j 1 j 1 and h 0 h min and h j h max they must be separate and ordered such that h j 1 h j for all the j the points are to be approximated over each interval by a polynomial of degree m 2 or 3 so for j 1 j 1 and h j h h j 1 10 p j h h j m 0 m c j m h h j m where p j h h j is the polynomial of degree m which holds between stage knot points h j and h j 1 expressed as a function of h h j the height of stage h above the preceding knot point at each knot there are continuity conditions between the polynomials on either side agreeing in value and first derivative for quadratic splines and additionally the second derivative for cubic splines the h j may be set as data or automatically allocated such that there are the same number of data points in each interval for example described below the program calculates all the coefficients so that the sum of the squares of the differences between data points and functions are minimised only those data points falling within a certain interval contribute to the total sum using the function for that interval it is not necessary to scale the h as recommended for polynomial approximation in section 2 as it only appears as the local shifted value h h j and the degree of the polynomial is low anyway the details of those operations are as follows the sum of the squares of the errors is minimised using the polynomials as given in eq 10 as 11 ε 2 j 1 j n i j w n m 0 m c j m h n h j m q n ν 2 where i j is the set of data point reference numbers in interval j the summations are a mathematical statement of the obvious over all the intervals consider every data point in that interval and calculate its contribution to the total error using the polynomial for that interval the spline nature of the approximation requires the satisfaction across each interior knot of the continuity of function value plus all derivatives up to m 1 at the knot points giving extra conditions on all the coefficients c j m from eqs 10 at left and right of each interior knot point and using δ j h j 1 h j for the interval length the conditions become for j 2 j 12 c j 1 0 m 0 m c j m δ j m c j 1 1 m 1 m mc j m δ j m 1 and c j 1 2 c j 2 3 c j 3 δ j if m 3 the solution procedure to determine the unknown c j m by minimising ε 2 in eq 11 is first to use the continuity eqs 12 to eliminate those variables on the left sides then to solve for the remaining c j m as for polynomial approximation differentiation leading to the normal equations could be used but it is simpler to use optimisation software which was the case in this work because of the high degree of continuity enforced by equations 12 the net number of unknowns is not large just j m in the present work quadratic splines m 2 were found to be satisfactory and j might have a maximum value of say 10 to allocate the knot points h j they could simply be equally spaced between minimum and maximum values another automatic method that which was used here was simply programmed and which often worked well was where knot points were calculated such that there were approximately the same number of data points in all intervals however the knots can also simply be assigned as data such hand adjustment of the knot positions was sometimes useful to describe regions of high curvature it was usually found necessary to place a knot point near isolated data points for extreme floods it should be emphasised that only the values of the stage knot points h j were specified there was no attempt to pin the approximation by specifying the discharge there the approximating spline method worked well in all the examples considered with occasional improvement by hand allocation of knot points it never failed badly unlike the polynomial method if too high a degree m were used as in fig 3 4 plotting of rating curves horizontal discharge axis in this work as described above using q 1 2 q proved very helpful for computations however using it as a plotting co ordinate caused the low flow region to be too condensed for display purposes attempts were made instead to use log q for the computations but this caused the high flow region to be too condensed with difficulties of approximation the hybrid solution was adopted of obtaining solutions using q 1 2 but for plotting the traditional horizontal scale of log q has been mostly used here with its ability to represent variation of several orders of magnitude the exception is the use of q in fig 3 vertical stage axis use of logarithmic scales for stage has often made representation and understanding difficult and caused errors report i section 4 3 reported on an elementary mathematical mistake in current software using logarithmic axes unless one were using the traditional power function of eq 1 with h h 0 there is little reason to use a logarithmic scale for stage as it typically varies from a value close to zero opening out unreasonably on the logarithmic scale to at most about 10 m tradition is that the stage has an arbitrary local datum somewhere below the lowest possible water level so that stages plotted are typically in the range of greater than 0 m to something like 10 m or rather less but where they have no external physical significance use of the transformed variable y eq 7 or the spline method mean that there is no advantage to specifying and using these traditional local values of stage it would be possible to use the actual elevation above mean sea level which would have certain advantages as that is often important in water engineering there would no longer be such a need to maintain an arbitrary local benchmark and refer measurements to that especially if satellite navigation systems could be directly used for water level measurements 5 results to examine the performance of the methods described above data from seven sites were considered three from australia two from bangladesh and two from the united states of america wherever necessary results were converted to si units results have already been shown for one in fig 1 and another in fig 3 using polynomial approximation only results for that and another five are shown in fig 4 in each case two rating curves are presented one from polynomial approximation the other from approximating splines all have been obtained using ν 1 2 thus approximating values of q 1 2 in all cases the polynomial degree m shown on each figure was chosen as the smallest value that was compatible with accuracy often increasing m by a single degree beyond that led to unacceptable fluctuations as has been seen in fig 3 which is for the same station as fig 4 e for the spline method all results are for quadratic splines m 2 no advantage was found using cubic splines m 3 in the first four cases in fig 4 automatic allocation of knot points was used with about the same number of data points in each interval in the two remaining examples and in fig 1 especially at large flows where there were few data points the knot points h j were allocated manually by specifying in a data file the method used is shown on each figure a avon river at stratford vic australia site number 225201a 2012 06 05 to 2015 04 24 there is a large gap in this data the polynomial approximation of low degree m 3 and the quadratic splines with only three intervals have worked well both giving a similar plausible bridging of the gap there are actually two points close together for the highest flows using higher degree polynomials showed over fitting with the result that both points were almost interpolated with large oscillations between data points b brahmaputra river bangladesh 1992 the data was taken from mirza 2003 by digitising a fairly small figure so the accuracy here might be questionable both methods handle this fairly simple problem quite well it might be thought that neither method has treated the two points at h 19 m q 40 000 m 3 s 1 well but it should be remembered that the approximations are for discharge plotted horizontally and so they actually perform quite well in passing between those two points and the three or four points on the other side of the curves with roughly the same stage c choctawhatchee river near bellwood al usa usgs station 02361500 2000 12 07 to 2015 05 22 the only real problem for approximation seems to be for the lowest flows where there is a quite characteristic scatter of points both methods seem to perform satisfactorily d ganges river bangladesh 1992 the data was also digitised from a small figure in mirza 2003 this is a demanding problem if one accepts that the fine structure lumps in the data are real it has been chosen here to do that as a test of the model although it might be over fitting it if one knew the reliability of the data it might have been possible to use a smoother approximation with a polynomial of lesser degree and or splines with fewer intervals both polynomials and splines with high levels of approximation have performed well in describing the complicated variation the polynomial can do this because the data points are uniformly distributed the splines have performed well even if the placement of the knots has yet again been performed automatically and there are actually few data points in each interval e gwydir river at pallamallawa nsw australia site number 418001 1991 01 05 to 1998 07 29 again this shows data with some large gaps using splines automatic allocation of equally populated intervals did not give such good results for high flows so for the first time in this figure knots were allocated by hand placing one at 8 m which caused the splines to pass very close to the high flow points as shown some of those data points were obtained partly from a boat floating above flooded agricultural land possibly a rougher approximation would have been more justified in any case with splines one has quite a lot of power to experiment with point placement f noxubee river near geiger al usa usgs station 02448500 1970s this data set shows three regions of local channel and overbank control the polynomial method has worked well here but with a high degree of approximation necessary to pick up the points of high curvature which has led to some possible over fitting the spline approximations have worked well also with only five hand allocated knots this is a site where the greater freedom to allocate spline knot points has been of benefit 6 scattered and looped data the problem of the scatter of data points is now considered two main causes will be identified and two different ways of representing the data firstly short term changes in the stream will be considered it is suggested that this scatter can be incorporated and quantified by the computation of a rating envelope so that maximum and minimum expected flows can also be calculated and published secondly long term stream changes can be identified and described by a procedure that enables the calculation of a rating curve also for any date in the past 6 1 a model of a rating curve determined by channel resistance a model of a stream is now developed to try to understand how channel changes affect rating curves this will apply to both channel and overbank control where the boundary resistance of the stream determines the rating it is assumed that in the vicinity of the gauging station the long wave equations hold a pair of partial differential equations one expressing volume conservation the other momentum conservation fenton 2015a sections 1 4 1 5 showed for waves of a sufficiently long period that the time derivative in the momentum conservation equation can be neglected obviously enough but not so obviously also that fluid inertia terms can be neglected in that limit leaving the only terms in the equation those due to resistance and gravity surprisingly even for high froude number flows modelling the resistance here by the gauckler manning equation then gives the momentum equation in the form in which the only approximation is that wave motions are long typical of flood waves and of course also valid for steady flow 13 q 1 n a 5 3 p 2 3 s η where n is manning s resistance coefficient a is stream cross sectional area p is its wetted perimeter and s η η x is the magnitude of the slope of the free surface where η is the surface elevation which might also be a function of time t for the special case of a steady uniform flow s η s 0 the bed slope and the expression becomes the usual statement of the gauckler manning equation it is surprising that the expression here is such a simple and general extension of that familiar form we consider the different terms on the right of eq 13 to see how different channel quantities affect the rating resistance coefficient n this might be able to change relatively quickly and its value can depend on the recent flow history due to the following effects small changes in bed grain arrangement and armouring can have a finite effect and could occur quite quickly if for example overlying particles with high resistance are swept away by an increase in flow or start to deposit in interstices bed forms ripples dunes anti dunes etc if conditions are right for the development or changing of bed forms the effects on resistance could be important this would take longer than for bed grain re arrangement as more material has to be transported this has been treated by simons and richardson 1962 sediment transport if the bed grains are moving then the stress required to move them appears additionally whether they are moving along the bed rolling jumping or carried suspended in the flow it could be quite variable depending on the different thresholds of movement vegetation grasses reeds trees standing in the water etc this would have a more slowly varying effect partly continuous and possibly seasonal the relative change in rated discharge due to a change δ n is obtained by the differential of eq 13 with respect to n giving δ q q δ n n which might not be small fenton 2015a section 1 6 2 showed the wide scatter of channel resistance coefficients in a large field study and hypothesised that some of that was due simply to different arrangements of bed particles fig 6 below shows a situation where a range of variation q in a large alluvial river over three years was some 25 50 that may also be partly due to fill and scour however the rapidity of change in the data suggested it was mainly due to resistance changes geometric term a 5 3 p 2 3 effects of bed fill or scour as a model we consider the channel to be rectangular of width b such that a b h z where z is the bed elevation and to be wide such that p b so that the term becomes a 5 3 p 2 3 b h z 5 3 the relative change in rated discharge due to a change δ z in the bed level due to scour or fill is then δ q q 5 3 δ z h z in which h z is the water depth at the gauging station it is asserted here that that relative amount of scour or fill δ z depth is usually small in this case because finite amounts of material have to be moved to effect the change in bed elevation such changes to the rating will be relatively slow they may be of a consistent long term nature leading to gradual change in the rating curve a method to identify and calculate such change will be presented in section 6 4 unsteady surface slope changes the last term in eq 13 is the surface slope which for a change δ s η gives the differential δ q q 1 2 δ s η s η the slope might change because of long term downstream channel changes however there can be rapid changes as a flood wave passes which could have a finite effect on the rating but only at times immediately before and after a flood peak when the surface slope is sufficiently different from the mean bed slope some important data are obtained during floods when there may be unsteady effects which it would be good to correct and of course subsequent routine computation of discharge should ideally be corrected for unsteadiness around flood peaks the problem was considered at some length in fenton and keller 2001 section 4 which included an extra correction to the jones method which obtains an estimate of s η by assuming that the flood is propagating as a wave without change however effects of changing resistance described above are also important but unable to be quantified so that unsteadiness will not be considered further here 6 2 scattered data and results due to a moveable bed let us consider the mechanism by which changes in resistance cause the data to be scattered fig 5 shows rating curve axes stage versus discharge three dashed lines represent hypothetical rating curves for a stream with different constant resistance values the dotted line represents a hypothetical flood event showing the actual relationship between stage and discharge at each time we now consider such an event in detail the initial point a is for a low flow over a bed with relatively small resistance after a period of steady flow during which the bed has been steadily armoured and smoothed the flood event then begins the flow increases quickly in time but initially not enough to change the nature of the bed and the flood trajectory follows a curve corresponding to the initial resistance after some distance on the figure the bed is no longer stable grains move are exposed and bed forms might develop accordingly the resistance is greater and the trajectory crosses contours of increasing resistance there may also be unsteady effects due to the front of the flood being steeper and the instantaneous flow being greater which mimic the effects of changing resistance after the flood peak with maximum discharge and high transport resistance continues to increase a little time later the stage is a maximum subsequently the flow continues to decrease but the transport rate is still enough for resistance to increase gradually however that stops and the flow gradually decreases at point b with relatively low flow with the disturbed bed still in place the resistance is still high now gradually over time the sediment transport acts to reduce the bed forms and pack the bed grains so that resistance is less as time passes the bed will gradually be worked back to a low resistance state as initially but where the more or less steady flow as at point c might be different from the initial one the path has followed a loop with two discharges for each stage and vice versa before and after the flow maximum this is often described as a looped rating curve however it is really just a trajectory a path in time on rating axes that may be more or less looped a rating point obtained during such an event could be anywhere on it if we consider a long period of time with many such flow events the space between the upper and lower constant resistance curves will contain many such flow trajectories and many individual rating points obtained at moments on those trajectories leading to a scatter of points between the bounds the more stable the bed the less the scatter usually rating measurements are not made frequently enough for any trajectory to be identified and the rating points seem randomly scattered by approximating all data points as described above we obtain what we call the rating curve if a new rating point were found to be discrepant from established results it might be possible to correct for any effects of unsteadiness as described above but as suggested there effects of changing resistance due to changing bed composition and bed forms might also be important we do not know those conditions and do not know how much to correct the conventional shift curve approach is to arbitrarily distort the rating curve locally by a straight line on logarithmic axes to pass through the new point sauer 2002 section 8 wmo 2010 section 1 12 the view here is that even a short time after the discrepant measurement when resistance in the stream is still the same the flow might be quite different and be far from the shifted interval so that the shift is not relevant the next time that the interval of the shifted curve is visited by a flow event conditions in the stream might be quite different and the previous discrepant point and shift no longer have a special relevance accordingly there is little need to ascribe great importance to a discrepant data point not agreeing with the rating curve the view here is that it is an approximating curve passing through a more or less scattered cloud of points where at least some of that scatter is due to fluctuations in the preceding flows and instantaneous state of the bed when each point was determined now considering the subsequent regular routine measurements of stage to estimate flows each measurement might be made at any point on the continuing trajectory but should fall within the band of resistance values as modelled in the figure this ephemeral nature of the resistance in mobile bed streams means that it is not possible to predict accurately the flow at any later time it is not known what flows and bed changes will occur in the future up until the moment a routine stage measurement is made and the rating curve required to give a corresponding flow this existence of a certain level of uncertainty for some rating sites suggests the concept and different treatment of the next section using the approximation methods developed here to calculate curves for not just the likely mean discharge but also for minimum and maximum possible values of course the data for many sites shows little scatter in the small sample presented in this paper of the six run of river results shown in fig 4 about three show evidence of significant scatter a single rating curve might still be considered satisfactory but augmentation by maximum and minimum flow curves might be useful 6 3 a generalisation for scattered data the rating envelope maxima and minima the existence of a finite band of results leads to an extension of the idea of a single rating curve the calculation of a rating envelope inside of which all or most of the individual rating points fall and to provide expressions for curves approximating both upper and lower bounds as well as the conventional rating curve approximating all points the effects of long term changes would have to be subtracted however possibly using time decaying weights as described in the following section for gauging stations where data is scattered rather than being a problem this can be viewed as providing extra information as to the range of discharges that can be expected it would make some sense also to publish routinely the minimum and maximum flows expected for each stage reading in keeping with the approach in this work methods of data approximation can be used to calculate the upper and lower envelopes the method suggested here is first to calculate the approximation to all the points the rating curve and then to delete those points which lie below it then to approximate the remaining points again deleting those points which lie below it and repeat the process of approximation and deletion as many times as necessary to give the upper envelope a fit to the uppermost points then this procedure would be repeated for the lower envelope successively deleting all points above each curve as approximately half the data points are lost with each pass the number of passes is limited the two data points with the smallest and largest values of independent variable h might always be retained to ensure that the final envelope would extend from the smallest to largest values of stage in practice what one would be doing is approximating the 1 8 or 1 16 say of all data points those which lie furthest from the approximation to all the points in the spirit of approximation it can be called an envelope even if some points might still lie outside it fig 6 shows an example for three years of gaugings from the red river viet nam the flood hydrographs for those years shown in report i section 11 3 were quite characteristic with the main events being more seasonal rather than with individual events the flows coming off the high mountains in southern china the flow trajectory has several large loops barely identifiable in the figure here the procedure described above for computing envelopes was applied using polynomial approximation with degree m 6 four passes of the halving procedure for each of the upper and lower envelopes were applied so starting with 217 data points at the end there were about 217 2 4 15 for each envelope it can be seen that the method worked well giving mean maximum and minimum rating curves 6 4 identification of long term changes and calculation of a rating curve for any day in the past or present a feature of both approximation methods using polynomials and piecewise continuous splines is that the importance of each data point can be weighted for example less weight might be given to a point whose accuracy was doubtful or points can be weighted according to their age so that the oldest points have the smallest contributions and the most recent gaugings can be rationally incorporated to give the most recent rating curve in fact the rating curve can be constructed for any day now or in the past for that day t 0 say one could assume that points more recent than that would have zero weight and those older have a weight which is a function of their age thus if t n is the time when point n was established then in the sums of squares eqs 9 11 the weights are given by 14 w n f t 0 t n if t 0 t n 0 otherwise where f t 0 t n is a function of the age of the data t 0 t n at the date of the rating curve to be calculated here all rating points later than t 0 have been assigned a weight of zero it might not be too outrageous in fact if data were scarce also to include later rating points in some manner as providing some information at least this will not be pursued here the simplest method of diminishing the importance of older points would be to ignore all points with an age greater than a certain amount the author tried this but for high flows where there were not enough points to define the curve properly poor results were obtained a better method seems to be to use a smoother function decaying into the past to keep all the points to some extent in determining the shape of the curve a good example is the exponential weight factor f t 0 t n exp α t 0 t n where α is a decay constant writing τ 1 2 for the half life the age at which the weight decays by a factor of 1 2 then the expression can be written 15 f t 0 t n 1 2 t 0 t n τ 1 2 this was applied to 31 years of data from usgs station 02448500 on the noxubee river near geiger al usa with results shown in fig 7 the polynomial method with a degree m 3 was used with a q 1 2 fit and with a half life of τ 1 2 2 years found to work well the results show how the rating curve and presumably the bed has generally moved steadily down over 31 years 7 conclusions it has been asserted that the problem of rating curve generation benefits little from simple hydraulic formulae and is essentially one of data approximation for which least squares methods can be used they too have their problems if used without knowledge and overcoming of intrinsic computational difficulties two methods have been developed and applied both use a power transformation of discharges one uses polynomial approximation in which it is necessary to scale the stage and then to use a polynomial which is a series of chebyshev polynomials these have much better numerical properties than simple polynomials and are easily implemented the only important parameter is the degree of polynomial however monitoring of results for different degrees is necessary as there is usually one degree beyond which the results show unacceptable oscillations the other method developed here uses piecewise continuous splines together with least squares approximation this requires possibly just the input of the number of computational knot points depending on the results some specification and manipulation of knot point stage values might be necessary the spline approach is more robust and flexible but is slightly more complicated to program as the natures of the polynomial and spline approximations are different but programming details of the solution methods are similar the use of both would be convenient and would provide a test and check on results the nature of scattered rating data at some stations has been discussed and it has been shown that the scatter of data points in mobile bed streams might be predominantly due to changes in resistance in the stream those changes can be ephemeral depending on the arrangement of bed grains or of bed forms so that we never really know what the immediate resistance and hence the rating is a method has been developed to compute upper and lower bounds to the rating data giving an envelope to scattered data so that for routine stage measurements not only the most likely mean discharge but also the possible maximum and minimum values could be published it is suggested that if a discrepant rating point is determined there is no point in locally distorting the rating curve by using a shift curve as the next time that the interval of validity of the shift is visited by a flow event conditions in the stream might be quite different both approximation methods developed here allow the specification of a weight for each data point which can be specified as diminishing with age of the data such that the methods can be used to generate the present rating curve or that on any particular day in the past an incidental practical benefit of the approaches here is the possibility of no longer using an arbitrary local datum for rating data and curves instead using the actual elevation above mean sea level thereby merging more with other hydraulic applications that might use the results 
7098,due to the significant costs associated with stream health monitoring hydrological modeling is widely used to calculate ecologically relevant hydrologic indices to better understand the overall condition of streams within large and diverse watersheds however hydrologic modeling s ability to replicate these indices is limited especially when calibrating models by optimizing a single objective function or when selecting a single optimal solution hence this study evaluates the performance of multi objective model calibration in representing 167 hydrologic indices of ecological interest using the median values of different pareto optimal solution sets for this purpose two strategies based on three nash sutcliffe efficiencies nse and root mean squared error rmse with explicit hydrograph partitioning were implemented additionally the k means clustering technique was employed to define subsets of pareto optimal solutions representing high medium and low flow conditions the soil and water assessment tool swat was set up for the honeyoey creek pine creek watershed located in michigan usa and was calibrated using a single streamflow gauging station and the recently proposed multi objective optimization algorithm non dominated sorting genetic algorithm iii nsga iii the results show that the nse and rmse based calibration strategies can represent 128 and 123 indices within a range of 30 relative errors respectively in addition the results of this study demonstrated that using different set of solutions instead of a single optimal solution introduces more flexibility in the predictability of different hydrologic indices of ecological interest moreover it is suggested that a multi objective calibration approach allows the systematic identification of groups of poorly represented and closely related indices knowing these poorly represented indices would facilitate the formulation of additional objective functions intended to improve model performance or to detect

based on individual characteristics comprised of species abundance and condition species richness and composition or trophic composition herman and nejadhashemi 2015 however due to limited economic resources it is not possible to measure these characteristics for all streams within a watershed therefore stream health evaluation based on field data is very limited to address this difficulty several modeling approaches have been introduced to extend the available information to ungauged locations woznicki et al 2015 streamflow regime has been recognized as a key determinant for sustaining biodiversity and ecological integrity thus ecologically relevant hydrologic indices are often used as predictors in stream health models besides landscape factors and water quality indicators poff and

have shown that the use of typical calibration approaches i e single objective based on widely used performance metrics produces poor representations of some streamflow regime characteristics murphy et al 2013 vis et al 2015 for instance while average conditions are generally well predicted low and high flow indices are frequently over or under predicted wenger et al 2010 moreover no model has been found to provide all selected ecologically relevant hydrologic indices within 30 of the observed values caldwell et al 2015 vis et al 2015 therefore several studies have proposed to explicitly include ecologically relevant hydrologic indices into the objective functions for model calibration to improve the overall performance of streamflow regime simulations murphy et al 2013 shrestha et al

they are not explicitly included in the objective function formulation kiesel et al 2017 in addition optimal solutions are sensitive to the weights assigned to each ecological relevant hydrological

have mainly shown improvements in the representation of target flow conditions rather than the overall streamflow regime or have been evaluated using traditional performance metrics instead of ecologically relevant hydrological indices furthermore the aforementioned studies have mainly implemented single objective algorithms for model calibration therefore these previous studies present no integrated perspectives on relationships between different performance metrics or hydrological indices involved in the model calibration process meanwhile multi objective optimization algorithms are very useful for evaluating the tradeoffs between different metrics and objective functions involved in hydrologic model calibration price et al 2012 and can provide sets of solutions able to represent different flow conditions efstratiadis and koutsoyiannis 2010 reed et al 2013 however pareto optimal solutions are not usually evaluated employing ecologically relevant hydrological indices but instead pure hydrological signatures based on for example flow duration curve fdc segments or runoff ratios shafii and tolson 2015 van werkhoven et al 2009 moreover many studies have been more concerned about selecting a best single solution than analyzing the whole set of pareto optimal solutions which could provide better results for overall streamflow regime representation for instance vis et al 2015 attributed high model efficiencies when using the median of several optimum solutions as a more robust prediction for ecologically relevant hydrologic indicators therefore the objective of this study is to identify an objective function best suited for stream health model applications using a multi objective optimization algorithm for model calibration typical performance metrics that represent different flow conditions and explicit hydrograph partitioning are considered in this study for this purpose the soil and water assessment tool swat watershed model and the nsga iii multi objective optimization algorithm are jointly implemented then a set of 167 ecologically relevant hydrologic indices is used for evaluating the ability of the resulting pareto optimal solutions in representing the overall streamflow regime 2 materials and methods two strategies based on a multi objective optimization technique for model calibration were compared to evaluate their abilities to predict ecologically relevant hydrologic indices fig 1 the first multi objective strategy calibrates the model based on three different forms of nash sutcliffe efficiency nse described by krause et al 2005 and pushpalatha et al 2012 that are suitable for evaluating high medium and low flows in the second strategy observed daily flow time series were divided into three categories high medium and low flows using explicit thresholds for low and high flow flows exceeded 75 and 25 of the time respectively for each category an objective function based on the root mean square error rmse was computed pareto optimal solutions for calibrated model parameters were obtained for each multi objective strategy employing the nsga iii algorithm deb and jain 2014 jain and deb 2014 for both strategies the soil and water assessment tool swat arnold et al 2012 neitsch et al 2011 was used to simulate daily streamflow discharge time series for every stream segment and the matlab hydrological index tool abouali et al 2016 was employed to calculate 167 hydrologic indices intended to characterize streamflow regime olden and poff 2003 hydrologic indices were computed for each pareto optimal point obtained from both multi objective strategies and for the observed flow dataset then model outputs and indices were evaluated with respect to the observed values using statistical analysis for this purpose pareto optimal points for each multi objective strategy were clustered into three groups using the k means method arthur and vassilvitskii 2007 while generalized least square gls estimation was used to analyze the differences between the simulated and observed mean streamflow values the median errors between the hydrologic indices based on pareto optimal solutions and observed time series were evaluated with respect to the 30 uncertainty bound for the observed values as reported by previous studies caldwell et al 2015 kennard et al 2009 vis et al 2015 results were compared with the optimal solutions from a single objective approach in which the objective functions are based on nse as recommended by moriasi et al 2015 for evaluation of hydrological models moreover given that both nse and rmse are computed using the sum of the square differences between observed and simulated values and nse is non dimensional only nse was considered for the single objective model calibration 2 1 study area in order to perform environmental flow analysis it is desirable to identify areas where urbanization is limited streamflow is not regulated or its alteration is negligible and observed discharge records are available for almost all the studied period olden and poff 2003 the honeyoey creek pine creek watershed with a drainage area of 1010 km2 meets all the criteria because urbanization is less than 4 streamflow regulation is limited and observed streamflow data for the period is complete the study area is located in the saginaw bay watershed in east central michigan fig 2 which is the largest watershed in the state and is identified as an area of concern by the us environmental protection agency due to pollution from sediment and nutrients that resulted in eutrophication fish habitat degradation and loss of recreational values among others epa 2015 the watershed has an average slope of 1 9 ranging from 12 39 in the headwaters to 0 1 4 in the lowlands ned 2015 the region has a temperate climate with distinct seasons andresen and winkler 2009 the average annual rainfall is about 840 mm for the period 1981 2010 noaa 2017 however the precipitation regime is bimodal with maxima in may and september and minima in february and july mean annual air temperature in the watershed is 9 c with a minimum monthly temperature of 9 c in january and a maximum monthly temperature of 28 c in july the dominant land use is agriculture covering about 50 of the watershed followed by forests 24 wetlands 16 and pasturelands 7 nass 2012 over 60 of the river network s riparian vegetation has not been altered by human activities the dominant soil textures are loamy sand sandy loam loam clay loam and sand which cover about 30 26 20 and 11 of the study area respectively nrcs 2014 the average flow is about 10 3 m3 s at the outlet of the watershed high flows occur between march and may as a result of snow melting and high precipitation while low flows occur between july and october during summer and fall seasons usgs 2017 high flows considered in this study as those that are exceeded at most 25 of the time q25 have magnitudes above 11 3 m3 s while low flows are defined as those with values below 3 9 m3 s which is the discharge exceeded 75 of the time q75 2 2 data collection datasets required for the hydrologic modeling comprise topography land use soil properties climate and observed streamflow discharge the national elevation dataset from the us geological survey usgs with 30 m spatial resolution was used to represent the topography of the watershed ned 2015 the land use characteristics were obtained from the cropland data layer developed by the national agricultural statistics service of the us department of agriculture usda nass with 30 m spatial resolution nass 2012 the soil properties were compiled from the natural resources conservation service s nrcs soil survey geographic ssurgo database at a scale of 1 250 000 nrcs 2014 daily time series for precipitation and temperature from 2001 through 2014 were obtained from two weather stations that belong to the national climatic data center noaa 2017 relative humidity solar radiation and wind speed time series for the same time span were provided by the stochastic weather generator wxgen neitsch et al 2011 included in swat daily streamflow discharges between 2003 and 2014 were obtained from the pine river near midland gauging station id 04155500 usgs 2017 2 3 swat model description the soil and water assessment tool swat version 2012 rev 614 is a semi distributed continuous time process based hydrological model which simulates water flow sediment transport and water quality processes in watersheds arnold et al 1998 swat divides a watershed into subwatersheds that are further discretized into multiple units with homogeneous land use slope and soil characteristics known as hydrologic response units hru the main processes in swat include snow accumulation and melting evapotranspiration infiltration percolation losses surface runoff channel routing and groundwater flows neitsch et al 2011 swat is used in this study for daily flow simulation between 2003 and 2014 for all 749 defined stream segments in the honeyoey creek pine creek watershed fifteen parameters were selected for model calibration whose description and ranges of variation are presented in table 1 the calibration period was defined between 2003 and 2008 while the validation period spans between 2009 and 2014 meanwhile two years of warm up period 2001 2002 were considered to stabilize initial conditions of soil water cibin et al 2010 2 4 hydrologic indices the 171 hydrologic indices reported by olden and poff 2003 were evaluated for all pareto optimal solutions after completing each multi objective model calibration for this study we discarded four indices related to the frequency and duration of zero flow days and low flow spells which were all equal to zero in this case then the remaining 167 hydrologic indices were compared with the respective indices for the observed dataset including the calibration and validation periods the evaluated hydrologic indices characterize the streamflow regime in terms of magnitude frequency duration timing and rate of change of flows poff et al 1997 richter et al 1996 for a given daily time series these indices were classified into eleven groups magnitude for low ml average ma and high mh flow conditions frequency for low fl and high fh flow conditions duration for low dl and high dh flow conditions timing for low tl average ta and high th flow conditions and rate of change for average ra flow conditions the hydrologic indices were computed using the matlab hydrological index tool mhit which has shown better computing performances in comparison to other available packages when handling high number of datasets abouali et al 2016 2 5 objective functions in this study we contrast the ability of two commonly used procedures in representing a wide number of the streamflow metrics related to environmental flows indicated in section 2 4 each procedure refers to a specific three dimensional objective space fig 3 further details are presented next 2 5 1 nash sutcliffe efficiency based objective functions in this strategy nse based objective functions are formulated to represent different parts of the observed hydrograph krause et al 2005 and pushpalatha et al 2012 indicated that standard nse eq 1 nash and sutcliffe 1970 is very sensitive to high flows on continuous simulations given that the differences between simulated and observed values are squared meanwhile nse calculated on root squared transformed flows eq 2 nsesqrt has been found to provide a more balanced performance because the errors are more equally distributed on high and low flow portions of the hydrograph oudin et al 2006 pushpalatha et al 2012 additionally relative nse eq 3 nserel described by krause et al 2005 suppresses the influence of peak flows on the efficiency computation making it more sensitive to low flows pushpalatha et al 2012 showed that nse computed on the reciprocal of flow values inverse transformed flows is better suited for low flow conditions focusing on the 20 lowest flows on average however in this study we decided to use the nserel given that some of the ecologically relevant hydrologic indices e g low flow index base flow indices indices based on moving averages computed by mhit for low flows are based also on overall flow values therefore nse nsesqrt and nserel were used to represent high medium and low flows respectively 1 nse 1 i 1 n o i p i 2 i 1 n o i o 2 2 ns e sqrt 1 i 1 n o i p i 2 i 1 n o i o 2 3 ns e rel 1 i 1 n o i p i o i 2 i 1 n o i o o 2 where o and p are the observed and predicted values respectively for all nse based criteria the objective functions of were minimized by computing 1 nse which have a range between zero and infinity values for any form of nse range from minus infinity to one while the corresponding ofs range from zero to infinity a perfect fit between simulated and observed values is achieved when all nse are equal to one and corresponding ofs are equal to zero 2 5 2 root mean square error based objective functions in this strategy rmse based objective functions are formulated for streamflow calibration the time series for the entire study period 2003 2014 was divided into three categories representing high medium and low flows using the q25 and q75 thresholds obtained from the observed data to have the same amount of observed and simulated points in each category the simulated time series are divided following the observed time series partitioning then the rmse is computed for each flow category 4 rms e j 1 n j i 1 n j o i p i 2 where j refers to the flow category and nj is the number of observations for each category each minimization of is equal to the computed rmse for each category a perfect fit between observed and simulated values yield an rmse equal to zero 2 6 multi objective optimization algorithm multi objective evolutionary algorithms moeas are population based heuristic search methods that use randomly generated points that move towards an optimal pareto front using evolutionary operators coello coello et al 2007 moeas have been widely implemented during the last two decades for water resources applications efstratiadis and koutsoyiannis 2010 maier et al 2014 reed et al 2013 for instance the non dominated sorting genetic algorithm ii nsga ii deb et al 2002 has been widely used for hydrologic model calibration e g bekele and nicklow 2007 confesor and whittaker 2007 lu et al 2014 shafii and de smedt 2009 the popularity of nsga ii is mainly given by its simplicity modularity parameter less property and good performance for difficult two objective problems deb 2008 however without any extensions or combinations with other approaches the nsga ii by itself has shown shortcomings for solving problems with three or more objectives deb and jain 2014 reed et al 2013 sindhya et al 2013 nsga iii which is based on the nsga ii framework is the evolutionary multi objective optimization algorithm used to implement the two multi objective calibration strategies deb and jain 2014 jain and deb 2014 nsga iii is an elitist reference point based procedure that uses non domination sorting to solve problems with four or more objectives this procedure has also shown good performance solving cases with three objectives seada and deb 2016 the main difference between nsga ii and nsga iii is the niching method which is a procedure to maintain diversity among solutions deb 2001 nsga ii uses crowding distances while nsga iii is reference directions based deb and jain 2014 jain and deb 2014 a reference direction is a line that crosses both the origin and a supplied reference point in the objective space a detailed explanation of the algorithm can be found in deb and jain 2014 and seada and deb 2016 to the best of our knowledge this is the first time that the nsga iii algorithm is used for hydrologic model calibration nsga iii s parameters are the population size equal to the number of reference points assigned here equal to 100 the number of generations assigned here as 500 crossover and mutation probabilities assigned as 0 9 and the reciprocal of the number of calibration parameters respectively and distribution indices for each genetic operation i e simulated binary crossover sbx and polynomial mutation assigned as 10 and 20 respectively the nsga iii implementation used in this study was programmed in java and was provided by the computational optimization and innovation coin laboratory at michigan state university the java code was adapted for this study to have a connection with swat to perform the automatic calibration process the convergence to the optimal pareto front was evaluated using the hypervolume indicator which is a measure of the volume enclosed by a pareto front with respect to a specified reference point auger et al 2009 the optimal pareto front was selected when a steady behavior of the hypervolume indicator was observed across the preceding generations in this study the reference points for each strategy were selected with nse nsesqrt nserel 0 and rmseh rmsem 30 m3 s and rmsel 10 m3 s which approximately correspond to the extreme objective function values visited by the optimization algorithm the hypervolume indicator was computed for the pareto front obtained at the end of each generation using the walking fish group wfg algorithm while et al 2012 2016 and the resulting values for each strategy were normalized to range between 0 and 1 2 7 model evaluation in order to perform the statistical analysis for model evaluation the pareto optimal points are clustered into three groups representing high medium and low flow conditions hence the k mean clustering method is employed for the two calibration strategies in order to identify separate sets of solutions that show better performances for each flow condition the three clusters are identified for each calibration method using the corresponding objective functions presented in section 2 5 thus pareto optimal solutions with the highest nse and nserel values are going to be collected in the high and low flow clusters respectively solutions with balanced nse and nserel values will comprise the medium flow cluster then the simulated streamflow time series from each group are compared with the observed dataset to evaluate whether the estimated mean differences between the simulations and observations are significant to this end the difference of each simulation with respect to the observed dataset is used as response to fit a simple regression with intercept using gls estimation with autoregressive model with lag 1 or ar 1 to account for the serial correlation for the time series the differences are considered significant when the reported p value is less than 0 05 i e 95 confidence interval for the estimated mean of the distribution does not span zero with positive or negative values for the difference indicating over under estimation of the actual observation the process was repeated comparing high medium and low streamflow categories using the q25 and q75 thresholds defined for the rmse based calibration strategy however because the extracted time series for each flow category are irregularly spaced temporally we modeled the difference from the corresponding samples between the observed series and each simulated series three different methods were used normal distribution student s t distribution and gls with a continuous autoregressive model with lag 1 or car 1 then we determined the most appropriated test based on the smallest akaike information criterion aic value finally the hydrologic indices obtained for each pareto optimal solution were also grouped following the same three clusters determined above high medium and low flow conditions for each cluster and hydrologic index the difference between the simulated and observed values were computed and divided by the respective observed values to obtain the relative error then it was determined whether the median relative errors for each group were within or outside the 30 uncertainty bound the procedure comprises of calculating all indices for each solution in the pareto optimal and then taking the median of these values the comparison described above was also performed with no clustering of the pareto optimal solutions in order to evaluate the effect of accounting for all solutions in the median values of the predicted hydrologic indices 3 results and discussion 3 1 convergence and spread of optimal pareto fronts obtained with multi objective calibration strategies the behavior of the normalized hypervolume indicator with respect to the number of generations is presented in fig 4 results show a faster convergence for the nse based strategy compared to the rmse based strategy since the value for the normalized hypervolume indicator decreases faster with a decreasing generation number for the nse based strategy in addition fig 5 shows the final pareto fronts obtained after 349 and 484 generations i e where the steady behavior of the hypervolume indicator starts to be observed using the nse and rmse based calibration strategies respectively the solutions along the nse based optimal pareto front range from 0 22 to 0 76 for nse from 0 37 to 0 73 for nsesqrt and from 0 57 to 0 81 for nserel the optimal pareto front is characterized by two distinct regions with significant tradeoffs one of those regions the low flow cluster shows nserel above 0 77 fig 5a with lower values for nse and nsesqrt spanning from 0 22 to 0 35 and from 0 37 to 0 45 respectively the other region the high and medium flow clusters shows acceptable nse and nsesqrt values i e from 0 73 to 0 76 and from 0 58 to 0 71 respectively while nserel ranges from 0 57 to 0 71 these results indicate that solutions with a very good representation of low discharges provide a poor representation of peak and medium flows guo et al 2014 shafii and de smedt 2009 however the results also suggest that low discharges still exhibit acceptable efficiencies for the best representations of high and medium flows additionally a strong linear correlation r 2 0 91 between the nse and nsesqrt objective functions is observed though it is weaker r 2 0 002 for smaller values for the nserel objective function i e low flow cluster hence it is likely that nse and nsesqrt are providing similar information for model calibration and therefore similar results can be achieved discarding one of these two objective functions with respect to the rmse based optimal pareto front the performance measures range from 8 3 to 20 4 m3 s for rmseh from 2 1 to 4 9 m3 s for rmsem and from 0 81 to 3 6 m3 s for rmsel fig 5b these values indicate that in general the rmse based values range from 30 to 130 of the observed average discharges for each flow category high medium and low defined using the observed q25 and q75 thresholds moreover the rmse based optimal pareto clusters are layered along the rmseh direction this behavior suggests that the high flow cluster can represent some medium and low discharges that are well represented by medium and low flow clusters 3 2 reduction of initial parameter ranges by multi objective calibration strategies the pareto optimal calibrated swat parameter ranges varied according to the multi objective calibration strategy see table 1 in general results suggest that the nse based calibration strategy was able to provide narrower calibrated ranges for model parameters than the rmse based strategy moreover for some parameters the implementation of the k means method to the optimal pareto fronts allowed the identification of different ranges depending on the role of the objective functions in each cluster e g importance of nse and rmseh for high flow and importance of nserel and rmsel for low flow in order to compare the results for calibration parameters we considered whether or not they showed a significant reduction in their ranges after the calibration process i e narrower calibration range with respect to initial calibration range and whether or not they showed similar final ranges in each multi objective calibration strategy regarding the significant reduction in calibration ranges we found that a group of parameters describing mainly hru and groundwater components showed very similar initial and final ranges for both calibration strategies these parameters were biomix biological mixing canmx max canopy storage epco plant uptake gw revap groundwater revap coefficient and revapmn groundwater threshold depth for revap in contrast the groundwater parameter gwqmn threshold depth for flow return reduced in range for both multi objective strategies however the ranges varied depending on the calibration strategy likewise some parameters mainly related to groundwater and routing components such as esco soil evaporation gw delay groundwater delay time alpha bf baseflow factor rchrg dp percolation factor ch n 2 manning coefficient and ch k 2 alluvium hydraulic conductivity had a smaller range after calibration regardless of calibration strategy it is worth noting that gw delay alpha bf and ch n 2 were within different ranges depending on contrasting flow conditions i e high and low flow clusters for example gw delay resulted in a range of 0 0 1 days for high flow conditions and a range of 237 309 days for low flow conditions using the nse based strategy meanwhile cn2 curve number for moisture condition ii and sol awc soil water capacity showed contrasting ranges in high and low flows for the nse based strategy for instance low flow conditions favored positive multiplicative factors for cn2 increasing runoff potential while providing negative multiplicative factors for sol awc reducing the available water capacity of soils for high flow conditions cn2 and sol awc results were the opposite however the rmse based strategy did not provide reduced calibrated ranges for these two parameters finally surlag surface runoff lag showed very similar reduced ranges for all flow conditions in the nse based strategy while providing a reduced range only for high flow condition in the rmse based strategy 3 3 flow duration curves and streamflow time series representation fig 6 presents fdc and hydrographs for the simulation period visual inspection of the simulated and observed curves reveals that the nse based strategy provides less variability than the rmse based strategy represented by the width of light gray bound of solutions for instance q25 and q75 for the nse based strategy ranged from 7 4 to 11 8 m3 s and from 2 6 to 4 3 m3 s respectively fig 6a c meanwhile q25 and q75 for the rmse based strategy ranged from 4 6 to 12 2 m3 s and from 2 6 to 5 9 m3 s respectively fig 6d f this observation suggests that the higher variability for streamflow simulations given by the rmse based calibration strategy is consistent with the wide cn2 0 25 0 23 for high flow and 0 24 0 25 for low flow and sol awc 0 19 0 23 for high flow and 0 22 0 23 for low flow calibrated ranges as presented in table 1 this was supported by previous studies in which these parameters were identified as highly sensitive for streamflow calibration van griensven et al 2006 in contrast in the case of the nse based strategy cn2 and sol awc which were treated as global multipliers see table 1 resulted in narrow calibrated ranges 0 25 0 22 for high flow and 0 246 0 249 for low flow and 0 02 0 25 for high flow and 0 25 0 13 for low flow respectively note that some extreme discharges especially low flow events lie outside all the simulation bounds provided by optimal pareto solutions considered here also some descending limbs and subsequent low flow pulses are poorly simulated in both calibration and validation periods therefore limitations in the representation of extreme low and high flow related indices are expected however different sources of error may play a role here including input data uncertainties and structural inadequacies price et al 2012 in both calibration strategies high flow cluster bounds include most of the observed fdc while shrinking the dispersion of simulated fdcs it is worth noting that the group of simulated fdcs obtained from the nse based calibration strategy splits into two branches at the portion representing discharges exceeded 25 of the time see the left section of the fdc subplots in fig 6a c for the aforementioned calibration strategy only the low flow cluster does not have any simulated fdc representing the corresponding branch for high discharges fig 6c additionally medium flow cluster shows the largest variability in the nse based calibration strategy fig 6b while lower flow cluster does in the rmse based strategy fig 6f 3 4 statistical analysis for predicted streamflow time series we performed the statistical analysis of the mean difference between observed and simulated streamflow time series for the simulation period comprised from 2003 to 2014 most of the results showed that gls with car 1 correlation outperforms other methods in estimating the mean streamflow difference since other methods do not take into account the serial correlation in time series as indicated by smaller aics in a few rare cases the t student model is better than gls car 1 meaning it is even more important to model the heavy tail distribution rather than the serial correlation the percentage of pareto optimal solutions in each cluster without enough evidence of significant difference with a confidence level of 95 table 2 only account for the results obtained with gls with ar 1 or car 1 correlations results for the statistical analysis indicated that in general the nse based strategy provides many more pareto optimal solutions without significant differences compared to the rmse based strategy table 2 also shows that most solutions that belong to the high flow cluster of the pareto front yield good mean representations of overall high and medium streamflow time series values in both multi objective calibration strategies however the percentages for the high flow category do not surpass 47 because of the recurrent under estimation of the mean of time series comprising high discharges surprisingly the medium flow cluster resulted in more solutions with good mean representation of discharges below q25 threshold i e low flow values in both calibration strategies therefore it is possible to infer that solutions with simultaneous good performances based on both nse and nserel pareto front region conformed by high and medium flow clusters see fig 5 lead to sound representation of overall streamflow time series and specific flow conditions which is consistent with the graphical results obtained for fdcs and hydrographs presented in fig 6 3 5 the level of predictability of ecologically relevant hydrologic indices using multi and single objective strategies 3 5 1 multi objective calibration strategies for the period from 2003 to 2014 we computed the relative errors between 171 ecologically relevant hydrologic indices obtained from the pareto optimal solutions and those obtained from the observed hydrograph results were organized according to the eleven hydrologic index groups described in section 2 4 as described in section 2 7 for each group and multi objective calibration strategy the analysis was conducted using the following subsets of pareto optimal solutions complete pareto front i e all points and high medium and low flow clusters obtained with the k means method indices whose median relative errors were outside the 30 bound for all different subsets of pareto optimal solutions are reported in table 3 and described in table s1 hence we considered that these indices were not well represented by the calibration strategies and the model structure employed in this study the results indicated that the nse based calibration strategy was able to provide acceptable representation of 128 indices while the rmse based calibration strategy did the same for 123 indices mostly the rmse based strategy provided more dispersion for indices values than the nse based strategy see table 4 in general the calibrated model has high probability to misrepresent the ecologically relevant hydrologic indices under extreme conditions low and high flows annual hydrograph recession period june to october and the flood pulses that happen during the low flow period fig 6 as apparent in the figure the overlap between the predicted versus the observed data are minimal during the low flow conditions august october and high flow conditions may july this fact is further supported by the high relative errors obtained for the average maximum monthly flows for june july and october i e mh6 mh7 and mh10 and for indices related to perennial streams olden and poff 2003 such as ml14 ml16 ml21 mh10 fl1 dl11 dl16 dh15 ra6 and ra7 table 3 this implies that the calibrated model is not able to accurately estimate key indices for perennial streams additionally it is important to note that extreme high flows may july are also being under predicted as indicated by the statistical analysis performed in section 3 4 as a result the level of error for estimating extreme high flow indices is large this phenomenon has been observed in previous studies while being a subject of current research in hydrological science garcia et al 2017 murphy et al 2013 pfannerstill et al 2014 shrestha et al 2014 regarding the magnitude of flow events both multi objective calibration strategies provided acceptable results for 76 out of 94 indices 81 these strategies were not able to fully represent the variability of flows across months and years and the magnitude mean and median of annual extreme flows for instance under medium flow conditions results in table 3 indicate a poor representation of the variability of some summer and fall monthly flows i e ma29 ma33 which are expressed in terms of the coefficient of variation and the skewness in annual flows i e ma45 represented in terms of the difference between the mean and median annual flows additionally the nse based calibration strategy generated high relative errors for the variability across annual flows expressed in terms of the range or 90th 10th percentiles i e ma42 and ma44 which include extreme flow values for low flow conditions the mean and median of annual minimum flows were not well replicated i e ml14 and ml16 respectively also affecting the results for some indices depending on these values e g low flow index ml15 baseflow index ml19 and variability across annual minimum flows ml21 for high flow conditions both calibration strategies had limitations in representing high flow volumes e g mh21 and the mean maximum monthly flows for some summer and fall months e g mh6 june mh7 july mh10 october regarding the frequency of flow events both multi objective calibration strategies generated acceptable median values for 10 out of 13 indices 77 the indices that were not well represented include the low flow pulse count i e fl1 and some flood frequency indices that use the median and 75th percentile of flows as upper thresholds i e fh5 and fh9 moreover the nse based strategy yielded poor representations of a high flood pulse count index based on a very high upper threshold i e fh4 which uses 7 times median flow while the rmse based strategy produced limited results for high flood pulse count i e fh1 and flood frequency using percentile 25th as threshold i e fh8 for the duration of flow events both calibration strategies resulted in acceptable values for 32 out of 41 indices 78 the results for this group of hydrologic indices were consistent with the poor representation of some indices describing the magnitude and frequency of flow events for instance duration indices related to magnitude and variability of daily and annual minima i e dl1 and dl11 and dl6 dl8 respectively yielded elevated relative errors for both strategies similarly high flow indices with the median and 75th percentile of flows used as thresholds i e dh17 and dh15 respectively produced high relative errors too likewise the nse based strategy presented difficulties representing high flow duration using seven times the median as an upper threshold i e dh19 moreover the rmse based strategy yielded large deviations for the annual minima of 3 day means of daily discharge i e dl2 the mean annual 3 day minimum of daily discharge i e dl12 and indices related to flood duration i e dh20 dh23 because of poor results in the identification of the number of extreme high flow events with respect to the timing of flow events all the four indices were well reproduced using both multi objective calibration strategies however the nse based strategy was not able to produce median relative errors within 30 for the seasonal predictability of non low flow i e tl4 finally regarding the rate of change in flow events both multi objective calibration strategies reproduced 6 out of 9 indices 67 with median relative errors outside 30 for the fall rate i e ra3 and change of flow for increasing and decreasing discharges i e ra6 and ra7 respectively in comparison to previous studies where hydrological modeling was employed to predict ecological relevant hydrologic indices caldwell et al 2015 kiesel et al 2017 murphy et al 2013 shrestha et al 2014 vis et al 2015 the use of the median of different optimal pareto subsets improved the representation of some indicators e g julian day of annual minimum tl1 high flood pulse count fh1 rise rate ra1 reversals ra8 however indices related to the frequency and duration of high and low flow pulses e g fl1 dl16 and dh15 see below were poorly simulated for instance table 4 presents the lowest relative error obtained for a suite of 32 indices included in the software indicators of hydrologic alteration iha the nature conservancy 2009 that were evaluated by shrestha et al 2014 for this group of indices while calibrated solutions can properly reproduce the magnitude duration and timing of different flow conditions with difficulties for dl1 the annual minima of daily flows the frequency and duration of low flood pulses i e fl1 and dl16 respectively the duration of high flow pulses i e dh15 and the fall rate i e ra3 still showed high deviances it is important to note that most of the indices in table 4 were well represented by high flow clusters which are dominated by good performances for nse or rmseh however the misrepresented low flow indices fl1 and dl16 obtained the lowest relative errors using optimal pareto solutions from low flow clusters these clusters have a better description of low flow discharges particularly in the seasonal transition from summer to fall 3 5 2 single objective calibration we obtained the individual model simulations that minimized each nse based objective function from the optimized pareto front obtained after the nsga iii algorithm implementation with their corresponding results for the ecologically relevant hydrologic indices maximum attained values for nse nsesqrt and nserel were 0 76 0 73 and 0 81 respectively some of the indices reported in table 3 were represented within the satisfactory threshold of 30 using some of the single objective calibrated models as expected the optimal nse model provided acceptable results for high flow related indices mean maximum monthly flows for june and july mh6 and mh7 respectively high flow volume using as threshold three times the median annual flow mh22 high flow duration with seven times the median flow as the upper threshold dh19 and the seasonal predictability of non low flows tl4 similarly nsesqrt produced acceptable outcomes for high flood pulse count with seven times the median daily flow as the upper threshold fh4 in addition to mh22 high flow volume dh19 high flow duration and tl4 seasonal predictability also given by the optimal nse model additionally the optimal nsesqrt model provided acceptable results for the mean maximum october flow mh10 which is a key index for perennial streams related to low flows during the fall season meanwhile the optimal nserel model which is insensitive to peak flows and biased towards low flows surprisingly improved the representation of the high flow pulse duration dh15 a key indicator for perennial streams this occurs because nserel significantly reduces the influence of absolute differences during high flow events krause et al 2005 therefore the nserel objective function has the property of benefiting simulations that better describe the overall shape of the hydrograph which can be graphically evinced in fig 6c for the nse based low flow cluster simulations indices presented in table 4 that were poorly represented by the single objective calibration approach using the standard nse include ma19 mean monthly flow for august dl2 annual minimum of 3 day average flow tl1 julian date of annual minimum and ra8 reversals likewise optimal nsesqrt model provided poor representation for ma19 august mean flow dl2 3 day annual minimum ra1 rise rate and r8 reversals in addition indices poorly represented by the nserel optimal model include ma14 ma17 and ma21 ma22 mean monthly flows for march june and october november respectively ml17 seven day minimum flow divided by mean annual daily flows averaged across all years dl5 seasonal magnitude of minimum annual flow and dh2 dh5 magnitude of maximum annual flow from 3 day duration to seasonal which are mainly related with high flow events all the aforementioned indices were well represented by the nse based multi objective calibration strategy see table 4 3 5 3 comparison of single and multi objective calibration approaches in general the two multi objective performed better than the three single objective approaches in calculating the hydrologic indices within a satisfactory range of 30 relative error regarding the single objective approaches the optimal nse and nsesqrt models were able to satisfactorily represent 71 of the indices while the optimal nserel model was able to satisfactorily represent 47 meanwhile the multi objectives nse and rmse based approaches were able to represent 77 and 74 of the indices respectively results revealed that no calibration approach can be considered the best for all indices while they can be complementary to each other however the main advantage of multi objective calibration over the single objective approaches is that they provide a range of solutions for the streamflow and hydrologic indices this range is derived from the pareto optimal front which can be used for uncertainty quantification purposes efstratiadis and koutsoyiannis 2010 4 conclusions this study evaluated the predictability of 167 ecologically relevant hydrologic indices using different approaches for model calibration for this purpose we compared the performance of two multi objective and three single objective formulations employing the nsga iii algorithm and the swat model structure among the multi objective formulations the nse based strategy was found to be the preferred multi objective model calibration approach since 1 it provided the fastest convergence the highest number of well predicted indices and the smallest dispersion in the indices values over the different subsets of pareto optimal simulations 2 the high and medium flow clusters of the pareto front region contained the highest percentages of solutions with no evidence of significant mean difference between simulated and observed time series 3 the same pareto front region contained the highest percentages of solutions with the lowest median relative error and dispersion measure for hydrological indices and 4 the calibration ranges were narrower than the rmse based strategy among the single objective approaches nse and nsesqrt presented similar results while both outperformed the multi objective calibration approaches for estimating high flow indices meanwhile in this study the representation of regime components such as the frequency and duration of low flows and the overall timing and rate of change were in general better using the multi objective calibration approaches however it is recommended to use the nse based single and multi objective calibration approaches together since they provide more reliable information for a larger number of indices in addition we suggest omitting either the standard nse or nsesqrt based objective function because they provide similar information in this study we proposed the use of the nserel performance measure in a multi objective framework in order to improve the representation of low and extreme low flow events while maintaining a good overall representation of other flow conditions however we showed that an nserel objective function improves low flows while highly sacrificing the representation of other flow conditions as opposed to the standard nse for high flows which improves high flows while maintaining acceptable representation of other flow conditions therefore during the calibration process we observed that nserel affects the overall central tendency values e g median and mean flows for different temporal scales e g monthly annual which negatively impacts the representation of low flow indicators e g baseflow index we also demonstrated that the use of different sets of solutions instead of a single optimal solution introduces more flexibility in the predictability of different hydrologic indices of ecological interest moreover we were able to identify a reduced group of poorly represented indices particularly in the transition from summer to fall seasons since this study was performed in a watershed with a single streamflow gauging station it is recommended that future studies should focus on replicating this work in other regions with more streamflow gauging stations and different climatological and physiographical characteristics in which flow patterns are

7098,due to the significant costs associated with stream health monitoring hydrological modeling is widely used to calculate ecologically relevant hydrologic indices to better understand the overall condition of streams within large and diverse watersheds however hydrologic modeling s ability to replicate these indices is limited especially when calibrating models by optimizing a single objective function or when selecting a single optimal solution hence this study evaluates the performance of multi objective model calibration in representing 167 hydrologic indices of ecological interest using the median values of different pareto optimal solution sets for this purpose two strategies based on three nash sutcliffe efficiencies nse and root mean squared error rmse with explicit hydrograph partitioning were implemented additionally the k means clustering technique was employed to define subsets of pareto optimal solutions representing high medium and low flow conditions the soil and water assessment tool swat was set up for the honeyoey creek pine creek watershed located in michigan usa and was calibrated using a single streamflow gauging station and the recently proposed multi objective optimization algorithm non dominated sorting genetic algorithm iii nsga iii the results show that the nse and rmse based calibration strategies can represent 128 and 123 indices within a range of 30 relative errors respectively in addition the results of this study demonstrated that using different set of solutions instead of a single optimal solution introduces more flexibility in the predictability of different hydrologic indices of ecological interest moreover it is suggested that a multi objective calibration approach allows the systematic identification of groups of poorly represented and closely related indices knowing these poorly represented indices would facilitate the formulation of additional objective functions intended to improve model performance or to detect

changing environmental conditions are threatening water security and freshwater biodiversity around the world bunn and arthington 2002 carpenter et al 2011 dudgeon et al 2006 hipsey et al 2015 vörösmarty et al 2010 traditionally stream condition evaluation has used chemical and microbiological constituents as criteria karr and yoder 2004 however the lack of holistic approaches resulted in further degradation of aquatic ecosystems hering et al 2010 jelks et al 2008 to overcome this issue biological assessments were introduced to provide additional insight into the overall ecological integrity of streams us epa 2011 woznicki et al 2016a and therefore can be used for environmental management and decision making biological assessments measure the biota e g fish benthic macroinvertebrates periphyton amphibians within a stream to obtain information regarding its biological integrity us epa 2011 in this context biological integrity is the capacity to support and maintain a balanced integrated and adaptive biological system within the expected structure and function of the natural habitat of a particular region karr 1996 karr and dudley 1981 stream health integrates the physical chemical and biological integrity of a stream which supports living systems that are necessary for human well being karr 1999 maddock 1999 stream health indices are generally based on individual characteristics comprised of species abundance and condition species richness and composition or trophic composition herman and nejadhashemi 2015 however due to limited economic resources it is not possible to measure these characteristics for all streams within a watershed therefore stream health evaluation based on field data is very limited to address this difficulty several modeling approaches have been introduced to extend the available information to ungauged locations woznicki et al 2015 streamflow regime has been recognized as a key determinant for sustaining biodiversity and ecological integrity thus ecologically relevant hydrologic indices are often used as predictors in stream health models besides landscape factors and water quality indicators poff and zimmerman 2010 woznicki et al 2016a prediction of ecologically relevant hydrologic indices include the use of regional statistic approaches carlisle et al 2009 dhungel et al 2016 knight et al 2012 patrick and yuan 2017 sanborn and bledsoe 2006 yang et al 2016 and hydrological modeling caldwell et al 2015 kennen et al 2008 kiesel et al 2017 olsen et al 2013 vis et al 2015 wenger et al 2010 you et al 2014 the use of hydrological models is especially preferred when it is necessary to evaluate the change of stream health driven by modifications in land use environmental conditions or management practices poff et al 2010 shrestha et al 2016 woznicki et al 2016b however hydrologic models ability to replicate ecologically relevant indices is limited vigiak et al 2018 some studies have shown that the use of typical calibration approaches i e single objective based on widely used performance metrics produces poor representations of some streamflow regime characteristics murphy et al 2013 vis et al 2015 for instance while average conditions are generally well predicted low and high flow indices are frequently over or under predicted wenger et al 2010 moreover no model has been found to provide all selected ecologically relevant hydrologic indices within 30 of the observed values caldwell et al 2015 vis et al 2015 therefore several studies have proposed to explicitly include ecologically relevant hydrologic indices into the objective functions for model calibration to improve the overall performance of streamflow regime simulations murphy et al 2013 shrestha et al 2014 vis et al 2015 for instance kiesel et al 2017 and zhang et al 2016 used multi metric i e aggregated objective functions based on a reduced number of ecologically relevant hydrological indices 12 and 16 indices respectively they found that it is possible to obtain better overall representations of streamflow regime compared to objective functions based only on conventional performance metrics e g coefficient of efficiency mean squared errors correlation coefficient however optimal solutions were still unable to effectively represent all hydrological indices individually especially when they are not explicitly included in the objective function formulation kiesel et al 2017 in addition optimal solutions are sensitive to the weights assigned to each ecological relevant hydrological index in the multi metric objective function zhang et al 2016 furthermore different authors have suggested the use of typical performance metrics with transformations e g square root reciprocal or normalization of streamflow values garcia et al 2017 oudin et al 2006 pushpalatha et al 2012 or explicit hydrograph partitioning pfannerstill et al 2014 for model calibration however these approaches have mainly shown improvements in the representation of target flow conditions rather than the overall streamflow regime or have been evaluated using traditional performance metrics instead of ecologically relevant hydrological indices furthermore the aforementioned studies have mainly implemented single objective algorithms for model calibration therefore these previous studies present no integrated perspectives on relationships between different performance metrics or hydrological indices involved in the model calibration process meanwhile multi objective optimization algorithms are very useful for evaluating the tradeoffs between different metrics and objective functions involved in hydrologic model calibration price et al 2012 and can provide sets of solutions able to represent different flow conditions efstratiadis and koutsoyiannis 2010 reed et al 2013 however pareto optimal solutions are not usually evaluated employing ecologically relevant hydrological indices but instead pure hydrological signatures based on for example flow duration curve fdc segments or runoff ratios shafii and tolson 2015 van werkhoven et al 2009 moreover many studies have been more concerned about selecting a best single solution than analyzing the whole set of pareto optimal solutions which could provide better results for overall streamflow regime representation for instance vis et al 2015 attributed high model efficiencies when using the median of several optimum solutions as a more robust prediction for ecologically relevant hydrologic indicators therefore the objective of this study is to identify an objective function best suited for stream health model applications using a multi objective optimization algorithm for model calibration typical performance metrics that represent different flow conditions and explicit hydrograph partitioning are considered in this study for this purpose the soil and water assessment tool swat watershed model and the nsga iii multi objective optimization algorithm are jointly implemented then a set of 167 ecologically relevant hydrologic indices is used for evaluating the ability of the resulting pareto optimal solutions in representing the overall streamflow regime 2 materials and methods two strategies based on a multi objective optimization technique for model calibration were compared to evaluate their abilities to predict ecologically relevant hydrologic indices fig 1 the first multi objective strategy calibrates the model based on three different forms of nash sutcliffe efficiency nse described by krause et al 2005 and pushpalatha et al 2012 that are suitable for evaluating high medium and low flows in the second strategy observed daily flow time series were divided into three categories high medium and low flows using explicit thresholds for low and high flow flows exceeded 75 and 25 of the time respectively for each category an objective function based on the root mean square error rmse was computed pareto optimal solutions for calibrated model parameters were obtained for each multi objective strategy employing the nsga iii algorithm deb and jain 2014 jain and deb 2014 for both strategies the soil and water assessment tool swat arnold et al 2012 neitsch et al 2011 was used to simulate daily streamflow discharge time series for every stream segment and the matlab hydrological index tool abouali et al 2016 was employed to calculate 167 hydrologic indices intended to characterize streamflow regime olden and poff 2003 hydrologic indices were computed for each pareto optimal point obtained from both multi objective strategies and for the observed flow dataset then model outputs and indices were evaluated with respect to the observed values using statistical analysis for this purpose pareto optimal points for each multi objective strategy were clustered into three groups using the k means method arthur and vassilvitskii 2007 while generalized least square gls estimation was used to analyze the differences between the simulated and observed mean streamflow values the median errors between the hydrologic indices based on pareto optimal solutions and observed time series were evaluated with respect to the 30 uncertainty bound for the observed values as reported by previous studies caldwell et al 2015 kennard et al 2009 vis et al 2015 results were compared with the optimal solutions from a single objective approach in which the objective functions are based on nse as recommended by moriasi et al 2015 for evaluation of hydrological models moreover given that both nse and rmse are computed using the sum of the square differences between observed and simulated values and nse is non dimensional only nse was considered for the single objective model calibration 2 1 study area in order to perform environmental flow analysis it is desirable to identify areas where urbanization is limited streamflow is not regulated or its alteration is negligible and observed discharge records are available for almost all the studied period olden and poff 2003 the honeyoey creek pine creek watershed with a drainage area of 1010 km2 meets all the criteria because urbanization is less than 4 streamflow regulation is limited and observed streamflow data for the period is complete the study area is located in the saginaw bay watershed in east central michigan fig 2 which is the largest watershed in the state and is identified as an area of concern by the us environmental protection agency due to pollution from sediment and nutrients that resulted in eutrophication fish habitat degradation and loss of recreational values among others epa 2015 the watershed has an average slope of 1 9 ranging from 12 39 in the headwaters to 0 1 4 in the lowlands ned 2015 the region has a temperate climate with distinct seasons andresen and winkler 2009 the average annual rainfall is about 840 mm for the period 1981 2010 noaa 2017 however the precipitation regime is bimodal with maxima in may and september and minima in february and july mean annual air temperature in the watershed is 9 c with a minimum monthly temperature of 9 c in january and a maximum monthly temperature of 28 c in july the dominant land use is agriculture covering about 50 of the watershed followed by forests 24 wetlands 16 and pasturelands 7 nass 2012 over 60 of the river network s riparian vegetation has not been altered by human activities the dominant soil textures are loamy sand sandy loam loam clay loam and sand which cover about 30 26 20 and 11 of the study area respectively nrcs 2014 the average flow is about 10 3 m3 s at the outlet of the watershed high flows occur between march and may as a result of snow melting and high precipitation while low flows occur between july and october during summer and fall seasons usgs 2017 high flows considered in this study as those that are exceeded at most 25 of the time q25 have magnitudes above 11 3 m3 s while low flows are defined as those with values below 3 9 m3 s which is the discharge exceeded 75 of the time q75 2 2 data collection datasets required for the hydrologic modeling comprise topography land use soil properties climate and observed streamflow discharge the national elevation dataset from the us geological survey usgs with 30 m spatial resolution was used to represent the topography of the watershed ned 2015 the land use characteristics were obtained from the cropland data layer developed by the national agricultural statistics service of the us department of agriculture usda nass with 30 m spatial resolution nass 2012 the soil properties were compiled from the natural resources conservation service s nrcs soil survey geographic ssurgo database at a scale of 1 250 000 nrcs 2014 daily time series for precipitation and temperature from 2001 through 2014 were obtained from two weather stations that belong to the national climatic data center noaa 2017 relative humidity solar radiation and wind speed time series for the same time span were provided by the stochastic weather generator wxgen neitsch et al 2011 included in swat daily streamflow discharges between 2003 and 2014 were obtained from the pine river near midland gauging station id 04155500 usgs 2017 2 3 swat model description the soil and water assessment tool swat version 2012 rev 614 is a semi distributed continuous time process based hydrological model which simulates water flow sediment transport and water quality processes in watersheds arnold et al 1998 swat divides a watershed into subwatersheds that are further discretized into multiple units with homogeneous land use slope and soil characteristics known as hydrologic response units hru the main processes in swat include snow accumulation and melting evapotranspiration infiltration percolation losses surface runoff channel routing and groundwater flows neitsch et al 2011 swat is used in this study for daily flow simulation between 2003 and 2014 for all 749 defined stream segments in the honeyoey creek pine creek watershed fifteen parameters were selected for model calibration whose description and ranges of variation are presented in table 1 the calibration period was defined between 2003 and 2008 while the validation period spans between 2009 and 2014 meanwhile two years of warm up period 2001 2002 were considered to stabilize initial conditions of soil water cibin et al 2010 2 4 hydrologic indices the 171 hydrologic indices reported by olden and poff 2003 were evaluated for all pareto optimal solutions after completing each multi objective model calibration for this study we discarded four indices related to the frequency and duration of zero flow days and low flow spells which were all equal to zero in this case then the remaining 167 hydrologic indices were compared with the respective indices for the observed dataset including the calibration and validation periods the evaluated hydrologic indices characterize the streamflow regime in terms of magnitude frequency duration timing and rate of change of flows poff et al 1997 richter et al 1996 for a given daily time series these indices were classified into eleven groups magnitude for low ml average ma and high mh flow conditions frequency for low fl and high fh flow conditions duration for low dl and high dh flow conditions timing for low tl average ta and high th flow conditions and rate of change for average ra flow conditions the hydrologic indices were computed using the matlab hydrological index tool mhit which has shown better computing performances in comparison to other available packages when handling high number of datasets abouali et al 2016 2 5 objective functions in this study we contrast the ability of two commonly used procedures in representing a wide number of the streamflow metrics related to environmental flows indicated in section 2 4 each procedure refers to a specific three dimensional objective space fig 3 further details are presented next 2 5 1 nash sutcliffe efficiency based objective functions in this strategy nse based objective functions are formulated to represent different parts of the observed hydrograph krause et al 2005 and pushpalatha et al 2012 indicated that standard nse eq 1 nash and sutcliffe 1970 is very sensitive to high flows on continuous simulations given that the differences between simulated and observed values are squared meanwhile nse calculated on root squared transformed flows eq 2 nsesqrt has been found to provide a more balanced performance because the errors are more equally distributed on high and low flow portions of the hydrograph oudin et al 2006 pushpalatha et al 2012 additionally relative nse eq 3 nserel described by krause et al 2005 suppresses the influence of peak flows on the efficiency computation making it more sensitive to low flows pushpalatha et al 2012 showed that nse computed on the reciprocal of flow values inverse transformed flows is better suited for low flow conditions focusing on the 20 lowest flows on average however in this study we decided to use the nserel given that some of the ecologically relevant hydrologic indices e g low flow index base flow indices indices based on moving averages computed by mhit for low flows are based also on overall flow values therefore nse nsesqrt and nserel were used to represent high medium and low flows respectively 1 nse 1 i 1 n o i p i 2 i 1 n o i o 2 2 ns e sqrt 1 i 1 n o i p i 2 i 1 n o i o 2 3 ns e rel 1 i 1 n o i p i o i 2 i 1 n o i o o 2 where o and p are the observed and predicted values respectively for all nse based criteria the objective functions of were minimized by computing 1 nse which have a range between zero and infinity values for any form of nse range from minus infinity to one while the corresponding ofs range from zero to infinity a perfect fit between simulated and observed values is achieved when all nse are equal to one and corresponding ofs are equal to zero 2 5 2 root mean square error based objective functions in this strategy rmse based objective functions are formulated for streamflow calibration the time series for the entire study period 2003 2014 was divided into three categories representing high medium and low flows using the q25 and q75 thresholds obtained from the observed data to have the same amount of observed and simulated points in each category the simulated time series are divided following the observed time series partitioning then the rmse is computed for each flow category 4 rms e j 1 n j i 1 n j o i p i 2 where j refers to the flow category and nj is the number of observations for each category each minimization of is equal to the computed rmse for each category a perfect fit between observed and simulated values yield an rmse equal to zero 2 6 multi objective optimization algorithm multi objective evolutionary algorithms moeas are population based heuristic search methods that use randomly generated points that move towards an optimal pareto front using evolutionary operators coello coello et al 2007 moeas have been widely implemented during the last two decades for water resources applications efstratiadis and koutsoyiannis 2010 maier et al 2014 reed et al 2013 for instance the non dominated sorting genetic algorithm ii nsga ii deb et al 2002 has been widely used for hydrologic model calibration e g bekele and nicklow 2007 confesor and whittaker 2007 lu et al 2014 shafii and de smedt 2009 the popularity of nsga ii is mainly given by its simplicity modularity parameter less property and good performance for difficult two objective problems deb 2008 however without any extensions or combinations with other approaches the nsga ii by itself has shown shortcomings for solving problems with three or more objectives deb and jain 2014 reed et al 2013 sindhya et al 2013 nsga iii which is based on the nsga ii framework is the evolutionary multi objective optimization algorithm used to implement the two multi objective calibration strategies deb and jain 2014 jain and deb 2014 nsga iii is an elitist reference point based procedure that uses non domination sorting to solve problems with four or more objectives this procedure has also shown good performance solving cases with three objectives seada and deb 2016 the main difference between nsga ii and nsga iii is the niching method which is a procedure to maintain diversity among solutions deb 2001 nsga ii uses crowding distances while nsga iii is reference directions based deb and jain 2014 jain and deb 2014 a reference direction is a line that crosses both the origin and a supplied reference point in the objective space a detailed explanation of the algorithm can be found in deb and jain 2014 and seada and deb 2016 to the best of our knowledge this is the first time that the nsga iii algorithm is used for hydrologic model calibration nsga iii s parameters are the population size equal to the number of reference points assigned here equal to 100 the number of generations assigned here as 500 crossover and mutation probabilities assigned as 0 9 and the reciprocal of the number of calibration parameters respectively and distribution indices for each genetic operation i e simulated binary crossover sbx and polynomial mutation assigned as 10 and 20 respectively the nsga iii implementation used in this study was programmed in java and was provided by the computational optimization and innovation coin laboratory at michigan state university the java code was adapted for this study to have a connection with swat to perform the automatic calibration process the convergence to the optimal pareto front was evaluated using the hypervolume indicator which is a measure of the volume enclosed by a pareto front with respect to a specified reference point auger et al 2009 the optimal pareto front was selected when a steady behavior of the hypervolume indicator was observed across the preceding generations in this study the reference points for each strategy were selected with nse nsesqrt nserel 0 and rmseh rmsem 30 m3 s and rmsel 10 m3 s which approximately correspond to the extreme objective function values visited by the optimization algorithm the hypervolume indicator was computed for the pareto front obtained at the end of each generation using the walking fish group wfg algorithm while et al 2012 2016 and the resulting values for each strategy were normalized to range between 0 and 1 2 7 model evaluation in order to perform the statistical analysis for model evaluation the pareto optimal points are clustered into three groups representing high medium and low flow conditions hence the k mean clustering method is employed for the two calibration strategies in order to identify separate sets of solutions that show better performances for each flow condition the three clusters are identified for each calibration method using the corresponding objective functions presented in section 2 5 thus pareto optimal solutions with the highest nse and nserel values are going to be collected in the high and low flow clusters respectively solutions with balanced nse and nserel values will comprise the medium flow cluster then the simulated streamflow time series from each group are compared with the observed dataset to evaluate whether the estimated mean differences between the simulations and observations are significant to this end the difference of each simulation with respect to the observed dataset is used as response to fit a simple regression with intercept using gls estimation with autoregressive model with lag 1 or ar 1 to account for the serial correlation for the time series the differences are considered significant when the reported p value is less than 0 05 i e 95 confidence interval for the estimated mean of the distribution does not span zero with positive or negative values for the difference indicating over under estimation of the actual observation the process was repeated comparing high medium and low streamflow categories using the q25 and q75 thresholds defined for the rmse based calibration strategy however because the extracted time series for each flow category are irregularly spaced temporally we modeled the difference from the corresponding samples between the observed series and each simulated series three different methods were used normal distribution student s t distribution and gls with a continuous autoregressive model with lag 1 or car 1 then we determined the most appropriated test based on the smallest akaike information criterion aic value finally the hydrologic indices obtained for each pareto optimal solution were also grouped following the same three clusters determined above high medium and low flow conditions for each cluster and hydrologic index the difference between the simulated and observed values were computed and divided by the respective observed values to obtain the relative error then it was determined whether the median relative errors for each group were within or outside the 30 uncertainty bound the procedure comprises of calculating all indices for each solution in the pareto optimal and then taking the median of these values the comparison described above was also performed with no clustering of the pareto optimal solutions in order to evaluate the effect of accounting for all solutions in the median values of the predicted hydrologic indices 3 results and discussion 3 1 convergence and spread of optimal pareto fronts obtained with multi objective calibration strategies the behavior of the normalized hypervolume indicator with respect to the number of generations is presented in fig 4 results show a faster convergence for the nse based strategy compared to the rmse based strategy since the value for the normalized hypervolume indicator decreases faster with a decreasing generation number for the nse based strategy in addition fig 5 shows the final pareto fronts obtained after 349 and 484 generations i e where the steady behavior of the hypervolume indicator starts to be observed using the nse and rmse based calibration strategies respectively the solutions along the nse based optimal pareto front range from 0 22 to 0 76 for nse from 0 37 to 0 73 for nsesqrt and from 0 57 to 0 81 for nserel the optimal pareto front is characterized by two distinct regions with significant tradeoffs one of those regions the low flow cluster shows nserel above 0 77 fig 5a with lower values for nse and nsesqrt spanning from 0 22 to 0 35 and from 0 37 to 0 45 respectively the other region the high and medium flow clusters shows acceptable nse and nsesqrt values i e from 0 73 to 0 76 and from 0 58 to 0 71 respectively while nserel ranges from 0 57 to 0 71 these results indicate that solutions with a very good representation of low discharges provide a poor representation of peak and medium flows guo et al 2014 shafii and de smedt 2009 however the results also suggest that low discharges still exhibit acceptable efficiencies for the best representations of high and medium flows additionally a strong linear correlation r 2 0 91 between the nse and nsesqrt objective functions is observed though it is weaker r 2 0 002 for smaller values for the nserel objective function i e low flow cluster hence it is likely that nse and nsesqrt are providing similar information for model calibration and therefore similar results can be achieved discarding one of these two objective functions with respect to the rmse based optimal pareto front the performance measures range from 8 3 to 20 4 m3 s for rmseh from 2 1 to 4 9 m3 s for rmsem and from 0 81 to 3 6 m3 s for rmsel fig 5b these values indicate that in general the rmse based values range from 30 to 130 of the observed average discharges for each flow category high medium and low defined using the observed q25 and q75 thresholds moreover the rmse based optimal pareto clusters are layered along the rmseh direction this behavior suggests that the high flow cluster can represent some medium and low discharges that are well represented by medium and low flow clusters 3 2 reduction of initial parameter ranges by multi objective calibration strategies the pareto optimal calibrated swat parameter ranges varied according to the multi objective calibration strategy see table 1 in general results suggest that the nse based calibration strategy was able to provide narrower calibrated ranges for model parameters than the rmse based strategy moreover for some parameters the implementation of the k means method to the optimal pareto fronts allowed the identification of different ranges depending on the role of the objective functions in each cluster e g importance of nse and rmseh for high flow and importance of nserel and rmsel for low flow in order to compare the results for calibration parameters we considered whether or not they showed a significant reduction in their ranges after the calibration process i e narrower calibration range with respect to initial calibration range and whether or not they showed similar final ranges in each multi objective calibration strategy regarding the significant reduction in calibration ranges we found that a group of parameters describing mainly hru and groundwater components showed very similar initial and final ranges for both calibration strategies these parameters were biomix biological mixing canmx max canopy storage epco plant uptake gw revap groundwater revap coefficient and revapmn groundwater threshold depth for revap in contrast the groundwater parameter gwqmn threshold depth for flow return reduced in range for both multi objective strategies however the ranges varied depending on the calibration strategy likewise some parameters mainly related to groundwater and routing components such as esco soil evaporation gw delay groundwater delay time alpha bf baseflow factor rchrg dp percolation factor ch n 2 manning coefficient and ch k 2 alluvium hydraulic conductivity had a smaller range after calibration regardless of calibration strategy it is worth noting that gw delay alpha bf and ch n 2 were within different ranges depending on contrasting flow conditions i e high and low flow clusters for example gw delay resulted in a range of 0 0 1 days for high flow conditions and a range of 237 309 days for low flow conditions using the nse based strategy meanwhile cn2 curve number for moisture condition ii and sol awc soil water capacity showed contrasting ranges in high and low flows for the nse based strategy for instance low flow conditions favored positive multiplicative factors for cn2 increasing runoff potential while providing negative multiplicative factors for sol awc reducing the available water capacity of soils for high flow conditions cn2 and sol awc results were the opposite however the rmse based strategy did not provide reduced calibrated ranges for these two parameters finally surlag surface runoff lag showed very similar reduced ranges for all flow conditions in the nse based strategy while providing a reduced range only for high flow condition in the rmse based strategy 3 3 flow duration curves and streamflow time series representation fig 6 presents fdc and hydrographs for the simulation period visual inspection of the simulated and observed curves reveals that the nse based strategy provides less variability than the rmse based strategy represented by the width of light gray bound of solutions for instance q25 and q75 for the nse based strategy ranged from 7 4 to 11 8 m3 s and from 2 6 to 4 3 m3 s respectively fig 6a c meanwhile q25 and q75 for the rmse based strategy ranged from 4 6 to 12 2 m3 s and from 2 6 to 5 9 m3 s respectively fig 6d f this observation suggests that the higher variability for streamflow simulations given by the rmse based calibration strategy is consistent with the wide cn2 0 25 0 23 for high flow and 0 24 0 25 for low flow and sol awc 0 19 0 23 for high flow and 0 22 0 23 for low flow calibrated ranges as presented in table 1 this was supported by previous studies in which these parameters were identified as highly sensitive for streamflow calibration van griensven et al 2006 in contrast in the case of the nse based strategy cn2 and sol awc which were treated as global multipliers see table 1 resulted in narrow calibrated ranges 0 25 0 22 for high flow and 0 246 0 249 for low flow and 0 02 0 25 for high flow and 0 25 0 13 for low flow respectively note that some extreme discharges especially low flow events lie outside all the simulation bounds provided by optimal pareto solutions considered here also some descending limbs and subsequent low flow pulses are poorly simulated in both calibration and validation periods therefore limitations in the representation of extreme low and high flow related indices are expected however different sources of error may play a role here including input data uncertainties and structural inadequacies price et al 2012 in both calibration strategies high flow cluster bounds include most of the observed fdc while shrinking the dispersion of simulated fdcs it is worth noting that the group of simulated fdcs obtained from the nse based calibration strategy splits into two branches at the portion representing discharges exceeded 25 of the time see the left section of the fdc subplots in fig 6a c for the aforementioned calibration strategy only the low flow cluster does not have any simulated fdc representing the corresponding branch for high discharges fig 6c additionally medium flow cluster shows the largest variability in the nse based calibration strategy fig 6b while lower flow cluster does in the rmse based strategy fig 6f 3 4 statistical analysis for predicted streamflow time series we performed the statistical analysis of the mean difference between observed and simulated streamflow time series for the simulation period comprised from 2003 to 2014 most of the results showed that gls with car 1 correlation outperforms other methods in estimating the mean streamflow difference since other methods do not take into account the serial correlation in time series as indicated by smaller aics in a few rare cases the t student model is better than gls car 1 meaning it is even more important to model the heavy tail distribution rather than the serial correlation the percentage of pareto optimal solutions in each cluster without enough evidence of significant difference with a confidence level of 95 table 2 only account for the results obtained with gls with ar 1 or car 1 correlations results for the statistical analysis indicated that in general the nse based strategy provides many more pareto optimal solutions without significant differences compared to the rmse based strategy table 2 also shows that most solutions that belong to the high flow cluster of the pareto front yield good mean representations of overall high and medium streamflow time series values in both multi objective calibration strategies however the percentages for the high flow category do not surpass 47 because of the recurrent under estimation of the mean of time series comprising high discharges surprisingly the medium flow cluster resulted in more solutions with good mean representation of discharges below q25 threshold i e low flow values in both calibration strategies therefore it is possible to infer that solutions with simultaneous good performances based on both nse and nserel pareto front region conformed by high and medium flow clusters see fig 5 lead to sound representation of overall streamflow time series and specific flow conditions which is consistent with the graphical results obtained for fdcs and hydrographs presented in fig 6 3 5 the level of predictability of ecologically relevant hydrologic indices using multi and single objective strategies 3 5 1 multi objective calibration strategies for the period from 2003 to 2014 we computed the relative errors between 171 ecologically relevant hydrologic indices obtained from the pareto optimal solutions and those obtained from the observed hydrograph results were organized according to the eleven hydrologic index groups described in section 2 4 as described in section 2 7 for each group and multi objective calibration strategy the analysis was conducted using the following subsets of pareto optimal solutions complete pareto front i e all points and high medium and low flow clusters obtained with the k means method indices whose median relative errors were outside the 30 bound for all different subsets of pareto optimal solutions are reported in table 3 and described in table s1 hence we considered that these indices were not well represented by the calibration strategies and the model structure employed in this study the results indicated that the nse based calibration strategy was able to provide acceptable representation of 128 indices while the rmse based calibration strategy did the same for 123 indices mostly the rmse based strategy provided more dispersion for indices values than the nse based strategy see table 4 in general the calibrated model has high probability to misrepresent the ecologically relevant hydrologic indices under extreme conditions low and high flows annual hydrograph recession period june to october and the flood pulses that happen during the low flow period fig 6 as apparent in the figure the overlap between the predicted versus the observed data are minimal during the low flow conditions august october and high flow conditions may july this fact is further supported by the high relative errors obtained for the average maximum monthly flows for june july and october i e mh6 mh7 and mh10 and for indices related to perennial streams olden and poff 2003 such as ml14 ml16 ml21 mh10 fl1 dl11 dl16 dh15 ra6 and ra7 table 3 this implies that the calibrated model is not able to accurately estimate key indices for perennial streams additionally it is important to note that extreme high flows may july are also being under predicted as indicated by the statistical analysis performed in section 3 4 as a result the level of error for estimating extreme high flow indices is large this phenomenon has been observed in previous studies while being a subject of current research in hydrological science garcia et al 2017 murphy et al 2013 pfannerstill et al 2014 shrestha et al 2014 regarding the magnitude of flow events both multi objective calibration strategies provided acceptable results for 76 out of 94 indices 81 these strategies were not able to fully represent the variability of flows across months and years and the magnitude mean and median of annual extreme flows for instance under medium flow conditions results in table 3 indicate a poor representation of the variability of some summer and fall monthly flows i e ma29 ma33 which are expressed in terms of the coefficient of variation and the skewness in annual flows i e ma45 represented in terms of the difference between the mean and median annual flows additionally the nse based calibration strategy generated high relative errors for the variability across annual flows expressed in terms of the range or 90th 10th percentiles i e ma42 and ma44 which include extreme flow values for low flow conditions the mean and median of annual minimum flows were not well replicated i e ml14 and ml16 respectively also affecting the results for some indices depending on these values e g low flow index ml15 baseflow index ml19 and variability across annual minimum flows ml21 for high flow conditions both calibration strategies had limitations in representing high flow volumes e g mh21 and the mean maximum monthly flows for some summer and fall months e g mh6 june mh7 july mh10 october regarding the frequency of flow events both multi objective calibration strategies generated acceptable median values for 10 out of 13 indices 77 the indices that were not well represented include the low flow pulse count i e fl1 and some flood frequency indices that use the median and 75th percentile of flows as upper thresholds i e fh5 and fh9 moreover the nse based strategy yielded poor representations of a high flood pulse count index based on a very high upper threshold i e fh4 which uses 7 times median flow while the rmse based strategy produced limited results for high flood pulse count i e fh1 and flood frequency using percentile 25th as threshold i e fh8 for the duration of flow events both calibration strategies resulted in acceptable values for 32 out of 41 indices 78 the results for this group of hydrologic indices were consistent with the poor representation of some indices describing the magnitude and frequency of flow events for instance duration indices related to magnitude and variability of daily and annual minima i e dl1 and dl11 and dl6 dl8 respectively yielded elevated relative errors for both strategies similarly high flow indices with the median and 75th percentile of flows used as thresholds i e dh17 and dh15 respectively produced high relative errors too likewise the nse based strategy presented difficulties representing high flow duration using seven times the median as an upper threshold i e dh19 moreover the rmse based strategy yielded large deviations for the annual minima of 3 day means of daily discharge i e dl2 the mean annual 3 day minimum of daily discharge i e dl12 and indices related to flood duration i e dh20 dh23 because of poor results in the identification of the number of extreme high flow events with respect to the timing of flow events all the four indices were well reproduced using both multi objective calibration strategies however the nse based strategy was not able to produce median relative errors within 30 for the seasonal predictability of non low flow i e tl4 finally regarding the rate of change in flow events both multi objective calibration strategies reproduced 6 out of 9 indices 67 with median relative errors outside 30 for the fall rate i e ra3 and change of flow for increasing and decreasing discharges i e ra6 and ra7 respectively in comparison to previous studies where hydrological modeling was employed to predict ecological relevant hydrologic indices caldwell et al 2015 kiesel et al 2017 murphy et al 2013 shrestha et al 2014 vis et al 2015 the use of the median of different optimal pareto subsets improved the representation of some indicators e g julian day of annual minimum tl1 high flood pulse count fh1 rise rate ra1 reversals ra8 however indices related to the frequency and duration of high and low flow pulses e g fl1 dl16 and dh15 see below were poorly simulated for instance table 4 presents the lowest relative error obtained for a suite of 32 indices included in the software indicators of hydrologic alteration iha the nature conservancy 2009 that were evaluated by shrestha et al 2014 for this group of indices while calibrated solutions can properly reproduce the magnitude duration and timing of different flow conditions with difficulties for dl1 the annual minima of daily flows the frequency and duration of low flood pulses i e fl1 and dl16 respectively the duration of high flow pulses i e dh15 and the fall rate i e ra3 still showed high deviances it is important to note that most of the indices in table 4 were well represented by high flow clusters which are dominated by good performances for nse or rmseh however the misrepresented low flow indices fl1 and dl16 obtained the lowest relative errors using optimal pareto solutions from low flow clusters these clusters have a better description of low flow discharges particularly in the seasonal transition from summer to fall 3 5 2 single objective calibration we obtained the individual model simulations that minimized each nse based objective function from the optimized pareto front obtained after the nsga iii algorithm implementation with their corresponding results for the ecologically relevant hydrologic indices maximum attained values for nse nsesqrt and nserel were 0 76 0 73 and 0 81 respectively some of the indices reported in table 3 were represented within the satisfactory threshold of 30 using some of the single objective calibrated models as expected the optimal nse model provided acceptable results for high flow related indices mean maximum monthly flows for june and july mh6 and mh7 respectively high flow volume using as threshold three times the median annual flow mh22 high flow duration with seven times the median flow as the upper threshold dh19 and the seasonal predictability of non low flows tl4 similarly nsesqrt produced acceptable outcomes for high flood pulse count with seven times the median daily flow as the upper threshold fh4 in addition to mh22 high flow volume dh19 high flow duration and tl4 seasonal predictability also given by the optimal nse model additionally the optimal nsesqrt model provided acceptable results for the mean maximum october flow mh10 which is a key index for perennial streams related to low flows during the fall season meanwhile the optimal nserel model which is insensitive to peak flows and biased towards low flows surprisingly improved the representation of the high flow pulse duration dh15 a key indicator for perennial streams this occurs because nserel significantly reduces the influence of absolute differences during high flow events krause et al 2005 therefore the nserel objective function has the property of benefiting simulations that better describe the overall shape of the hydrograph which can be graphically evinced in fig 6c for the nse based low flow cluster simulations indices presented in table 4 that were poorly represented by the single objective calibration approach using the standard nse include ma19 mean monthly flow for august dl2 annual minimum of 3 day average flow tl1 julian date of annual minimum and ra8 reversals likewise optimal nsesqrt model provided poor representation for ma19 august mean flow dl2 3 day annual minimum ra1 rise rate and r8 reversals in addition indices poorly represented by the nserel optimal model include ma14 ma17 and ma21 ma22 mean monthly flows for march june and october november respectively ml17 seven day minimum flow divided by mean annual daily flows averaged across all years dl5 seasonal magnitude of minimum annual flow and dh2 dh5 magnitude of maximum annual flow from 3 day duration to seasonal which are mainly related with high flow events all the aforementioned indices were well represented by the nse based multi objective calibration strategy see table 4 3 5 3 comparison of single and multi objective calibration approaches in general the two multi objective performed better than the three single objective approaches in calculating the hydrologic indices within a satisfactory range of 30 relative error regarding the single objective approaches the optimal nse and nsesqrt models were able to satisfactorily represent 71 of the indices while the optimal nserel model was able to satisfactorily represent 47 meanwhile the multi objectives nse and rmse based approaches were able to represent 77 and 74 of the indices respectively results revealed that no calibration approach can be considered the best for all indices while they can be complementary to each other however the main advantage of multi objective calibration over the single objective approaches is that they provide a range of solutions for the streamflow and hydrologic indices this range is derived from the pareto optimal front which can be used for uncertainty quantification purposes efstratiadis and koutsoyiannis 2010 4 conclusions this study evaluated the predictability of 167 ecologically relevant hydrologic indices using different approaches for model calibration for this purpose we compared the performance of two multi objective and three single objective formulations employing the nsga iii algorithm and the swat model structure among the multi objective formulations the nse based strategy was found to be the preferred multi objective model calibration approach since 1 it provided the fastest convergence the highest number of well predicted indices and the smallest dispersion in the indices values over the different subsets of pareto optimal simulations 2 the high and medium flow clusters of the pareto front region contained the highest percentages of solutions with no evidence of significant mean difference between simulated and observed time series 3 the same pareto front region contained the highest percentages of solutions with the lowest median relative error and dispersion measure for hydrological indices and 4 the calibration ranges were narrower than the rmse based strategy among the single objective approaches nse and nsesqrt presented similar results while both outperformed the multi objective calibration approaches for estimating high flow indices meanwhile in this study the representation of regime components such as the frequency and duration of low flows and the overall timing and rate of change were in general better using the multi objective calibration approaches however it is recommended to use the nse based single and multi objective calibration approaches together since they provide more reliable information for a larger number of indices in addition we suggest omitting either the standard nse or nsesqrt based objective function because they provide similar information in this study we proposed the use of the nserel performance measure in a multi objective framework in order to improve the representation of low and extreme low flow events while maintaining a good overall representation of other flow conditions however we showed that an nserel objective function improves low flows while highly sacrificing the representation of other flow conditions as opposed to the standard nse for high flows which improves high flows while maintaining acceptable representation of other flow conditions therefore during the calibration process we observed that nserel affects the overall central tendency values e g median and mean flows for different temporal scales e g monthly annual which negatively impacts the representation of low flow indicators e g baseflow index we also demonstrated that the use of different sets of solutions instead of a single optimal solution introduces more flexibility in the predictability of different hydrologic indices of ecological interest moreover we were able to identify a reduced group of poorly represented indices particularly in the transition from summer to fall seasons since this study was performed in a watershed with a single streamflow gauging station it is recommended that future studies should focus on replicating this work in other regions with more streamflow gauging stations and different climatological and physiographical characteristics in which flow patterns are

7099,coastal bays with fresh submarine groundwater discharge sgd have been found to provide a favorable environment to shellfish e g oysters significant variability in the spatial distribution and magnitude of sgd may occur because of subsurface heterogeneity we investigated the relationship between stratigraphic controls i e paleovalley systems and the spatial distribution of sgd in relation to oyster reefs in copano bay south texas major oyster reefs have been shown to be oriented perpendicular to shore along interfluves and near paleovalley margins a novel combination approach of radioactive geochemical tracers stable isotopes geophysical and petrophysical techniques were used to identify estuarine depositional environments for individual hydrogeologic characterization and evaluation of sgd distribution with implications to ecological features such as oyster reefs a 1 km2 area within a paleovalley system in copano bay yielded discernible differences in sediment type apparent resistivity and sgd rates among four different depositional environments paleovalley paleovalley margin oyster reef and interfluve electrical resistivity tomography revealed a direct connection between the oyster reef and the underlying more permeable interfluve and the presence of a fresher sgd component in the subsurface measurements of sgd from stationary and mobile continuous radon 222 surveys across each depositional environment showed that by and large areas in proximity to reefs have larger sgd rates 62 6 11 3 cm d in january and 28 7 10 8 cm d in july when compared to paleovalleys 31 9 8 9 cm d in january and 19 5 7 2 cm d in july the role of depositional environments as hydrologic controls on sgd to oyster reefs revealed in this study is further confirmed by significant differences in stable and radioactive isotopes observed over small spatial scales offshore when compared to the entire estuary although constant mixing and radon 222 degassing of bay waters are likely altering the relationships between the different depositional environments and magnitude of sgd this study provides an improved understanding of possible pathways of freshwater and solute inputs to oyster reefs for more informed decisions on reef restoration efforts keywords oyster reefs copano bay texas submarine groundwater discharge sgd electrical resistivity paleovalley system heterogeneity 1 introduction numerous factors control the distribution of oysters such as the existence of a hard substrate for settlement during the larval stage dellapenna et al 2008 twichell et al 2010 and the substrate has to be free of significant sedimentation to avoid burial eastern oyster biological review team 2007 most relevant to this study are the physical and chemical characteristics of water that influence oyster survivability studies have demonstrated that oyster efficiency i e growth rate is greatest where adequate nutrient supply is available livingston et al 2000 salinity falls between 14 and 28 practical salinity scale the averaged salinity in the global ocean of 35 is used as the reference millero 1993 and temperature ranges between 20 and 30 c heilmayer et al 2008 coastal areas with fresh sgd have been found to provide a favorable environment to oysters given that they can be characterized by brackish and more temperature conservative profiles when compared to areas not influenced by groundwater wang et al 2015 submarine groundwater discharge sgd has been identified as a key source of land derived nutrients and plays a significant role in the delivery of solutes to surface water kroeger and charette 2008 previous studies have shown that geologic heterogeneity can influence the spatial distribution quantity and direction of sgd mulligan et al 2007 russoniello et al 2013 including the occurrence of preferential flowpaths breier et al 2005 uddameri et al 2014 understanding of these hydrogeologic characteristics is important because non conservative nutrients i e nitrogen phosphorous iron for instance can be retained or go through important biogeochemical alterations in the subsurface as a result of different water residence times associated with geologic heterogeneities charette 2007 sawyer et al 2014 there are numerous studies that have focused on sgd as a source of nutrients krest et al 2000 santos et al 2008 sawyer et al 2014 wang et al 2015 wilson and gardner 2006 wong et al 2014 but only a handful have examined the spatial occurrence in relation to ecological features such as oyster reefs or seagrasses befus et al 2014 cardenas et al 2010 rutkowski et al 1999 for instance while the role of groundwater in supporting oyster health has been documented in some areas i e zero riverine inflow bays of japan by taniguchi and hiyama 2014 the spatial distribution of sgd and its relation to oyster reefs has not been documented the spatial occurrence and magnitude of sgd vary considerably due to hydrodynamic forces at the sub centimeter to km scale santos et al 2012 for example at the regional scale subsurface inflows to coastal water bodies in arid regions have shown to be even more important than those in other climates due to a lack of perennial surface inflows uddameri et al 2014 at the estuarine scale sgd is generally higher in the intertidal zone with larger seepage magnitudes during low tides due to increased hydraulic gradients and or hydraulic pumping of seawater by tides and wave action robinson et al 2007 taniguchi and iwakawa 2004 subsurface heterogeneity leads to significant spatial distribution variations of sgd in estuaries for instance while low permeability layers i e paleovalleys incising confining units can lead to seepage far into subtidal regions breier and edmonds 2007 russoniello et al 2013 the high permeability layers that incise confining units i e caused by human induced alterations such as dredging can lead to sgd further offshore santos et al 2008 or throughout the bay from deeper flowpaths beside geologic heterogeneity produced by shallow stratigraphic features other factors such as convective flow caused by salinity and or temperature gradients are expected to cause preferential flow paths and sgd rates of varying magnitudes bighash and murgulet 2015 santos et al 2012 in this study the potential influence of subsurface heterogeneity on sgd was examined across a variety of depositional environments i e paleovalley paleovalley margin oyster reef and interfluve in relation to the potential ability to sustain the health and productivity of oyster reefs paleovalleys are relict fluvial channels incised during the last glacial maximum that later during marine transgressive periods were infilled with fine grained sediments that formed a low permeability cap this cap impedes vertical flow and redirects groundwater flow laterally normal to the paleovalley thalweg with discharge seeping along the interfluve paleovalley margin mulligan et al 2007 russoniello et al 2013 interestingly oyster reefs have been shown to be oriented perpendicular to shore along interfluves and near this margin dellapenna et al 2008 we hypothesize that paleovalley margins are a favorable habitat to oysters not only because they provide a good substrate for settlement but because they offer favorable conditions for survivability owing to larger magnitudes of sgd and associated solute fluxes the spatial variability of sgd in relation to the above mentioned shallow estuarine geologic features was investigated at different scales using a novel combination of approaches including radioactive geochemical tracers stable isotopes geophysical and petrophysical techniques we tested the reliability of results from a small scale area i e 1 km2 encompassing the paleovalley and adjacent margins by means of variance analyses of selected hydrologic variables and comparison to the estuary scale i e mission aransas estuary a dataset that encompasses a 500 km2 area the study also provides some degree of understanding of different hydrologic forces driving sgd in a shallow and low surface flow bay 2 methods 2 1 study area copano bay lies within the coastal plain of texas part of the gulf of mexico basin the texas coastal plain has a monoclinal belt structure gently dipping 1 8 7 5 m km 1 toward the gulf of mexico baker 1979 bed thicknesses increase down dip with sands of approximately 215 400 m thickness in the coastal bend region ashworth 1995 these sediments are ambiguously grouped into the gulf coast aquifer system see inset of fig 1 a major hydrostratigraphic unit composed of minor sub units which are difficult to accurately delineate using modern methods mace et al 2006 some of the sub units are enriched in uranium deposits leading to large activities of radon rn and radium ra in groundwater cech et al 1988 this occurrence corroborates the use of the uranium thorium nuclides as a groundwater tracer in this area mission aransas estuary formed from the drowned mission and aransas rivers has a seafloor composed of terrigenous and biogenic sediments the spatial variability of these sediments is related to water depth proximity to shore and the underlying geology morton and mcgowen 1980 coarser grained sediments are concentrated around high energy bay margins that erode high standing pleistocene sediments while deeper portions of the bays are predominantly mud paleoclimate research denotes decreasing sediment supply around 4 8 ka which likely led to the expansion of oyster reefs in copano bay at approximately 2 5 ka sediment delivery resumed due to increased precipitation and subsequent erosion of the edwards plateau cooke et al 2003 toomey et al 1993 troiani et al 2011 specifically this study focuses on the area crossing the infilled mission river paleovalley and copano reef referred to as the north reef herein and continues further into the relict fluvial banks it also considers the mission bay mouth and adjacent shoreline as reference sampling sites in addition the entire mission aransas estuary is included in the variance analysis as described in section 2 4 3 2 2 exploratory techniques 2 2 1 continuous resistivity profiling subsurface characterization of the different depositional environments was conducted at different scales using electrical resistivity profiling crp an imaging technique used to depict local changes in lithology and porewater salinity this method has been used increasingly in hydrogeologic framework studies breier et al 2005 evans and lizarralde 2011 murgulet et al 2016 russoniello et al 2013 an advanced geosciences inc agi supersting r8 equipped with a 112 m 56 graphite electrode cable that continuously captures 8 subsurface readings every 800 ms ms was used to retrieve data from the electrode array in a dipole dipole configuration for high resolution data collection approximately 20 m from the water surface surveys were conducted on calm water conditions with boat speeds under 4 km h km h 1 to prevent noise which can affect measurements of voltage and current from which the apparent resistivities are computed gps data and depth soundings were recorded simultaneously with a lowrance lms 480 m sonar gps and an lgc 2000 gps antenna a yellow springs instruments ysi professional plus data sonde recorded simultaneously water column resistivity and temperature the survey combines the raw 800 ms diagonal readings to produce pseudosections which are themselves overlaid to yield a final inverted resistivity image a finite element mesh and a maximally smooth least squares algorithm were used to discretize the sections and run the model inversion samouëlian et al 2005 in january 2017 two crp surveys were conducted parallel to the north copano bay shoreline on each side of the mission bay mouth i e southern and northern transects fig 2 a and b crossing over several paleovalley axes and oyster reef systems fig 2c and d the reefs in general extend perpendicular from shore and are referred as the north south and unnamed reefs fig 2 the north and south reefs extend on the northern and southern edge respectively of the paleovalley at the mouth of mission bay the spatial distribution of these oyster reefs can be found in troiani et al 2011 both the southern and northern transects were derived from several sub transects processed piecewise using the agi s earthimager software and combined to create a continuous electrical resistivity profile subsequent post processing analysis was used to select a small scale area suitable for the proposed hydrogeologic investigation see section 2 4 1 five additional crp transects distinguished as transects 1 5 or t1 t5 were collected within a smaller area where the most pronounced differences in subsurface resistivity were measured during the initial shoreline wide survey this selected area corresponds to the north side of the mission river paleovalley margin fig 2b and d and the higher electrical resistivity associated with the reef 2 2 2 petrophysical analysis petrophysical analyses were conducted on 40 cm below seafloor cm bsf sediment cores in order to constrain the apparent resistivity data and estimate hydraulic properties of the deposits cores were collected using a polycarbonate tube diameter 7 cm equipped with a one way valve from each sampling station 14 in total five deeper cores up to 105 cm were collected at sampling locations selected for time lapse analysis fig 3 see section 2 4 2 each sediment core was extruded and sectioned every ten centimeters within one day from collection for grain size distribution and porosity analyses for grain size distributions 1 2 cm3 of sediment was allocated for laser diffraction analysis beckman coulter limit of detection lod 0 375 µm 2000 µm hydrogen peroxide up to 40 by volume was used to oxidize organic matter from the sediment through a multi stage process to control oxidation reaction rates welschmeyer 1994 two cycles of di washing agitation and centrifugation of sediment were conducted before grain size analysis core sections with grains 2000 µm were processed with a ro tap sieve shaker with sieves up to 4 mm porosity measurements were derived by weighing and drying at 105 c 166 cm3 of water saturated sediment core cylinders each section was massed at the end of the drying process i e when no change in mass was observed with time porosity was then derived using the relationship between bulk density and particle density avnimelech et al 2001 assuming a constant and conventionally agreed upon particle density of 2 65 g cm 3 klute 1986 hydraulic conductivity was calculated from the grain size analysis using the kozeny carmen equation carman 1957 1 k ρ g μ d g 2 n e 3 1 n e 2 where ρ and μ are the density and dynamic viscosity of water respectively g is acceleration due to gravity dg is the geometric grain size and n e is the effective porosity while previous literature contests the use of this equation for hydraulic conductivity of fine grained sediments recent research indicates that the geometric mean is acceptable for effective hydraulic conductivity estimates based on good agreement with permeameter measurements urumovic and urumovic 2016 2 3 water sample collection water samples for radio and stable isotopes as well as other parameters described in this study were collected from surface and pore water as follows the study commenced with sample collection for the small scale reef study referred to as the north reef study in february 2016 during the small scale study samples were collected as grab samples for all three radioisotopes radon 222 222rn radium 224 224ra and radium 226 226ra and stable isotopes oxygen δ18o and hydrogen δd february 7 and 13 and as continuous measurements of 222rn as part of the in situ time series surveys february 16 and 25 and march 1 11 and 12 2017 as described in this section for the shoreline surveys continuous measurements of 222rn were conducted along the transects presented in fig 1 in january 21 and 23 and july 28 and 29 2017 during the same time grab pore and surface water samples for radioisotope measurements were collected at six locations along the surveyed transects in addition to the above for each time series and continuous or mobile surveys the shoreline and offshore endmembers were sampled for 222rn activities in order to constrain the mass balance and sgd estimates as part of a larger effort twelve groundwater samples were collected in may 2015 from wells located within the watershed and based on hydrogeochemical analysis a subset of four were identified as reliable 222rn endmembers for sgd calculations fig 1 please refer to section 2 4 1 for details on sample collection processing method of analysis and development of 222rn mass balance and sgd calculations surface water samples were collected in accordance with the texas commission on environmental quality tceq surface water sampling standard operating procedure using a van dorn bottle from 20 cm above the sediment water interface tceq 2012 turbidity was derived from secchi depth measurements at 0 1 m precision immediately following sample collection porewater and groundwater samples were collected using a peristaltic pump attached to silicon tubing which was inserted at the bottom of gas tight 250 ml i e groundwater samples and 2 l bottles i e porewater samples which were overfilled to minimize degassing samples were collected after purging at least three volumes of tubing and well casing pipe and after ysi field parameters stabilized porewater samples were extracted successfully with a retractable tip piezometer at four locations but sufficient water volume for all analysis mentioned above was available at three locations field parameters such as temperature specific conductivity dissolved oxygen do ph and oxidation reduction potential orp for bottom pore and ground water were measured in situ using an ysi pro plus or ex situ when equipped with a flow through cell i e porewater and groundwater 2 4 groundwater discharge analyses radioisotopes such as 222rn 224ra and 226ra were used as geochemical tracers to quantify sgd and identify mixing of different water sources this method was complimented by time lapse subsurface electrical resistivity imaging tomography ert and examination of δd and δ18o stable isotope signatures of bottom and pore water samples intercomparison studies conducted over a variety of hydrogeologic settings have exhibited both discrepancy and agreement among methods of sgd estimates knee and paytan 2011 there is agreement in the research community that multiple methods should be used when estimating sgd in highly heterogeneous settings such as coastal areas mulligan and charette 2006 povinec et al 2012 2 4 1 radioisotopes 222rn 224ra and 226ra for the north reef study grab samples for 222rn n 14 224ra n 7 226ra n 7 and the stable isotopes δd and δ18o n 14 measurements were collected on february 7th 1st and 2nd transects shoreline and mission bay mouth and the 13th transect 3 fig 1 tidal variation was minimal between these days max range 0 15 m with no change in baseflow observed at usgs stream gauge station 08189500 fig 1 as mentioned in section 2 3 measurements of radioisotopes and estimation of sgd rates were conducted both in situ i e time series north reef small scale study fig 1 and spatially from mobile continuous measurements along the same southern and northern crp transects see section 2 2 1 during the north reef study time series in situ 222rn measurements were conducted at four depositional environments defined by the crp i e paleovalley paleovalley margin oyster reef and interfluve and at the shoreline using the approach by smith and robbins 2012 continuous mobile measurements of 222rn conducted in january and july 2017 along the northern shore of copano bay fig 2 helped to better constrain the in situ measurements at the north reef and surrounding depositional environments as selected from the crp and illustrate variability across respective environments water radon activities were measured using a durridge rad 7 radon in air monitor by radon degassing desiccation of the degassed air and alpha counting of the 218polonium po and 214po daughter products in a scintillation cell the rad h2o accessories were used for grab samples and the rad aqua durridge 2015 for continuous in situ or mobile measurements the uncertainty of 222rn measurements is presented as the 2 sigma error 2σ for the continuous in situ or mobile radon measurements the detector was connected to a peristaltic pump that extracted bottom water at a rate of approximately 1 l min 1 within the closed loop the gas was continuously circulated with a durridge field drystik which maintained the humidity under 15 air radon concentration was also measured with an additional rad7 detector throughout the duration of the in situ or mobile continuous surveys to derive bay water degassing flux for the 222rn mass balance during mobile measurements of 222rn the use of multiple detectors connected in line yields increased spatial resolution thus better precision in locating spatial heterogeneity of sgd two durridge rad7 s were used in the january 2017 mobile survey providing a count integration time of 15 min or one measurement every 1 km and three detectors for july with a 10 min integration time or an integrated measurement every 0 7 km however as a result of setup error data collected around the north reef in january was compromised the july survey path was almost identical to january with the northern transect including the survey around the north reef and a return from the unknown reef to the south of the north reef radium samples for in situ measurements were collected at the beginning and end of each of the time lapse 222rn event while for the mobile surveys samples were collected from 6 different locations chosen based on differences in subsurface resistivity and depositional environments water samples for 224ra and 226ra measurements were collected using a water sump pump vault filter setup an approximate volume of 54 l of bottom water was filtered through purenex 1 µm nominal pore size polypropylene filters in the field and then passed twice through manganese oxide mno2 acrylic fiber dimova et al 2007 kim et al 2001 and rinsed with radium free water to eliminate any salt particles sun and torgersen 1998 in the lab measurements of 224ra were conducted on a rad7 via alpha counting of the 216po daughter product assuming equilibrium with the parent nuclides 220rn and 224ra measurements of 226ra were conducted on the impregnated mno2 fibers that were previously flushed with dinitrogen n2 gas and sealed in gas tight cartridges to allow the 214po 218po and 222rn to reach secular equilibrium with 226ra holding time at least 3 weeks the 214po and 218po daughter products were counted in a closed loop using a durridge rad 7 and 226ra activities were calculated using a calibration curve fitting based on five standard samples measured against calibrated instruments from richard peterson s lab at coastal carolina university radium samples were occasionally checked for efficiency by re processing the same water sample through a second cartridge moore 2008 each efficiency check resulted in 95 of radium retained on the first cartridge the main principle behind using continuous radon measurements to quantify groundwater discharge rates to surface waters is based on the inventory of 222rn over time accounting for different sources or sinks that have altered the apparent 222rn activity the 222rn mass balance used to estimate sgd as described in detail by burnett and dulaiova 2003 lambert and burnett 2003 smith and robbins 2012 and references therein is expressed mathematically as 2 f total z λ a rn λ a ra f o f i f sed f atm f mix a first step in developing the 222rn mass balance is to derive the 222rn inventory in the water accounting for the decay corrected activity of 222rn λarn production of 222rn from dissolved 226ra λara and the water depth z the tidal effect which has a minor influence in this system may be a source or sink term depending upon the tide for instance 222rn is lost due to mixing with offshore waters during flood tides fo is the offshore flux as they are characterized in general by lower 222rn activities and therefore it must be added back into the equation the opposite occurs during an ebbing tide when nearshore water with generally higher activity is an additional source of 222rn at the monitored station fi is the inshore nearshore flux sediment flux derived from bottom sediments via laboratory equilibration experiments fsed must be subtracted from the measured activity in deriving the 222rn inventory atmospheric evasion or radon degassing due to turbulent exchange between air and water is a sink thus must be added back into the inventory fatm is the loss due to atmospheric evasion lateral mixing fmix is the losses due to mixing processes in the water column is accounted for by adding back the lowest of the net 222rn fluxes over time the individual effect of these terms can be observed in more detail in fig s5 once these terms are accounted for the leftover 222rn inventory ftotal is assumed to be explained by the advective flux of 222rn laden groundwater the final seepage flux w is defined as the ratio of 222rn flux to the 222rn groundwater endmember activity thus changes over time if any can be converted to radon fluxes using the advective fluid radon activities which is derived from the local groundwater or in situ porewater see section 3 3 1 222rn fluxes are converted to water fluxes burnett and dulaiova 2003 3 w cm d 1 f total 222 rn gw the uncertainty of sgd rates is evaluated in this study in two ways 1 using the standard deviation of all sgd rates derived during a time series for in situ measurements over several hours and mobile separated into the reef and other environments see section 3 3 3 surveys and 2 using different groundwater endmembers see sections 3 3 2 and 3 3 3 2 4 2 in situ time lapse ert time lapse ert data were collected at the five previously identified estuarine geologic settings using the agi supersting r8 setup presented in section sub2 2 1 since four of the five time lapses were conducted on the water survey time was influenced by available daylight and weather conditions unlike the crp collection method where the cable is moving during stationary ert each eight channel measurement is acquired twice and must be within two standard deviations of one another to be recorded otherwise it is repeated termed stacking changes in bulk resistivity monitored between each time step can be attributed to fluctuations in pore fluid chemistry as the subsurface matrix remains constant nyquist et al 2008 changes in resistivity between the different erts were estimated using the esri arcmap version 10 1 build 3035 and the raster calculator tool theobald 2007 was applied to the initial and final ert profiles substantial resistivity changes identified in the tomography profiles between the different time steps were used to analyze potential surface water groundwater exchange or possible input of fresher groundwater for this purpose we have estimated the pore fluid resistivity ρ by removing the influence of lithology on resistivity readings as follows the formation factor f a measure of the porosity and clay content was calculated according to the relationship developed by lee and collett 2006 pore fluid resistivity derived as the ratio of the resistivity of the saturated formation apparent resistivity measurements to the formation factor was converted to salinity s using the relationship s 7 042 rp 1 0233 developed by manheim et al 2004 areas with percent changes exceeding the root mean square error are considered to represent potential areas of groundwater movement 2 4 3 stable isotopes δ18o and δd stable isotopes of water δ18o and δd were measured using a picarro l2120 i cavity ringdown spectrometer at the stable isotope geoscience facility of the texas a m university the isotope ratios are referenced to the international vienna standard mean oceanic water vsmow by way of internal reference standards jgulf 1 22 δ18o and 5 8 δd and kona 6 86 δ18o and 50 8 δd and are reported using the conventional delta δ notation in per mil average internal precision is 0 12 for δ18o and 0 36 for δd and an external precision replicate i e an internal standard with multiple aliquots measured throughout the course of an analytical session of the same sample is 0 26 for δ18o and 1 1 for δd the relationship between these two isotope ratios was analyzed in an attempt to identify areas with sgd input and constrain potential mixing between groundwater and seawater for each depositional environment 2 4 4 statistical analysis statistical analyses were conducted on radioisotope stable isotope and petrophysical data using the software r version 3 1 2 variables were tested for normality using a normal quantile quantile plot q q plot of the sample and theoretical quantiles q q plots that did not exhibit skewness and had shapiro wilk p values above 0 05 at the 95 confidence interval were considered normally distributed and were processed by parametric testing i e one way analysis of variance ghasemi and zahediasl 2012 non normal distributed data were processed with the non parametric equivalents i e kruskal wallis or mann whitney u test kruskal and wallis 1952 mann and whitney 1947 these univariate techniques were used to determine significant or lack thereof differences between depositional environments f tests for equality of variance that quantify the same variables on a larger spatial scale hartley 1950 were completed on data derived from the sub estuary scale study against those from a parallel estuary scale study the purpose of this analysis was to determine if the variance of selected hydrologic variables on a 1 km2 scale i e paleovalley adjacent margins and reef is equivalent to that of a dataset that encompasses a 500 km2 area i e mission aransas estuary statistics were conducted using alpha 0 05 95 confidence interval as the criterion for significant result unless otherwise noted therefore p values below or equal to 0 05 were considered significant standard deviations σ arithmetic means x sample counts n were also used as indicators of statistical significance 3 results 3 1 exploratory assessments 3 1 1 continuous resistivity profiling and sediment characterization the crp survey conducted along the north shore of copano bay intersected several paleovalleys and associated margins in addition to oyster reefs fig 2a and b more specifically areas of larger resistivity up to 3 8 o meters ωhm m were associated with the north reef area and possibly the extended north side of the paleovalley margin and interfluve associated with the aransas river paleovalley fig 2a b and d these higher resistivity zones within the southern transect fig 2c also coincide with locations of other oyster reefs as shown by troiani et al 2011 lower electrical resistivity 0 2 1 ωhm m was associated with other areas such as paleovalley axes and some areas in proximity to shoreline not to be confused with the small scale north reef study area to better constrain these different environments a small scale crp survey was conducted on the north side of the mission river paleovalley axis an area where the largest subsurface electrical resistivity was closely aligned with an oyster reef i e north reef regardless of the relatively low and narrow bulk resistivity range 0 95 3 0 ωhm m excluding the surface water range 0 25 0 90 ωhm m huang and mayne 2008 four distinct environments were identified fig 3 1 the paleovalley a vertically homogenous area characterized by the lowest resistivity 0 9 ωhm m 2 the paleovalley margin an area of sharp resistivity contrast between the paleovalley and oyster reef 0 9 2 0 ωhm m or about 70 change in the dataset range over 100 m at 12 m subsurface depth 3 the oyster reef an area with shallow bathymetry and higher subsurface resistivity that extends to the sediment water interface 2 0 ωhm m and 4 and the interfluve an area with higher subsurface resistivity 1 5 2 0 ωhm m with the exception of a shallow conductive layer 0 9 1 1 ωhm m that thickens with distance from shore these distinct environments become less evident with distance from shore including patchy areas of high resistivity up to 3 0 ωhm m within the paleovalley and lower resistivity beneath the reef down to 0 5 ωhm m see figs 3 and s1 grain size analyses and porosity measurements were in good agreement with inverted resistivity sections the paleovalley sediment core exhibited a bi modal grain size distribution throughout the entire depth profile 66 cm fig 3 these modes were centered on 1 and 5 μm which is close in agreement to what troiani et al 2011 described as middle copano bay deposits i e fine sediments at the paleovalley margin the first 26 cm of the lithology were consistent with the paleovalley however below this depth and up to the retrieved 90 cm depth the core was dominated by a mode centered on 40 μm classified as coarse silt the oyster reef s average primary mode exceeded 4000 μm the largest ro tap sieve used the fraction of clay at the reef decreased from 10 at the sediment water interface to 3 at 15 cm bsf core sediments from the interfluve exhibited a downward coarsening trend with the 1 and 5 μm size becoming secondary and tertiary respectively to the 90 μm mode at 45 cm while at 86 cm the grain size distribution resembles that of the oyster reef due to shallow water depths the crp was not conducted at the shoreline and mission bay mouth but permeability characterization was accomplished using sediment core analyses at the shoreline sediment grain size exhibited a vertically homogeneous mono modal distribution centered on 140 μm a similar distribution was determined for the mission bay mouth primary mode centered on 130 μm but with a higher clay fraction 10 4 compared to 5 5 at the shoreline application of the folk classification scheme folk 1980 to the grain size results leads to the following description of the different estuarine geologic environments 1 paleovalley estuarine mud with some shallow 1 cm sections falling within the silt or sandy mud category near the mission bay mouth 2 margin surficial mud coarsening to sandy silt beneath 30 cm 3 reef shell and shell hash with appreciable fines and 4 interfluve surficial mud or clay that increases in thickness with distance from shore coarsening to sandy mud or shell hash beneath 30 cm the environments outside the paleovalley system were characterized as follows 1 shoreline vertically homogenous muddy to silty sand 2 mission bay mouth silty sand with some sections being considered sandy mud or sandy silt due to a higher proportion of fines grain size analysis agreed well with the anomalously higher electrical resistivity 3 0 ωhm m measured in the paleovalley at the third transect during coring at this location resistance was encountered at 25 cm and while the shallow sediments were mud up to 24 cm the last sections primary mode was centered on 560 μm the higher electrical resistivity and coarser grain sizes at this point likely indicate the presence of a partially lithified patch reef which are prevalent in copano bay dellapenna et al 2008 porosity measurements and geometric mean grain size x are included as z scores or standard scores s later in section 3 2 average porosity of sediment cores in the study area was 67 with a standard deviation of 17 and an interquartile range of 56 80 the minimum porosity was associated with the shoreline 38 and maximum with the interfluve 83 far from shore porosities were high in surficial sediments at the interfluve margin and paleovalley x 80 σ 2 n 35 however they decreased with increasing depth for the interfluve and margin more than the paleovalley depth fig s2 table 1 3 1 2 groundwater endmember characterization the groundwater endmember used for this study was selected using geochemical analysis that revealed trends between the average depth of the screened formation and the geochemical constituents fig 4 in general there was a positive linear relationship between radon activity and depth r 0 75 p 0 005 fig 4a and a negative logarithmic correlation between depth and 224 226ra activity ratios ar r 0 75 p 0 005 fig 4b as well as 224ra activity r 0 87 p 0 0002 fig 4c the depth ar correlation is not as strong because 226ra exhibited a weak heteroscedastic direct relationship the variability of a variable is unequal across the range of values of a second variable that predicts it with depth r 0 68 p 0 016 fig s3a enrichment of the short lived isotope of 224ra i e half life of 3 6 days in the shallower groundwater samples is indicated by greater ar values three of the shallowest groundwater samples have ar 1 the decrease in 224ra activities and increase in 226ra with depth see figs 4 s3 is likely related to shorter residence times and contact of groundwater with the parent material such as uranium roll front deposits which in south texas are common in deeper formations hobday and galloway 1999 in addition the difference in depth relationships of 222rn and 226ra is related likely to their non reactive or reactive nature respectively for instance 222rn is conservative it is only subject to radioactive decay i e half life of 3 8 days and dilution as groundwater travels through formations that are depleted in uranium minerals on the other hand the long lived i e half life of 1 600 years 226ra is reactive and controlled by several factors such as salinity boehm et al 2006 moore 1996 dissolved oxygen and ph cerdà domènech et al 2017 therefore explaining the observed relationship sodium content significantly increased with depth r 0 68 p 0 016 fig 4d while ca2 and mg2 decreased r 0 68 p 0 016 and r 0 68 p 0 016 respectively fig s3b and c groundwater salinity min 0 28 max 1 52 x 0 86 showed a slight positive relationship with depth r 0 68 p 0 016 with only two of the deeper samples exceeded the salinities measured in the four shallow selected endmember samples fig s3d these significant changes in hydrogeochemical characteristics with depth indicate the presence of different hydrostratigraphic units and confinement within the sampled depth range 17 260 m based on these unique geochemical characteristics also shown by piper diagram analyses fig s4 only the shallowest four wells with similar geochemical characteristics depth range 17 58 m were selected to represent the 222rn endmember activities of 222rn for the selected wells ranged between 5664 and 14 509 bq m 3 x 8 693 bq m 3 since a separation via confining units is expected between the different hydrostratigraphic units discharge from the deeper aquifers is not expected to occur in this environment thus the choice of the shallowest four wells as the representative groundwater endmember this choice is in consent with most studies using 222rn as a tracer of sgd which use mainly monitoring wells developed in the water table aquifers 3 2 paleovalley system spatial analysis the small scale north reef investigation conducted at the selected paleovalley system fig 1d using surface water grab sample measurements reveals that regardless of the minimal changes in the hydrologic conditions the third transect depicts a slightly different geochemical pattern than the rest of the stations fig 5 because 222rn data from the two liter grab samples collected at each environment see section 2 3 exhibited skewness and shapiro wilks p values 0 05 at a 95 confidence interval processing was conducted using non parametric equivalents of one way analysis of variance kruskal wallis and wilcoxon mann whitney u test kruskal and wallis 1952 mann and whitney 1947 a kruskal wallis test indicated that there was significant variability in 222rn activities among depositional environments p 0 03 however the same kruskal wallis non parametric test applied to the 222rn inventories calculated as the product of 222rn activity and water depth resulted in no significant differences p 0 09 a mann whitney u test showed that the concentrations and inventories in the interfluve are significantly greater than the other three environments away from shore p 0 05 in fact the interfluve at the 2nd transect and shoreline had anomalously high activities of 271 and 242 bq m 3 respectively compared to the average 65 bq m 3 n 14 among other parameters standard scores of activities are presented in fig 5 due to low success in extracting sufficient water sample size with the retractable tip piezometer porewater samples for 222rn were collected at four locations at depths ranging from 35 to 250 cm bsf x porewater 222rn activity of 3 855 bq m 3 n 4 regardless of the small number of samples the four porewater activities exhibit a wide range with the lowest of 585 and 600 bq m 3 measured at the offshore interfluve and the shoreline at 35 cm bsf respectively and the highest of 10 840 bq m 3 in the interfluve 150 cm bsf in close proximity to the shore the average groundwater 222rn activity falls within the porewater range x groundwater 8 693 bq m 3 σ 3 980 bq m 3 n 4 activities of 224ra decreased with distance from shore from 10 8 bq m 3 at the shore to 5 6 bq m 3 closer to copano bay s center because 224ra has a very short half time i e 3 6 days larger activities are indicative of a nearby and recent source activities of 226ra were relatively invariable within the study area x 12 1 bq m 3 σ 0 4 bq m 3 n 5 comparatively the average 226ra activity within the study area was slightly higher than the offshore endmember 10 5 bq m 3 table 2 during the spatial sampling the 224ra 226ra ar ranged from 0 48 at the interfluve to 0 93 at the shoreline table 2 on the other hand ar as high as 2 34 were measured at the paleovalley margin during the time series in situ measurements of sgd followed by the reef i e 1 16 and 1 19 interfluve i e 1 08 and the shoreline i e 0 97 and 0 99 the lowest overall ar were measured at the paleovalley i e 0 32 and 0 39 during the in situ measurements of sgd table 2 these larger 224ra activities leading to ar 1 closer to the shore and around the reef area are likely the result of increased shallow groundwater transport in the absence of surface runoff resulting from lower contact time with aquifer solids lamontagne et al 2008 recall that shallow groundwater is largely enriched in 224ra over 226ra see section 3 1 2 ar 1 are indicative of enrichment in the short lived isotope 224ra which as mentioned above is an indication of more recent sgd supporting the argument of faster sgd in close proximity to the reef the stable isotopes of δ18o and δd data range was relatively small with min δ18o and δd of 0 2 and 2 1 measured in the interfluve porewater and the max δ18o and δd of 0 6 and 5 8 in the paleovalley porewater however changes among different depositional environments are significant given the analytical precision see section 2 4 3 and fig 6 a mann whitney u test showed that the reef was significantly more depleted than the other environments p 0 03 except for one interfluve sample porewater ratios closely match surface water within each depositional environment except for the paleovalley with more isotopically enriched signature this is an indication of limited exchange between surface water and groundwater via mixing in the pore spaces at the paleovalley when compared to the rest of the environments especially at the interfluve reef and shoreline these spatial differences in the δ18o distribution corroborate with z scores analysis fig 5d selected end member groundwater well signatures are substantially more depleted than the surface and pore waters δ18o x 4 4 δd 22 7 in semi arid coastal settings meteoric groundwater discharge is not necessarily fresh due to high evaporation effects leading to significant isotopic enrichment of waters in the near subsurface porewater and soil water as shown in other systems just south of the study area bighash and murgulet 2015 murgulet et al 2016 and elsewhere adomako et al 2010 therefore mixing of more isotopically depleted groundwater with the enriched near surface waters likely leads to isotopic signatures of upwelling waters to the bay that are not significantly distinct from porewaters and surface waters making an analysis such as this for a small scale area more difficult to interpret 3 3 sgd analysis 3 3 1 end member as indicated by many studies defining a representative groundwater source or endmember is a major challenge in estimating sgd fluxes burnett and dulaiova 2003 cerdà domènech et al 2017 garcia orellana et al 2013 lamontagne et al 2008 urquidi gaume et al 2016 in this study we conducted a geochemical analysis of groundwater from available wells within the mission aransas watershed to best determine the most representative inputs to the bay see section 3 1 2 most studies use the largest activity of groundwater to derive conservative estimates of sgd porewater measurements of 222rn activities obtained between 35 and 250 cm below the sediment water interface show evidence of activities that would explain a source of sgd close to the highest groundwater measured activity at one location 10 840 bq m 3 at the interfluve closer to shoreline the other porewater activities are below the lowest groundwater activity 8693 bq m 3 indicating strong mixing between different sources of groundwater including shallow and deep and recirculated water to account for mixing of groundwater inputs and porewater of different geochemical characteristics rates of sgd were calculated using the highest and average groundwater 14 508 and 8693 bq m 3 respectively and highest porewater 10 840 bq m 3 222rn activities we selected the largest 222rn activity in porewater as the most representative endmember given the depth of collection at 1 5 m below the sediment water interface and similarity to the mean range activity of the selected groundwater wells this resulted in conservative estimates of approximately 20 cm d 1 lower than the rates calculated with the lower groundwater 222rn activity endmember 3 3 2 in situ 222rn surveys the average standard deviation of in situ continuous or time series measurements of 222rn during approximately 7 h periods and over half hour integration windows was 12 bq m 3 this variation in 222rn had significant correlation with turbidity r 0 71 p 0 05 n 25 and an inverse relationship with water depth r 0 66 p 0 05 n 25 as part of the 222rn inventory see eqs 2 and 3 section 2 4 1 we observed that after correcting 222rn activities for 226ra 18 7 6 1 bq m 3 water depth had the second most significant influence on the 222rn inventory change 17 2 9 3 bq m 3 followed by atmospheric evasion 3 4 1 9 bq m 3 and sediment supported 222rn 1 2 0 6 bq m 3 values reported in parenthesis represent the average correction of all environments one standard deviation fig s5 activities of 226ra fluctuated by a relative coefficient of difference of 7 3 or roughly 0 5 bq m 3 between the beginning and end of the surveys this small change in activity coupled with negligible variations in water level resulted in a relatively constant 226ra inventory throughout the surveys after accounting for minor inputs from sediment and atmospheric evasion a strong correlation between measured radon in water and sgd is evident rates of sgd integrated over individual survey periods were highest at the reef x 43 1 6 1 cm d 1 followed by at the paleovalley margin x 35 1 7 0 cm d 1 a rain event occurred before the reef monitoring event fig 7 table 3 immediately following storm events it is likely that increased degassing caused by higher winds see fig 7 wind speeds are spiking during precipitation events sheetflow runoff and other smaller uncaptured effects of mixing with offshore surface waters may lower apparent 222rn activities and thus sgd rates average rates of sgd at the paleovalley x 30 3 6 1 cm d 1 were similar to those at the shoreline x 31 2 6 2 cm d 1 and interfluve x 27 3 5 4 cm d 1 considering the 2σ counting error the paleovalley and reef were the most invariable over their sampling periods with a standard deviation of 7 5 and 7 8 cm d 1 respectively and were significantly less variable than the margin p 0 05 f test with a standard deviation of 16 0 cm d 1 3 3 3 continuous mobile 222rn surveys total 222rn activities and the associated sgd rates measured during the january and july 2017 nearshore surveys are generally higher in proximity to the reefs and decreasing toward the paleovalley axis fig 8 222rn activities in january in proximity to reefs excluding the survey along the north reef ranged from 41 1 to 130 6 bq m 3 x 74 1 2σ 37 3 bq m 3 respectively n 17 while for all other areas including paleovalleys activities ranged from 16 4 to 64 8 bq m 3 x 31 7 2σ 16 3 bq m 3 respectively n 27 the resulting january sgd rates are in general on the higher end close to reefs from 50 1 to 83 1 cm d 1 and x 62 6 n 17 and a standard deviation of 11 3 cm d 1 excluding the survey along the north reef however maxima are not clearly associated with reefs fig 8a c and d nevertheless areas including paleovalleys have characteristically lower sgd rates from 9 6 to 49 9 cm d 1 x 28 7 n 27 and a standard deviation of σ 10 8 bq m 3 table 4 222rn activities in july are overall lower when compared to january however contrary to the previous event maxima occur at the north and south reefs 52 1 and 62 1 bq m 3 respectively in proximity to reefs which for this event includes a survey along the north reef 222rn activities ranged from 29 8 to 62 1 bq m 3 x 41 9 2σ 6 4 bq m 3 n 25 at 30 min integration time while for all other areas including paleovalleys activities ranged from 6 3 to 47 4 bq m 3 x 29 9 2σ 8 6 bq m 3 n 48 at 30 min integration time rates of sgd are distinctively higher in proximity to reefs from 22 1 to 57 5 cm d 1 x 31 9 σ 8 9 cm d 1 respectively n 25 while much lower from 7 2 to 34 5 cm d 1 x 19 5 n 48 and a standard deviation of 7 2 bq m 3 for all other areas including paleovalleys considering the 2σ error of 222rn measurements although this study is not concerned with changes in sgd across seasons it should be noted that overall sgd rates are greater in january min and max 9 6 and 83 1 cm d 1 respectively x 41 9 2σ 19 7 cm d 1 n 44 when compared to july min and max 7 6 and 57 5 cm d 1 respectively x 24 0 2σ 9 7 cm d 1 n 72 table 4 time lapse maximum wind velocity data from one offshore weather station fig 8a shows calmer winds before and during the january survey x 19 4 km h 1 than the july x 30 3 km h 1 in addition temporal variation range during both sampling trips in july was fairly large january and july range 1 3 and 16 1 km h 1 respectively with lower wind velocities observed during the first part of the day and slowly increasing later in the afternoon in this environment persistent high velocity winds preceding sampling monitoring events could potentially lead to significant 222rn degassing thus lower calculated sgd rates fig 8c f significant co2 losses due to degassing have also been inferred by other studies in this area for instance yao and hu 2017 estimated co2 losses to the atmosphere from the mission aransas estuary murgulet et al 2018 also notes the likelihood of significant co2 outgassing in nueces bay texas which may be enhanced by persistent winds and mixing of the estuary given that 222rn is expected to degas at much faster rates than co2 losses that are unaccounted for in the inventories and sgd calculations are expected and should be further investigated williams and follows 2011 3 3 4 in situ time lapse ert an advantage of the electrical resistivity technique is that it provides a visual representation of the orientation depth and type of flow i e saline versus fresh and shallow versus deeper within the subsurface in space and time significant uncertainties are likely associated with these results due to limited constrains on lithology beyond the 1 5 m depth investigated in this study and outside of the characterization provided by troiani et al 2011 however it should be noted that focus was placed on the relative salinity differences during the survey period to evaluate depth and direction of exchange between groundwater and surface water changes in subsurface resistivity are considered significant if they exceed the root mean square rms and l 2 norm errors indicators of the best fit of the inversion nyquist et al 2008 thus eliminating the effects of lithology see table 3 for this study the oyster reef showed the strongest directional flow when analyzed with time this is likely related to a directional change in winds that began around 13 15 fig 9 time step 5 that lead to water mass moving toward the reef and a negative change in shallow porewater resistivity i e fresh sgd on the windward side the wind forcing may have had resulting fetch that led to a higher water level than the leeward side of the reef resulting in a hydraulic gradient across the reef and complimented by wave pumping as also indicated by santos et al 2008 the shoreline environment which had an 8 decrease in salinity in shallow porewater 100 m from shore experienced an increase in resistivity at the beach slope while the subsurface sections with overlying surface water decreased in resistivity salinity 16 2 at 0 4 m below sediment water interface versus 17 6 in surface water at the other environments paleovalley margin and interfluve changes occurred largely in the shallow subsurface with trends similar to surface water i e a resistivity increase in surface water lead to an increase in shallow subsurface resistivity measured initial and final pore fluid salinities across all the environments were strongly variable range 5 3 31 ppt see table 3 the estimated formation factors confirm the low porosity and clay content characteristics of the shoreline 7 8 and higher porosity and clay content for the paleovalley 1 6 the margin showed the largest component of deeper and fresher groundwater table 3 since the method relies on changes in salinity with time in the subsurface movement of water masses of similar salinity in the subsurface may lead to negligible changes in salinity not exceeding the inherent error of measurement and underestimation of the extent to which the exchange between groundwater and surface water may occur nevertheless trends derived from time lapse ert are in good agreement with this study s hypothesis and sgd measurements which indicate that groundwater discharge redirected from the paleovalley is seeping along the interfluve paleovalley margin thus to the oyster reefs this was originally suggested by manheim et al 2004 and later shown by findings in russoniello et al 2013 before being confirmed by sawyer et al 2014 4 discussion exploratory geophysical investigations were successful in delineating different depositional environments and constraining their relationship with sgd nevertheless if not coupled with a comprehensive hydrostratigraphic characterization i e deep cores changes in resistivity and porewater salinity with depth cannot be correlated with certainty other researchers have assumed constant porewater resistivity to examine changes in porosity evans and lizarralde 2011 in this study sampling of porewater at discrete locations and depths within the bottom sediment layer reveals differences in salinity spatial sampling 16 5 19 4 and 20 6 at 35 150 and 250 cm bsf respectively time series 21 2 19 9 17 0 between 100 and 30 cm depth bsf thus conversion of apparent resistivity to apparent porosity for the subsurface may yield inaccurate results without porewater salinity information bulk resistivity measurements for the north shore as well as the north reef small scale investigation area reveal areas within the interfluves and reefs that are likely more permeable or fresh and the connectivity of a higher resistivity formation with the seafloor at the reefs figs 2 3 and 5b c s1 the grain size and porosity data are in good agreement with the subsurface resistivity measurements and suggest that all offshore environments except for the reef are confined by surficial estuarine muds as also indicated by troiani et al 2011 figs 2a 3 possibly directing meteoric groundwater to the reef this is also conveyed by the slightly more depleted δ18o and δd signatures measured along the reef figs 5d 6 the small variation in the isotope signatures although significant considering the error of measurement cannot be used to distinguish with confidence between different sources of water as southern winds might move more isotopically lighter water from the upstream mission bay fig 9 to copano bay along the shallow bathymetry under each scenario the reef will receive a higher proportion of meteoric water however the lower measured 222rn activities at the reef compared to the interfluve observed during the small scale and north shore sampling events could result from dilution with mission bay waters as well as larger degassing rates in shallow waters both leading to lower sgd rates larger than expected activities of 222rn in the paleovalley and interfluve may be explained by evacuation of porewater due to sediment mobilization this process occurs when water is trapped or otherwise released by shear stress that exceeds the threshold of the bedform pilditch and miller 2006 santos et al 2012 furthermore although darcy s flux is not expected to contribute to the significant sgd rates measured at the paleovalley molecular diffusion of 222rn hammond et al 1977 irrigation of sediments by benthic organisms aller and yingst 1978 and physical stirring by wind waves krone 1979 could also be significant contributors of radon transport across the sediment water interface the observed good correlation between 222rn activities in the water column with turbidity is evidence that evacuation by physical stirring may play a dominant role in our environments spatial analysis of the sources and sinks of radon demonstrated expected trends first sediment supported radon was highest in clay dominated environments this is expected since clays have a higher surface area to volume ratio which yields a higher probability of 226ra alpha recoil of the daughter isotope into porewater hughes et al 2015 sun and semkow 1998 in addition bollinger and moore 1993 proved experimentally that th and ra activities were inversely proportional with grain size in a tidal creek r 0 9 second 222rn loss due to atmospheric evasion was highest in areas of shallow water namely the shoreline and reef turbulent exchange as previously mentioned may lead to degassing of the bay water these changes accounted for in the mass balance were not substantial in altering the 222rn inventory fig s5 however we caution that consistent high winds extending from days or weeks preceding a survey could have significant degassing effects particularly on the shallower areas of the bay i e nearshore and reef areas thus leading to lower 222rn activities and inventories such as for the shallow reef and shoreline areas degassing of bay waters is most likely to have occurred before the july continuous mobile 222rn survey fig 7a we believe that long term high winds are leading to degassing of 222rn and yield lower activities in the water beyond those accounted for in the mass balance see section 2 4 1 in our study lower minimum 222rn activities 6 3 5 bq m 3 than the supported dissolved 226ra min and max 15 8 and 16 9 bq m 3 x 16 2 bq m 3 n 4 were measured along the continuous transect in july this difference 9 9 bq m 3 although in most instances is within the uncertainty of 222rn measurements x 16 bq m 3 may be an indication that degassing due to prolonged high wind speeds and gusts is unaccounted for in the mass balance when the difference is added back into the mass balance the resulting sgd rates x 31 2 cm d 1 are in average approximately 10 cm d 1 higher however still lower than average january rates x 41 8 cm d 1 in january the minimum 222rn activities 16 2 11 bq m 3 are within the supported dissolved 226ra range min and max 15 8 and 16 9 bq m 3 and resemble the average activity x 16 3 bq m 3 n 2 a more in depth analysis of 222rn losses induced by meteorological forcing particularly in shallow estuaries subjected to persistent windstorms and frequent wind gusts is necessary to get a more precise estimate of sgd variances in relation to hydrogeologic heterogeneity sgd rates from time series estimates i e time series 222rn mass balance for the different depositional environments are in good agreement with those derived from the spatial north shore assessment i e continuous mobile radon surveys for january in particular although in both instances the rates are in the same order of magnitude consistently higher sgds for both north shore events are at large associated with areas of higher electrical resistivity fig 2c d and 8 these zones correspond in general with paleovalley margins and interfluves and with several reefs i e north reef south reef unnamed reef and other reefs see figs 2a b and 8 this confirms that the observed variation in sgd rates among the different depositional environments within the north reef study area using the in situ 222rn mass balance although small is likely substantial in addition time lapse ert measurements also confirm that larger sgd rates are likely to occur between the paleovalley margin and interfluve with more significant fresh contributions at the reef ert reveals larger percent changes in resistivity salinity at environments where based on the grain size analysis and this study s hypothesis advection and inputs of water masses of different salinities is expected to dominate such as at the margin oyster reef and shoreline in this study the estimated sgd rates from both in situ and mobile 222rn surveys are consistent with published fluxes in other coastal settings see table 5 for a list of studies and also exhibit analogous ranges 8 83 cm d 1 when compared to the parallel mission aransas estuary study 5 88 cm d 1 douglas et al 2017 the largest sgd rates in the parallel study 88 and 72 cm d 1 were measured at two locations near oyster reefs i e the south reef area and goose island further confirming the permeable nature of these ecological structures within the small scale north reef study area the distribution of 224ra 226ra show a large variation among the depositional environments 224ra 226ra ars as high as 2 34 measured during time series events at the margin 1 19 at the reef 1 08 at the interfluve and 0 99 at the shoreline associated with the lowest overall of 0 32 at the paleovalley are strong indicators of geologic controls on sgd and support the higher inputs in close proximity to the oyster reefs table 2 the larger 224ra activities in relation to 226ra leading to ar 1 are likely the result of increased shallow groundwater transport shallow groundwater is largely enriched in 224ra over 226ra fig 5b ar 1 are indicative of enrichment in the short lived isotope 224ra which as mentioned above supports the argument of faster and likely fresher sgd in close proximity to the reef this study s suggested hydrogeologic influences on rates of sgd are further corroborated by significant differences in stable and radioactive isotopes observed to occur over small spatial scales offshore 1 km the variance observed for the north reef area dataset is approximately 15 4 and 1 5 times for 222rn and δ18o respectively that of the entire mission aransas estuary from the parallel study douglas et al 2017 which is approximately 500 square kilometers n 22 this larger degree of variance for the small scale study may be explained by higher spatial resolution of sampling stations which targeted significant subsurface heterogeneity associated with specific hydrogeologic features and captured larger changes of different parameters nevertheless although 222rn activities and sgd rates within the small scale area show trends favoring this study s hypothesis differences among depositional environments are not largely variable since larger differences in sgd rates are observed over a larger area such as those derived from both continuous mobile surveys along the north shoreline and from estuary wide time lapse i e january and july 2017 we believe that tide and wind induced mixing of surface water may alter water signatures i e apparent activities within a small area in addition this study characterizes sgd closer to shore and it agrees with previous studies that point to higher degrees of interaction between groundwater and surface water in close proximity to the intertidal zone santos et al 2012 therefore larger sgd inputs in proximity to the shoreline may additionally influence the chemistry of the water within the 1 km scale i e north reef small scale area resulting in a less clear relationship that would otherwise more strongly indicate the reefs as areas receiving more substantial sgd 5 conclusion this study shows that low gradient watersheds characteristic of small surface water exports can have large groundwater surface water interaction components that introduce or reintroduce groundwater into the water column recirculation based on good agreement between petrophysical geophysical and geochemical analyses the following were determined 1 all offshore environments except for the reef are confined by surficial estuarine muds possibly directing meteoric groundwater to the reef 2 larger sgd rates at the reef and margin 62 6 11 3 cm d 1 in january and 28 7 10 8 cm d 1 in july when compared to paleovalleys 31 9 8 9 cm d 1 in january and 19 5 7 2 cm d 1 in july are arguably the result of more hydraulically conductive sediments turbulent exchange and pumping based on bathymetric relief change and 3 turbulent exchange may lead to substantial 222rn degassing of the bay water and lower estimated sgd rates in areas of shallow bathymetry such as the oyster reefs this is different from most sgd studies that use 222rn as a groundwater tracer which suggest that sgd is a function of water level change i e tidal changes while turbulent exchange and pumping based on bathymetric relief may be significant controls of mechanisms dominating sgd and pore fluid transport in a small bay with minimal tidal influence these requires further investigation the influence of subsurface heterogeneity in the estuarine distribution and magnitude of sgd and its relationship to oyster reefs is indicated in this study by 1 significant variability in 222rn activities exceed daily variation at a single location and activity ratios of 224ra 226ra over small spatial scales including different depositional environments which are larger than a parallel study that encompasses mostly open bay deposits 2 the in situ estimated differences in sgd rates among depositional environments are in good agreement with the spatial continuous mobile radon surveys and 3 consistently higher sgd rates derived from 222rn mass balance are at large associated with areas of higher electrical resistivity which correspond in general with paleovalley margins interfluves and several reefs although we expect that the relationship between the different depositional environments and magnitude of sgd was altered by hydrodynamic forcings this study provides an improved understanding of possible pathways of freshwater and solute inputs to oyster reefs future studies concerning oyster reef restoration efforts should consider the linkage between depositional environments and natural subsurface substrates as they could be conduits for freshwater and nutrient inputs via sgd and likely have the ability to

7099,coastal bays with fresh submarine groundwater discharge sgd have been found to provide a favorable environment to shellfish e g oysters significant variability in the spatial distribution and magnitude of sgd may occur because of subsurface heterogeneity we investigated the relationship between stratigraphic controls i e paleovalley systems and the spatial distribution of sgd in relation to oyster reefs in copano bay south texas major oyster reefs have been shown to be oriented perpendicular to shore along interfluves and near paleovalley margins a novel combination approach of radioactive geochemical tracers stable isotopes geophysical and petrophysical techniques were used to identify estuarine depositional environments for individual hydrogeologic characterization and evaluation of sgd distribution with implications to ecological features such as oyster reefs a 1 km2 area within a paleovalley system in copano bay yielded discernible differences in sediment type apparent resistivity and sgd rates among four different depositional environments paleovalley paleovalley margin oyster reef and interfluve electrical resistivity tomography revealed a direct connection between the oyster reef and the underlying more permeable interfluve and the presence of a fresher sgd component in the subsurface measurements of sgd from stationary and mobile continuous

paleovalleys 31 9 8 9 cm d in january and 19 5 7 2 cm d in july the role of depositional environments as hydrologic controls on sgd to oyster reefs revealed in this study is further confirmed by significant differences in stable and radioactive isotopes observed over small spatial scales offshore when compared to the entire estuary although constant mixing and radon 222 degassing of bay

et al 2010 and the substrate has to be free of significant sedimentation to avoid burial eastern oyster biological review team 2007 most relevant to this study are the physical and chemical characteristics of water that influence oyster survivability studies have demonstrated that oyster efficiency i e growth rate is greatest where adequate nutrient supply is available livingston et al

heilmayer et al 2008 coastal areas with fresh sgd have been found to provide a favorable environment to oysters given that they can be characterized by brackish and more temperature conservative profiles when compared to areas not influenced by groundwater wang et al 2015 submarine groundwater discharge sgd has been identified as a key source of land derived nutrients and plays a significant role in the delivery of solutes to surface water kroeger and charette 2008 previous studies have shown that geologic heterogeneity can influence the spatial distribution quantity and direction of sgd mulligan et al 2007 russoniello et al 2013 including the occurrence of preferential flowpaths breier et al 2005 uddameri et al 2014 understanding of these hydrogeologic characteristics is important because non conservative nutrients i e nitrogen phosphorous iron for instance can be retained or go through important biogeochemical alterations in the subsurface as a result of different water residence times associated with geologic heterogeneities charette 2007 sawyer et al 2014 there are numerous studies that have focused on sgd as a source of nutrients krest et al 2000 santos et al 2008 sawyer et al 2014 wang et al 2015 wilson and gardner 2006 wong et al 2014 but only a handful have examined the spatial occurrence in relation to ecological features such as oyster reefs or seagrasses befus et al 2014 cardenas et al 2010 rutkowski et al 1999 for instance while the role of groundwater in supporting oyster health has been documented in some areas i e zero riverine inflow bays of japan by taniguchi and hiyama 2014 the spatial distribution of sgd and its relation to oyster reefs has not been documented the spatial occurrence and magnitude of sgd vary considerably due to hydrodynamic forces at the sub centimeter to km scale santos et al 2012 for example at the regional scale subsurface inflows to coastal water bodies in arid regions have shown to be even more important than those in other climates due to a lack of perennial surface inflows uddameri et al 2014 at the estuarine scale sgd is generally higher in the intertidal zone with larger seepage magnitudes during low tides due to increased hydraulic gradients and or hydraulic pumping of seawater by tides and wave action robinson et al 2007 taniguchi and iwakawa 2004 subsurface heterogeneity leads to significant spatial distribution variations of sgd in estuaries for instance while low permeability layers i e paleovalleys incising confining units can lead to seepage far into subtidal regions breier and edmonds 2007 russoniello et al 2013 the high permeability layers that incise confining units i e caused by human induced alterations such as dredging can lead to sgd further offshore santos et al 2008 or throughout the bay from deeper flowpaths beside geologic heterogeneity produced by shallow stratigraphic features other factors such as convective flow caused by salinity and or temperature gradients are expected to cause preferential flow paths and sgd rates of varying magnitudes bighash and murgulet 2015 santos et al 2012 in this study the potential influence of subsurface heterogeneity on sgd was examined across a variety of depositional environments i e paleovalley paleovalley margin oyster reef and interfluve in relation to the potential ability to sustain the health and productivity of oyster reefs paleovalleys are relict fluvial channels incised during the last glacial maximum that later during marine transgressive periods were infilled with fine grained sediments that formed a low permeability cap this cap impedes vertical flow and redirects groundwater flow laterally normal to the paleovalley thalweg with discharge seeping along the interfluve paleovalley margin mulligan et al 2007 russoniello et al 2013 interestingly oyster reefs have been shown to be oriented perpendicular to shore along interfluves and near this margin dellapenna et al 2008 we hypothesize that paleovalley margins are a favorable habitat to oysters not only because they provide a good substrate for settlement but because they offer favorable conditions for survivability owing to larger magnitudes of sgd and associated solute fluxes the spatial variability of sgd in relation to the above mentioned shallow estuarine geologic features was investigated at different scales using a novel combination of approaches including radioactive geochemical tracers stable isotopes geophysical and petrophysical techniques we tested the reliability of results from a small scale area i e 1 km2 encompassing the paleovalley and adjacent margins by means of variance analyses of selected hydrologic variables and comparison to the estuary scale i e mission aransas estuary a dataset that encompasses a 500 km2 area the study also provides some degree of understanding of different hydrologic forces driving sgd in a shallow and low surface flow bay 2 methods 2 1 study area copano bay lies within the coastal plain of texas part of the gulf of mexico basin the texas coastal plain has a monoclinal belt structure gently dipping 1 8 7 5 m km 1 toward the gulf of mexico baker 1979 bed thicknesses increase down dip with sands of approximately 215 400 m thickness in the coastal bend region ashworth 1995 these sediments are ambiguously grouped into the gulf coast aquifer system see inset of fig 1 a major hydrostratigraphic unit composed of minor sub units which are difficult to accurately delineate using modern methods mace et al 2006 some of the sub units are enriched in uranium deposits leading to large activities of radon rn and radium ra in groundwater cech et al 1988 this occurrence corroborates the use of the uranium thorium nuclides as a groundwater tracer in this area mission aransas estuary formed from the drowned mission and aransas rivers has a seafloor composed of terrigenous and biogenic sediments the spatial variability of these sediments is related to water depth proximity to shore and the underlying geology morton and mcgowen 1980 coarser grained sediments are concentrated around high energy bay margins that erode high standing pleistocene sediments while deeper portions of the bays are predominantly mud paleoclimate research denotes decreasing sediment supply around 4 8 ka which likely led to the expansion of oyster reefs in copano bay at approximately 2 5 ka sediment delivery resumed due to increased precipitation and subsequent erosion of the edwards plateau cooke et al 2003 toomey et al 1993 troiani et al 2011 specifically this study focuses on the area crossing the infilled mission river paleovalley and copano reef referred to as the north reef herein and continues further into the relict fluvial banks it also considers the mission bay mouth and adjacent shoreline as reference sampling sites in addition the entire mission aransas estuary is included in the variance analysis as described in

electrical resistivity profiling crp an imaging technique used to depict local changes in lithology and porewater salinity this method has been used increasingly in hydrogeologic framework studies

captures 8 subsurface readings every 800 ms ms was used to retrieve data from the electrode array in a dipole dipole configuration for high resolution data collection approximately 20 m from the water surface surveys were conducted on calm water conditions with boat speeds under 4 km h km h 1 to prevent noise which can affect measurements of voltage and current from which the apparent resistivities

surveys were conducted parallel to the north copano bay shoreline on each side of the mission bay mouth i e southern and northern transects fig 2 a and b crossing over several paleovalley axes and oyster reef systems fig 2c and d the reefs in general extend perpendicular from shore and are referred as the north south and unnamed reefs fig 2 the north and south reefs extend on the northern and southern edge respectively of the paleovalley at the mouth of mission bay the spatial distribution of these oyster reefs can be found in troiani et al 2011 both the southern and northern transects were derived from several sub transects processed piecewise using the agi s earthimager software and combined to create a continuous electrical resistivity profile subsequent post processing analysis was used to select a small scale area suitable for the proposed hydrogeologic investigation see section 2 4 1 five additional crp transects distinguished as transects 1 5 or t1 t5 were collected within a smaller area where the most pronounced differences in subsurface resistivity were measured during the initial shoreline wide survey this selected area corresponds to the north side of the mission river paleovalley margin fig 2b and d and the higher electrical resistivity associated with the reef 2 2 2 petrophysical analysis petrophysical analyses were conducted on 40 cm below seafloor cm bsf sediment cores in order to constrain the apparent resistivity data and estimate hydraulic properties of the deposits cores were collected using a polycarbonate tube diameter 7 cm equipped with a one way valve from each sampling station 14 in total five deeper cores up to 105 cm were collected at sampling locations selected for time lapse analysis fig 3 see section 2 4 2 each sediment core was extruded and sectioned every ten centimeters within one day from collection for grain size distribution and porosity analyses for grain size distributions 1 2 cm3 of sediment was allocated for laser diffraction analysis beckman coulter limit of detection lod 0 375 µm 2000 µm hydrogen peroxide up to 40 by volume was used to oxidize organic matter from the sediment through a multi stage process to control oxidation reaction rates welschmeyer 1994 two cycles of di washing agitation and centrifugation of sediment were conducted before grain size analysis core sections with grains 2000 µm were processed with a ro tap sieve shaker with sieves up to 4 mm porosity measurements were derived by weighing and drying at 105 c 166 cm3 of water saturated sediment core cylinders each section was massed at the end of the drying process i e when no change in mass was observed with time porosity was then derived using the relationship between bulk density and particle density avnimelech et al 2001 assuming a constant and conventionally agreed upon particle density of 2 65 g cm 3 klute 1986 hydraulic conductivity was calculated from the grain size analysis using the kozeny carmen equation carman 1957 1 k ρ g μ d g 2 n e 3 1 n e 2 where ρ and μ are the density and dynamic viscosity of water respectively g is acceleration due to gravity dg is the geometric grain size and n e is the effective porosity while previous literature contests the use of this equation for hydraulic conductivity of fine grained sediments recent research indicates that the geometric mean is acceptable for effective hydraulic conductivity estimates based on good agreement with permeameter measurements urumovic and urumovic 2016 2 3 water sample collection water samples for radio and stable isotopes as well as other parameters described in this study were collected from surface and pore water as follows the study commenced with sample collection for the small scale reef study referred to as the north reef study in february 2016 during the small scale study samples were collected as grab samples for all three radioisotopes radon 222 222rn radium 224 224ra and radium 226 226ra and stable isotopes oxygen δ18o and hydrogen δd february 7 and 13 and as continuous measurements of 222rn as part of the in situ time series surveys february 16 and 25 and march 1 11 and 12 2017 as described in this section for the shoreline surveys continuous measurements of 222rn were conducted along the transects presented in fig 1 in january 21 and 23 and july 28 and 29 2017 during the same time grab pore and surface water samples for radioisotope measurements were collected at six locations along the surveyed transects in addition to the above for each time series and continuous or mobile surveys the shoreline and offshore endmembers were sampled for 222rn activities in order to constrain the mass balance and sgd estimates as part of a larger effort twelve groundwater samples were collected in may 2015 from wells located within the watershed and based on hydrogeochemical analysis a subset of four were identified as reliable 222rn endmembers for sgd calculations fig 1 please refer to section 2 4 1 for details on sample collection processing method of analysis and development of 222rn mass balance and sgd calculations surface water samples were collected in accordance with the texas commission on environmental quality tceq surface water sampling standard operating procedure using a van dorn bottle from 20 cm above the sediment water interface tceq 2012 turbidity was derived from secchi depth measurements at 0 1 m precision immediately following sample collection porewater and groundwater samples were collected using a peristaltic pump attached to silicon tubing which was inserted at the bottom of gas tight 250 ml i e groundwater samples and 2 l bottles i e porewater samples which were overfilled to minimize degassing samples were collected after purging at least three volumes of tubing and well casing pipe and after ysi field parameters stabilized porewater samples were extracted successfully with a retractable tip piezometer at four locations but sufficient water volume for all analysis mentioned above was available at three locations field parameters such as temperature specific conductivity dissolved oxygen do ph and oxidation reduction potential orp for bottom pore and ground water were measured in situ using an ysi pro plus or ex situ when equipped with a flow through cell i e porewater and groundwater 2 4 groundwater discharge analyses radioisotopes such as 222rn 224ra and 226ra were used as geochemical tracers to quantify sgd and identify mixing of different water sources this method was complimented by time lapse subsurface electrical resistivity imaging tomography ert and examination of δd and δ18o stable isotope signatures of bottom and pore water samples intercomparison studies conducted over a variety of hydrogeologic settings have exhibited both discrepancy and agreement among methods of sgd estimates knee and paytan 2011 there is agreement in the research community that multiple methods should be used when estimating sgd in highly heterogeneous settings such as coastal areas mulligan and charette 2006 povinec et al 2012 2 4 1 radioisotopes 222rn 224ra and 226ra for the north reef study grab samples for 222rn n 14 224ra n 7 226ra n 7 and the stable isotopes δd and δ18o n 14 measurements were collected on february 7th 1st and 2nd transects shoreline and mission bay mouth and the 13th transect 3 fig 1 tidal variation was minimal between these days max range 0 15 m with no change in baseflow observed at usgs stream gauge station 08189500 fig 1 as mentioned in section 2 3 measurements of radioisotopes and estimation of sgd rates were conducted both in situ i e time series north reef small scale study fig 1 and spatially from mobile continuous measurements along the same southern and northern crp transects see section 2 2 1 during the north reef study time series in situ 222rn measurements were conducted at four depositional environments defined by the crp i e paleovalley paleovalley margin oyster reef and interfluve and at the shoreline using the approach by smith and robbins 2012 continuous mobile measurements of 222rn conducted in january and july 2017 along the northern shore of copano bay fig 2 helped to better constrain the in situ measurements at the north reef and surrounding depositional environments as selected from the crp and illustrate variability across respective environments water radon activities were measured using a durridge rad 7 radon in air monitor by radon degassing desiccation of the degassed air and alpha counting of the 218polonium po and 214po daughter products in a scintillation cell the rad h2o accessories were used for grab samples and the rad aqua durridge 2015 for continuous in situ or mobile measurements the uncertainty of 222rn measurements is presented as the 2 sigma error 2σ for the continuous in situ or mobile radon measurements the detector was connected to a peristaltic pump that extracted bottom water at a rate of approximately 1 l min 1 within the closed loop the gas was continuously circulated with a durridge field drystik which maintained the humidity under 15 air radon concentration was also measured with an additional rad7 detector throughout the duration of the in situ or mobile continuous surveys to derive bay water degassing flux for the 222rn mass balance during mobile measurements of 222rn the use of multiple detectors connected in line yields increased spatial resolution thus better precision in locating spatial heterogeneity of sgd two durridge rad7 s were used in the january 2017 mobile survey providing a count integration time of 15 min or one measurement every 1 km and three detectors for july with a 10 min integration time or an integrated measurement every 0 7 km however as a result of setup error data collected around the north reef in january was compromised the july survey path was almost identical to january with the northern transect including the survey around the north reef and a return from the unknown reef to the south of the north reef radium samples for in situ measurements were collected at the beginning and end of each of the time lapse 222rn event while for the mobile surveys samples were collected from 6 different locations chosen based on differences in subsurface resistivity and depositional environments water samples for 224ra and 226ra measurements were collected using a water sump pump vault filter setup an approximate volume of 54 l of bottom water was filtered through purenex 1 µm nominal pore size polypropylene filters in the field and then passed twice through manganese oxide mno2 acrylic fiber dimova et al 2007 kim et al 2001 and rinsed with radium free water to eliminate any salt particles sun and torgersen 1998 in the lab measurements of 224ra were conducted on a rad7 via alpha counting of the 216po daughter product assuming equilibrium with the parent nuclides 220rn and 224ra measurements of 226ra were conducted on the impregnated mno2 fibers that were previously flushed with dinitrogen n2 gas and sealed in gas tight cartridges to allow the 214po 218po and 222rn to reach secular equilibrium with 226ra holding time at least 3 weeks the 214po and 218po daughter products were counted in a closed loop using a durridge rad 7 and 226ra activities were calculated using a calibration curve fitting based on five standard samples measured against calibrated instruments from richard peterson s lab at coastal carolina university radium samples were occasionally checked for efficiency by re processing the same water sample through a second cartridge moore 2008 each efficiency check resulted in 95 of radium retained on the first cartridge the main principle behind using continuous radon measurements to quantify groundwater discharge rates to surface waters is based on the inventory of 222rn over time accounting for different sources or sinks that have altered the apparent 222rn activity the 222rn mass balance used to estimate sgd as described in detail by burnett and dulaiova 2003 lambert and burnett 2003 smith and robbins 2012 and references therein is expressed mathematically as 2 f total z λ a rn λ a ra f o f i f sed f atm f mix a first step in developing the 222rn mass balance is to derive the 222rn inventory in the water accounting for the decay corrected activity of 222rn λarn production of 222rn from dissolved 226ra λara and the water depth z the tidal effect which has a minor influence in this system may be a source or sink term depending upon the tide for instance 222rn is lost due to mixing with offshore waters during flood tides fo is the offshore flux as they are characterized in general by lower 222rn activities and therefore it must be added back into the equation the opposite occurs during an ebbing tide when nearshore water with generally higher activity is an additional source of 222rn at the monitored station fi is the inshore nearshore flux sediment flux derived from bottom sediments via laboratory equilibration experiments fsed must be subtracted from the measured activity in deriving the 222rn inventory atmospheric evasion or radon degassing due to turbulent exchange between air and water is a sink thus must be added back into the inventory fatm is the loss due to atmospheric evasion lateral mixing fmix is the losses due to mixing processes in the water column is accounted for by adding back the lowest of the net 222rn fluxes over time the individual effect of these terms can be observed in more detail in fig s5 once these terms are accounted for the leftover 222rn inventory ftotal is assumed to be explained by the advective flux of 222rn laden groundwater the final seepage flux w is defined as the ratio of 222rn flux to the 222rn groundwater endmember activity thus changes over time if any can be converted to radon fluxes using the advective fluid radon activities which is derived from the local groundwater or in situ porewater see section 3 3 1 222rn fluxes are converted to water fluxes burnett and dulaiova 2003 3 w cm d 1 f total 222 rn gw the uncertainty of sgd rates is evaluated in this study in two ways 1 using the standard deviation of all sgd rates derived during a time series for in situ measurements over several hours and mobile separated into the reef and other environments see section 3 3 3 surveys and 2 using different groundwater endmembers see sections 3 3 2 and 3 3 3 2 4 2 in situ time lapse ert time lapse ert data were collected at the five previously identified estuarine geologic settings using the agi supersting r8 setup presented in section sub2 2 1 since four of the five time lapses were conducted on the water survey time was influenced by available daylight and weather conditions unlike the crp collection method where the cable is moving during stationary ert each eight channel measurement is acquired twice and must be within two standard deviations of one another to be recorded otherwise it is repeated termed stacking changes in bulk resistivity monitored between each time step can be attributed to fluctuations in pore fluid chemistry as the subsurface matrix remains constant nyquist et al 2008 changes in resistivity between the different erts were estimated using the esri arcmap version 10 1 build 3035 and the raster calculator tool theobald 2007 was applied to the initial and final ert profiles substantial resistivity changes identified in the tomography profiles between the different time steps were used to analyze potential surface water groundwater exchange or possible input of fresher groundwater for this purpose we have estimated the pore fluid resistivity ρ by removing the influence of lithology on resistivity readings as follows the formation factor f a measure of the porosity and clay content was calculated according to the relationship developed by lee and collett 2006 pore fluid resistivity derived as the ratio of the resistivity of the saturated formation apparent resistivity measurements to the formation factor was converted to salinity s using the relationship s 7 042 rp 1 0233 developed by manheim et al 2004 areas with percent changes exceeding the root mean square error are considered to represent potential areas of groundwater movement 2 4 3 stable isotopes δ18o and δd stable isotopes of water δ18o and δd were measured using a picarro l2120 i cavity ringdown spectrometer at the stable isotope geoscience facility of the texas a m university the isotope ratios are referenced to the international vienna standard mean oceanic water vsmow by way of internal reference standards jgulf 1 22 δ18o and 5 8 δd and kona 6 86 δ18o and 50 8 δd and are reported using the conventional delta δ notation in per mil average internal precision is 0 12 for δ18o and 0 36 for δd and an external precision replicate i e an internal standard with multiple aliquots measured throughout the course of an analytical session of the same sample is 0 26 for δ18o and 1 1 for δd the relationship between these two isotope ratios was analyzed in an attempt to identify areas with sgd input and constrain potential mixing between groundwater and seawater for each depositional environment 2 4 4 statistical analysis statistical analyses were conducted on radioisotope stable isotope and petrophysical data using the software r version 3 1 2 variables were tested for normality using a normal quantile quantile plot q q plot of the sample and theoretical quantiles q q plots that did not exhibit skewness and had shapiro wilk p values above 0 05 at the 95 confidence interval were considered normally distributed and were processed by parametric testing i e one way analysis of variance ghasemi and zahediasl 2012 non normal distributed data were processed with the non parametric equivalents i e kruskal wallis or mann whitney u test kruskal and wallis 1952 mann and whitney 1947 these univariate techniques were used to determine significant or lack thereof differences between depositional environments f tests for equality of variance that quantify the same variables on a larger spatial scale hartley 1950 were completed on data derived from the sub estuary scale study against those from a parallel estuary scale study the purpose of this analysis was to determine if the variance of selected hydrologic variables on a 1 km2 scale i e paleovalley adjacent margins and reef is equivalent to that of a dataset that encompasses a 500 km2 area i e mission aransas estuary statistics were conducted using alpha 0 05 95 confidence interval as the criterion for significant result unless otherwise noted therefore p values below or equal to 0 05 were considered significant standard deviations σ arithmetic means x sample counts n were also used as indicators of statistical significance 3 results 3 1 exploratory assessments 3 1 1 continuous resistivity profiling and sediment characterization the crp survey conducted along the north shore of copano bay intersected several paleovalleys and associated margins in addition to oyster reefs fig 2a and b more specifically areas of larger resistivity up to 3 8 o meters ωhm m were associated with the north reef area and possibly the extended north side of the paleovalley margin and interfluve associated with the aransas river paleovalley fig 2a b and d these higher resistivity zones within the southern transect fig 2c also coincide with locations of other oyster reefs as shown by troiani et al 2011 lower electrical resistivity 0 2 1 ωhm m was associated with other areas such as paleovalley axes and some areas in proximity to shoreline not to be confused with the small scale north reef study area to better constrain these different environments a small scale crp survey was conducted on the north side of the mission river paleovalley axis an area where the largest subsurface electrical resistivity was closely aligned with an oyster reef i e north reef regardless of the relatively low and narrow bulk resistivity range 0 95 3 0 ωhm m excluding the surface water range 0 25 0 90 ωhm m huang and mayne 2008 four distinct environments were identified fig 3 1 the paleovalley a vertically homogenous area characterized by the lowest resistivity 0 9 ωhm m 2 the paleovalley margin an area of sharp resistivity contrast between the paleovalley and oyster reef 0 9 2 0 ωhm m or about 70 change in the dataset range over 100 m at 12 m subsurface depth 3 the oyster reef an area with shallow bathymetry and higher subsurface resistivity that extends to the sediment water interface 2 0 ωhm m and 4 and the interfluve an area with higher subsurface resistivity 1 5 2 0 ωhm m with the exception of a shallow conductive layer 0 9 1 1 ωhm m that thickens with distance from shore these distinct environments become less evident with distance from shore including patchy areas of high resistivity up to 3 0 ωhm m within the paleovalley and lower resistivity beneath the reef down to 0 5 ωhm m see figs 3 and s1 grain size analyses and porosity measurements were in good agreement with inverted resistivity sections the paleovalley sediment core exhibited a bi modal grain size distribution throughout the entire depth profile 66 cm fig 3 these modes were centered on 1 and 5 μm which is close in agreement to what troiani et al 2011 described as middle copano bay deposits i e fine sediments at the paleovalley margin the first 26 cm of the lithology were consistent with the paleovalley however below this depth and up to the retrieved 90 cm depth the core was dominated by a mode centered on 40 μm classified as coarse silt the oyster reef s average primary mode exceeded 4000 μm the largest ro tap sieve used the fraction of clay at the reef decreased from 10 at the sediment water interface to 3 at 15 cm bsf core sediments from the interfluve exhibited a downward coarsening trend with the 1 and 5 μm size becoming secondary and tertiary respectively to the 90 μm mode at 45 cm while at 86 cm the grain size distribution resembles that of the oyster reef due to shallow water depths the crp was not conducted at the shoreline and mission bay mouth but permeability characterization was accomplished using sediment core analyses at the shoreline sediment grain size exhibited a vertically homogeneous mono modal distribution centered on 140 μm a similar distribution was determined for the mission bay mouth primary mode centered on 130 μm but with a higher clay fraction 10 4 compared to 5 5 at the shoreline application of the folk classification scheme folk 1980 to the grain size results leads to the following description of the different estuarine geologic environments 1 paleovalley estuarine mud with some shallow 1 cm sections falling within the silt or sandy mud category near the mission bay mouth 2 margin surficial mud coarsening to sandy silt beneath 30 cm 3 reef shell and shell hash with appreciable fines and 4 interfluve surficial mud or clay that increases in thickness with distance from shore coarsening to sandy mud or shell hash beneath 30 cm the environments outside the paleovalley system were characterized as follows 1 shoreline vertically homogenous muddy to silty sand 2 mission bay mouth silty sand with some sections being considered sandy mud or sandy silt due to a higher proportion of fines grain size analysis agreed well with the anomalously higher electrical resistivity 3 0 ωhm m measured in the paleovalley at the third transect during coring at this location resistance was encountered at 25 cm and while the shallow sediments were mud up to 24 cm the last sections primary mode was centered on 560 μm the higher electrical resistivity and coarser grain sizes at this point likely indicate the presence of a partially lithified patch reef which are prevalent in copano bay dellapenna et al 2008 porosity measurements and geometric mean grain size x are included as z scores or standard scores s later in section 3 2 average porosity of sediment cores in the study area was 67 with a standard deviation of 17 and an interquartile range of 56 80 the minimum porosity was associated with the shoreline 38 and maximum with the interfluve 83 far from shore porosities were high in surficial sediments at the interfluve margin and paleovalley x 80 σ 2 n 35 however they decreased with increasing depth for the interfluve and margin more than the paleovalley depth fig s2 table 1 3 1 2 groundwater endmember characterization the groundwater endmember used for this study was selected using geochemical analysis that revealed trends between the average depth of the screened formation and the geochemical constituents fig 4 in general there was a positive linear relationship between radon activity and depth r 0 75 p 0 005 fig 4a and a negative logarithmic correlation between depth and 224 226ra activity ratios ar r 0 75 p 0 005 fig 4b as well as 224ra activity r 0 87 p 0 0002 fig 4c the depth ar correlation is not as strong because 226ra exhibited a weak heteroscedastic direct relationship the variability of a variable is unequal across the range of values of a second variable that predicts it with depth r 0 68 p 0 016 fig s3a enrichment of the short lived isotope of 224ra i e half life of 3 6 days in the shallower groundwater samples is indicated by greater ar values three of the shallowest groundwater samples have ar 1 the decrease in 224ra activities and increase in 226ra with depth see figs 4 s3 is likely related to shorter residence times and contact of groundwater with the parent material such as uranium roll front deposits which in south texas are common in deeper formations hobday and galloway 1999 in addition the difference in depth relationships of 222rn and 226ra is related likely to their non reactive or reactive nature respectively for instance 222rn is conservative it is only subject to radioactive decay i e half life of 3 8 days and dilution as groundwater travels through formations that are depleted in uranium minerals on the other hand the long lived i e half life of 1 600 years 226ra is reactive and controlled by several factors such as salinity boehm et al 2006 moore 1996 dissolved oxygen and ph cerdà domènech et al 2017 therefore explaining the observed relationship sodium content significantly increased with depth r 0 68 p 0 016 fig 4d while ca2 and mg2 decreased r 0 68 p 0 016 and r 0 68 p 0 016 respectively fig s3b and c groundwater salinity min 0 28 max 1 52 x 0 86 showed a slight positive relationship with depth r 0 68 p 0 016 with only two of the deeper samples exceeded the salinities measured in the four shallow selected endmember samples fig s3d these significant changes in hydrogeochemical characteristics with depth indicate the presence of different hydrostratigraphic units and confinement within the sampled depth range 17 260 m based on these unique geochemical characteristics also shown by piper diagram analyses fig s4 only the shallowest four wells with similar geochemical characteristics depth range 17 58 m were selected to represent the 222rn endmember activities of 222rn for the selected wells ranged between 5664 and 14 509 bq m 3 x 8 693 bq m 3 since a separation via confining units is expected between the different hydrostratigraphic units discharge from the deeper aquifers is not expected to occur in this environment thus the choice of the shallowest four wells as the representative groundwater endmember this choice is in consent with most studies using 222rn as a tracer of sgd which use mainly monitoring wells developed in the water table aquifers 3 2 paleovalley system spatial analysis the small scale north reef investigation conducted at the selected paleovalley system fig 1d using surface water grab sample measurements reveals that regardless of the minimal changes in the hydrologic conditions the third transect depicts a slightly different geochemical pattern than the rest of the stations fig 5 because 222rn data from the two liter grab samples collected at each environment see section 2 3 exhibited skewness and shapiro wilks p values 0 05 at a 95 confidence interval processing was conducted using non parametric equivalents of one way analysis of variance kruskal wallis and wilcoxon mann whitney u test kruskal and wallis 1952 mann and whitney 1947 a kruskal wallis test indicated that there was significant variability in 222rn activities among depositional environments p 0 03 however the same kruskal wallis non parametric test applied to the 222rn inventories calculated as the product of 222rn activity and water depth resulted in no significant differences p 0 09 a mann whitney u test showed that the concentrations and inventories in the interfluve are significantly greater than the other three environments away from shore p 0 05 in fact the interfluve at the 2nd transect and shoreline had anomalously high activities of 271 and 242 bq m 3 respectively compared to the average 65 bq m 3 n 14 among other parameters standard scores of activities are presented in fig 5 due to low success in extracting sufficient water sample size with the retractable tip piezometer porewater samples for 222rn were collected at four locations at depths ranging from 35 to 250 cm bsf x porewater 222rn activity of 3 855 bq m 3 n 4 regardless of the small number of samples the four porewater activities exhibit a wide range with the lowest of 585 and 600 bq m 3 measured at the offshore interfluve and the shoreline at 35 cm bsf respectively and the highest of 10 840 bq m 3 in the interfluve 150 cm bsf in close proximity to the shore the average groundwater 222rn activity falls within the porewater range x groundwater 8 693 bq m 3 σ 3 980 bq m 3 n 4 activities of 224ra decreased with distance from shore from 10 8 bq m 3 at the shore to 5 6 bq m 3 closer to copano bay s center because 224ra has a very short half time i e 3 6 days larger activities are indicative of a nearby and recent source activities of 226ra were relatively invariable within the study area x 12 1 bq m 3 σ 0 4 bq m 3 n 5 comparatively the average 226ra activity within the study area was slightly higher than the offshore endmember 10 5 bq m 3 table 2 during the spatial sampling the 224ra 226ra ar ranged from 0 48 at the interfluve to 0 93 at the shoreline table 2 on the other hand ar as high as 2 34 were measured at the paleovalley margin during the time series in situ measurements of sgd followed by the reef i e 1 16 and 1 19 interfluve i e 1 08 and the shoreline i e 0 97 and 0 99 the lowest overall ar were measured at the paleovalley i e 0 32 and 0 39 during the in situ measurements of sgd table 2 these larger 224ra activities leading to ar 1 closer to the shore and around the reef area are likely the result of increased shallow groundwater transport in the absence of surface runoff resulting from lower contact time with aquifer solids lamontagne et al 2008 recall that shallow groundwater is largely enriched in 224ra over 226ra see section 3 1 2 ar 1 are indicative of enrichment in the short lived isotope 224ra which as mentioned above is an indication of more recent sgd supporting the argument of faster sgd in close proximity to the reef the stable isotopes of δ18o and δd data range was relatively small with min δ18o and δd of 0 2 and 2 1 measured in the interfluve porewater and the max δ18o and δd of 0 6 and 5 8 in the paleovalley porewater however changes among different depositional environments are significant given the analytical precision see section 2 4 3 and fig 6 a mann whitney u test showed that the reef was significantly more depleted than the other environments p 0 03 except for one interfluve sample porewater ratios closely match surface water within each depositional environment except for the paleovalley with more isotopically enriched signature this is an indication of limited exchange between surface water and groundwater via mixing in the pore spaces at the paleovalley when compared to the rest of the environments especially at the interfluve reef and shoreline these spatial differences in the δ18o distribution corroborate with z scores analysis fig 5d selected end member groundwater well signatures are substantially more depleted than the surface and pore waters δ18o x 4 4 δd 22 7 in semi arid coastal settings meteoric groundwater discharge is not necessarily fresh due to high evaporation effects leading to significant isotopic enrichment of waters in the near subsurface porewater and soil water as shown in other systems just south of the study area bighash and murgulet 2015 murgulet et al 2016 and elsewhere adomako et al 2010 therefore mixing of more isotopically depleted groundwater with the enriched near surface waters likely leads to isotopic signatures of upwelling waters to the bay that are not significantly distinct from porewaters and surface waters making an analysis such as this for a small scale area more difficult to interpret 3 3 sgd analysis 3 3 1 end member as indicated by many studies defining a representative groundwater source or endmember is a major challenge in estimating sgd fluxes burnett and dulaiova 2003 cerdà domènech et al 2017 garcia orellana et al 2013 lamontagne et al 2008 urquidi gaume et al 2016 in this study we conducted a geochemical analysis of groundwater from available wells within the mission aransas watershed to best determine the most representative inputs to the bay see section 3 1 2 most studies use the largest activity of groundwater to derive conservative estimates of sgd porewater measurements of 222rn activities obtained between 35 and 250 cm below the sediment water interface show evidence of activities that would explain a source of sgd close to the highest groundwater measured activity at one location 10 840 bq m 3 at the interfluve closer to shoreline the other porewater activities are below the lowest groundwater activity 8693 bq m 3 indicating strong mixing between different sources of groundwater including shallow and deep and recirculated water to account for mixing of groundwater inputs and porewater of different geochemical characteristics rates of sgd were calculated using the highest and average groundwater 14 508 and 8693 bq m 3 respectively and highest porewater 10 840 bq m 3 222rn activities we selected the largest 222rn activity in porewater as the most representative endmember given the depth of collection at 1 5 m below the sediment water interface and similarity to the mean range activity of the selected groundwater wells this resulted in conservative estimates of approximately 20 cm d 1 lower than the rates calculated with the lower groundwater 222rn activity endmember 3 3 2 in situ 222rn surveys the average standard deviation of in situ continuous or time series measurements of 222rn during approximately 7 h periods and over half hour integration windows was 12 bq m 3 this variation in 222rn had significant correlation with turbidity r 0 71 p 0 05 n 25 and an inverse relationship with water depth r 0 66 p 0 05 n 25 as part of the 222rn inventory see eqs 2 and 3 section 2 4 1 we observed that after correcting 222rn activities for 226ra 18 7 6 1 bq m 3 water depth had the second most significant influence on the 222rn inventory change 17 2 9 3 bq m 3 followed by atmospheric evasion 3 4 1 9 bq m 3 and sediment supported 222rn 1 2 0 6 bq m 3 values reported in parenthesis represent the average correction of all environments one standard deviation fig s5 activities of 226ra fluctuated by a relative coefficient of difference of 7 3 or roughly 0 5 bq m 3 between the beginning and end of the surveys this small change in activity coupled with negligible variations in water level resulted in a relatively constant 226ra inventory throughout the surveys after accounting for minor inputs from sediment and atmospheric evasion a strong correlation between measured radon in water and sgd is evident rates of sgd integrated over individual survey periods were highest at the reef x 43 1 6 1 cm d 1 followed by at the paleovalley margin x 35 1 7 0 cm d 1 a rain event occurred before the reef monitoring event fig 7 table 3 immediately following storm events it is likely that increased degassing caused by higher winds see fig 7 wind speeds are spiking during precipitation events sheetflow runoff and other smaller uncaptured effects of mixing with offshore surface waters may lower apparent 222rn activities and thus sgd rates average rates of sgd at the paleovalley x 30 3 6 1 cm d 1 were similar to those at the shoreline x 31 2 6 2 cm d 1 and interfluve x 27 3 5 4 cm d 1 considering the 2σ counting error the paleovalley and reef were the most invariable over their sampling periods with a standard deviation of 7 5 and 7 8 cm d 1 respectively and were significantly less variable than the margin p 0 05 f test with a standard deviation of 16 0 cm d 1 3 3 3 continuous mobile 222rn surveys total 222rn activities and the associated sgd rates measured during the january and july 2017 nearshore surveys are generally higher in proximity to the reefs and decreasing toward the paleovalley axis fig 8 222rn activities in january in proximity to reefs excluding the survey along the north reef ranged from 41 1 to 130 6 bq m 3 x 74 1 2σ 37 3 bq m 3 respectively n 17 while for all other areas including paleovalleys activities ranged from 16 4 to 64 8 bq m 3 x 31 7 2σ 16 3 bq m 3 respectively n 27 the resulting january sgd rates are in general on the higher end close to reefs from 50 1 to 83 1 cm d 1 and x 62 6 n 17 and a standard deviation of 11 3 cm d 1 excluding the survey along the north reef however maxima are not clearly associated with reefs fig 8a c and d nevertheless areas including paleovalleys have characteristically lower sgd rates from 9 6 to 49 9 cm d 1 x 28 7 n 27 and a standard deviation of σ 10 8 bq m 3 table 4 222rn activities in july are overall lower when compared to january however contrary to the previous event maxima occur at the north and south reefs 52 1 and 62 1 bq m 3 respectively in proximity to reefs which for this event includes a survey along the north reef 222rn activities ranged from 29 8 to 62 1 bq m 3 x 41 9 2σ 6 4 bq m 3 n 25 at 30 min integration time while for all other areas including paleovalleys activities ranged from 6 3 to 47 4 bq m 3 x 29 9 2σ 8 6 bq m 3 n 48 at 30 min integration time rates of sgd are distinctively higher in proximity to reefs from 22 1 to 57 5 cm d 1 x 31 9 σ 8 9 cm d 1 respectively n 25 while much lower from 7 2 to 34 5 cm d 1 x 19 5 n 48 and a standard deviation of 7 2 bq m 3 for all other areas including paleovalleys considering the 2σ error of 222rn measurements although this study is not concerned with changes in sgd across seasons it should be noted that overall sgd rates are greater in january min and max 9 6 and 83 1 cm d 1 respectively x 41 9 2σ 19 7 cm d 1 n 44 when compared to july min and max 7 6 and 57 5 cm d 1 respectively x 24 0 2σ 9 7 cm d 1 n 72 table 4 time lapse maximum wind velocity data from one offshore weather station fig 8a shows calmer winds before and during the january survey x 19 4 km h 1 than the july x 30 3 km h 1 in addition temporal variation range during both sampling trips in july was fairly large january and july range 1 3 and 16 1 km h 1 respectively with lower wind velocities observed during the first part of the day and slowly increasing later in the afternoon in this environment persistent high velocity winds preceding sampling monitoring events could potentially lead to significant 222rn degassing thus lower calculated sgd rates fig 8c f significant co2 losses due to degassing have also been inferred by other studies in this area for instance yao and hu 2017 estimated co2 losses to the atmosphere from the mission aransas estuary murgulet et al 2018 also notes the likelihood of significant co2 outgassing in nueces bay texas which may be enhanced by persistent winds and mixing of the estuary given that 222rn is expected to degas at much faster rates than co2 losses that are unaccounted for in the inventories and sgd calculations are expected and should be further investigated williams and follows 2011 3 3 4 in situ time lapse ert an advantage of the electrical resistivity technique is that it provides a visual representation of the orientation depth and type of flow i e saline versus fresh and shallow versus deeper within the subsurface in space and time significant uncertainties are likely associated with these results due to limited constrains on lithology beyond the 1 5 m depth investigated in this study and outside of the characterization provided by troiani et al 2011 however it should be noted that focus was placed on the relative salinity differences during the survey period to evaluate depth and direction of exchange between groundwater and surface water changes in subsurface resistivity are considered significant if they exceed the root mean square rms and l 2 norm errors indicators of the best fit of the inversion nyquist et al 2008 thus eliminating the effects of lithology see table 3 for this study the oyster reef showed the strongest directional flow when analyzed with time this is likely related to a directional change in winds that began around 13 15 fig 9 time step 5 that lead to water mass moving toward the reef and a negative change in shallow porewater resistivity i e fresh sgd on the windward side the wind forcing may have had resulting fetch that led to a higher water level than the leeward side of the reef resulting in a hydraulic gradient across the reef and complimented by wave pumping as also indicated by santos et al 2008 the shoreline environment which had an 8 decrease in salinity in shallow porewater 100 m from shore experienced an increase in resistivity at the beach slope while the subsurface sections with overlying surface water decreased in resistivity salinity 16 2 at 0 4 m below sediment water interface versus 17 6 in surface water at the other environments paleovalley margin and interfluve changes occurred largely in the shallow subsurface with trends similar to surface water i e a resistivity increase in surface water lead to an increase in shallow subsurface resistivity measured initial and final pore fluid salinities across all the environments were strongly variable range 5 3 31 ppt see table 3 the estimated formation factors confirm the low porosity and clay content characteristics of the shoreline 7 8 and higher porosity and clay content for the paleovalley 1 6 the margin showed the largest component of deeper and fresher groundwater table 3 since the method relies on changes in salinity with time in the subsurface movement of water masses of similar salinity in the subsurface may lead to negligible changes in salinity not exceeding the inherent error of measurement and underestimation of the extent to which the exchange between groundwater and surface water may occur nevertheless trends derived from time lapse ert are in good agreement with this study s hypothesis and sgd measurements which indicate that groundwater discharge redirected from the paleovalley is seeping along the interfluve paleovalley margin thus to the oyster reefs this was originally suggested by manheim et al 2004 and later shown by findings in russoniello et al 2013 before being confirmed by sawyer et al 2014 4 discussion exploratory geophysical investigations were successful in delineating different depositional environments and constraining their relationship with sgd nevertheless if not coupled with a comprehensive hydrostratigraphic characterization i e deep cores changes in resistivity and porewater salinity with depth cannot be correlated with certainty other researchers have assumed constant porewater resistivity to examine changes in porosity evans and lizarralde 2011 in this study sampling of porewater at discrete locations and depths within the bottom sediment layer reveals differences in salinity spatial sampling 16 5 19 4 and 20 6 at 35 150 and 250 cm bsf respectively time series 21 2 19 9 17 0 between 100 and 30 cm depth bsf thus conversion of apparent resistivity to apparent porosity for the subsurface may yield inaccurate results without porewater salinity information bulk resistivity measurements for the north shore as well as the north reef small scale investigation area reveal areas within the interfluves and reefs that are likely more permeable or fresh and the connectivity of a higher resistivity formation with the seafloor at the reefs figs 2 3 and 5b c s1 the grain size and porosity data are in good agreement with the subsurface resistivity measurements and suggest that all offshore environments except for the reef are confined by surficial estuarine muds as also indicated by troiani et al 2011 figs 2a 3 possibly directing meteoric groundwater to the reef this is also conveyed by the slightly more depleted δ18o and δd signatures measured along the reef figs 5d 6 the small variation in the isotope signatures although significant considering the error of measurement cannot be used to distinguish with confidence between different sources of water as southern winds might move more isotopically lighter water from the upstream mission bay fig 9 to copano bay along the shallow bathymetry under each scenario the reef will receive a higher proportion of meteoric water however the lower measured 222rn activities at the reef compared to the interfluve observed during the small scale and north shore sampling events could result from dilution with mission bay waters as well as larger degassing rates in shallow waters both leading to lower sgd rates larger than expected activities of 222rn in the paleovalley and interfluve may be explained by evacuation of porewater due to sediment mobilization this process occurs when water is trapped or otherwise released by shear stress that exceeds the threshold of the bedform pilditch and miller 2006 santos et al 2012 furthermore although darcy s flux is not expected to contribute to the significant sgd rates measured at the paleovalley molecular diffusion of 222rn hammond et al 1977 irrigation of sediments by benthic organisms aller and yingst 1978 and physical stirring by wind waves krone 1979 could also be significant contributors of radon transport across the sediment water interface the observed good correlation between 222rn activities in the water column with turbidity is evidence that evacuation by physical stirring may play a dominant role in our environments spatial analysis of the sources and sinks of radon demonstrated expected trends first sediment supported radon was highest in clay dominated environments this is expected since clays have a higher surface area to volume ratio which yields a higher probability of 226ra alpha recoil of the daughter isotope into porewater hughes et al 2015 sun and semkow 1998 in addition bollinger and moore 1993 proved experimentally that th and ra activities were inversely proportional with grain size in a tidal creek r 0 9 second 222rn loss due to atmospheric evasion was highest in areas of shallow water namely the shoreline and reef turbulent exchange as previously mentioned may lead to degassing of the bay water these changes accounted for in the mass balance were not substantial in altering the 222rn inventory fig s5 however we caution that consistent high winds extending from days or weeks preceding a survey could have significant degassing effects particularly on the shallower areas of the bay i e nearshore and reef areas thus leading to lower 222rn activities and inventories such as for the shallow reef and shoreline areas degassing of bay waters is most likely to have occurred before the july continuous mobile 222rn survey fig 7a we believe that long term high winds are leading to degassing of 222rn and yield lower activities in the water beyond those accounted for in the mass balance see section 2 4 1 in our study lower minimum 222rn activities 6 3 5 bq m 3 than the supported dissolved 226ra min and max 15 8 and 16 9 bq m 3 x 16 2 bq m 3 n 4 were measured along the continuous transect in july this difference 9 9 bq m 3 although in most instances is within the uncertainty of 222rn measurements x 16 bq m 3 may be an indication that degassing due to prolonged high wind speeds and gusts is unaccounted for in the mass balance when the difference is added back into the mass balance the resulting sgd rates x 31 2 cm d 1 are in average approximately 10 cm d 1 higher however still lower than average january rates x 41 8 cm d 1 in january the minimum 222rn activities 16 2 11 bq m 3 are within the supported dissolved 226ra range min and max 15 8 and 16 9 bq m 3 and resemble the average activity x 16 3 bq m 3 n 2 a more in depth analysis of 222rn losses induced by meteorological forcing particularly in shallow estuaries subjected to persistent windstorms and frequent wind gusts is necessary to get a more precise estimate of sgd variances in relation to hydrogeologic heterogeneity sgd rates from time series estimates i e time series 222rn mass balance for the different depositional environments are in good agreement with those derived from the spatial north shore assessment i e continuous mobile radon surveys for january in particular although in both instances the rates are in the same order of magnitude consistently higher sgds for both north shore events are at large associated with areas of higher electrical resistivity fig 2c d and 8 these zones correspond in general with paleovalley margins and interfluves and with several reefs i e north reef south reef unnamed reef and other reefs see figs 2a b and 8 this confirms that the observed variation in sgd rates among the different depositional environments within the north reef study area using the in situ 222rn mass balance although small is likely substantial in addition time lapse ert measurements also confirm that larger sgd rates are likely to occur between the paleovalley margin and interfluve with more significant fresh contributions at the reef ert reveals larger percent changes in resistivity salinity at environments where based on the grain size analysis and this study s hypothesis advection and inputs of water masses of different salinities is expected to dominate such as at the margin oyster reef and shoreline in this study the estimated sgd rates from both in situ and mobile 222rn surveys are consistent with published fluxes in other coastal settings see table 5 for a list of studies and also exhibit analogous ranges 8 83 cm d 1 when compared to the parallel mission aransas estuary study 5 88 cm d 1 douglas et al 2017 the largest sgd rates in the parallel study 88 and 72 cm d 1 were measured at two locations near oyster reefs i e the south reef area and goose island further confirming the permeable nature of these ecological structures within the small scale north reef study area the distribution of 224ra 226ra show a large variation among the depositional environments 224ra 226ra ars as high as 2 34 measured during time series events at the margin 1 19 at the reef 1 08 at the interfluve and 0 99 at the shoreline associated with the lowest overall of 0 32 at the paleovalley are strong indicators of geologic controls on sgd and support the higher inputs in close proximity to the oyster reefs table 2 the larger 224ra activities in relation to 226ra leading to ar 1 are likely the result of increased shallow groundwater transport shallow groundwater is largely enriched in 224ra over 226ra fig 5b ar 1 are indicative of enrichment in the short lived isotope 224ra which as mentioned above supports the argument of faster and likely fresher sgd in close proximity to the reef this study s suggested hydrogeologic influences on rates of sgd are further corroborated by significant differences in stable and radioactive isotopes observed to occur over small spatial scales offshore 1 km the variance observed for the north reef area dataset is approximately 15 4 and 1 5 times for 222rn and δ18o respectively that of the entire mission aransas estuary from the parallel study douglas et al 2017 which is approximately 500 square kilometers n 22 this larger degree of variance for the small scale study may be explained by higher spatial resolution of sampling stations which targeted significant subsurface heterogeneity associated with specific hydrogeologic features and captured larger changes of different parameters nevertheless although 222rn activities and sgd rates within the small scale area show trends favoring this study s hypothesis differences among depositional environments are not largely variable since larger differences in sgd rates are observed over a larger area such as those derived from both continuous mobile surveys along the north shoreline and from estuary wide time lapse i e january and july 2017 we believe that tide and wind induced mixing of surface water may alter water signatures i e apparent activities within a small area in addition this study characterizes sgd closer to shore and it agrees with previous studies that point to higher degrees of interaction between groundwater and surface water in close proximity to the intertidal zone santos et al 2012 therefore larger sgd inputs in proximity to the shoreline may additionally influence the chemistry of the water within the 1 km scale i e north reef small scale area resulting in a less clear relationship that would otherwise more strongly indicate the reefs as areas receiving more substantial sgd 5 conclusion this study shows that low gradient watersheds characteristic of small surface water exports can have large groundwater surface water interaction components that introduce or reintroduce groundwater into the water column recirculation based on good agreement between petrophysical geophysical and geochemical analyses the following were determined 1 all offshore environments except for the reef are confined by surficial estuarine muds possibly directing meteoric groundwater to the reef 2 larger sgd rates at the reef and margin 62 6 11 3 cm d 1 in january and 28 7 10 8 cm d 1 in july when compared to paleovalleys 31 9 8 9 cm d 1 in january and 19 5 7 2 cm d 1 in july are arguably the result of more hydraulically conductive sediments turbulent exchange and pumping based on bathymetric relief change and 3 turbulent exchange may lead to substantial 222rn degassing of the bay water and lower estimated sgd rates in areas of shallow bathymetry such as the oyster reefs this is different from most sgd studies that use 222rn as a groundwater tracer which suggest that sgd is a function of water level change i e tidal changes while turbulent exchange and pumping based on bathymetric relief may be significant controls of mechanisms dominating sgd and pore fluid transport in a small bay with minimal tidal influence these requires further investigation the influence of subsurface heterogeneity in the estuarine distribution and magnitude of sgd and its relationship to oyster reefs is indicated in this study by 1 significant variability in 222rn activities exceed daily variation at a single location and activity ratios of 224ra 226ra over small spatial scales including different depositional environments which are larger than a parallel study that encompasses mostly open bay deposits 2 the in situ estimated differences in sgd rates among depositional environments are in good agreement with the spatial continuous mobile radon surveys and 3 consistently higher sgd rates derived from 222rn mass balance are at large associated with areas of higher electrical resistivity which correspond in general with paleovalley margins interfluves and several reefs although we expect that the relationship between the different depositional environments and magnitude of sgd was altered by hydrodynamic forcings this study provides an improved understanding of possible pathways of freshwater and solute inputs to oyster reefs future studies concerning oyster reef restoration efforts should consider the linkage between depositional environments and natural subsurface substrates as they could be conduits for freshwater and nutrient inputs via sgd and likely have the ability to
