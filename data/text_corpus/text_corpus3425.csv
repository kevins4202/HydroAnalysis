17125,the uncertainties on the occurrence fate and hazard of contaminants of emerging concern cecs increasingly challenge drinking water dw utilities whether additional measures should be taken to reduce the health risk this has led to the development and evaluation of risk based approaches by the scientific community dw guideline values are commonly derived based on deterministic chemical risk assessment cra here we propose a new probabilistic procedure that is a quantitative chemical risk assessment qcra to assess potential health risk related to the occurrence of cecs in dw the qcra includes uncertainties in risk calculation in both exposure and hazard assessments to quantify the health risk in terms of the benchmark quotient probabilistic distribution the qcra estimates the probabilistic distribution of cecs concentration in dw based on their concentration in source water and simulating the breakthrough curves of a granular activated carbon gac treatment process the model inputs and output uncertainties were evaluated by sensitivity and uncertainty analyses for each step of the risk assessment to identify the most relevant factors affecting risk estimation dominant factors resulted to be the concentration of cecs in water sources gac isotherm parameters and toxicological data to stress the potential of this new qcra approach several case studies are considered with focus on bisphenol a as an example cec and various gac management options qcra quantifies the probabilistic risk providing more insight compared to cra qcra proved to be more effective in supporting the intervention prioritization for treatment optimization to pursue health risk minimization graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords contaminants of emerging concern quantitative chemical risk assessment activated carbon adsorption drinking water treatment stochastic modeling 1 introduction over the last years research on drinking water dw has drawn attention towards the occurrence fate and potentially harmful impact on human health of a variety of recently identified compounds of anthropogenic origin often labelled contaminants of emerging concern cecs e g perfluorinated compounds alkylphenols pharmaceuticals pesticides baken et al 2018 in particular differences in human health risks and the large number of different compounds created a need for prioritization and regulation of cecs in dw based on the risk level this is complicated by knowledge gaps that result in uncertainties for both exposure and hazard assessment steps of the procedure who ipcs 2018 as for the exposure assessment despite several studies reporting trace levels of cecs in the aquatic environment staples et al 2018 cecs concentrations in dw are sometimes poorly known also due to the high percentage of censored data namely data lower than the analytical limit of quantification loq cantoni et al 2020 as a consequence the evaluation of this uncertainty is necessary for prioritization in the definition of dw standards lapworth et al 2012 it is therefore important to fill existing knowledge gaps on fate of cecs throughout treatment processes currently applied in drinking water treatment plants dwtps to mitigate potential health risks it is important to assess whether dwtps as currently designed are able to sufficiently remove cecs and if not which additional treatment is the most suitable to be integrated to improve cecs removal among the available treatment processes adsorption onto granular activated carbon gac was so far identified as the best available technology bat for the removal of many cecs westerhoff et al 2005 gac removal efficiency depends on the system operating conditions and decreases over time due to gac saturation with organic matter and cecs breakthrough curves are typically used to describe the gac treatment performance regarding a specific contaminant over time since they define the time trend of the outlet contaminant concentration during filter operation piazzoli and antonelli 2018 the gac performance model and thus the breakthrough curve can be built through numerical simulations based on isotherm and kinetics data collected from batch adsorption tests patterson et al 2019 furthermore mathematical modeling allows a less costly assessment of several non tested operating conditions of the gac treatment and permits the propagation of the uncertainties related to input data resulting in a comprehensive tool able to predict the gac treatment performance athanasaki et al 2015 for the hazard assessment dw regulatory standards are conventionally set based on toxicological data and used for risk characterization not for every cec a regulatory standard is yet derived to manage risks associated with dw baken et al 2018 moreover toxicological studies on cecs are in some cases confidential and they might be incomplete or contradictory schriks et al 2010 in current chemical risk assessment cra in dw applications uncertainties are taken into account by selecting conservative point values such as a high exposure concentration or a lower bound estimate of the health based guideline level bokkers et al 2017 then the ratio between the exposure concentration and the health based guideline level point values is calculated as the deterministic benchmark quotient bq that provides an indication of the risk level baken et al 2018 however replacing the point values by their uncertainty distributions in a quantitative risk assessment would make it possible to evaluate the level of conservatism in the estimated risk and the main sources of uncertainty in the whole procedure who ipcs 2018 few case studies are reported in literature that provide a probabilistic quantification of the risk still these applications include the uncertainty analysis just either on the exposure assessment kavcar et al 2009 thomaidi et al 2020 or in the hazard assessment baird et al 1996 renwick et al 2004 resulting in a risk estimation that is not completely representative of the uncertainties in both aspects exposure and hazard of the risk assessment van der voet and slob 2007 proposed an integrated probabilistic procedure to include both variability and uncertainty in the risk assessment but this approach is relatively time consuming for both the data collection and the distinction of the variability and uncertainty within the assessment another method focusing on the uncertainty of both the exposure and hazard assessment is the aproba plus tool bokkers et al 2017 which applies lognormal uncertainty distributions to the hazard assessment parameters resulting in a confidence interval for the human dose associated with specified protection goals furthermore the tool includes the option to insert an estimation of the exposure uncertainty this method is not a stand alone tool but it requires to be integrated in a broader assessment framework to get case specific inputs from exposure and dose response analyses which also contain uncertainty lapworth et al 2012 to the best of the authors knowledge there are no research studies applying a quantitative chemical risk assessment qcra in the field of dw production and consumption we have developed a comprehensive procedure to implement a qcra that includes dw treatment performance modeling and propagation of uncertainties related to the calculation of cec removal efficiencies qcra results were compared with the conventional cra approach bisphenol a bpa has been selected as the cec representative because it is one of the two cecs together with perfluorinated compounds pfas newly included in the revision of the european drinking water directive european parliament 2018 among the list of compounds to be monitored and for which a regulatory limit has been set gac treatment process was selected for simulations as the most suitable to be integrated in current dwtps since it is the best available technology for bpa removal the simulations underline the benefits of qcra compared to cra in providing more insights and precise indications to water utilities that need to upgrade and optimize the current dwtps to comply with the new proposed limit for bpa in dw sensitivity and uncertainty analyses have been used to rank the parameters which mainly contribute to the risk assessment uncertainty and may need further investigation moreover some case studies have been explored with respect to bpa concentration in source water and gac management options to highlight the potential of qcra as supporting tool for the optimization of the interventions in the whole dw supply system 2 materials and methods 2 1 quantitative chemical risk assessment qcra procedure a probabilistic modeling framework was defined for the development of qcra procedure fig 1 in particular the developed procedure is applied for one of the cecs introduced in the proposed revision of the european drinking water directive namely bpa eu parliament 2020 2 1 1 exposure assessment source water quality and treatment efficacy gac filtration performance has been modeled through aquapriori a python based treatment simulation tool developed by kwr water research institute that provides amongst others breakthrough curves of gac filters vries et al 2017 solutes adsorption on gac is modeled using the ideal adsorbed solution theory iast in its simplified version where the competition of the cecs with natural organic matter nom is considered as dominant while competition with other micropollutants is neglected qi et al 2007 the aquapriori tool was modified to allow simulating with a statistical distribution of input parameters rather than a point value the iast model input parameters are i cec inlet concentration ii gac filter operating conditions empty bed contact time ebct regeneration time as bed volumes bvreg gac particle size and bed porosity and iii freundlich isotherm parameters kf and 1 n for the selected cec input data were collected both from literature and 17 full scale dwtps located in milan area abstracting groundwater as dw source with wells in the confined aquifer from 30 to 100 meters deep and with treatment trains made by gac filters 14 dwtps gac filters in parallel with stripping towers 2 dwtps or gac filters coupled with reverse osmosis membranes on a fraction of gac filters effluent 1 dwtp before the treated water entering the distribution network disinfection by sodium hypochlorite 16 dwtps or uv radiation 1 dwtp is applied for each input parameter the number of available data and their ranges are reported in table 1 while detailed values are shown in table s1 s4 and figure s1 in supplementary materials sm collected data were used to estimate the statistical distribution for each input parameter according to the procedure explained in paragraph 2 2 1 the estimated statistical distributions were used to sample 1 000 data for each input parameter whose combination resulted in 1 000 simulated breakthrough curves under the assumption that the cec concentration in the gac effluent is equal to the cec concentration in dw for each breakthrough curve the quantile corresponding to the 98th percentile of the outlet concentration distribution c98 was selected as indicator of a realistic maximum cec concentration in dw the resulting 1 000 values for c98 were used to estimate the statistical uncertainty distribution of the maximum cec concentration 2 1 2 hazard assessment the hazard assessment was aimed at estimating a health based value namely the drinking water target level dwtl which represents the concentration of a compound that does not result in the exceedance of the tolerable exposure i e a health based guidance level like tdi adi rfd of a consumer over lifetime who 2006 dwtl µg l 1 was calculated by eq 1 baken et al 2018 1 dwtl rfd 1000 p wir where rfd mg kg 1 day 1 is the reference dose p is the allocation factor that is the percentage of risk maximally associated to dw consumption compared to the overall exposure pathways considered as constant and equal to 20 baken et al 2018 wir is the water intake rate l kg 1 day 1 which is the ratio between the daily water consumption and the body weight the dwtl should be sufficiently low to allow safe long term consumption of 2l of tap water for adults of 60 kg i e the wir value was assumed a fixed value of 0 033 l kg 1 day 1 baken et al 2018 for the rfd estimation toxicological data were collected from international statutory guidelines and toxicological studies in particular only guidelines mentioning a toxicological reference study and providing all the specific inputs for the assessment have been considered according to the procedure explained in section s1 in supplementary materials the most recent scientific opinion published by the european food safety authority efsa in 2015 on bpa has been selected as reference for the hazard assessment efsa 2015 efsa identified the mean relative kidney weight from the f1 males in a two generation toxicity study in mice tyl et al 2008 as the critical effect of bpa the point of departure pod was the lower confidence limit of the benchmark dose bmdl10 provided by efsa as 8 96 mg kg 1day 1 while the upper confidence limit of the benchmark dose bmdu10 was 108 9 mg kg 1day 1 in the efsa assessment uncertainty factors of 14 7 2 5 and 10 were applied for interspecies toxicokinetics i e calculation of the human equivalent dose hed interspecies toxicodynamics and intraspecies differences respectively in addition an extra factor of 6 was included to take into account the limitations of the data available on bpa toxicity for mammary gland reproductive neuro behavioural immune and metabolic systems efsa reports a deterministic rfd for external oral exposure to bpa in humans of 4 0 μg kg 1day 1 finally differently from what reported by efsa a duration extrapolation factor was applied for subchronic to chronic conversion the critical effect in the toxicity study tyl et al 2008 is not a developmental or reprotoxic effect but a general toxicity effect on kidney assumed to occur after continuous repeated exposure since the f1 males were exposed up to the age of 14 weeks a factor for duration is considered necessary in the deterministic approach a factor of 2 was used as a default value proposed by the efsa efsa 2012 to derive the uncertainty distribution of the rfd and evaluate which factors are more relevant in the final rfd uncertainty the aproba plus tool was used as described by bokkers et al 2017 the protection goals namely the effect magnitude m and the population incidence i were set to 10 and 1 respectively therefore the output reference dose is the dose at which 1 of the population would be subject to an effect of 10 or more reduction in mean relative kidney weight for the uncertainty factors inputs to the aproba plus tool interspecies intraspecies and duration extrapolation data based default uncertainty distributions provided by the software were applied for the limited data available on bpa toxicity for mammary gland reproductive neuro behavioural immune and metabolic systems the efsa assessment factor of 6 was considered here as the upper 95 confidence limit the possibility that actual additional data on these endpoints would not change the pod is reflected by setting the lower 5 confidence limit of this assessment factor distribution to 1 details on the inputs to the aproba plus tool based on the critical endpoint established by efsa are reported in table s7 and s8 in supplementary materials the estimated rfd statistical distribution wir and allocation factor p were used to calculate 1 000 values of dwtl used to fit its statistical distribution 2 1 3 risk characterization for the risk characterization step once that both the statistical distributions of c98 and dwtl were obtained they were used to sample 1 000 data each from which it has been possible to compute 1 000 bq values according to eq 2 2 bq c 98 dwtl these values were used to estimate the bq statistical distribution see paragraph 2 2 1 the bq statistical distribution was employed to extrapolate two different data i the maximum probabilistic bq bqprob max corresponding to the maximum bq value resulting from the quantitative simulation ii the probability of bq above the health risk threshold value equal to 1 p bq 1 resulting from the bq estimation uncertainties p bq 1 represents the percentage of the total area underlying the bq probability density curve that is above the bq value of 1 moreover the deterministic bq bqdet was estimated as the ratio between the deterministic c98 and the deterministic dwtl calculated from the efsa values according to the conventional cra 2 2 stochastic simulations 2 2 1 definition of input and output data distributions collected inputs and estimated outputs data were used to fit their statistical distribution for each parameter fits to the lognormal weibull gamma beta rayleigh uniform triangular and logistic statistical distributions were tested data fitting to specific distributions were performed with the fit function in the python scipy stats package which applies a maximum likelihood estimation method then the statistical distribution having the minimum akaike information criterion aic was selected because the freundlich isotherm model parameters kf and 1 n are bivariate correlated a multivariate statistical distribution method was applied the gaussian anamorphosis function method with inverse anamorphosis function a linear transformation and the anamorphosis function was used in order to describe the joint probability distribution santoro et al 2015 2 2 2 sensitivity analysis sensitivity analyses were performed on c98 and bq variables a global sensitivity analysis approach was applied a variance based quantitative and all factors at a time aat method was preferred to local sensitivity analysis to describe the whole inputs space dimensionality including interactions among inputs saltelli and annoni 2010 it is based on the first order effect index si in which output variations are induced by varying all the input factors simultaneously therefore the sensitivity to each factor considers the direct influence of that factor as well as the joint influence due to interactions saltelli and annoni 2010 si value identifies the most relevant input factors by assessing their contribution to the model output variance as defined in eq 3 3 s i i v i e i y x i v y where xi is the i th evaluated input y is the evaluated output i represents all the input factors except the i th for each i th evaluated input a series of n values was generated as uniformly distributed between the minimum and the maximum of the collected input data ranges then for each of the evaluated input n values 1 000 combinations of values of all the other input factors i th were sampled from their estimated statistical distributions resulting in 1 000 values of the assessed output y all the inputs were assumed to be independent except for the freundlich isotherm parameters that were jointly sampled from their multivariate statistical distribution similar to the other input parameters all freundlich parameter couples as found in literature were evaluated as the i th input to yield a series of n values 2 2 3 uncertainty analysis uncertainty analysis of the bq output was performed a monte carlo simulation method was applied which allowed for the simultaneous forward propagation of all the inputs uncertainties into the output distribution saltelli and annoni 2010 all the inputs found to be relevant in the sensitivity analysis were simultaneously sampled from their estimated statistical distributions and randomly combined for a total of 1 000 simulations resulting in 1 000 values of bq whose statistical distribution has been fitted to check whether 1 000 simulations were enough to get stable outputs the whole procedure was repeated four times then pairwise comparisons were performed with the kolmogorov smirnov test to test whether the four resulting bq samples were drawn from the same continuous distribution moreover it was checked that the standard errors for several percentiles table s13 of the bq distributions were below 10 2 3 qcra application for systems management and optimization the developed qcra procedure has been applied to three different case studies in the first two case studies it has been assumed to have a drinking water source contaminated with bpa having the maximum concentration measured cin max and distributed according to the literature data see table 1 and table s1 two cases have been simulated i dw no gac in which there is not a gac process in the dwtp and thus no cecs removal is assumed to occur ii dw gac in which a gac process is present but it is managed aiming at the removal of conventional pollutants implying a high regeneration time bvreg 80 000 bv in the third case study the worst case scenario with gac treatment wcs gac has been assessed assuming the highest bpa concentration in source water found in literature namely 43 μg l constantly entering the dwtp in which there is a gac process managed for conventional pollutants removal bvreg 80 000 bv in addition other two intervention scenarios derived from wcs gac were simulated for exploring the potential of qcra for the optimization of the gac process specifically the first intervention scenario is an upgrading scenario wcs gac up in which the gac process is upgraded by increasing the number of gac filters in parallel up to an optimal value being the ebct the input parameter to be optimized while the second intervention scenario simulates an optimal management scenario wcs gac manag in which the regeneration frequency of the gac filters was managed with reference to bpa being the bvreg the optimization parameter as for the exposure assessment step of the qcra procedure the freundlich isotherm parameter pairs found in literature were reduced exclusively to those found for gac applications in dw production see table s4 values and assumptions for inputs variables are summarized in table s9 for all the case studies for each case study both the traditional cra and the developed qcra procedures have been performed the cra output namely the bqdet was compared to the two qcra indexes bqprob max 1 and p bq 1 0 defined in paragraph 2 1 3 in particular for the two intervention scenarios wcs gac up and wcs gac manag the optimal values of the considered input parameter were obtained at bqdet 1 for the cra while both conditions of bqprob max 1 and p bq 1 0 were evaluated for the qcra 3 results and discussion the qcra procedure development as reported in fig 1 has been performed firstly identifying the statistical distribution of each input parameter that was fed to exposure assessment hazard assessment and risk characterization models to estimate the outputs distributions the resulting statistical distributions their parameters and the aic numbers obtained for each fitted statistical distribution are reported in table s10 results of the sensitivity and uncertainty analyses as well as the application of the developed procedure to the representative case studies is here reported to show how decision makers water utilities and scientific community may benefit from including the uncertainties within risk assessment rather than selecting deterministic point values 3 1 sensitivity analysis one of the main benefits of applying a quantitative risk assessment procedure including the related uncertainties is that the output can highlight which aspects display the main contribution to the overall uncertainty and therefore what type of additional information should be collected to increase the accuracy in the modeling process reducing the assessment uncertainty bokkers et al 2017 in particular this was achieved through two sensitivity analyses to identify which inputs among the set required for exposure and hazard assessment steps affect mostly c98 and dwtl outputs respectively then limiting the analysis to these dominant inputs a sensitivity analysis has been performed to evaluate which inputs are more influencing on the bq estimation accuracy as for the exposure assessment the shapes of the modeled breakthrough curves provide qualitative information about the influence of each input parameter on the c98 output in particular a substantial difference in breakthrough curves between the minimum and maximum value of the analyzed input parameter indicates that this input has a relevant influence on the c98 output examples of breakthrough curves obtained varying ebct and couples of freundlich isotherm parameters are reported in fig 2 while graphs for the other input parameters are shown in figure s3 the ebct parameter seems not to have relevant influence on the breakthrough curves shape in the analyzed range i e differences in breakthrough curves are graphically almost indistinguishable between minimum and maximum ebct values fig 2a and 2b instead it is evident that a variation in freundlich parameter values imply a substantial variation in the resulting breakthrough curves and consequently have an effect on the c98 it is important to notice that some curves exceed more than a 100 breakthrough ratio without extensive analysis we postulate that competitive effects of nom cause these overshoots as nom was included as a possibly competing substance in the simulation of bpa sorption and breakthrough corwin and summers 2011 due to competition with nom desorption and subsequent release of adsorbed cec bpa in this case would lead to elution with non adsorbed cec hand et al 1997 in addition to visual inspection of the breakthrough curves the si values were calculated for each input in order to quantitatively identify and rank the most relevant input factors affecting the c98 output recall that a higher si implies a higher influence of the input parameter on the output results are reported in table 2 it emerges that for each operating condition ebct bvreg bed porosity and particle size the si values are at least one order of magnitude lower than the one for freundlich isotherm parameters and inlet bpa concentration therefore operating conditions turned out not to have significant effects on the variability of the c98 output for the studied cec or at least to be less relevant compared to freundlich isotherm parameters and inlet bpa concentration consequently only the uncertainties related to freundlich isotherm parameters and inlet bpa concentration were considered in the bq sensitivity analysis as for the hazard assessment step the aproba plus tool provides analyses on which of the assessment uncertainty factors reported by efsa have the main contribution to the overall rfd uncertainty see table s11 the greatest contributor to the rfd uncertainty is the assessment factor accounting for the intraspecies differences with 28 contribution followed by the duration extrapolation factor 25 contribution the uncertainty on the pod value 20 and the interspecies factor 17 finally 10 of the rfd uncertainty is due to the efsa assessment factor taking into account the limitations of the data available on bpa toxicity for mammary gland reproductive neuro behavioral immune and metabolic systems as a consequence a stochastic approach is highly recommended to include the uncertainties related to available toxicological data in the evaluation these uncertainties affect the final output of the risk analysis in particular for a class of contaminants as the cecs where a gap of knowledge is certainly present and further toxicological studies are expected to be published chiu and slob 2015 for the risk characterization assessment step the sensitivity analysis was performed on the bq output to prioritize those qcra inputs that were found to be the dominant factors in the previous steps from results in table 2 it is possible to note that si indexes for the three inputs are all in the same order of magnitude and therefore both parameters describing the gac process and toxicological data have a significant influence on the estimated bq this suggests that when predicting the gac performance towards bpa it is important to precisely estimate the source water concentration and to test the selected gac performance with the real source water through batch experiments in order to evaluate the case specific freundlich isotherm parameters actually these considerations can apply also to cecs other than bpa moreover more toxicological data on bpa hazard on several specific endpoints e g mammary gland reproductive neuro behavioural immune and metabolic systems will make the assessment factor for the incomplete toxicity information redundant efsa is currently re evaluating bpa in case additional toxicity data does not warrant the choice of another pod due to a more sensitive endpoint the uncertainty in the rfd can be reduced by eliminating the assessment factor accounting for the limited available data consequently the uncertainty in the dwtl and final bq is also reduced 3 2 uncertainty analysis the main advantage of a probabilistic framework for risk assessment is the possibility to reproduce the observed variability of source water quality and cecs affinity towards gac and the uncertainties related to cecs toxicity in contrast to a deterministic procedure where a single expected bq is estimated the probabilistic framework can provide its whole probability distribution and therefore more insight about its accuracy and reliability in addition this approach permits to relate the design of a gac process to health risk probability highlighting the effective benefits of a specific design assumption in order to highlight more clearly such benefits the probabilistic qcra output was compared to the results obtained by the deterministic cra in the qcra uncertainty analysis 1 000 monte carlo simulations were performed sampling simultaneously from their distributions all the relevant inputs while keeping constant the gac process operating conditions not being relevant the procedure was repeated four times and 1 000 monte carlo simulations were confirmed to be enough to get stable outputs in fact the standard errors for the main percentiles of the four bq distributions were below 10 table s12 moreover pairwise comparisons of the four bq outputs with kolmogorov smirnov tests resulted in all p values above the significance level α 0 05 table s13 meaning that the four bq outputs can be assumed to follow the same distribution starting from the exposure assessment the probabilistic qcra procedure shows the wide range of breakthrough curves figure s4 which are calculated by sampling from the whole model inputs uncertainty distributions compared to the single gac breakthrough curve obtained with the deterministic cra assuming the maximum cin max and the qsar quantitative structure activity relationship predicted parameters of freundlich isotherm set as default in the aquapriori tool for the hazard assessment the deterministic dwtl is equal to 12 0 µg l estimated from the efsa rfd 4 0 μg kg 1 day 1 the duration extrapolation factor of 2 and assuming standard daily water consumption 2 l and body weight 60 kg baken et al 2018 the aproba plus provides an approximate probabilistic rfd defined as the 5 percentile of the target human dose hd1 10 equal to 3 69 μg kg 1 day 1 that is slightly lower than the efsa rfd although different assumptions and probabilistic uncertainty factors have been considered table s14 considering the whole rfd distribution provided by the aproba plus the qcra output provides a statistical distribution for the dwtl fig 3 a well described by a lognormal distribution with mean 5 93 μg l and standard deviation 1 725 both the deterministic dwtl and most of the probabilistic dwtl distribution exceed the parametric value for bpa in the revised european drinking water directive 2 5 µg l eu parliament 2020 indicating that this can be considered sufficiently protective lastly according to the conventional deterministic cra the bqdet is equal to 0 004 indicating that there is no human health risk linked to bpa in treated dw as for the probabilistic qcra considering only a central statistic of the bq statistical distribution like the average that is equal to 0 01 leads to a result in agreement with the one obtained by the deterministic approach however with the qcra the maximum bq can be calculated reflecting a conservative estimate of the risk for individuals who are highly exposed and sensitive to the effects of bpa this analysis suggests that when consuming 2l of tap water a potential health risk cannot be excluded in specific cases since the maximum probabilistic bq that is the 99 percentile of the bq distribution is equal to 1 15 and the probability of exceeding the bq threshold value of 1 is equal to 0 2 another benefit of the probabilistic approach is that it provides two different parameters that relate to two different features of the human health risk in fact exposure to chemicals can have acute or chronic effects on human health depending on their severity and duration acute effects usually occur rapidly as a result of short term exposures to high pollutants concentrations uncommon for cecs in water while chronic effects can generally occur as a result of long term exposure to lower concentrations schultz et al 2003 therefore when the analyzed hazard is likely to have an acute effect on human health the maximum probabilistic bq should be the most important parameter to be assessed and reduced describing the most critical situation that could happen even with low probability on the other hand when the analyzed hazard is likely to have a chronic effect on human health as it can be the case of dw pollution with cecs the probability of bq values exceeding the threshold value bq 1 should be the most important parameter to be reduced considering not only the most critical concentration at which the consumer could be in contact but also all the concentrations higher than the threshold value and the probability that the consumer would drink contaminated water 3 3 qcra application to case studies definition of interventions based only on the compliance with quality standards can be unfeasible or ineffective due to the multiplicity of cecs which are or might be present in a water supply source as well as the differentiated efficiency of gac process instead it is proposed here that prioritization of interventions to reduce concentrations of cecs should be based on the avoided health risk hadi et al 2019 three case studies were identified dw no gac dw gac wcs gac to explore the potential of the developed qcra procedure in providing a valid support to tune monitoring campaigns and design management measures to minimize health risk due to bpa and more generally to cecs in the first two case studies a dw source is polluted by bpa with a maximum measured concentration cin max distributed according to literature data see table 1 and table s1 in the case study dw no gac since supplied water does not undergo a gac process maximum bpa concentration c98 in dw is distributed as the maximum bpa concentration cin max in source water while in the dw gac case the dw source undergoes a gac treatment throughout the dwtp in the third case study wcs gac a dw source polluted by the highest bpa maximum concentration cin max found in literature namely 43 μg l was assumed in case studies comprising a gac process it was assumed that gac process was managed looking exclusively at conventional micropollutants breakthrough thus no specific measures are taken to address cecs removal the simulated breakthrough curves for the dw gac and wcs gac case studies are reported in figure s5 and the statistical distributions of the estimated c98 dwtl and corresponding bq are reported in fig 3 for the three case studies the deterministic cra and probabilistic qcra outputs are reported in table 3 both dw case studies show that no human health risks is identified based on the deterministic approach revealing a no risk situation bqdet 0 04 on the other hand the application of the probabilistic qcra allows to highlight that in both cases there is a potential risk in specific cases being the p bq 1 greater than zero with maximum probabilistic bq of 1 55 and 1 62 in absence and in presence of a gac process respectively comparing the bq parameters found in the two dw case studies without a specific treatment and with gac process managed for conventional pollutants it is clear that bq values in both deterministic cra and probabilistic qcra are very similar this finding highlights that if the gac process present in a dwtp is managed looking only at conventional micropollutants bpa approaches the complete breakthrough during the gac filter functioning see figure s5a making the adsorption process no longer effective in reducing bpa outlet concentration as a parameter for bpa has been included in the proposed revision of the european drinking water directive eu parliament 2020 it is important to design and manage the gac process accordingly in addition the probabilistic quantitative approach contrarily to the deterministic one can be useful to select the more appropriate operating conditions to minimize the actual health risk based on the joint analyses of bqprob max and p bq 1 deriving from each operating conditions evaluated moreover it can be observed that the p bq 1 in case of presence of the gac process is slightly higher than the one in the case without gac process this could be due to the breakthrough curves shapes that show effluent concentrations exceeding the influent concentration for a while during filter functioning hand et al 1997 it is essential to consider this aspect since there could be situations in which the outlet maximum concentration c98 is higher than the concentration in dw source this finding points out that monitoring cec concentration only in the dw source could lead to a risk underestimation and that coupling the monitoring with the modeling of the gac process performance is beneficial for a more accurate risk assessment for the wcs gac case study the high regeneration time leads to the complete bpa breakthrough and a probability of 24 80 of exceeding the bq threshold value in this case also the deterministic approach would have revealed a risk with the bq higher than 1 but again the probabilistic maximum bq is one order of magnitude higher than the deterministic one 3 4 intervention scenarios optimization for risk minimization both the deterministic cra and probabilistic qcra procedures applied to the wcs gac scenario highlighted that the gac process designed and managed for conventional pollutants resulted to be ineffective to prevent human health risk in case of high bpa inlet concentration thus the qcra procedure was applied to evaluate the efficiency of gac process optimization interventions in minimizing the health risk as benchmark the conventional deterministic cra was used the first simulated intervention scenario wcs gac up is a typical intervention applied by the water utilities managers that is the gac process upgrade with an increase in the number of parallel filters treating the supplied water in fact the flowrate per filter would decrease by increasing the filters number raising the ebct and determining a reduction of the maximum outlet concentration which means a lower bq value and a lower probability to exceed bq value equal to 1 in particular it should be possible to estimate the number of filters reducing the probability to virtually 0 if smaller than 1e 5 it is considered zero which represents the optimal number of filters in practice the ebct was the parameter to be optimized since it was one of the aquapriori inputs and it can be easily related to the filters number as it was in the input of the sensitivity analysis the ebct has been varied between 8 and 20 minutes since operating at higher ebct is proven not to improve the gac filter performance in terms of the total water volume treated between two regenerations crittenden et al 2012 figure s6 shows the breakthrough curves and the bq values statistical distribution obtained at the minimum 8 minutes and maximum 20 minutes ebct values the second simulated scenario wcs gac manag is related to a management intervention where the gac regeneration frequency is the parameter to be optimized in fact by reducing the time between two gac filter regenerations the breakthrough curve is interrupted in advance resulting in a lower cec maximum outlet concentration and thus a lower bq value consequently the probability of exceeding bq value equal to 1 will be lower therefore in the present optimization the goal is to determine the time of regeneration bvreg that makes that probability to virtually 0 in this case while the currently applied regeneration time ranges between 20 000 and 80 000 bvs table 1 the bvreg range for the optimization based on bpa was tested between 0 and 80 000 bvs although more frequent regenerations compared to conventional operation would imply higher operating and environmental costs it is an effective solution to mitigate health risks due to the occurrence of bpa in dw in figure s7 the breakthrough curves and the c98 dwtl and bq statistical distribution obtained at regeneration with 11 000 25 000 and 80 000 bvs are shown finally the two intervention scenarios were combined to evaluate the effect of concurrent changes in the ebct and regeneration time bvreg fig 4 reports the three parameters used to evaluate the human health risk and optimize the gac process namely bqdet bqprob max and p bq 1 as a function of the ebct and the bvreg parameters it can be seen that the ebct has a negligible influence on all the three optimizing parameters compared to the regeneration time therefore the ebct seems not to be a relevant parameter through which optimize bpa removal by gac process as it was expected from the sensitivity analysis results both the deterministic bq and probabilistic maximum bq decrease with the reduction of the regeneration time as well as the probability of exceedance bq equal to 1 using the deterministic approach looking at the deterministic bq a regeneration time equal to 25 000 bv would be selected as the optimal value under which there is no significant risk bqdet 1 while with the quantitative approach it comes out that there is still a 12 0 probability of exceeding bq value equal to 1 therefore the deterministic bq value provides the less precautionary approach which does not identify residual human health risk in specific cases with the probabilistic approach an optimal regeneration time of 13 600 bv has been obtained for the case in which the optimization goal is the maximum probabilistic bq value equal to 1 instead an optimal regeneration time of 11 000 bv would result in a virtual 0 probability of exceedance of bq value equal to 1 since these two probabilistic risk parameters decrease with different trends with the change in the regeneration time it is important to select the proper optimization parameter according to the evaluated risk whether it is an acute or chronic effect moreover a full optimization procedure could include the environmental and economic intervention costs together with the qcra output 4 conclusions in the present work a qcra procedure has been successfully developed highlighting the advantages of a stochastic approach in the assessment of a potential human health risk associated to cecs in drinking water this has been quantitatively estimated performing a characterization of uncertainty for each phase of the risk assessment usually neglected in the conventional deterministic approach compared to conventional deterministic cra where conservative point values are selected the probabilistic qcra procedure exhibits a precautionary approach since it includes uncertainties since for all the analyzed case studies the probabilistic maximum bq value was higher than the deterministic bq value it turned out that the output uncertainty cannot be neglected furthermore the probabilistic qcra provides additional information i e the probability of exceeding the bq threshold value bq 1 which is not considered in the conventional deterministic approach by providing these two different kinds of information the probabilistic qcra procedure shows its adaptive nature and it can be tailored to different contaminants and their potential health effects the probabilistic qcra framework was used for a global sensitivity analysis aimed at identifying the most relevant factors affecting the risk bq output which thus require highest attention in the modeling process the results showed that both the exposure inputs excluded the gac operating conditions and toxicological data have relevant influence on the estimated bq values hence the developed procedure may be also used to address the future research efforts in narrowing the most relevant uncertainties the probabilistic qcra is fit to be used as a decision support tool for water utilities because its results allow to support and quantitatively justify allocation of resources in health risk management measures or control strategies moreover it will be beneficial to apply the developed qcra to different cecs for assessing health effects and dw treatment process configurations in order to provide a comprehensive evaluation and support the

17125,the uncertainties on the occurrence fate and hazard of contaminants of emerging concern cecs increasingly challenge drinking water dw utilities whether additional measures should be taken to reduce the health risk this has led to the development and evaluation of risk based approaches by the scientific community dw guideline values are commonly derived based on deterministic chemical risk assessment cra here we propose a new probabilistic procedure that is a quantitative chemical risk assessment qcra to assess potential health risk related to the occurrence of cecs in dw the qcra includes uncertainties in risk calculation in both exposure and hazard assessments to quantify the health risk in terms of the benchmark quotient probabilistic distribution the qcra estimates the probabilistic distribution of cecs concentration in dw based on their concentration in source water and simulating the breakthrough curves of a granular activated carbon gac treatment process the model inputs and output uncertainties were evaluated by sensitivity and uncertainty analyses for each step of the risk assessment to identify the most relevant factors affecting risk estimation dominant factors resulted to be the concentration of cecs in water sources gac isotherm parameters and toxicological data to stress the potential of this new qcra approach several case studies are considered with focus on bisphenol a as an example cec and various gac management options qcra quantifies the probabilistic risk providing more insight compared to cra qcra proved to be more effective in supporting the intervention prioritization for treatment optimization to pursue health risk minimization graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords contaminants of emerging concern quantitative chemical risk assessment activated carbon adsorption drinking water treatment stochastic modeling 1 introduction over the last years research on drinking water dw has drawn attention towards the occurrence fate and potentially harmful impact on human health of a variety of recently identified compounds of anthropogenic origin often labelled contaminants of emerging concern cecs e g perfluorinated compounds alkylphenols pharmaceuticals pesticides baken et al 2018 in particular differences in human health risks and the large number of different compounds created a need for prioritization and regulation of cecs in dw based on the risk level this is complicated by knowledge gaps that result in uncertainties for both exposure and hazard assessment steps of the procedure who ipcs 2018 as for the exposure assessment despite several studies reporting trace levels of cecs in the aquatic environment staples et al 2018 cecs concentrations in dw are sometimes poorly known also due to the high percentage of censored data namely data lower than the analytical limit of quantification loq cantoni et al 2020 as a consequence the evaluation of this uncertainty is necessary for prioritization in the definition of dw standards lapworth et al 2012 it is therefore important to fill existing knowledge gaps on fate of cecs throughout treatment processes currently applied in drinking water treatment plants dwtps to mitigate potential health risks it is important to assess whether dwtps as currently designed are able to sufficiently remove cecs and if not which additional treatment is the most suitable to be integrated to improve cecs removal among the available treatment processes adsorption onto granular activated carbon gac was so far identified as the best available technology bat for the removal of many cecs westerhoff et al 2005 gac removal efficiency depends on the system operating conditions and decreases over time due to gac saturation with organic matter and cecs breakthrough curves are typically used to describe the gac treatment performance regarding a specific contaminant over time since they define the time trend of the outlet contaminant concentration during filter operation piazzoli and antonelli 2018 the gac performance model and thus the breakthrough curve can be built through numerical simulations based on isotherm and kinetics data collected from batch adsorption tests patterson et al 2019 furthermore mathematical modeling allows a less costly assessment of several non tested operating conditions of the gac treatment and permits the propagation of the uncertainties related to input data resulting in a comprehensive tool able to predict the gac treatment performance athanasaki et al 2015 for the hazard assessment dw regulatory standards are conventionally set based on toxicological data and used for risk characterization not for every cec a regulatory standard is yet derived to manage risks associated with dw baken et al 2018 moreover toxicological studies on cecs are in some cases confidential and they might be incomplete or contradictory schriks et al 2010 in current chemical risk assessment cra in dw applications uncertainties are taken into account by selecting conservative point values such as a high exposure concentration or a lower bound estimate of the health based guideline level bokkers et al 2017 then the ratio between the exposure concentration and the health based guideline level point values is calculated as the deterministic benchmark quotient bq that provides an indication of the risk level baken et al 2018 however replacing the point values by their uncertainty distributions in a quantitative risk assessment would make it possible to evaluate the level of conservatism in the estimated risk and the main sources of uncertainty in the whole procedure who ipcs 2018 few case studies are reported in literature that provide a probabilistic quantification of the risk still these applications include the uncertainty analysis just either on the exposure assessment kavcar et al 2009 thomaidi et al 2020 or in the hazard assessment baird et al 1996 renwick et al 2004 resulting in a risk estimation that is not completely representative of the uncertainties in both aspects exposure and hazard of the risk assessment van der voet and slob 2007 proposed an integrated probabilistic procedure to include both variability and uncertainty in the risk assessment but this approach is relatively time consuming for both the data collection and the distinction of the variability and uncertainty within the assessment another method focusing on the uncertainty of both the exposure and hazard assessment is the aproba plus tool bokkers et al 2017 which applies lognormal uncertainty distributions to the hazard assessment parameters resulting in a confidence interval for the human dose associated with specified protection goals furthermore the tool includes the option to insert an estimation of the exposure uncertainty this method is not a stand alone tool but it requires to be integrated in a broader assessment framework to get case specific inputs from exposure and dose response analyses which also contain uncertainty lapworth et al 2012 to the best of the authors knowledge there are no research studies applying a quantitative chemical risk assessment qcra in the field of dw production and consumption we have developed a comprehensive procedure to implement a qcra that includes dw treatment performance modeling and propagation of uncertainties related to the calculation of cec removal efficiencies qcra results were compared with the conventional cra approach bisphenol a bpa has been selected as the cec representative because it is one of the two cecs together with perfluorinated compounds pfas newly included in the revision of the european drinking water directive european parliament 2018 among the list of compounds to be monitored and for which a regulatory limit has been set gac treatment process was selected for simulations as the most suitable to be integrated in current dwtps since it is the best available technology for bpa removal the simulations underline the benefits of qcra compared to cra in providing more insights and precise indications to water utilities that need to upgrade and optimize the current dwtps to comply with the new proposed limit for bpa in dw sensitivity and uncertainty analyses have been used to rank the parameters which mainly contribute to the risk assessment uncertainty and may need further investigation moreover some case studies have been explored with respect to bpa concentration in source water and gac management options to highlight the potential of qcra as supporting tool for the optimization of the interventions in the whole dw supply system 2 materials and methods 2 1 quantitative chemical risk assessment qcra procedure a probabilistic modeling framework was defined for the development of qcra procedure fig 1 in particular the developed procedure is applied for one of the cecs introduced in the proposed revision of the european drinking water directive namely bpa eu parliament 2020 2 1 1 exposure assessment source water quality and treatment efficacy gac filtration performance has been modeled through aquapriori a python based treatment simulation tool developed by kwr water research institute that provides amongst others breakthrough curves of gac filters vries et al 2017 solutes adsorption on gac is modeled using the ideal adsorbed solution theory iast in its simplified version where the competition of the cecs with natural organic matter nom is considered as dominant while competition with other micropollutants is neglected qi et al 2007 the aquapriori tool was modified to allow simulating with a statistical distribution of input parameters rather than a point value the iast model input parameters are i cec inlet concentration ii gac filter operating conditions empty bed contact time ebct regeneration time as bed volumes bvreg gac particle size and bed porosity and iii freundlich isotherm parameters kf and 1 n for the selected cec input data were collected both from literature and 17 full scale dwtps located in milan area abstracting groundwater as dw source with wells in the confined aquifer from 30 to 100 meters deep and with treatment trains made by gac filters 14 dwtps gac filters in parallel with stripping towers 2 dwtps or gac filters coupled with reverse osmosis membranes on a fraction of gac filters effluent 1 dwtp before the treated water entering the distribution network disinfection by sodium hypochlorite 16 dwtps or uv radiation 1 dwtp is applied for each input parameter the number of available data and their ranges are reported in table 1 while detailed values are shown in table s1 s4 and figure s1 in supplementary materials sm collected data were used to estimate the statistical distribution for each input parameter according to the procedure explained in paragraph 2 2 1 the estimated statistical distributions were used to sample 1 000 data for each input parameter whose combination resulted in 1 000 simulated breakthrough curves under the assumption that the cec concentration in the gac effluent is equal to the cec concentration in dw for each breakthrough curve the quantile corresponding to the 98th percentile of the outlet concentration distribution c98 was selected as indicator of a realistic maximum cec concentration in dw the resulting 1 000 values for c98 were used to estimate the statistical uncertainty distribution of the maximum cec concentration 2 1 2 hazard assessment the hazard assessment was aimed at estimating a health based value namely the drinking water target level dwtl which represents the concentration of a compound that does not result in the exceedance of the tolerable exposure i e a health based guidance level like tdi adi rfd of a consumer over lifetime who 2006 dwtl µg l 1 was calculated by eq 1 baken et al 2018 1 dwtl rfd 1000 p wir where rfd mg kg 1 day 1 is the reference dose p is the allocation factor that is the percentage of risk maximally associated to dw consumption compared to the overall exposure pathways considered as constant and equal to 20 baken et al 2018 wir is the water intake rate l kg 1 day 1 which is the ratio between the daily water consumption and the body weight the dwtl should be sufficiently low to allow safe long term consumption of 2l of tap water for adults of 60 kg i e the wir value was assumed a fixed value of 0 033 l kg 1 day 1 baken et al 2018 for the rfd estimation toxicological data were collected from international statutory guidelines and toxicological studies in particular only guidelines mentioning a toxicological reference study and providing all the specific inputs for the assessment have been considered according to the procedure explained in section s1 in supplementary materials the most recent scientific opinion published by the european food safety authority efsa in 2015 on bpa has been selected as reference for the hazard assessment efsa 2015 efsa identified the mean relative kidney weight from the f1 males in a two generation toxicity study in mice tyl et al 2008 as the critical effect of bpa the point of departure pod was the lower confidence limit of the benchmark dose bmdl10 provided by efsa as 8 96 mg kg 1day 1 while the upper confidence limit of the benchmark dose bmdu10 was 108 9 mg kg 1day 1 in the efsa assessment uncertainty factors of 14 7 2 5 and 10 were applied for interspecies toxicokinetics i e calculation of the human equivalent dose hed interspecies toxicodynamics and intraspecies differences respectively in addition an extra factor of 6 was included to take into account the limitations of the data available on bpa toxicity for mammary gland reproductive neuro behavioural immune and metabolic systems efsa reports a deterministic rfd for external oral exposure to bpa in humans of 4 0 μg kg 1day 1 finally differently from what reported by efsa a duration extrapolation factor was applied for subchronic to chronic conversion the critical effect in the toxicity study tyl et al 2008 is not a developmental or reprotoxic effect but a general toxicity effect on kidney assumed to occur after continuous repeated exposure since the f1 males were exposed up to the age of 14 weeks a factor for duration is considered necessary in the deterministic approach a factor of 2 was used as a default value proposed by the efsa efsa 2012 to derive the uncertainty distribution of the rfd and evaluate which factors are more relevant in the final rfd uncertainty the aproba plus tool was used as described by bokkers et al 2017 the protection goals namely the effect magnitude m and the population incidence i were set to 10 and 1 respectively therefore the output reference dose is the dose at which 1 of the population would be subject to an effect of 10 or more reduction in mean relative kidney weight for the uncertainty factors inputs to the aproba plus tool interspecies intraspecies and duration extrapolation data based default uncertainty distributions provided by the software were applied for the limited data available on bpa toxicity for mammary gland reproductive neuro behavioural immune and metabolic systems the efsa assessment factor of 6 was considered here as the upper 95 confidence limit the possibility that actual additional data on these endpoints would not change the pod is reflected by setting the lower 5 confidence limit of this assessment factor distribution to 1 details on the inputs to the aproba plus tool based on the critical endpoint established by efsa are reported in table s7 and s8 in supplementary materials the estimated rfd statistical distribution wir and allocation factor p were used to calculate 1 000 values of dwtl used to fit its statistical distribution 2 1 3 risk characterization for the risk characterization step once that both the statistical distributions of c98 and dwtl were obtained they were used to sample 1 000 data each from which it has been possible to compute 1 000 bq values according to eq 2 2 bq c 98 dwtl these values were used to estimate the bq statistical distribution see paragraph 2 2 1 the bq statistical distribution was employed to extrapolate two different data i the maximum probabilistic bq bqprob max corresponding to the maximum bq value resulting from the quantitative simulation ii the probability of bq above the health risk threshold value equal to 1 p bq 1 resulting from the bq estimation uncertainties p bq 1 represents the percentage of the total area underlying the bq probability density curve that is above the bq value of 1 moreover the deterministic bq bqdet was estimated as the ratio between the deterministic c98 and the deterministic dwtl calculated from the efsa values according to the conventional cra 2 2 stochastic simulations 2 2 1 definition of input and output data distributions collected inputs and estimated outputs data were used to fit their statistical distribution for each parameter fits to the lognormal weibull gamma beta rayleigh uniform triangular and logistic statistical distributions were tested data fitting to specific distributions were performed with the fit function in the python scipy stats package which applies a maximum likelihood estimation method then the statistical distribution having the minimum akaike information criterion aic was selected because the freundlich isotherm model parameters kf and 1 n are bivariate correlated a multivariate statistical distribution method was applied the gaussian anamorphosis function method with inverse anamorphosis function a linear transformation and the anamorphosis function was used in order to describe the joint probability distribution santoro et al 2015 2 2 2 sensitivity analysis sensitivity analyses were performed on c98 and bq variables a global sensitivity analysis approach was applied a variance based quantitative and all factors at a time aat method was preferred to local sensitivity analysis to describe the whole inputs space dimensionality including interactions among inputs saltelli and annoni 2010 it is based on the first order effect index si in which output variations are induced by varying all the input factors simultaneously therefore the sensitivity to each factor considers the direct influence of that factor as well as the joint influence due to interactions saltelli and annoni 2010 si value identifies the most relevant input factors by assessing their contribution to the model output variance as defined in eq 3 3 s i i v i e i y x i v y where xi is the i th evaluated input y is the evaluated output i represents all the input factors except the i th for each i th evaluated input a series of n values was generated as uniformly distributed between the minimum and the maximum of the collected input data ranges then for each of the evaluated input n values 1 000 combinations of values of all the other input factors i th were sampled from their estimated statistical distributions resulting in 1 000 values of the assessed output y all the inputs were assumed to be independent except for the freundlich isotherm parameters that were jointly sampled from their multivariate statistical distribution similar to the other input parameters all freundlich parameter couples as found in literature were evaluated as the i th input to yield a series of n values 2 2 3 uncertainty analysis uncertainty analysis of the bq output was performed a monte carlo simulation method was applied which allowed for the simultaneous forward propagation of all the inputs uncertainties into the output distribution saltelli and annoni 2010 all the inputs found to be relevant in the sensitivity analysis were simultaneously sampled from their estimated statistical distributions and randomly combined for a total of 1 000 simulations resulting in 1 000 values of bq whose statistical distribution has been fitted to check whether 1 000 simulations were enough to get stable outputs the whole procedure was repeated four times then pairwise comparisons were performed with the kolmogorov smirnov test to test whether the four resulting bq samples were drawn from the same continuous distribution moreover it was checked that the standard errors for several percentiles table s13 of the bq distributions were below 10 2 3 qcra application for systems management and optimization the developed qcra procedure has been applied to three different case studies in the first two case studies it has been assumed to have a drinking water source contaminated with bpa having the maximum concentration measured cin max and distributed according to the literature data see table 1 and table s1 two cases have been simulated i dw no gac in which there is not a gac process in the dwtp and thus no cecs removal is assumed to occur ii dw gac in which a gac process is present but it is managed aiming at the removal of conventional pollutants implying a high regeneration time bvreg 80 000 bv in the third case study the worst case scenario with gac treatment wcs gac has been assessed assuming the highest bpa concentration in source water found in literature namely 43 μg l constantly entering the dwtp in which there is a gac process managed for conventional pollutants removal bvreg 80 000 bv in addition other two intervention scenarios derived from wcs gac were simulated for exploring the potential of qcra for the optimization of the gac process specifically the first intervention scenario is an upgrading scenario wcs gac up in which the gac process is upgraded by increasing the number of gac filters in parallel up to an optimal value being the ebct the input parameter to be optimized while the second intervention scenario simulates an optimal management scenario wcs gac manag in which the regeneration frequency of the gac filters was managed with reference to bpa being the bvreg the optimization parameter as for the exposure assessment step of the qcra procedure the freundlich isotherm parameter pairs found in literature were reduced exclusively to those found for gac applications in dw production see table s4 values and assumptions for inputs variables are summarized in table s9 for all the case studies for each case study both the traditional cra and the developed qcra procedures have been performed the cra output namely the bqdet was compared to the two qcra indexes bqprob max 1 and p bq 1 0 defined in paragraph 2 1 3 in particular for the two intervention scenarios wcs gac up and wcs gac manag the optimal values of the considered input parameter were obtained at bqdet 1 for the cra while both conditions of bqprob max 1 and p bq 1 0 were evaluated for the qcra 3 results and discussion the qcra procedure development as reported in fig 1 has been performed firstly identifying the statistical distribution of each input parameter that was fed to exposure assessment hazard assessment and risk characterization models to estimate the outputs distributions the resulting statistical distributions their parameters and the aic numbers obtained for each fitted statistical distribution are reported in table s10 results of the sensitivity and uncertainty analyses as well as the application of the developed procedure to the representative case studies is here reported to show how decision makers water utilities and scientific community may benefit from including the uncertainties within risk assessment rather than selecting deterministic point values 3 1 sensitivity analysis one of the main benefits of applying a quantitative risk assessment procedure including the related uncertainties is that the output can highlight which aspects display the main contribution to the overall uncertainty and therefore what type of additional information should be collected to increase the accuracy in the modeling process reducing the assessment uncertainty bokkers et al 2017 in particular this was achieved through two sensitivity analyses to identify which inputs among the set required for exposure and hazard assessment steps affect mostly c98 and dwtl outputs respectively then limiting the analysis to these dominant inputs a sensitivity analysis has been performed to evaluate which inputs are more influencing on the bq estimation accuracy as for the exposure assessment the shapes of the modeled breakthrough curves provide qualitative information about the influence of each input parameter on the c98 output in particular a substantial difference in breakthrough curves between the minimum and maximum value of the analyzed input parameter indicates that this input has a relevant influence on the c98 output examples of breakthrough curves obtained varying ebct and couples of freundlich isotherm parameters are reported in fig 2 while graphs for the other input parameters are shown in figure s3 the ebct parameter seems not to have relevant influence on the breakthrough curves shape in the analyzed range i e differences in breakthrough curves are graphically almost indistinguishable between minimum and maximum ebct values fig 2a and 2b instead it is evident that a variation in freundlich parameter values imply a substantial variation in the resulting breakthrough curves and consequently have an effect on the c98 it is important to notice that some curves exceed more than a 100 breakthrough ratio without extensive analysis we postulate that competitive effects of nom cause these overshoots as nom was included as a possibly competing substance in the simulation of bpa sorption and breakthrough corwin and summers 2011 due to competition with nom desorption and subsequent release of adsorbed cec bpa in this case would lead to elution with non adsorbed cec hand et al 1997 in addition to visual inspection of the breakthrough curves the si values were calculated for each input in order to quantitatively identify and rank the most relevant input factors affecting the c98 output recall that a higher si implies a higher influence of the input parameter on the output results are reported in table 2 it emerges that for each operating condition ebct bvreg bed porosity and particle size the si values are at least one order of magnitude lower than the one for freundlich isotherm parameters and inlet bpa concentration therefore operating conditions turned out not to have significant effects on the variability of the c98 output for the studied cec or at least to be less relevant compared to freundlich isotherm parameters and inlet bpa concentration consequently only the uncertainties related to freundlich isotherm parameters and inlet bpa concentration were considered in the bq sensitivity analysis as for the hazard assessment step the aproba plus tool provides analyses on which of the assessment uncertainty factors reported by efsa have the main contribution to the overall rfd uncertainty see table s11 the greatest contributor to the rfd uncertainty is the assessment factor accounting for the intraspecies differences with 28 contribution followed by the duration extrapolation factor 25 contribution the uncertainty on the pod value 20 and the interspecies factor 17 finally 10 of the rfd uncertainty is due to the efsa assessment factor taking into account the limitations of the data available on bpa toxicity for mammary gland reproductive neuro behavioral immune and metabolic systems as a consequence a stochastic approach is highly recommended to include the uncertainties related to available toxicological data in the evaluation these uncertainties affect the final output of the risk analysis in particular for a class of contaminants as the cecs where a gap of knowledge is certainly present and further toxicological studies are expected to be published chiu and slob 2015 for the risk characterization assessment step the sensitivity analysis was performed on the bq output to prioritize those qcra inputs that were found to be the dominant factors in the previous steps from results in table 2 it is possible to note that si indexes for the three inputs are all in the same order of magnitude and therefore both parameters describing the gac process and toxicological data have a significant influence on the estimated bq this suggests that when predicting the gac performance towards bpa it is important to precisely estimate the source water concentration and to test the selected gac performance with the real source water through batch experiments in order to evaluate the case specific freundlich isotherm parameters actually these considerations can apply also to cecs other than bpa moreover more toxicological data on bpa hazard on several specific endpoints e g mammary gland reproductive neuro behavioural immune and metabolic systems will make the assessment factor for the incomplete toxicity information redundant efsa is currently re evaluating bpa in case additional toxicity data does not warrant the choice of another pod due to a more sensitive endpoint the uncertainty in the rfd can be reduced by eliminating the assessment factor accounting for the limited available data consequently the uncertainty in the dwtl and final bq is also reduced 3 2 uncertainty analysis the main advantage of a probabilistic framework for risk assessment is the possibility to reproduce the observed variability of source water quality and cecs affinity towards gac and the uncertainties related to cecs toxicity in contrast to a deterministic procedure where a single expected bq is estimated the probabilistic framework can provide its whole probability distribution and therefore more insight about its accuracy and reliability in addition this approach permits to relate the design of a gac process to health risk probability highlighting the effective benefits of a specific design assumption in order to highlight more clearly such benefits the probabilistic qcra output was compared to the results obtained by the deterministic cra in the qcra uncertainty analysis 1 000 monte carlo simulations were performed sampling simultaneously from their distributions all the relevant inputs while keeping constant the gac process operating conditions not being relevant the procedure was repeated four times and 1 000 monte carlo simulations were confirmed to be enough to get stable outputs in fact the standard errors for the main percentiles of the four bq distributions were below 10 table s12 moreover pairwise comparisons of the four bq outputs with kolmogorov smirnov tests resulted in all p values above the significance level α 0 05 table s13 meaning that the four bq outputs can be assumed to follow the same distribution starting from the exposure assessment the probabilistic qcra procedure shows the wide range of breakthrough curves figure s4 which are calculated by sampling from the whole model inputs uncertainty distributions compared to the single gac breakthrough curve obtained with the deterministic cra assuming the maximum cin max and the qsar quantitative structure activity relationship predicted parameters of freundlich isotherm set as default in the aquapriori tool for the hazard assessment the deterministic dwtl is equal to 12 0 µg l estimated from the efsa rfd 4 0 μg kg 1 day 1 the duration extrapolation factor of 2 and assuming standard daily water consumption 2 l and body weight 60 kg baken et al 2018 the aproba plus provides an approximate probabilistic rfd defined as the 5 percentile of the target human dose hd1 10 equal to 3 69 μg kg 1 day 1 that is slightly lower than the efsa rfd although different assumptions and probabilistic uncertainty factors have been considered table s14 considering the whole rfd distribution provided by the aproba plus the qcra output provides a statistical distribution for the dwtl fig 3 a well described by a lognormal distribution with mean 5 93 μg l and standard deviation 1 725 both the deterministic dwtl and most of the probabilistic dwtl distribution exceed the parametric value for bpa in the revised european drinking water directive 2 5 µg l eu parliament 2020 indicating that this can be considered sufficiently protective lastly according to the conventional deterministic cra the bqdet is equal to 0 004 indicating that there is no human health risk linked to bpa in treated dw as for the probabilistic qcra considering only a central statistic of the bq statistical distribution like the average that is equal to 0 01 leads to a result in agreement with the one obtained by the deterministic approach however with the qcra the maximum bq can be calculated reflecting a conservative estimate of the risk for individuals who are highly exposed and sensitive to the effects of bpa this analysis suggests that when consuming 2l of tap water a potential health risk cannot be excluded in specific cases since the maximum probabilistic bq that is the 99 percentile of the bq distribution is equal to 1 15 and the probability of exceeding the bq threshold value of 1 is equal to 0 2 another benefit of the probabilistic approach is that it provides two different parameters that relate to two different features of the human health risk in fact exposure to chemicals can have acute or chronic effects on human health depending on their severity and duration acute effects usually occur rapidly as a result of short term exposures to high pollutants concentrations uncommon for cecs in water while chronic effects can generally occur as a result of long term exposure to lower concentrations schultz et al 2003 therefore when the analyzed hazard is likely to have an acute effect on human health the maximum probabilistic bq should be the most important parameter to be assessed and reduced describing the most critical situation that could happen even with low probability on the other hand when the analyzed hazard is likely to have a chronic effect on human health as it can be the case of dw pollution with cecs the probability of bq values exceeding the threshold value bq 1 should be the most important parameter to be reduced considering not only the most critical concentration at which the consumer could be in contact but also all the concentrations higher than the threshold value and the probability that the consumer would drink contaminated water 3 3 qcra application to case studies definition of interventions based only on the compliance with quality standards can be unfeasible or ineffective due to the multiplicity of cecs which are or might be present in a water supply source as well as the differentiated efficiency of gac process instead it is proposed here that prioritization of interventions to reduce concentrations of cecs should be based on the avoided health risk hadi et al 2019 three case studies were identified dw no gac dw gac wcs gac to explore the potential of the developed qcra procedure in providing a valid support to tune monitoring campaigns and design management measures to minimize health risk due to bpa and more generally to cecs in the first two case studies a dw source is polluted by bpa with a maximum measured concentration cin max distributed according to literature data see table 1 and table s1 in the case study dw no gac since supplied water does not undergo a gac process maximum bpa concentration c98 in dw is distributed as the maximum bpa concentration cin max in source water while in the dw gac case the dw source undergoes a gac treatment throughout the dwtp in the third case study wcs gac a dw source polluted by the highest bpa maximum concentration cin max found in literature namely 43 μg l was assumed in case studies comprising a gac process it was assumed that gac process was managed looking exclusively at conventional micropollutants breakthrough thus no specific measures are taken to address cecs removal the simulated breakthrough curves for the dw gac and wcs gac case studies are reported in figure s5 and the statistical distributions of the estimated c98 dwtl and corresponding bq are reported in fig 3 for the three case studies the deterministic cra and probabilistic qcra outputs are reported in table 3 both dw case studies show that no human health risks is identified based on the deterministic approach revealing a no risk situation bqdet 0 04 on the other hand the application of the probabilistic qcra allows to highlight that in both cases there is a potential risk in specific cases being the p bq 1 greater than zero with maximum probabilistic bq of 1 55 and 1 62 in absence and in presence of a gac process respectively comparing the bq parameters found in the two dw case studies without a specific treatment and with gac process managed for conventional pollutants it is clear that bq values in both deterministic cra and probabilistic qcra are very similar this finding highlights that if the gac process present in a dwtp is managed looking only at conventional micropollutants bpa approaches the complete breakthrough during the gac filter functioning see figure s5a making the adsorption process no longer effective in reducing bpa outlet concentration as a parameter for bpa has been included in the proposed revision of the european drinking water directive eu parliament 2020 it is important to design and manage the gac process accordingly in addition the probabilistic quantitative approach contrarily to the deterministic one can be useful to select the more appropriate operating conditions to minimize the actual health risk based on the joint analyses of bqprob max and p bq 1 deriving from each operating conditions evaluated moreover it can be observed that the p bq 1 in case of presence of the gac process is slightly higher than the one in the case without gac process this could be due to the breakthrough curves shapes that show effluent concentrations exceeding the influent concentration for a while during filter functioning hand et al 1997 it is essential to consider this aspect since there could be situations in which the outlet maximum concentration c98 is higher than the concentration in dw source this finding points out that monitoring cec concentration only in the dw source could lead to a risk underestimation and that coupling the monitoring with the modeling of the gac process performance is beneficial for a more accurate risk assessment for the wcs gac case study the high regeneration time leads to the complete bpa breakthrough and a probability of 24 80 of exceeding the bq threshold value in this case also the deterministic approach would have revealed a risk with the bq higher than 1 but again the probabilistic maximum bq is one order of magnitude higher than the deterministic one 3 4 intervention scenarios optimization for risk minimization both the deterministic cra and probabilistic qcra procedures applied to the wcs gac scenario highlighted that the gac process designed and managed for conventional pollutants resulted to be ineffective to prevent human health risk in case of high bpa inlet concentration thus the qcra procedure was applied to evaluate the efficiency of gac process optimization interventions in minimizing the health risk as benchmark the conventional deterministic cra was used the first simulated intervention scenario wcs gac up is a typical intervention applied by the water utilities managers that is the gac process upgrade with an increase in the number of parallel filters treating the supplied water in fact the flowrate per filter would decrease by increasing the filters number raising the ebct and determining a reduction of the maximum outlet concentration which means a lower bq value and a lower probability to exceed bq value equal to 1 in particular it should be possible to estimate the number of filters reducing the probability to virtually 0 if smaller than 1e 5 it is considered zero which represents the optimal number of filters in practice the ebct was the parameter to be optimized since it was one of the aquapriori inputs and it can be easily related to the filters number as it was in the input of the sensitivity analysis the ebct has been varied between 8 and 20 minutes since operating at higher ebct is proven not to improve the gac filter performance in terms of the total water volume treated between two regenerations crittenden et al 2012 figure s6 shows the breakthrough curves and the bq values statistical distribution obtained at the minimum 8 minutes and maximum 20 minutes ebct values the second simulated scenario wcs gac manag is related to a management intervention where the gac regeneration frequency is the parameter to be optimized in fact by reducing the time between two gac filter regenerations the breakthrough curve is interrupted in advance resulting in a lower cec maximum outlet concentration and thus a lower bq value consequently the probability of exceeding bq value equal to 1 will be lower therefore in the present optimization the goal is to determine the time of regeneration bvreg that makes that probability to virtually 0 in this case while the currently applied regeneration time ranges between 20 000 and 80 000 bvs table 1 the bvreg range for the optimization based on bpa was tested between 0 and 80 000 bvs although more frequent regenerations compared to conventional operation would imply higher operating and environmental costs it is an effective solution to mitigate health risks due to the occurrence of bpa in dw in figure s7 the breakthrough curves and the c98 dwtl and bq statistical distribution obtained at regeneration with 11 000 25 000 and 80 000 bvs are shown finally the two intervention scenarios were combined to evaluate the effect of concurrent changes in the ebct and regeneration time bvreg fig 4 reports the three parameters used to evaluate the human health risk and optimize the gac process namely bqdet bqprob max and p bq 1 as a function of the ebct and the bvreg parameters it can be seen that the ebct has a negligible influence on all the three optimizing parameters compared to the regeneration time therefore the ebct seems not to be a relevant parameter through which optimize bpa removal by gac process as it was expected from the sensitivity analysis results both the deterministic bq and probabilistic maximum bq decrease with the reduction of the regeneration time as well as the probability of exceedance bq equal to 1 using the deterministic approach looking at the deterministic bq a regeneration time equal to 25 000 bv would be selected as the optimal value under which there is no significant risk bqdet 1 while with the quantitative approach it comes out that there is still a 12 0 probability of exceeding bq value equal to 1 therefore the deterministic bq value provides the less precautionary approach which does not identify residual human health risk in specific cases with the probabilistic approach an optimal regeneration time of 13 600 bv has been obtained for the case in which the optimization goal is the maximum probabilistic bq value equal to 1 instead an optimal regeneration time of 11 000 bv would result in a virtual 0 probability of exceedance of bq value equal to 1 since these two probabilistic risk parameters decrease with different trends with the change in the regeneration time it is important to select the proper optimization parameter according to the evaluated risk whether it is an acute or chronic effect moreover a full optimization procedure could include the environmental and economic intervention costs together with the qcra output 4 conclusions in the present work a qcra procedure has been successfully developed highlighting the advantages of a stochastic approach in the assessment of a potential human health risk associated to cecs in drinking water this has been quantitatively estimated performing a characterization of uncertainty for each phase of the risk assessment usually neglected in the conventional deterministic approach compared to conventional deterministic cra where conservative point values are selected the probabilistic qcra procedure exhibits a precautionary approach since it includes uncertainties since for all the analyzed case studies the probabilistic maximum bq value was higher than the deterministic bq value it turned out that the output uncertainty cannot be neglected furthermore the probabilistic qcra provides additional information i e the probability of exceeding the bq threshold value bq 1 which is not considered in the conventional deterministic approach by providing these two different kinds of information the probabilistic qcra procedure shows its adaptive nature and it can be tailored to different contaminants and their potential health effects the probabilistic qcra framework was used for a global sensitivity analysis aimed at identifying the most relevant factors affecting the risk bq output which thus require highest attention in the modeling process the results showed that both the exposure inputs excluded the gac operating conditions and toxicological data have relevant influence on the estimated bq values hence the developed procedure may be also used to address the future research efforts in narrowing the most relevant uncertainties the probabilistic qcra is fit to be used as a decision support tool for water utilities because its results allow to support and quantitatively justify allocation of resources in health risk management measures or control strategies moreover it will be beneficial to apply the developed qcra to different cecs for assessing health effects and dw treatment process configurations in order to provide a comprehensive evaluation and support the

17126,in this study visible light vl was adopted for permanganate pm activation without additional catalyst where sulfamethazine smt was selected as the probe compound experiment results showed that the vl pm system can effectively degrade smt through pseudo first order reaction kinetics influencing factors including pm dosage solution ph humid acid ha and coexisting anions co3 2 so4 2 cl and no3 which affect smt photo degradation were also examined pyrophosphate pp had an inhibitory effect on smt degradation due to the complexation of pp with mn iii electron spin resonance esr spectrometry and uv vis spectrophotometer proved that vl can activate pm to generate o2 and mn iii reactive species furthermore based on the active site prediction intermediates identification and density functional theory dft calculation two main degradation pathways involving smt molecular rearrangement and cleavage of s n bond were proposed moreover the energy barriers of the two degradation pathways were also calculated this study offers a novel approach for aqueous smt removal and deepens our understanding of the degradation mechanism of smt through dft calculation which hopes to shed light on the future development of vl pm treatment graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords permanganate sulfamethazine trivalent manganese superoxide radical degradation pathway density functional theory 1 introduction as an important class of broad spectrum antibiotics sulfonamides are widely used in human medicine aquaculture and livestock production tian et al 2020 zhang et al 2016a however due to their incomplete metabolism and uncontrolled release these compounds with high levels of concentrations were detected in natural environment qin et al 2020 due to their persistence and toxicity sulfonamides residues have led to the development and spread of sulfonamide resistance in environmental pathogens zhou et al 2019b sulfamethazine smt as a typical sulfonamide is widespread in river soil sediment underground water and sewage plant treatment effluents fan et al 2015 the reported residual concentrations generally range from ng l to μg l fan et al 2015 the undesirable smt residues show strongly adverse effects such as endocrine disruption to humans and animals chronic toxicity to human s body zhang et al 2019 in addition long term exposure causes the emergence of resistance in intestinal microorganisms further binding to pathogens through horizontal gene transfer therefore conducting an efficient method to remove smt in the environment is essential to protect the ecosystem and human health to date various chemical oxidation techniques have been used to degrade smt in aqueous phase yang et al 2020 including oxidation by ferrate vi feng et al 2018 chlorine or ozone liu et al 2019a advanced oxidation processes aops such as fenton or fenton like cheng et al 2019 cheng et al 2018 photocatalysis zhou et al 2019a uv h2o2 and uv persulfate acosta rangel et al 2018 zhang et al 2016b compared with other oxidants permanganate pm kmno4 has the advantages of relatively stable ease of storage and delivery wide ph operating range and high standard redox potential 0 558 v 1 692 v yan et al 1999 these characteristics allow pm to be successfully applied to remove various recalcitrant pollutants such as chlorophene xu et al 2018 triclosan gao et al 2018 and microcystins kim et al 2018 however there is limited knowledge on the treatment of sulfonamides e g smt with pm this may due to the fact that pm only reacts with contaminants containing electron rich organic moieties pm is a selective oxidant gao et al 2014 to solve this problem some activation methods such as some ligands hu et al 2017 jin et al 2010 e g ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid edta sodium pyrophosphate pp humic acid ha bisulfite feng et al 2018 zhong and zhang 2019 iodide li et al 2018 are employed to activate pm to produce reactive manganese species e g manganite mn vi hypomanganate mn v and trivalent manganese mn iii although the addition of these external reagents appear to be valid they are either toxic or cause an increase in organic carbon content therefore it is difficult to apply into large scale water treatment light radiation is commonly employed to activate oxidants e g h2o2 persulfate monochloramine to enhance the generation of reactive radicals bu et al 2018 miklos et al 2019 e g oh so4 cl nh2 etc thus increasing the degradation of contaminants moreover photolysis is also an important decay process of smt in natural water previous studies observed that pm photodecomposition will produce higher reactive manganese such as mno2 and mno2 guo et al 2018 lee et al 1987 as shown in eq 1 and eq 2 thus we have reason to believe that the use of visible light vl radiation can effectively activate pm and generate highly reactive species however there is no information on the contribution of these high valent manganese intermediates in the presence of pm under vl system refer as vl pm system meanwhile information on sulfonamides removal such as smt mechanism by pm under vl system is inconclusive consequently investigating the effects of light irradiation on the pm activation performance and mechanism for organic compound degradation using both experimental and theoretical calculation methods taking smt with light irradiation as an example will be highly useful and promising 1 mno4 hν mno2 o2 2 mno4 hν mno2 o2 in this study we systematically investigated the degradation of smt under the vl pm system the present paper focuses on the following points i investigate the efficiency of vl irradiation on the pm activation ii discuss the effect of solution ph pm dosage anions co3 2 so4 2 cl and no3 and ha concentration on the degradation of smt in the vl pm system iii evaluate the feasibility of the vl pm process for smt removal in natural waters iv determine reactive species in the vl pm process v identify the oxidation products by high performance liquid chromatography triple quaternary rod tandem mass spectrometer hplc ms and propose the degradation pathways and verify by density functional theory dft calculation 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials smt was purchased from sinopharm chemical reagent co ltd its physicochemical properties were listed in table s1 potassium permanganate kmno4 acetic acid hac sodium hydroxide naoh and p benzoquinone bq were also obtained from sinopharm chemical reagent co ltd all other chemicals used in this work were at least analytical grade ultrapure water 18 2 mω cm was used for the preparation of aqueous solutions stock solutions of mn vii 40 mm were prepared by dissolving kmno4 crystals in ultrapure water 2 2 experimental procedures all photochemical experiments is conducted in 150 ml quartz beakers under magnetic agitation 400 r min in the absence presence vl 300w xe lamp with a cut off filter λ 420 nm light intensity is about 300 mw cm2 300w xe lamp is turned on 5 min to ensure a relatively stable output in the light experiment the vl reaction system is the same as our previous research wang et al 2020 typically 50 μm of pm is added into the solution containing 10 mg l smt at pre determined times 0 10 20 30 45 60 90 min about 1 ml of the sample is filtered with 0 22 μm filter membrane and rapidly transferred into a 2 ml chromatography sample bottle vials containing 100 μl of 1 m hydroxylamine hydrochloride to terminate the reaction the solution ph is adjusted by 0 1 m hac and 0 1 m of naoh all experiments are performed at least in triplicate and the mean values are adopted to ensure reproducibility 2 3 analytical methods the smt concentration is analyzed by a high performance liquid chromatography hplc agilent 1260 usa equipped with a uv vis detector the column is c 18 column 4 µm particle size 4 6 250 mm at the temperature of 30 c the hplc analysis method for smt is based on the previous study qin et al 2020 mobile phase 65 h2o and 35 acetonitrile ch3cn flow rate 1 ml min injection volume 20 µl and a 266 nm detection wavelength the concentration of residual pm is determined by tu 1810 uv vis spectrophotometer at 525 nm and smt mineralization is measured by a toc 5000a model analyzer the generated radicals o2 and oh are examined by electron spin resonance esr jes fa200 using 5 5 dimethyl 1 pyrroline n oxide dmpo as spin trap reagent the oxidation byproducts of smt are identified by hplc ms the detailed description of the operation condition of hplc ms is provided in text s1 in the supplementary material 2 4 theoretical calculation the calculations of all geometric structure is performed by gaussian 16 frisch et al 2016 with the density functional theory dft method grimme et al 2011 hariharan and pople 1973 the geometry optimizations are conducted using the b3lyp functional with 6 31g d basis set for the all atoms the transition states are performed with the same method and basis set and intrinsic reaction coordinate irc calculation is also conducted to ensure that the transition state does connect two related minimums after all the structures are optimized the single point energies are evaluated with the m06 2x functional with 6 311 g d p basis set for the all atoms r et al 1980 zhao and truhlar 2007 zhao and truhlar 2008 it is worth noting that dft d dispersion correction grimme 2011 is added to the calculations to better describe the weak interactions among molecules solvation effects were considered in the smt solvation calculations and pcm implicit solvation model barone and cossi 1998 was adopted in addition the fukui function f r lu and chen 2012 is introduced to analyze vulnerable sites of smt details on dft calculation can be found in text s2 in the supplementary material these data are used to predict the site of reactive species attack on smt during the oxidation process 3 results and discussions 3 1 reaction kinetics 3 1 1 effect of visible light radiation on pm oxidation of smt to investigate the roles of vl on pm activation the degradation of smt by vl alone direct photolysis pm alone and vl pm is systematically studied as shown in fig 1 a when subjected to vl irradiation alone only 2 03 of smt is removed within 90 min there is 34 63 removal of smt in the presence of 50 µm pm without light irradiation however the addition of 50 µm pm with vl irradiation significantly enhance smt degradation efficiency the removal efficiency 85 50 is much higher than the sum of the efficiencies of photolysis and pm oxidation furthermore the degradation of smt could be well simulated by pseudo first order kinetics fig 1b which is described as eq 3 the rate constant kobs of the vl pm is as high as 0 0217 min 1 much higher than that of vl alone 0 0003 min 1 and pm oxidation 0 0047 min 1 indicating the existence of synergistic effect 3 ln c t c 0 k o b s t where c0 and ct represent the concentration of smt at reaction times of t 0 and t t respectively and kobs is the pseudo first order rate constants min 1 the change of pm concentration over time during pm oxidation and vl pm process is also investigated as shown in figure s1 the residual pm concentration in vl pm process is almost twice as high as that in pm oxidation after 90 min reaction suggesting that vl irradiation can considerable alleviate the consumption of pm in the vl pm based on the above results it is reasonable to speculate that reactive species are generated in the vl pm system lee et al 1987 therefore the enhancement mechanism needed to be investigated in great detail 3 1 2 effect of pm dosage to further understand the removal efficiency of smt in vl pm process the effect of different concentrations of pm on smt degradation is studied fig 1c shows that smt degradation obviously relies on pm dosage the removal efficiency of smt increases from 2 03 to 99 08 when pm dosage increases from 0 to 200 µm correspondingly the kobs increases from 0 0003 min 1 to 0 0555 min 1 fig 1d the phenomenon indicates that higher pm dosage leads to a better degradation efficiency and degradation rate which is different from the traditional aops that had an optimum dosage of oxidizer xue et al 2020 however excess oxidant can lead to an unnecessary consumption of pm thus unless otherwise stated the selected pm dosage is 50 µm in the following experiments 3 1 3 effect of solution ph it is widely accepted that ph condition affected the oxidation ability and stability of pm because of the existence of various acid base dependent mn vii species and the speciation of smt is highly dependent on environmental ph figure s2 gao et al 2012 zhang et al 2016a thus solution ph may play a significance role in compound reactivity in this study the effect of solution ph 3 93 10 85 on the vl pm system for smt removal is evaluated as shown in the fig 2 a 83 47 of smt is removed at ph 3 93 within 45 min while only 2 93 is removed at ph 10 85 within 90 min in addition figure s3 depicts the variation of kobs with the solution ph change it can be seen that the degradation rate of smt decreases gradually with the increasing solution ph with the increase of solution ph from 3 93 to 10 85 kobs drops sharply from 0 0305 min 1 to 0 0005 min 1 as a result an acidic circumstance is more conducive to smt removal in the vl pm system the reasons may be that pm has undergone a series of disproportionation and reduction reactions under acidic conditions eventually leading to manganese oxide mno2 or mn ii as the final product in addition the redox potential of mn vii under acidic conditions 1 51 v eq 4 is higher than that of under neutral conditions 0 58 v eq 5 and alkaline conditions 0 56 v eq 6 hu et al 2018 meanwhile the in situ generation of mno2 shows more reactive under acidic conditions which is favorable for smt degradation xu et al 2018 previous studies also demonstrated that mno2 could accelerate the oxidation kinetics of organics in the process of pm oxidation gao et al 2012 hu et al 2018 therefore acidic condition is conducive to improving the oxidation ability of pm 4 mno4 8 h 5 e mn2 4 h2o 5 mno4 2 h2o 3 e mno2 4 oh 6 mno4 e mno4 2 3 1 3 effect of anions and humic acid on smt degradation the effect of anions e g co3 2 so4 2 cl and no3 and ha on smt removal is evaluated by using initial pm concentration of 50 μm under vl irradiation as shown in fig 2b the addition of individual so4 2 cl and no3 could slightly promote the degradation of smt the reason is that so4 2 cl and no3 play a role in delaying the decomposition of pm han et al 2013 further facilitating the oxidation reaction of pm compared with so4 2 cl and no3 the degradation efficiency of smt is significantly inhibited by the presence of co3 2 to be specific the removal efficiency is only 12 2 after 90 min in the presence of 0 5 mm it is also observed that the value of solution ph is increased from 6 43 to 8 15 as mentioned in section 3 1 3 the redox potential of mn vii is as low as 0 56 v under alkaline conditions liu et al 2016 observed a similar inhibitory effect as the addition of co3 2 would lead to the equilibration of co3 2 hco3 moreover co3 is a common free radicals scavenger qian et al 2016 thus resulting in a low efficiency fig 2c shows that ha exhibited a double edge role in the degradation of smt in the vl pm system ha with a low concentration level 5 mg l has a mild effect in promoting oxidation of smt by pm which is ascribed to the reductive properties of ha increasing the generation of mno2 sun et al 2013 yang et al 2018 meanwhile ha could complex with mn iii eq 7 and then successively produce o2 eq 8 and oh eq 9 jin et al 2010 xu et al 2017 however when the ha concentration is further increased from 5 mg l to 10 mg l the removal efficiency decreases from 86 34 to 65 95 on the one hand more pm is consumed under high level concentration of ha which leads to the reduction of smt removal rate on the other hand excessive ha could compete with target compound for secondary oxidants e g mno2 o2 oh chow and sze yin leung 2019 which also inhibits the oxidation of smt 7 mn vii 4 ha mn ii ha 5 ha mn iii 8 2 ha mn iii o2 2 h2o 2 mn ii 2 o2 4 h 2 ha 9 o2 h2o ho2 oh 10 ho2 h2o oh h2o2 3 1 4 degradation of smt in different water matrices to better understand the oxidation of smt in natural water four types of water such as ultrapure water uw tap water tw xiangjiang river water xrw and peach lake water plw are used in the experiments the characteristics of the four types of water are listed in table s2 as shown in fig 3 a the degradation of smt is inhibited in the three real water bodies compared to that in uw the tendency of toc removal rate is consistent with smt when the removal efficiency of smt is high the toc removal ratio is also relatively high fig 3b the results indicate that coexisting substances in natural water matrices may compete with smt for oxidants which affects the degradation efficiency of smt 3 2 identification of the reactive species 3 2 1 reactive oxygen radicals firstly the generation of reactive oxygen radicals was the most common reason why light irradiation can improve the activity of oxidants luo et al 2019 according to the previous study guo et al 2018 oh and o2 were most likely to be produced in the oxidation process to investigate the roles of reactive oxygen radicals played in vl pm system methanol meoh and tert butanol tba are used as scavengers of oh and p benzoquinone pbq serves as o2 quencher in the vl pm meoh and vl pm tba the degradation of smt is not inhibited but improved there are 2 17 and 11 15 higher than that of control group 85 50 fig 4 a the reason is that meoh and tba are transformed into alkyl radicals r further increasing the reduction of pm hu et al 2018 however the addition of pbq sharply hinders the degradation of smt its removal efficiency after 90 min reaction decreases from 85 50 to 34 19 as 2 mm of pbq is added fig 4a therefore the results indicate that o2 plays a dominant role while oh plays an insignificant role for the degradation of smt in vl pm system to further confirm the existence of radicals esr analysis with dmpo are performed in meoh and ultrapure water for o2 and oh detection respectively wang et al 2020 yin et al 2018 it could be seen from the esr spectrum fig 4b that no signals of dmpo o2 and dmpo oh are detected in the dark however the characteristic signals of dmpo o2 with an intensity ratio of 1 1 1 1 and dmpo oh with an intensity ratio of 1 2 2 1 could be observed under vl irradiation suggesting the generation of o2 and oh during the vl pm system in particular the peak intensity of o2 significantly increases with the irradiation time from 5 min to 10 min and its intensity signals is much higher than that of dmpo oh the results confirm that o2 is the primary reactive oxygen radicals in the vl pm process which is consistent with the results of free radical trapping tests 3 2 2 reactive manganese species secondly the generation of intermediate manganese is speculated during the activation of potassium permanganate under vl theoretically intermediate manganeses involve mn vi mn iv mn iii and mn ii while mn iv and mn ii are relatively stable and difficult to react with pollutants simandi et al 1984 experimental results fig 2a prove that mn vi does not react with smt to explore the activation mechanism tu 1810 uv vis spectrophotometer is used to investigate the absorbance spectra of the solution at different reaction times during dark and vl system as seen in fig 5 a b there is also no change in the absorption peak of mn vi at 610 nm thus mn vi is ruled out it is noting that the intensities of the absorption peak at 300 nm 500 nm of the reaction solution in vl pm system are higher than that of the dark system this is mainly due to the accumulation of mno2 and mn2 jiang et al 2015 simandi et al 1984 the result indicates that the involvement of vl promotes mno2 formed during the vl pm system 11 mn3 e mn2 12 2 mn3 2 h2o mno2 mn2 4 h furthermore it is reported that mn iii processes a high oxidation property for one electron transfer reactions 1 54 v eq 11 kostka et al 1995 with the negative free energy of reaction δg mn iii is labile and easily disproportionate to mn ii or mn iv davies 1968 eq 12 pp is a commonly used mn iii complexing agent which would lead to mn iii pp formed the formed mn iii pp has a characteristic absorbance peak at 258 nm webb et al 2005 to ascertain whether mn iii is important in the vl pm system the effect of pp on smt degradation is investigated and corresponding uv vis spectra at 200 nm 800 nm after 90 min reaction is compared as shown in fig 5c the degradation of smt is significantly suppressed by the addition of pp and the inhibiting effect increases with the increase of pp concentration 50 μm 200 μm and 1000 μm adding 1000 μm of pp almost completely inhibits the degradation of smt pm 0 50 μm smt 0 10 mg l indicating that mn iii plays an important role in the degradation of smt in vl pm system compared with smt mn iii is more susceptible to pp and the formed mn iii pp cannot bond to smt thus negatively influencing its oxidation capacity hu et al 2017 the characteristic peak of mn iii at 258 nm is also observed in uv vis spectra fig 5d with the content of 1000 μm pp consequently the characteristic peak of others intermediate manganeses mn ii or mn iv at 300 nm 500 nm is significantly decreased because the disproportionation of mn iii is inhibited in contrast there is still a characteristic peak at 300 nm 500 nm in the presence of 50 μm pp or 200 μm pp the above results suggest that mn iii is decisive manganese intermediate which not only has oxidation but also affects the formation of mno2 and mn2 fig 6 a 3 3 reaction mechanism 3 3 1 identification of degradation products and possible pathways to better elucidate the oxidation pathways of smt the transformation products tps by the vl pm process are identified by using hplc ms ms the full chromatograms of the oxidation reaction samples at 0 min 10 min 30 min 60 min and 90 min are obtained which are presented in figure s4a compared with the sample at 0 min the intensity of smt peak decreases with the time prolonging which indicates new byproducts are generated according to the chromatogram and mass spectrum five tps with precursor ions are identified by hplc ms analysis which include 1 4 amino phenyl 2 imino 4 6 dimethyl 1 2 dihydro pyrimidine m z 215 4 aminobenzenesulfonic acid m z 174 4 6 dimethyl 2 pyrimidinamine m z 124 4 aminophenol m z 110 and hydroxylated 4 6 dimethyl 2 amine 5 hydropyrimidine m z 140 based on determined intermediates and previous research findings chen et al 2020 li et al 2019 yin et al 2018 two possible degradation pathways of smt by vl pm oxidation are illustrated in fig 6b one of them is smiles type rearrangement and so2 extrusion resulting in the formation of tp1 m z 215 pathway a neutral radical smt h 0 species act as reactants during the process this is because smt has a high potential for h abstraction reactions in the presence of pm after forming smt h 0 smiles type rearrangement will occur then a single electron is transferred from smt to mn iii or mn iv stone and morgan 1984 finally forming 1 4 amino phenyl 2 imino 4 6 dimethyl 1 2 dihydro pyrimidine m z 215 as depicted in fig 6c allart simon et al 2016 also reported that free radicals attack sulfonamides to cause molecular rearrangement thus once smt0 is formed smiles type rearrangement and so2 extrusion will occur because of intramolecular radical attack fan et al 2015 gao et al 2012 yang et al 2018 the other is cleavage of s n bond producing tp2 m z 174 and tp3 m z 124 pathway b subsequently tp2 will further take off a sulfur dioxide and become tp4 m z 110 and the hydroxylation of tp3 results in the generation of tp5 m z 140 for the process one conjecture is that tp2 and tp3 are easier to attack by reactive species e g mn vii mn iii o2 promoting the hydrolysis of smt therefore the concentration of smt continues to decline 3 3 2 degradation pathways assisted by dft calculations in order to further verify the above degradation pathways the smt molecular charge distribution and fukui index based on dft are performed and presented in fig 7 the chemical structure of smt is shown in fig 7a generally a specific atom with high condensed dual descriptors cdd value possesses a higher reactivity of the molecular sites which is more susceptible to attack liu et al 2019b yang and parr 1985 in this study electrophilic attack f is primary attack mode due to the presence of electrophilic species mn vii mn iii and o2 as shown in fig 7b c the n26 atom displays a lower cdd value 0 0452 and is closely surrounded by the negative isosurface of fukui index which indicates it is a priority site besides for h atom of smt h33 0 0091 h32 0 0084 h27 0 0076 atom possess the lowest cdd value see table s3 in the supplementary material thus they are more prone to h abstraction reactions to produce smt h 0 in which h33 and h32 are easier to take place h abstraction reactions than that of h27 the above calculation results indicate that the proposed degradation pathways of smt by vl pm are reasonable furthermore the potential energy profile of the two degradation pathways is also calculated and presented in fig 8 as seen in fig 8a the h33 and 27h in smt are easily captured by oh to produce a2 and a3 their relative potential energy is 23 4 kcal mol and 16 8 kcal mol respectively the result proves that a2 is easily converted to a3 subsequently a4 occurs smiles type rearrangement reaction and finally forms a5 34 1 kcal mol for cleavage of s n bond of smt there exists two different reaction paths as depicted by fig 8b c the first possibility is that o2 directly attacks the n atom of n s bond to break this bond in the smt molecule but its energy barriers 34 1 kcal mol is higher than 30 kcal mol however only 18 0 kcal mol energy barriers are required to form b6 and b4 when breaking the n s bond of smt in the form of o2h protonated o2 this means that the latter is thermodynamically more favorable than the former thus the s n bond of smt attacked by o2h is discussed in the following part more thoroughly as seen in fig 8c b4 goes through hydroxylation to form b5 4 aminobenzenesulfonic acid 45 5 kcal mol b6 occurs h abstraction reaction to form b7 10 0 kcal mol then b7 transfers into b8 in the presence of mn iii 52 6 kcal mol finally b8 goes through protonation to form b9 249 4 kcal mol in addition pm can also oxidize 4 aminobenzenesulfonic acid m z 174 and 4 6 dimethyl 2 pyrimidinamine m z 124 to make the reaction proceed forward 4 conclusion in summary the combination of pm and vl is proved to be a powerful technology for degradation of smt compare to vl alone and pm alone the removal efficiency of smt by vl pm is largely improved because vl could accelerate the generation of reactive species mn iii and o2 the result of uv vis spectra and esr detection experiments prove that mn iii can promote the generation of o2 the degradation of smt by vl pm is favored at a higher pm dosage and under acidic conditions among co3 2 so4 2 cl no3 and ha co3 2 and ha with a high concentration show obvious inhibition on the efficiency of vl pm which is ascribed to solution ph variation and competitive consumption of reactive species respectively based on the detected intermediates and theoretical calculations smiles type rearrangement and so2 extrusion and cleavage of s n bond are the main degradation pathways in the vl pm system by comparing energy barriers we find that the breaking of s n bond in smt is the result of being attacked by o2h in addition energy barrier calculations show that smt molecular rearrangement and so2 extrusion is easier to occur than cleavage of s n bond in water phase declaration of

17126,in this study visible light vl was adopted for permanganate pm activation without additional catalyst where sulfamethazine smt was selected as the probe compound experiment results showed that the vl pm system can effectively degrade smt through pseudo first order reaction kinetics influencing factors including pm dosage solution ph humid acid ha and coexisting anions co3 2 so4 2 cl and no3 which affect smt photo degradation were also examined pyrophosphate pp had an inhibitory effect on smt degradation due to the complexation of pp with mn iii electron spin resonance esr spectrometry and uv vis spectrophotometer proved that vl can activate pm to generate o2 and mn iii reactive species furthermore based on the active site prediction intermediates identification and density functional theory dft calculation two main degradation pathways involving smt molecular rearrangement and cleavage of s n bond were proposed moreover the energy barriers of the two degradation pathways were also calculated this study offers a novel approach for aqueous smt removal and deepens our understanding of the degradation mechanism of smt through dft calculation which hopes to shed light on the future development of vl pm treatment graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords permanganate sulfamethazine trivalent manganese superoxide radical degradation pathway density functional theory 1 introduction as an important class of broad spectrum antibiotics sulfonamides are widely used in human medicine aquaculture and livestock production tian et al 2020 zhang et al 2016a however due to their incomplete metabolism and uncontrolled release these compounds with high levels of concentrations were detected in natural environment qin et al 2020 due to their persistence and toxicity sulfonamides residues have led to the development and spread of sulfonamide resistance in environmental pathogens zhou et al 2019b sulfamethazine smt as a typical sulfonamide is widespread in river soil sediment underground water and sewage plant treatment effluents fan et al 2015 the reported residual concentrations generally range from ng l to μg l fan et al 2015 the undesirable smt residues show strongly adverse effects such as endocrine disruption to humans and animals chronic toxicity to human s body zhang et al 2019 in addition long term exposure causes the emergence of resistance in intestinal microorganisms further binding to pathogens through horizontal gene transfer therefore conducting an efficient method to remove smt in the environment is essential to protect the ecosystem and human health to date various chemical oxidation techniques have been used to degrade smt in aqueous phase yang et al 2020 including oxidation by ferrate vi feng et al 2018 chlorine or ozone liu et al 2019a advanced oxidation processes aops such as fenton or fenton like cheng et al 2019 cheng et al 2018 photocatalysis zhou et al 2019a uv h2o2 and uv persulfate acosta rangel et al 2018 zhang et al 2016b compared with other oxidants permanganate pm kmno4 has the advantages of relatively stable ease of storage and delivery wide ph operating range and high standard redox potential 0 558 v 1 692 v yan et al 1999 these characteristics allow pm to be successfully applied to remove various recalcitrant pollutants such as chlorophene xu et al 2018 triclosan gao et al 2018 and microcystins kim et al 2018 however there is limited knowledge on the treatment of sulfonamides e g smt with pm this may due to the fact that pm only reacts with contaminants containing electron rich organic moieties pm is a selective oxidant gao et al 2014 to solve this problem some activation methods such as some ligands hu et al 2017 jin et al 2010 e g ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid edta sodium pyrophosphate pp humic acid ha bisulfite feng et al 2018 zhong and zhang 2019 iodide li et al 2018 are employed to activate pm to produce reactive manganese species e g manganite mn vi hypomanganate mn v and trivalent manganese mn iii although the addition of these external reagents appear to be valid they are either toxic or cause an increase in organic carbon content therefore it is difficult to apply into large scale water treatment light radiation is commonly employed to activate oxidants e g h2o2 persulfate monochloramine to enhance the generation of reactive radicals bu et al 2018 miklos et al 2019 e g oh so4 cl nh2 etc thus increasing the degradation of contaminants moreover photolysis is also an important decay process of smt in natural water previous studies observed that pm photodecomposition will produce higher reactive manganese such as mno2 and mno2 guo et al 2018 lee et al 1987 as shown in eq 1 and eq 2 thus we have reason to believe that the use of visible light vl radiation can effectively activate pm and generate highly reactive species however there is no information on the contribution of these high valent manganese intermediates in the presence of pm under vl system refer as vl pm system meanwhile information on sulfonamides removal such as smt mechanism by pm under vl system is inconclusive consequently investigating the effects of light irradiation on the pm activation performance and mechanism for organic compound degradation using both experimental and theoretical calculation methods taking smt with light irradiation as an example will be highly useful and promising 1 mno4 hν mno2 o2 2 mno4 hν mno2 o2 in this study we systematically investigated the degradation of smt under the vl pm system the present paper focuses on the following points i investigate the efficiency of vl irradiation on the pm activation ii discuss the effect of solution ph pm dosage anions co3 2 so4 2 cl and no3 and ha concentration on the degradation of smt in the vl pm system iii evaluate the feasibility of the vl pm process for smt removal in natural waters iv determine reactive species in the vl pm process v identify the oxidation products by high performance liquid chromatography triple quaternary rod tandem mass spectrometer hplc ms and propose the degradation pathways and verify by density functional theory dft calculation 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials smt was purchased from sinopharm chemical reagent co ltd its physicochemical properties were listed in table s1 potassium permanganate kmno4 acetic acid hac sodium hydroxide naoh and p benzoquinone bq were also obtained from sinopharm chemical reagent co ltd all other chemicals used in this work were at least analytical grade ultrapure water 18 2 mω cm was used for the preparation of aqueous solutions stock solutions of mn vii 40 mm were prepared by dissolving kmno4 crystals in ultrapure water 2 2 experimental procedures all photochemical experiments is conducted in 150 ml quartz beakers under magnetic agitation 400 r min in the absence presence vl 300w xe lamp with a cut off filter λ 420 nm light intensity is about 300 mw cm2 300w xe lamp is turned on 5 min to ensure a relatively stable output in the light experiment the vl reaction system is the same as our previous research wang et al 2020 typically 50 μm of pm is added into the solution containing 10 mg l smt at pre determined times 0 10 20 30 45 60 90 min about 1 ml of the sample is filtered with 0 22 μm filter membrane and rapidly transferred into a 2 ml chromatography sample bottle vials containing 100 μl of 1 m hydroxylamine hydrochloride to terminate the reaction the solution ph is adjusted by 0 1 m hac and 0 1 m of naoh all experiments are performed at least in triplicate and the mean values are adopted to ensure reproducibility 2 3 analytical methods the smt concentration is analyzed by a high performance liquid chromatography hplc agilent 1260 usa equipped with a uv vis detector the column is c 18 column 4 µm particle size 4 6 250 mm at the temperature of 30 c the hplc analysis method for smt is based on the previous study qin et al 2020 mobile phase 65 h2o and 35 acetonitrile ch3cn flow rate 1 ml min injection volume 20 µl and a 266 nm detection wavelength the concentration of residual pm is determined by tu 1810 uv vis spectrophotometer at 525 nm and smt mineralization is measured by a toc 5000a model analyzer the generated radicals o2 and oh are examined by electron spin resonance esr jes fa200 using 5 5 dimethyl 1 pyrroline n oxide dmpo as spin trap reagent the oxidation byproducts of smt are identified by hplc ms the detailed description of the operation condition of hplc ms is provided in text s1 in the supplementary material 2 4 theoretical calculation the calculations of all geometric structure is performed by gaussian 16 frisch et al 2016 with the density functional theory dft method grimme et al 2011 hariharan and pople 1973 the geometry optimizations are conducted using the b3lyp functional with 6 31g d basis set for the all atoms the transition states are performed with the same method and basis set and intrinsic reaction coordinate irc calculation is also conducted to ensure that the transition state does connect two related minimums after all the structures are optimized the single point energies are evaluated with the m06 2x functional with 6 311 g d p basis set for the all atoms r et al 1980 zhao and truhlar 2007 zhao and truhlar 2008 it is worth noting that dft d dispersion correction grimme 2011 is added to the calculations to better describe the weak interactions among molecules solvation effects were considered in the smt solvation calculations and pcm implicit solvation model barone and cossi 1998 was adopted in addition the fukui function f r lu and chen 2012 is introduced to analyze vulnerable sites of smt details on dft calculation can be found in text s2 in the supplementary material these data are used to predict the site of reactive species attack on smt during the oxidation process 3 results and discussions 3 1 reaction kinetics 3 1 1 effect of visible light radiation on pm oxidation of smt to investigate the roles of vl on pm activation the degradation of smt by vl alone direct photolysis pm alone and vl pm is systematically studied as shown in fig 1 a when subjected to vl irradiation alone only 2 03 of smt is removed within 90 min there is 34 63 removal of smt in the presence of 50 µm pm without light irradiation however the addition of 50 µm pm with vl irradiation significantly enhance smt degradation efficiency the removal efficiency 85 50 is much higher than the sum of the efficiencies of photolysis and pm oxidation furthermore the degradation of smt could be well simulated by pseudo first order kinetics fig 1b which is described as eq 3 the rate constant kobs of the vl pm is as high as 0 0217 min 1 much higher than that of vl alone 0 0003 min 1 and pm oxidation 0 0047 min 1 indicating the existence of synergistic effect 3 ln c t c 0 k o b s t where c0 and ct represent the concentration of smt at reaction times of t 0 and t t respectively and kobs is the pseudo first order rate constants min 1 the change of pm concentration over time during pm oxidation and vl pm process is also investigated as shown in figure s1 the residual pm concentration in vl pm process is almost twice as high as that in pm oxidation after 90 min reaction suggesting that vl irradiation can considerable alleviate the consumption of pm in the vl pm based on the above results it is reasonable to speculate that reactive species are generated in the vl pm system lee et al 1987 therefore the enhancement mechanism needed to be investigated in great detail 3 1 2 effect of pm dosage to further understand the removal efficiency of smt in vl pm process the effect of different concentrations of pm on smt degradation is studied fig 1c shows that smt degradation obviously relies on pm dosage the removal efficiency of smt increases from 2 03 to 99 08 when pm dosage increases from 0 to 200 µm correspondingly the kobs increases from 0 0003 min 1 to 0 0555 min 1 fig 1d the phenomenon indicates that higher pm dosage leads to a better degradation efficiency and degradation rate which is different from the traditional aops that had an optimum dosage of oxidizer xue et al 2020 however excess oxidant can lead to an unnecessary consumption of pm thus unless otherwise stated the selected pm dosage is 50 µm in the following experiments 3 1 3 effect of solution ph it is widely accepted that ph condition affected the oxidation ability and stability of pm because of the existence of various acid base dependent mn vii species and the speciation of smt is highly dependent on environmental ph figure s2 gao et al 2012 zhang et al 2016a thus solution ph may play a significance role in compound reactivity in this study the effect of solution ph 3 93 10 85 on the vl pm system for smt removal is evaluated as shown in the fig 2 a 83 47 of smt is removed at ph 3 93 within 45 min while only 2 93 is removed at ph 10 85 within 90 min in addition figure s3 depicts the variation of kobs with the solution ph change it can be seen that the degradation rate of smt decreases gradually with the increasing solution ph with the increase of solution ph from 3 93 to 10 85 kobs drops sharply from 0 0305 min 1 to 0 0005 min 1 as a result an acidic circumstance is more conducive to smt removal in the vl pm system the reasons may be that pm has undergone a series of disproportionation and reduction reactions under acidic conditions eventually leading to manganese oxide mno2 or mn ii as the final product in addition the redox potential of mn vii under acidic conditions 1 51 v eq 4 is higher than that of under neutral conditions 0 58 v eq 5 and alkaline conditions 0 56 v eq 6 hu et al 2018 meanwhile the in situ generation of mno2 shows more reactive under acidic conditions which is favorable for smt degradation xu et al 2018 previous studies also demonstrated that mno2 could accelerate the oxidation kinetics of organics in the process of pm oxidation gao et al 2012 hu et al 2018 therefore acidic condition is conducive to improving the oxidation ability of pm 4 mno4 8 h 5 e mn2 4 h2o 5 mno4 2 h2o 3 e mno2 4 oh 6 mno4 e mno4 2 3 1 3 effect of anions and humic acid on smt degradation the effect of anions e g co3 2 so4 2 cl and no3 and ha on smt removal is evaluated by using initial pm concentration of 50 μm under vl irradiation as shown in fig 2b the addition of individual so4 2 cl and no3 could slightly promote the degradation of smt the reason is that so4 2 cl and no3 play a role in delaying the decomposition of pm han et al 2013 further facilitating the oxidation reaction of pm compared with so4 2 cl and no3 the degradation efficiency of smt is significantly inhibited by the presence of co3 2 to be specific the removal efficiency is only 12 2 after 90 min in the presence of 0 5 mm it is also observed that the value of solution ph is increased from 6 43 to 8 15 as mentioned in section 3 1 3 the redox potential of mn vii is as low as 0 56 v under alkaline conditions liu et al 2016 observed a similar inhibitory effect as the addition of co3 2 would lead to the equilibration of co3 2 hco3 moreover co3 is a common free radicals scavenger qian et al 2016 thus resulting in a low efficiency fig 2c shows that ha exhibited a double edge role in the degradation of smt in the vl pm system ha with a low concentration level 5 mg l has a mild effect in promoting oxidation of smt by pm which is ascribed to the reductive properties of ha increasing the generation of mno2 sun et al 2013 yang et al 2018 meanwhile ha could complex with mn iii eq 7 and then successively produce o2 eq 8 and oh eq 9 jin et al 2010 xu et al 2017 however when the ha concentration is further increased from 5 mg l to 10 mg l the removal efficiency decreases from 86 34 to 65 95 on the one hand more pm is consumed under high level concentration of ha which leads to the reduction of smt removal rate on the other hand excessive ha could compete with target compound for secondary oxidants e g mno2 o2 oh chow and sze yin leung 2019 which also inhibits the oxidation of smt 7 mn vii 4 ha mn ii ha 5 ha mn iii 8 2 ha mn iii o2 2 h2o 2 mn ii 2 o2 4 h 2 ha 9 o2 h2o ho2 oh 10 ho2 h2o oh h2o2 3 1 4 degradation of smt in different water matrices to better understand the oxidation of smt in natural water four types of water such as ultrapure water uw tap water tw xiangjiang river water xrw and peach lake water plw are used in the experiments the characteristics of the four types of water are listed in table s2 as shown in fig 3 a the degradation of smt is inhibited in the three real water bodies compared to that in uw the tendency of toc removal rate is consistent with smt when the removal efficiency of smt is high the toc removal ratio is also relatively high fig 3b the results indicate that coexisting substances in natural water matrices may compete with smt for oxidants which affects the degradation efficiency of smt 3 2 identification of the reactive species 3 2 1 reactive oxygen radicals firstly the generation of reactive oxygen radicals was the most common reason why light irradiation can improve the activity of oxidants luo et al 2019 according to the previous study guo et al 2018 oh and o2 were most likely to be produced in the oxidation process to investigate the roles of reactive oxygen radicals played in vl pm system methanol meoh and tert butanol tba are used as scavengers of oh and p benzoquinone pbq serves as o2 quencher in the vl pm meoh and vl pm tba the degradation of smt is not inhibited but improved there are 2 17 and 11 15 higher than that of control group 85 50 fig 4 a the reason is that meoh and tba are transformed into alkyl radicals r further increasing the reduction of pm hu et al 2018 however the addition of pbq sharply hinders the degradation of smt its removal efficiency after 90 min reaction decreases from 85 50 to 34 19 as 2 mm of pbq is added fig 4a therefore the results indicate that o2 plays a dominant role while oh plays an insignificant role for the degradation of smt in vl pm system to further confirm the existence of radicals esr analysis with dmpo are performed in meoh and ultrapure water for o2 and oh detection respectively wang et al 2020 yin et al 2018 it could be seen from the esr spectrum fig 4b that no signals of dmpo o2 and dmpo oh are detected in the dark however the characteristic signals of dmpo o2 with an intensity ratio of 1 1 1 1 and dmpo oh with an intensity ratio of 1 2 2 1 could be observed under vl irradiation suggesting the generation of o2 and oh during the vl pm system in particular the peak intensity of o2 significantly increases with the irradiation time from 5 min to 10 min and its intensity signals is much higher than that of dmpo oh the results confirm that o2 is the primary reactive oxygen radicals in the vl pm process which is consistent with the results of free radical trapping tests 3 2 2 reactive manganese species secondly the generation of intermediate manganese is speculated during the activation of potassium permanganate under vl theoretically intermediate manganeses involve mn vi mn iv mn iii and mn ii while mn iv and mn ii are relatively stable and difficult to react with pollutants simandi et al 1984 experimental results fig 2a prove that mn vi does not react with smt to explore the activation mechanism tu 1810 uv vis spectrophotometer is used to investigate the absorbance spectra of the solution at different reaction times during dark and vl system as seen in fig 5 a b there is also no change in the absorption peak of mn vi at 610 nm thus mn vi is ruled out it is noting that the intensities of the absorption peak at 300 nm 500 nm of the reaction solution in vl pm system are higher than that of the dark system this is mainly due to the accumulation of mno2 and mn2 jiang et al 2015 simandi et al 1984 the result indicates that the involvement of vl promotes mno2 formed during the vl pm system 11 mn3 e mn2 12 2 mn3 2 h2o mno2 mn2 4 h furthermore it is reported that mn iii processes a high oxidation property for one electron transfer reactions 1 54 v eq 11 kostka et al 1995 with the negative free energy of reaction δg mn iii is labile and easily disproportionate to mn ii or mn iv davies 1968 eq 12 pp is a commonly used mn iii complexing agent which would lead to mn iii pp formed the formed mn iii pp has a characteristic absorbance peak at 258 nm webb et al 2005 to ascertain whether mn iii is important in the vl pm system the effect of pp on smt degradation is investigated and corresponding uv vis spectra at 200 nm 800 nm after 90 min reaction is compared as shown in fig 5c the degradation of smt is significantly suppressed by the addition of pp and the inhibiting effect increases with the increase of pp concentration 50 μm 200 μm and 1000 μm adding 1000 μm of pp almost completely inhibits the degradation of smt pm 0 50 μm smt 0 10 mg l indicating that mn iii plays an important role in the degradation of smt in vl pm system compared with smt mn iii is more susceptible to pp and the formed mn iii pp cannot bond to smt thus negatively influencing its oxidation capacity hu et al 2017 the characteristic peak of mn iii at 258 nm is also observed in uv vis spectra fig 5d with the content of 1000 μm pp consequently the characteristic peak of others intermediate manganeses mn ii or mn iv at 300 nm 500 nm is significantly decreased because the disproportionation of mn iii is inhibited in contrast there is still a characteristic peak at 300 nm 500 nm in the presence of 50 μm pp or 200 μm pp the above results suggest that mn iii is decisive manganese intermediate which not only has oxidation but also affects the formation of mno2 and mn2 fig 6 a 3 3 reaction mechanism 3 3 1 identification of degradation products and possible pathways to better elucidate the oxidation pathways of smt the transformation products tps by the vl pm process are identified by using hplc ms ms the full chromatograms of the oxidation reaction samples at 0 min 10 min 30 min 60 min and 90 min are obtained which are presented in figure s4a compared with the sample at 0 min the intensity of smt peak decreases with the time prolonging which indicates new byproducts are generated according to the chromatogram and mass spectrum five tps with precursor ions are identified by hplc ms analysis which include 1 4 amino phenyl 2 imino 4 6 dimethyl 1 2 dihydro pyrimidine m z 215 4 aminobenzenesulfonic acid m z 174 4 6 dimethyl 2 pyrimidinamine m z 124 4 aminophenol m z 110 and hydroxylated 4 6 dimethyl 2 amine 5 hydropyrimidine m z 140 based on determined intermediates and previous research findings chen et al 2020 li et al 2019 yin et al 2018 two possible degradation pathways of smt by vl pm oxidation are illustrated in fig 6b one of them is smiles type rearrangement and so2 extrusion resulting in the formation of tp1 m z 215 pathway a neutral radical smt h 0 species act as reactants during the process this is because smt has a high potential for h abstraction reactions in the presence of pm after forming smt h 0 smiles type rearrangement will occur then a single electron is transferred from smt to mn iii or mn iv stone and morgan 1984 finally forming 1 4 amino phenyl 2 imino 4 6 dimethyl 1 2 dihydro pyrimidine m z 215 as depicted in fig 6c allart simon et al 2016 also reported that free radicals attack sulfonamides to cause molecular rearrangement thus once smt0 is formed smiles type rearrangement and so2 extrusion will occur because of intramolecular radical attack fan et al 2015 gao et al 2012 yang et al 2018 the other is cleavage of s n bond producing tp2 m z 174 and tp3 m z 124 pathway b subsequently tp2 will further take off a sulfur dioxide and become tp4 m z 110 and the hydroxylation of tp3 results in the generation of tp5 m z 140 for the process one conjecture is that tp2 and tp3 are easier to attack by reactive species e g mn vii mn iii o2 promoting the hydrolysis of smt therefore the concentration of smt continues to decline 3 3 2 degradation pathways assisted by dft calculations in order to further verify the above degradation pathways the smt molecular charge distribution and fukui index based on dft are performed and presented in fig 7 the chemical structure of smt is shown in fig 7a generally a specific atom with high condensed dual descriptors cdd value possesses a higher reactivity of the molecular sites which is more susceptible to attack liu et al 2019b yang and parr 1985 in this study electrophilic attack f is primary attack mode due to the presence of electrophilic species mn vii mn iii and o2 as shown in fig 7b c the n26 atom displays a lower cdd value 0 0452 and is closely surrounded by the negative isosurface of fukui index which indicates it is a priority site besides for h atom of smt h33 0 0091 h32 0 0084 h27 0 0076 atom possess the lowest cdd value see table s3 in the supplementary material thus they are more prone to h abstraction reactions to produce smt h 0 in which h33 and h32 are easier to take place h abstraction reactions than that of h27 the above calculation results indicate that the proposed degradation pathways of smt by vl pm are reasonable furthermore the potential energy profile of the two degradation pathways is also calculated and presented in fig 8 as seen in fig 8a the h33 and 27h in smt are easily captured by oh to produce a2 and a3 their relative potential energy is 23 4 kcal mol and 16 8 kcal mol respectively the result proves that a2 is easily converted to a3 subsequently a4 occurs smiles type rearrangement reaction and finally forms a5 34 1 kcal mol for cleavage of s n bond of smt there exists two different reaction paths as depicted by fig 8b c the first possibility is that o2 directly attacks the n atom of n s bond to break this bond in the smt molecule but its energy barriers 34 1 kcal mol is higher than 30 kcal mol however only 18 0 kcal mol energy barriers are required to form b6 and b4 when breaking the n s bond of smt in the form of o2h protonated o2 this means that the latter is thermodynamically more favorable than the former thus the s n bond of smt attacked by o2h is discussed in the following part more thoroughly as seen in fig 8c b4 goes through hydroxylation to form b5 4 aminobenzenesulfonic acid 45 5 kcal mol b6 occurs h abstraction reaction to form b7 10 0 kcal mol then b7 transfers into b8 in the presence of mn iii 52 6 kcal mol finally b8 goes through protonation to form b9 249 4 kcal mol in addition pm can also oxidize 4 aminobenzenesulfonic acid m z 174 and 4 6 dimethyl 2 pyrimidinamine m z 124 to make the reaction proceed forward 4 conclusion in summary the combination of pm and vl is proved to be a powerful technology for degradation of smt compare to vl alone and pm alone the removal efficiency of smt by vl pm is largely improved because vl could accelerate the generation of reactive species mn iii and o2 the result of uv vis spectra and esr detection experiments prove that mn iii can promote the generation of o2 the degradation of smt by vl pm is favored at a higher pm dosage and under acidic conditions among co3 2 so4 2 cl no3 and ha co3 2 and ha with a high concentration show obvious inhibition on the efficiency of vl pm which is ascribed to solution ph variation and competitive consumption of reactive species respectively based on the detected intermediates and theoretical calculations smiles type rearrangement and so2 extrusion and cleavage of s n bond are the main degradation pathways in the vl pm system by comparing energy barriers we find that the breaking of s n bond in smt is the result of being attacked by o2h in addition energy barrier calculations show that smt molecular rearrangement and so2 extrusion is easier to occur than cleavage of s n bond in water phase declaration of

17127,we systemically investigated the transformation behavior of 2 4 dichlorophenol 24 dcp in seven different reaction systems including kmno4 heat ps o3 uv fenton naclo and k2feo4 treatment the results revealed that complete removal of 24 dcp could be reached in minutes especially for fe vi kmno4 naclo fenton and o3 system a total of 41 products were identified by lc ms and 10 of them were validated using commercial and self synthesized standards hydroxyl substitution and coupling reactions were commonly observed in the studied systems meanwhile extra routes such as sulfate substitution de chlorination and direct oxidation were also involved for certain oxidation methods comparisons showed that a high degree of chlorination 90 occurred for naclo system while coupling products accounted for 45 of the removed 24 dcp under ps oxidation moreover low mineralization degree together with high aquatic toxicity was attributed to the occurrence of coupling reaction which was possibly related to the redox potential of the main oxidative species considering the low abundance of coupling products and the gentle reaction condition uv irradiation is a better option for 24 dcp removal in water and wastewaters these findings can deepen our understanding on the transformation process of 24 dcp and provide some useful information for the environmental elimination of substituted phenols graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords oxidation systems 2 4 dichlorophenol 24 dcp transformation products mineralization aquatic toxicity 1 introduction because of large production and widespread application chlorophenols are ubiquitously detected in natural environment lin 1982 melton 1982 jensen 1996 witthuhn et al 2005 gonzalez et al 2012 such as surface water groundwater soil sediment and even tap water 2 4 dichlorophenol 24 dcp listed as one of the 129 priority pollutants by us epa keith and telliard 1979 is assumed to be one of the most abundant chlorophenols in the aquatic environment house et al 1997 it was found at concentrations of 1 56 6 72 and 2 55 μg l in beitang drainage river in tianjin china zhong et al 2018 wastewater influent in king williams town and midstream of bloukrans river in south africa farounbi and ngqwala 2020 respectively moreover it is also regarded as an emerging disinfection by product dbp which has been detected at mg l level in simulated and real tap waters lin 1982 melton 1982 for example the maximum concentration of 24 dcp could reach as high as 2 2 0 3 mg l in tap water of the netherlands tang and huang 1996 generally the halogenated dbps would exhibit significantly higher toxicity than other commonly known dbps such as trihalomethanes and haloacetic acids liu and zhang 2014 it was reported that 24 dcp at a concentration of 100 µg l could affect the antioxidant defense system in the livers of the goldfish carassius auratus zhang et al 2003 due to its widespread occurrence poor biodegradability environmental persistence and high toxicity the research interest on 24 dcp is increasingly growing until now concentrated studies have been conducted on elimination of 24 dcp including physical adsorption shah et al 2017 biodegradation yang et al 2002 fenton and photo fenton oxidation tang and huang 1996 trapido et al 1998 ozone ultrasound trapido et al 1998 sunlight and photocatalytic degradation serra et al 1994 liu et al 2017 and 2019a h2o2 basic oxygen furnace slag li et al 1999 and catalytic reduction ezzatahmadi et al 2019a and b among them chemical oxidation shows excellent performance however it is difficult to directly compare the observations from different authors since reaction kinetics intermediates transformation pathways and toxicity variation may differ largely depending on the employed chemical oxidation method chemical oxidation techniques like fe vi kmno4 naclo fenton o3 and persulfate ps are common and popular methods in water and wastewater treatment they can degrade pollutants through different reaction mechanisms for instance fe vi as a multipurpose chemical reagent sharma et al 2016 eliminates a wide range of aqueous contaminants by single and or two electron s transfer process chen et al 2018a liu et al 2019b while sulfate and hydroxyl radicals are primary reactive species in ps system pan et al 2018a xiao et al 2019 gao et al 2019 most of previous studies have been conducted to examine the removal and dechlorination of 24 dcp in the aforementioned single reaction system leaving the overall transformation mechanisms and ecological risk assessment unknown in addition recent reports have demonstrated that the degradation of phenolic compounds is always accompanied with the formation of coupling products guan et al 2017 pan et al 2018a chen et al 2019 however the relationship between oxidation method and the polymerization degree as well as the influence of these coupling products on the ecosystem are still less studied in this context we systematically investigated the transformation behavior of aqueous 24 dcp by seven different treatment methods including fe vi kmno4 naclo uv fenton o3 and heat ps oxidation after an initial examination on the oxidation kinetics the transformation products and mechanisms were explored by lc ms analysis and quantum chemical calculations for further comparison moreover the mineralization degree of reaction solutions was measured and the toxicity of 24 dcp and its products to p phosphoreum was also assessed we devote to find an environmental friendly and highly effective technique with low or even no ecotoxicity to treat water and wastewaters containing 24 dcp and or substituted phenols 2 chemicals and methods 2 1 chemicals 24 dcp purity 99 246 trichlorophenol 246 cp 2346 tetrachlorophenol 2346 cp 2 monochlorophenol 2 cp 4 monochlorophenol 4 cp phenol maleic acid 1 4 benzoquinone 4 chlorocatehol and 2 chlorohydroquinone were all provided by aladdin co ltd shanghai china the chromatographic grade formic acid and methanol were provided by merck darmstadt germany oxidants including kmno4 naclo k2s2o8 and fenton reagent i e h2o2 and feso4 7h2o and the other chemicals of at least reagent grade were purchased from nanjing chemical reagent co ltd nanjing china k2feo4 purity 95 used in the experiments was synthesized according to the wet method delaude and laszlo 1996 stock solution of 1 g l 24 dcp was prepared in 10 mm naoh solution which could increase the water solubility of 24 dcp 2 2 experimental procedure oxidation experiments of 24 dcp by kmno4 heat ps and k2feo4 were performed according to previously established methods chen et al 2016 pan et al 2018b liu et al 2019b o3 was produced from a pem water fed ozone generator model bpem 002 yichang china and it was continuously bubbled into the aqueous solution of 50 mg l 24 dcp through a glass tube the concentration of o3 which was controlled by the magnitude of working current 11 5 a was determined to be 140 6 mg l by an iodometry method due to the very rapid removal of substrate we split the outlet ozone gas into two branches when examining the removal of 5 mg l 24 dcp uv irradiation was performed with a xpa 7 photochemical reactor nanjing xujiang electromechanical plant nanjing china which was detailedly described in our previous work pan et al 2019 a 300 w mercury lamp was used as light source and its irradiation intensity was measured as 41 mw cm2 by an ultraviolet radiometer photoelectric instrument factory of beijing normal university beijing china no obvious concentration change of 24 dcp was observed for dark control as seen from fig s1e chlorination and fenton reactions were conducted in 50 ml conical flasks with 5 or 50 mg l 24 dcp the oxidation reactions were initiated by adding a specific amount of oxidants with stirring on a magnetic stirrer at defined time intervals 900 µl of reaction solutions were withdrawn into 2 ml plastic centrifuge tubes which were pre added with 100 µl of 0 1 m na2s2o3 to end the reaction considering its environmental concentration and accompanied products analysis the substrate was used at two initial concentrations of 5 and 50 mg l to conduct experiments in the above mentioned seven different oxidation systems the initial ph was adjusted to 7 0 with 0 1 m naoh or hcl in heat ps kmno4 uv and o3 reaction solutions while the ph value was set at 3 0 for fenton reaction moreover the reaction solutions were buffered to ph 7 0 with 0 01 m phosphate buffer solution during naclo and k2feo4 treatments unless otherwise stated the tests were performed at ambient temperature 25 c all kinetic experiments were carried out in triplicate and mean values were presented with standard deviations in the cases of fenton kmno4 and k2feo4 500 µl of methanol were added into the plastic centrifuge tubes to exclude any possible adsorption effect then these samples were centrifuged at 12000 rpm for 5 min by a super minimax 12k centrifuge biomaker china to remove particles like mno2 and fe oh 3 the supernatants were then analyzed by lc in another batch of experiments 20 ml of reaction solutions were purified by digital control solid phase extraction apparatus model hse 08a guangzhou kexiao scientific instrument co ltd guangzhou china and eluted into 2 ml of methanol for lc ms analysis 2 3 analytic methods quantitative analysis of 24 dcp was performed with agilent 1260 high performance liquid chromatography equipped with a uv detector 20 µl of samples were injected into zorbax 300sb c18 column 150 4 6 mm 5 µm at a flow rate of 1 0 ml min the mobile phase was composed of methanol and 0 3 formic acid solution v v 65 35 the detection wavelength and total run time was 284 nm and 5 5 min respectively the intermediates of 24 dcp were identified by an agilent 1260 infinity hplc coupled with an x500r qtof mass spectrometer ab sciex usa in negative mode a thermo bds hypersil c18 column 100 2 1 mm 2 4 µm was used for chromatographic separation specific parameters were set according to the research of liu et al 2019c total organic carbon toc an indicator to represent mineralization degree was measured with an oi 1030d toc analyzer aurora usa 2 4 theoretical calculation gaussian 09 program was used to optimize the structures of dimer products and reactive phenoxy radicals at the b3lyp 6 311g level by entering keywords opt freq the bulk solvent effect of water was considered using the polarized continuum model pcm the dipole moment and spin density could be directly obtained from gaussian out files 2 5 toxicity assessment the toxicity of reaction solution was measured by luminescent bacteria bioassay to assess the potential risks of 24 dcp and its intermediates the lyophilized powder of p phosphoreum was obtained from nanjing kuake technology co ltd nanjing china the toxicity experiments were carried out according to the research of chen et al 2016 especially the reaction solutions treated by fe vi kmno4 and fenton reagent were filtered by 0 22 µm filter membrane and the ph value was further adjusted to neutral condition for toxicity evaluation the blank control experiment in the absence of 24 dcp was simultaneously conducted to investigate the effect of different oxidants on p phosphoreum and the results demonstrated no obvious inhibition to p phosphoreum eight replicate tests were done for all bioluminescence experiments moreover ecosar software was also used to evaluate the acute and chronic toxicity of 24 dcp and its intermediates pan et al 2017 chen et al 2018a 3 results and discussion 3 1 oxidation kinetics of 24 dcp the kinetics of 24 dcp oxidized by fe vi kmno4 naclo uv fenton o3 and ps were depicted in fig 1 apparently 50 mg l 24 dcp could be completely eliminated from solutions in minutes especially for fe vi kmno4 naclo fenton and o3 treatments 180 s and 5 min respectively to get insights into the oxidation efficiency of the substrate in environment related conditions the experiments were also conducted at a relatively low initial concentration of 5 mg l as seen from fig s1 highly effective removal of 5 mg l 24 dcp was also obtained in the seven oxidation systems especially the removal data of 24 dcp by naclo fe vi and kmno4 can be well fitted by second order kinetics model and the corresponding reaction rate constants k app were 38774 88 67722 00 and 469 79 m 1 min 1 it was reported that the oxidation reduction potential e 0 of naclo at ph 7 0 was 0 84 v slightly higher than fe vi and kmno4 0 70 and 0 59 v respectively sharma 2010 the larger k app during fe vi treatment might be explained by the existence of other intermediate iron species such as fe iv and fe v which were formed from fe vi by one electron or two electron transfer casbeer et al 2013 dong et al 2018 these secondary oxidants have relatively high e 0 and could also oxidize the target compound effectively meanwhile pseudo first order kinetics was adopted for the cases of ps uv fenton and o3 and the k obs values were calculated to be 0 02 0 08 0 24 and 2 07 min 1 respectively trapido et al 1998 also observed that the degradation rate of 24 dcp was higher in fenton oxidation as compared with uv irradiation in addition the removal rates all decreased with the decreasing initial concentration except for uv illumination and ozone oxidation this might be explained by the fact that the utilization efficiency of oxidants was reduced at a low concentration of target compound as reported by chen et al 2016 for a given uv intensity the photooxidation of 24 dcp occurred more rapidly in dilute aqueous solution which was in agreement with the findings of serra et al 1994 and pan et al 2019 3 2 products identification a total of 41 intermediates belonging to 29 nominal masses were identified by lc ms analysis and 10 of them were validated using commercial standards fig s2 and self synthesized standard fig s3 therefore p126a p126b p93 p108 p142a p142b p115 p194 p230 and p322 should be 2 cp 4 cp phenol 1 4 benzoquinone 2 chlorohydroquinone 4 chlorocatehol maleic acid 246 cp 2346 cp and 24 dcp dimer respectively structures of the other intermediates were assigned based on their parent ion masses chlorine isotope patterns and product ion spectra detailed ms ms spectra and ms information were summarized in fig s4 and table s1 several compounds like monochlorophenol benzoquinone or dihydroxy dichlorobenzene namely p176 dihydroxy chlorobenzene namely p142 phenol and maleic acid were commonly identified as the byproducts of 24 dcp potter 1993 serra et al 1994 jensen 1996 trapido et al 1998 li et al 1999 xu and wang 2012 xu et al 2013 ezzatahmadi et al 2019a and ezzatahmadi et al 2019b however some intermediates including polyhydroxylated phenols p157 p158 p174 and p192 sulfooxylated phenols p204 p222 p256 p272 p284 and p300 dimers and trimers p235 p252 p286 p322 p448 and p482 were the first to report in this work although trapido et al 1998 also detected dimers of 24 dcp in advanced oxidation processes no detailed information was given in addition eight pairs of isomers i e p123a and p123b p126a and p126b p142a and p142b p176a p176b and p176c p192a p192b and p192c p252a and p252b p286a p286b and p286c p448a and p448b were observed except for commercially available p126 and p142 we further confirmed the specific structures in terms of dipole moment µ calculated at the b3lyp 6 311g level by gaussian 09 software yao et al 2017 3 3 elucidation of transformation pathways based on lc ms and lc ms ms analyses the transformation pathways of 24 dcp in kmno4 fig s5 heat ps fig s6 o3 fig s7 uv fig s8 fenton fig s9 naclo fig s10 and fe vi fig s11 systems were tentatively proposed in general as shown in fig 2 five main pathways including direct dechlorination pathway i hydroxylation pathway ii self or and cross coupling reaction pathway iii chlorination pathway iv and sulfate substitution pathway v were involved in 24 dcp oxidation kmno4 treatment was selected as an example to illustrate the reaction pathways fig s5 in pathway i 24 dcp underwent dechlorination at c 4 site to generate 2 cp p126a pathway ii was initiated by mno4 attack on the c cl bond or c h bond of 24 dcp to yield the hydroxyl substitution products p142 or p176a which were finally transformed into 1 2 3 4 5 benzenepentol via successive hydroxylation p142 p176a p158a p192a p174 p157 in addition direct oxidation of p142 could form 1 4 benzoquinone p108 which was further oxidized into ring opening product p170 in pathway iii 24 dcp and its primary product p126 could lose one electron to form corresponding phenoxy radicals in the oxidative environment then self coupling of 24 dcp radicals or cross coupling between 24 dcp and 2 cp radicals led to the generation of dimers p322 or p286 and trimers p448 see fig 4 for more details the evolution profiles of 24 dcp and its transformation intermediates in kmno4 system were assessed by monitoring their peak area in lc ms spectra the results were depicted in fig s12 as seen kmno4 rapidly oxidized 24 dcp into 14 intermediates its dechlorinated self and cross coupling products denoted as p126a p286 and p322 respectively reached maxima just in 5 s followed by a gradual decline during this process the trimer p448a could be accumulated indicating that the extent of oligomerization increased with the reaction time the hydroxylation products appeared later and achieved the highest peak area after 15 s the faster generation and larger abundance of dechlorinated and coupling products than hydroxylation products suggested that dechlorination and coupling might play a dominant role during 24 dcp oxidation process in addition unlike p448a and p157 p170 was likely to be degraded into co2 and h2o after increase to the maxima it should be noted that extra routes such as sulfate substitution self coupling of monochlorophenol and trimerization of 24 dcp were also involved during ps oxidation the possible effect of the concentration of oxidants or reactive species on degradation pathways was also explored by improving ps dosage from 30 675 to 60 35 mm and the results were shown in fig s13 as seen faster removal of 24 dcp was observed at a higher ps dosage except for the disappearance of p204 the rest products remained exactly the same while their abundances were obviously decreased in agreement with the report by shao et al 2020 this might be attributed to the increasing amount of reactive species generated with increasing ps dosage which could further oxidize the reaction intermediates into co2 and h2o as confirmed by the increased toc removal shown in fig 5b for o3 and k2feo4 systems similar trimerization occurred to produce p482 under uv irradiation self coupling of monochlorophenol p126 and subsequent hydroxylation was observed which resulted in the production of p252a and p235 besides monochlorophenol could undergo direct oxidation and ring cleavage to form ketones and low molecular weight carboxylic acids in fenton system moreover successive chlorination to yield tri tetra penta chlorophenols p194 p230 and p264 was proposed as the fourth transformation route for naclo oxidation quantitative analysis showed that the concentration of 246 cp reached 43 87 mg l in 30 s and consequently its conversion yield the ratio of the formed 246 cp to the degraded 24 dcp was as high as 95 this result revealed that chlorination made an important contribution to 24 dcp removal 3 4 comparison of 24 dcp degradation in seven systems the presence of dichloro benzenediol p176 and hydroxylated tetra chlorinated diphenyl ether oh tcde p322 was observed in all studied systems figs s5 s11 suggesting that hydroxyl substitution and coupling reaction were common transformation routes of 24 dcp many researchers have also reported hydroxylation reaction in the studied systems potter 1993 serra et al 1994 gao et al 2014 negreira et al 2015 ji et al 2016 liu et al 2017 and 2019a chen et al 2019 oputu et al 2019 yang et al 2019 which involved mechanism of direct oxygen transfer or oh attack except for uv and naclo the product p286 generated from self or cross coupling reaction of 24 dcp was also found furthermore the product p126 formed from the parent 24 dcp by direct dechlorination appeared in fe vi kmno4 uv fenton and heat ps systems qi et al 2015 also found dechlorination of pentachlorophenol by microwave activated ps system however the distribution of the other intermediates was very complex as shown in table s2 in general the numbers of mono ring products obtained by kmno4 and especially uv illumination chlorination and fenton oxidation were 1 to 5 times higher than multi ring products while the number of these two categories of compounds was comparable for the other three systems given this situation we compared the maximum concentration or peak area of the four major primary products mono ring products p126 and p176 coupling products p286 and p322 to explore the contribution of the corresponding reaction pathway to 24 dcp removal and the result was shown in fig 3 as seen the abundance of these four products changed largely in seven systems to be specific the concentration of p126 ranged from 0 3 12 mg l the highest concentration was measured in kmno4 system while the yield of this dechlorination product was still lower than 10 the low concentration of p126 and the relatively high peak area of p176 p286 and p322 in heat ps system indicated that hydroxyl addition and especially polymerization including self and cross coupling reactions largely contributed to 24 dcp removal as compared with dechlorination similar phenomenon was found during ozonation the maximum concentrations of dimer products p286 and p322 during seven oxidation processes were approximately 0 10 and 11 28 mg l according to the semi quantitative analysis of the homologue triclosan and the self synthesized sample by lc tof ms it showed that around 45 of 24 dcp could be transformed into the dimer products especially the self coupling dimer p322 during ps oxidation consistent with the observation that the number of mono ring products was dominant hydroxylation played a significant role in 24 dcp removal under uv illumination and fenton oxidation as indicated by the large abundance of p176 in brief hydroxylation and coupling reaction rather than dechlorination are main transformation pathways of 24 dcp some unique products encircled by green line in figs s6 s10 were identified after heat ps o3 uv fenton and naclo treatments it is well known that heat activation of ps could produce sulfate radicals these radicals may attack c cl and c h bond of 24 dcp to form two sulfooxylated intermediates p222 and p256 respectively which were further transformed into p204 p300 and p272 by hydroxylation or p284 by sulfate substitution fig s6 4 hydroxy 1 2 benzoquinone p123b with a retention time of 4 77 min was produced during ozonation as presented in fig s7 uv illumination could yield 2 chloro 1 4 benzoquinone p140 1 2 3 5 tetrahydroxybenzene p141 and 1 chloro 3 7 dichlorodiphenyl ether p235 fig s8 while fenton regent oxidized 24 dcp into phenol p93 fig s9 by contrast tri to penta chlorophenols p194 p230 and p264 were produced after chlorination fig s10 in addition ring opening products p115 or and p170 were obtained in 24 dcp oxidation by kmno4 uv and fenton these comparisons demonstrated that the removal of 24 dcp was achieved through two general routes including hydroxylation and coupling reaction however the contribution of two routes will differ depending on the treatment methods furthermore additional reaction routes may also be involved in terms of the nature of oxidants in fact the seven oxidation systems used belong to three kinds of chemical oxidation namely direct oxidation fe vi mn vii and clo ultraviolet photodegradation and advanced oxidation heat ps o3 and fenton based on the aforementioned analysis the transformation pathways and their respective contributions to 24 dcp removal presented relatively large discrepancy among different treatments further demonstrating the vital role of the characteristics of oxidants themselves 3 5 theoretical calculations our previous studies have suggested that phenolic organic compounds or their hydroxyl containing intermediates can easily lose an electron to become corresponding radicals in an oxidizing environment and these radicals can further polymerize into dimers trimers and higher polymers pan et al 2018a chen et al 2018b and 2019 in this work we calculated the spin densities of 24 dcp 2 cp and 4 cp radicals to indicate the distribution of an unpaired electron for structural elucidation of dimers and trimers it was apparently seen from fig s14 that the unparied electron in the 24 dcp radical was most likely to appear at the phenolic hydroxyl oxygen namely o 7 and its conjugated para and ortho carbon sites c 3 c 5 and c 1 due to the relatively large values of mulliken atomic spin densities 0 378 0 347 0 287 and 0 276 respectively same results were also obtained in the 2 cp and 4 cp radicals these observations revealed that both self and cross coupling reaction could occur through c c and c o ways the detection of p286 and p322 verified the occurrence of coupling reactions via c o way fig 4 it should be noted that the relative abundance of p286 and p322 in seven systems was ordered as heat ps and o3 fenton kmno4 k2feo4 and clo fig 3 this was possibly explained by the relative higher redox potential of ps 2 01 v and o3 1 24 v than the rest three oxidants kmno4 0 59 v k2feo4 0 70 v and naclo 0 84 v as shown in table 1 the oxidant with higher e 0 value may abstract h atom or obtain an electron from phenolic organic compounds or their hydroxyl containing intermediates more easily to form the corresponding phenoxy radicals which finally polymerize into dimers trimers and other complex polymers although the e 0 value of h2o2 is comparable with that of ps and o3 these three systems have different reactive species which is another factor resulting in the observed trend of polymerization it is well known that fenton regent is a totally oh induced oxidation method while so4 and ps also co exist in heat ps situation when it comes to o3 system both o3 and oh are the oxidizing species using laser flash photolysis technology chen et al 2020 have measured a larger amount of phenoxy radicals during so4 driven oxidation i e electron transfer of phenol than that during ho mediated reaction namely h abstraction 3 6 mineralization degree mineralization degree of 24 dcp solutions at the end of reaction 3 min for kmno4 naclo k2feo4 and fenton reactions 5 min for o3 and 90 min for heat ps and uv irradiation was evaluated by toc measurement as depicted in fig 5 a mineralization degree was generally very low possibly due to the high initial concentration of 24 dcp 50 mg l and the formation of refractory intermediate products to be specific the toc removal was ordered as 49 heat ps 23 o3 21 uv 18 fenton kmno4 6 k2feo4 4 naclo it was unexpected that the largest toc removal was observed in heat ps system which had a high abundance of coupling products in addition we further explored reaction conditions leading to high mineralization in ps system as seen the nearly complete elimination of 24 dcp except for ph 11 0 where the residual 24 dcp was 11 together with the large discrepancy in toc removal was obtained at different experimental conditions specifically the removal of toc was significantly decreased when the initial ph was adjusted to ph 3 0 and especially ph 11 0 fig 5b this might be attributed to the ph dependent variation of polymerization degree qi et al 2021 when the reaction time was extended to 120 min the toc removal was slightly increased from 49 to 52 increasing oxidant dosage and reaction temperature were both favorable for mineralization where toc removal reached 78 and 79 respectively thus we may conduct the ps oxidation reaction at increased oxidant dosage or elevated temperature to eliminate the remaining organic contents overall toc removal was largely different in seven reaction systems which might be explained by the observation that the distribution of products changes with reaction medium in this work ps oxidation of 24 dcp was carried out at 53 2 c for 90 min the high reaction temperature and long reaction time may improve the reaction efficiency between mono ring products and reactive species which facilitates the mineralization of these products into co2 and h2o therefore the residual toc 51 was mainly attributed to the coupling products which are resistant to further oxidation this speculation was further supported by the data shown in fig s15 that the sum of peak area of mono ring products was much lower than that of coupling products after 90 min of ps oxidation similar phenomenon was found for o3 oxidation in which we continuously bubbled o3 into aqueous reaction solution the mineralization degree was very low for the cases of naclo and fe vi demonstrating that fe vi and especially naclo oxidation was unfavorable for toc removal a high degree of chlorination 90 led to very low mineralization level during chlorination consistent with our study yang et al 2020 found that bisphenol f bpf could be rapidly removed at the fe vi bpf molar ratio of 10 1 but only 5 2 of toc was eliminated similar findings were also observed by gombos et al 2013 3 7 toxicity assessment to evalute the toxicity variation of the reaction solutions the experiments were carried out at an initial concentration of 3 mg l 24 dcp where nearly complete removal was also observed in our prescribed reaction period the inhibition rates of the 24 dcp reaction solutions to p phosphoreum were shown in fig 6 as seen the intial 24 dcp solution was very toxic with an inhibition rate of around 80 during the reaction process only uv and fenton treatment decreased the acute toxicity while the inhibition rate slightly increased for o3 and ps oxidation as seen from table s2 the number of mono ring products under uv irradiation was 18 much higher than those in ps and o3 solutions although the number of mono ring products in fenton system was comparable to ps and o3 a relatively less amount of coupling products were formed after fenton oxidation as shown in fig 3c and d the toxicity results predicted by ecosar program fig s16 also demonstrated that coupling products are very toxic combining the variation trend of toxicity and intermediate product we might attribute the first increase and then decrease in inhibition rate observed in the ozone sample to the evolution of toxic dimers p286 and p322 therefore the inhibition rate of the 24 dcp reaction solutions to p phosphoreum was related with the product distribution in the reaction medium other scholars also observed the generation of more toxic brominated coupling products such as hydroxylated polybrominated diphenyl ethers and biphenyls oh pbdes oh pbbs when bromophenols was treated by potassium permanganate sunlight irradiation and peroxydisulfate jiang et al 2014 zhao et al 2015 guan et al 2017 according to our study 24 dcp would definitely polymerize into more toxic chlorinated diphenyl ethers in common water treatment process therefore much more attention should be paid to the formation of toxic intermediates during 24 dcp removal due to the low abundance of toxic coupling products fig 3 and the gentle reaction condition uv irradiation is considered a better option for 24 dcp removal in water and wastewaters 4 conclusions according to our study we could obtain the following conclusions 1 seven chemical oxidation techniques could rapidly eliminate 24 dcp the time required for complete removal of 50 mg l 24 dcp ranges from 3 5 min for fe vi kmno4 naclo fenton and o3 treatments to 90 min for heat ps and uv irradiation 2 a total of 41 intermediates were identified and five pathways including dechlorination hydroxylation coupling chlorination and sulfate substitution were proposed 3 hydroxyl substitution and coupling reaction were common routes for 24 dcp removal a high degree of

17127,we systemically investigated the transformation behavior of 2 4 dichlorophenol 24 dcp in seven different reaction systems including kmno4 heat ps o3 uv fenton naclo and k2feo4 treatment the results revealed that complete removal of 24 dcp could be reached in minutes especially for fe vi kmno4 naclo fenton and o3 system a total of 41 products were identified by lc ms and 10 of them were validated using commercial and self synthesized standards hydroxyl substitution and coupling reactions were commonly observed in the studied systems meanwhile extra routes such as sulfate substitution de chlorination and direct oxidation were also involved for certain oxidation methods comparisons showed that a high degree of chlorination 90 occurred for naclo system while coupling products accounted for 45 of the removed 24 dcp under ps oxidation moreover low mineralization degree together with high aquatic toxicity was attributed to the occurrence of coupling reaction which was possibly related to the redox potential of the main oxidative species considering the low abundance of coupling products and the gentle reaction condition uv irradiation is a better option for 24 dcp removal in water and wastewaters these findings can deepen our understanding on the transformation process of 24 dcp and provide some useful information for the environmental elimination of substituted phenols graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords oxidation systems 2 4 dichlorophenol 24 dcp transformation products mineralization aquatic toxicity 1 introduction because of large production and widespread application chlorophenols are ubiquitously detected in natural environment lin 1982 melton 1982 jensen 1996 witthuhn et al 2005 gonzalez et al 2012 such as surface water groundwater soil sediment and even tap water 2 4 dichlorophenol 24 dcp listed as one of the 129 priority pollutants by us epa keith and telliard 1979 is assumed to be one of the most abundant chlorophenols in the aquatic environment house et al 1997 it was found at concentrations of 1 56 6 72 and 2 55 μg l in beitang drainage river in tianjin china zhong et al 2018 wastewater influent in king williams town and midstream of bloukrans river in south africa farounbi and ngqwala 2020 respectively moreover it is also regarded as an emerging disinfection by product dbp which has been detected at mg l level in simulated and real tap waters lin 1982 melton 1982 for example the maximum concentration of 24 dcp could reach as high as 2 2 0 3 mg l in tap water of the netherlands tang and huang 1996 generally the halogenated dbps would exhibit significantly higher toxicity than other commonly known dbps such as trihalomethanes and haloacetic acids liu and zhang 2014 it was reported that 24 dcp at a concentration of 100 µg l could affect the antioxidant defense system in the livers of the goldfish carassius auratus zhang et al 2003 due to its widespread occurrence poor biodegradability environmental persistence and high toxicity the research interest on 24 dcp is increasingly growing until now concentrated studies have been conducted on elimination of 24 dcp including physical adsorption shah et al 2017 biodegradation yang et al 2002 fenton and photo fenton oxidation tang and huang 1996 trapido et al 1998 ozone ultrasound trapido et al 1998 sunlight and photocatalytic degradation serra et al 1994 liu et al 2017 and 2019a h2o2 basic oxygen furnace slag li et al 1999 and catalytic reduction ezzatahmadi et al 2019a and b among them chemical oxidation shows excellent performance however it is difficult to directly compare the observations from different authors since reaction kinetics intermediates transformation pathways and toxicity variation may differ largely depending on the employed chemical oxidation method chemical oxidation techniques like fe vi kmno4 naclo fenton o3 and persulfate ps are common and popular methods in water and wastewater treatment they can degrade pollutants through different reaction mechanisms for instance fe vi as a multipurpose chemical reagent sharma et al 2016 eliminates a wide range of aqueous contaminants by single and or two electron s transfer process chen et al 2018a liu et al 2019b while sulfate and hydroxyl radicals are primary reactive species in ps system pan et al 2018a xiao et al 2019 gao et al 2019 most of previous studies have been conducted to examine the removal and dechlorination of 24 dcp in the aforementioned single reaction system leaving the overall transformation mechanisms and ecological risk assessment unknown in addition recent reports have demonstrated that the degradation of phenolic compounds is always accompanied with the formation of coupling products guan et al 2017 pan et al 2018a chen et al 2019 however the relationship between oxidation method and the polymerization degree as well as the influence of these coupling products on the ecosystem are still less studied in this context we systematically investigated the transformation behavior of aqueous 24 dcp by seven different treatment methods including fe vi kmno4 naclo uv fenton o3 and heat ps oxidation after an initial examination on the oxidation kinetics the transformation products and mechanisms were explored by lc ms analysis and quantum chemical calculations for further comparison moreover the mineralization degree of reaction solutions was measured and the toxicity of 24 dcp and its products to p phosphoreum was also assessed we devote to find an environmental friendly and highly effective technique with low or even no ecotoxicity to treat water and wastewaters containing 24 dcp and or substituted phenols 2 chemicals and methods 2 1 chemicals 24 dcp purity 99 246 trichlorophenol 246 cp 2346 tetrachlorophenol 2346 cp 2 monochlorophenol 2 cp 4 monochlorophenol 4 cp phenol maleic acid 1 4 benzoquinone 4 chlorocatehol and 2 chlorohydroquinone were all provided by aladdin co ltd shanghai china the chromatographic grade formic acid and methanol were provided by merck darmstadt germany oxidants including kmno4 naclo k2s2o8 and fenton reagent i e h2o2 and feso4 7h2o and the other chemicals of at least reagent grade were purchased from nanjing chemical reagent co ltd nanjing china k2feo4 purity 95 used in the experiments was synthesized according to the wet method delaude and laszlo 1996 stock solution of 1 g l 24 dcp was prepared in 10 mm naoh solution which could increase the water solubility of 24 dcp 2 2 experimental procedure oxidation experiments of 24 dcp by kmno4 heat ps and k2feo4 were performed according to previously established methods chen et al 2016 pan et al 2018b liu et al 2019b o3 was produced from a pem water fed ozone generator model bpem 002 yichang china and it was continuously bubbled into the aqueous solution of 50 mg l 24 dcp through a glass tube the concentration of o3 which was controlled by the magnitude of working current 11 5 a was determined to be 140 6 mg l by an iodometry method due to the very rapid removal of substrate we split the outlet ozone gas into two branches when examining the removal of 5 mg l 24 dcp uv irradiation was performed with a xpa 7 photochemical reactor nanjing xujiang electromechanical plant nanjing china which was detailedly described in our previous work pan et al 2019 a 300 w mercury lamp was used as light source and its irradiation intensity was measured as 41 mw cm2 by an ultraviolet radiometer photoelectric instrument factory of beijing normal university beijing china no obvious concentration change of 24 dcp was observed for dark control as seen from fig s1e chlorination and fenton reactions were conducted in 50 ml conical flasks with 5 or 50 mg l 24 dcp the oxidation reactions were initiated by adding a specific amount of oxidants with stirring on a magnetic stirrer at defined time intervals 900 µl of reaction solutions were withdrawn into 2 ml plastic centrifuge tubes which were pre added with 100 µl of 0 1 m na2s2o3 to end the reaction considering its environmental concentration and accompanied products analysis the substrate was used at two initial concentrations of 5 and 50 mg l to conduct experiments in the above mentioned seven different oxidation systems the initial ph was adjusted to 7 0 with 0 1 m naoh or hcl in heat ps kmno4 uv and o3 reaction solutions while the ph value was set at 3 0 for fenton reaction moreover the reaction solutions were buffered to ph 7 0 with 0 01 m phosphate buffer solution during naclo and k2feo4 treatments unless otherwise stated the tests were performed at ambient temperature 25 c all kinetic experiments were carried out in triplicate and mean values were presented with standard deviations in the cases of fenton kmno4 and k2feo4 500 µl of methanol were added into the plastic centrifuge tubes to exclude any possible adsorption effect then these samples were centrifuged at 12000 rpm for 5 min by a super minimax 12k centrifuge biomaker china to remove particles like mno2 and fe oh 3 the supernatants were then analyzed by lc in another batch of experiments 20 ml of reaction solutions were purified by digital control solid phase extraction apparatus model hse 08a guangzhou kexiao scientific instrument co ltd guangzhou china and eluted into 2 ml of methanol for lc ms analysis 2 3 analytic methods quantitative analysis of 24 dcp was performed with agilent 1260 high performance liquid chromatography equipped with a uv detector 20 µl of samples were injected into zorbax 300sb c18 column 150 4 6 mm 5 µm at a flow rate of 1 0 ml min the mobile phase was composed of methanol and 0 3 formic acid solution v v 65 35 the detection wavelength and total run time was 284 nm and 5 5 min respectively the intermediates of 24 dcp were identified by an agilent 1260 infinity hplc coupled with an x500r qtof mass spectrometer ab sciex usa in negative mode a thermo bds hypersil c18 column 100 2 1 mm 2 4 µm was used for chromatographic separation specific parameters were set according to the research of liu et al 2019c total organic carbon toc an indicator to represent mineralization degree was measured with an oi 1030d toc analyzer aurora usa 2 4 theoretical calculation gaussian 09 program was used to optimize the structures of dimer products and reactive phenoxy radicals at the b3lyp 6 311g level by entering keywords opt freq the bulk solvent effect of water was considered using the polarized continuum model pcm the dipole moment and spin density could be directly obtained from gaussian out files 2 5 toxicity assessment the toxicity of reaction solution was measured by luminescent bacteria bioassay to assess the potential risks of 24 dcp and its intermediates the lyophilized powder of p phosphoreum was obtained from nanjing kuake technology co ltd nanjing china the toxicity experiments were carried out according to the research of chen et al 2016 especially the reaction solutions treated by fe vi kmno4 and fenton reagent were filtered by 0 22 µm filter membrane and the ph value was further adjusted to neutral condition for toxicity evaluation the blank control experiment in the absence of 24 dcp was simultaneously conducted to investigate the effect of different oxidants on p phosphoreum and the results demonstrated no obvious inhibition to p phosphoreum eight replicate tests were done for all bioluminescence experiments moreover ecosar software was also used to evaluate the acute and chronic toxicity of 24 dcp and its intermediates pan et al 2017 chen et al 2018a 3 results and discussion 3 1 oxidation kinetics of 24 dcp the kinetics of 24 dcp oxidized by fe vi kmno4 naclo uv fenton o3 and ps were depicted in fig 1 apparently 50 mg l 24 dcp could be completely eliminated from solutions in minutes especially for fe vi kmno4 naclo fenton and o3 treatments 180 s and 5 min respectively to get insights into the oxidation efficiency of the substrate in environment related conditions the experiments were also conducted at a relatively low initial concentration of 5 mg l as seen from fig s1 highly effective removal of 5 mg l 24 dcp was also obtained in the seven oxidation systems especially the removal data of 24 dcp by naclo fe vi and kmno4 can be well fitted by second order kinetics model and the corresponding reaction rate constants k app were 38774 88 67722 00 and 469 79 m 1 min 1 it was reported that the oxidation reduction potential e 0 of naclo at ph 7 0 was 0 84 v slightly higher than fe vi and kmno4 0 70 and 0 59 v respectively sharma 2010 the larger k app during fe vi treatment might be explained by the existence of other intermediate iron species such as fe iv and fe v which were formed from fe vi by one electron or two electron transfer casbeer et al 2013 dong et al 2018 these secondary oxidants have relatively high e 0 and could also oxidize the target compound effectively meanwhile pseudo first order kinetics was adopted for the cases of ps uv fenton and o3 and the k obs values were calculated to be 0 02 0 08 0 24 and 2 07 min 1 respectively trapido et al 1998 also observed that the degradation rate of 24 dcp was higher in fenton oxidation as compared with uv irradiation in addition the removal rates all decreased with the decreasing initial concentration except for uv illumination and ozone oxidation this might be explained by the fact that the utilization efficiency of oxidants was reduced at a low concentration of target compound as reported by chen et al 2016 for a given uv intensity the photooxidation of 24 dcp occurred more rapidly in dilute aqueous solution which was in agreement with the findings of serra et al 1994 and pan et al 2019 3 2 products identification a total of 41 intermediates belonging to 29 nominal masses were identified by lc ms analysis and 10 of them were validated using commercial standards fig s2 and self synthesized standard fig s3 therefore p126a p126b p93 p108 p142a p142b p115 p194 p230 and p322 should be 2 cp 4 cp phenol 1 4 benzoquinone 2 chlorohydroquinone 4 chlorocatehol maleic acid 246 cp 2346 cp and 24 dcp dimer respectively structures of the other intermediates were assigned based on their parent ion masses chlorine isotope patterns and product ion spectra detailed ms ms spectra and ms information were summarized in fig s4 and table s1 several compounds like monochlorophenol benzoquinone or dihydroxy dichlorobenzene namely p176 dihydroxy chlorobenzene namely p142 phenol and maleic acid were commonly identified as the byproducts of 24 dcp potter 1993 serra et al 1994 jensen 1996 trapido et al 1998 li et al 1999 xu and wang 2012 xu et al 2013 ezzatahmadi et al 2019a and ezzatahmadi et al 2019b however some intermediates including polyhydroxylated phenols p157 p158 p174 and p192 sulfooxylated phenols p204 p222 p256 p272 p284 and p300 dimers and trimers p235 p252 p286 p322 p448 and p482 were the first to report in this work although trapido et al 1998 also detected dimers of 24 dcp in advanced oxidation processes no detailed information was given in addition eight pairs of isomers i e p123a and p123b p126a and p126b p142a and p142b p176a p176b and p176c p192a p192b and p192c p252a and p252b p286a p286b and p286c p448a and p448b were observed except for commercially available p126 and p142 we further confirmed the specific structures in terms of dipole moment µ calculated at the b3lyp 6 311g level by gaussian 09 software yao et al 2017 3 3 elucidation of transformation pathways based on lc ms and lc ms ms analyses the transformation pathways of 24 dcp in kmno4 fig s5 heat ps fig s6 o3 fig s7 uv fig s8 fenton fig s9 naclo fig s10 and fe vi fig s11 systems were tentatively proposed in general as shown in fig 2 five main pathways including direct dechlorination pathway i hydroxylation pathway ii self or and cross coupling reaction pathway iii chlorination pathway iv and sulfate substitution pathway v were involved in 24 dcp oxidation kmno4 treatment was selected as an example to illustrate the reaction pathways fig s5 in pathway i 24 dcp underwent dechlorination at c 4 site to generate 2 cp p126a pathway ii was initiated by mno4 attack on the c cl bond or c h bond of 24 dcp to yield the hydroxyl substitution products p142 or p176a which were finally transformed into 1 2 3 4 5 benzenepentol via successive hydroxylation p142 p176a p158a p192a p174 p157 in addition direct oxidation of p142 could form 1 4 benzoquinone p108 which was further oxidized into ring opening product p170 in pathway iii 24 dcp and its primary product p126 could lose one electron to form corresponding phenoxy radicals in the oxidative environment then self coupling of 24 dcp radicals or cross coupling between 24 dcp and 2 cp radicals led to the generation of dimers p322 or p286 and trimers p448 see fig 4 for more details the evolution profiles of 24 dcp and its transformation intermediates in kmno4 system were assessed by monitoring their peak area in lc ms spectra the results were depicted in fig s12 as seen kmno4 rapidly oxidized 24 dcp into 14 intermediates its dechlorinated self and cross coupling products denoted as p126a p286 and p322 respectively reached maxima just in 5 s followed by a gradual decline during this process the trimer p448a could be accumulated indicating that the extent of oligomerization increased with the reaction time the hydroxylation products appeared later and achieved the highest peak area after 15 s the faster generation and larger abundance of dechlorinated and coupling products than hydroxylation products suggested that dechlorination and coupling might play a dominant role during 24 dcp oxidation process in addition unlike p448a and p157 p170 was likely to be degraded into co2 and h2o after increase to the maxima it should be noted that extra routes such as sulfate substitution self coupling of monochlorophenol and trimerization of 24 dcp were also involved during ps oxidation the possible effect of the concentration of oxidants or reactive species on degradation pathways was also explored by improving ps dosage from 30 675 to 60 35 mm and the results were shown in fig s13 as seen faster removal of 24 dcp was observed at a higher ps dosage except for the disappearance of p204 the rest products remained exactly the same while their abundances were obviously decreased in agreement with the report by shao et al 2020 this might be attributed to the increasing amount of reactive species generated with increasing ps dosage which could further oxidize the reaction intermediates into co2 and h2o as confirmed by the increased toc removal shown in fig 5b for o3 and k2feo4 systems similar trimerization occurred to produce p482 under uv irradiation self coupling of monochlorophenol p126 and subsequent hydroxylation was observed which resulted in the production of p252a and p235 besides monochlorophenol could undergo direct oxidation and ring cleavage to form ketones and low molecular weight carboxylic acids in fenton system moreover successive chlorination to yield tri tetra penta chlorophenols p194 p230 and p264 was proposed as the fourth transformation route for naclo oxidation quantitative analysis showed that the concentration of 246 cp reached 43 87 mg l in 30 s and consequently its conversion yield the ratio of the formed 246 cp to the degraded 24 dcp was as high as 95 this result revealed that chlorination made an important contribution to 24 dcp removal 3 4 comparison of 24 dcp degradation in seven systems the presence of dichloro benzenediol p176 and hydroxylated tetra chlorinated diphenyl ether oh tcde p322 was observed in all studied systems figs s5 s11 suggesting that hydroxyl substitution and coupling reaction were common transformation routes of 24 dcp many researchers have also reported hydroxylation reaction in the studied systems potter 1993 serra et al 1994 gao et al 2014 negreira et al 2015 ji et al 2016 liu et al 2017 and 2019a chen et al 2019 oputu et al 2019 yang et al 2019 which involved mechanism of direct oxygen transfer or oh attack except for uv and naclo the product p286 generated from self or cross coupling reaction of 24 dcp was also found furthermore the product p126 formed from the parent 24 dcp by direct dechlorination appeared in fe vi kmno4 uv fenton and heat ps systems qi et al 2015 also found dechlorination of pentachlorophenol by microwave activated ps system however the distribution of the other intermediates was very complex as shown in table s2 in general the numbers of mono ring products obtained by kmno4 and especially uv illumination chlorination and fenton oxidation were 1 to 5 times higher than multi ring products while the number of these two categories of compounds was comparable for the other three systems given this situation we compared the maximum concentration or peak area of the four major primary products mono ring products p126 and p176 coupling products p286 and p322 to explore the contribution of the corresponding reaction pathway to 24 dcp removal and the result was shown in fig 3 as seen the abundance of these four products changed largely in seven systems to be specific the concentration of p126 ranged from 0 3 12 mg l the highest concentration was measured in kmno4 system while the yield of this dechlorination product was still lower than 10 the low concentration of p126 and the relatively high peak area of p176 p286 and p322 in heat ps system indicated that hydroxyl addition and especially polymerization including self and cross coupling reactions largely contributed to 24 dcp removal as compared with dechlorination similar phenomenon was found during ozonation the maximum concentrations of dimer products p286 and p322 during seven oxidation processes were approximately 0 10 and 11 28 mg l according to the semi quantitative analysis of the homologue triclosan and the self synthesized sample by lc tof ms it showed that around 45 of 24 dcp could be transformed into the dimer products especially the self coupling dimer p322 during ps oxidation consistent with the observation that the number of mono ring products was dominant hydroxylation played a significant role in 24 dcp removal under uv illumination and fenton oxidation as indicated by the large abundance of p176 in brief hydroxylation and coupling reaction rather than dechlorination are main transformation pathways of 24 dcp some unique products encircled by green line in figs s6 s10 were identified after heat ps o3 uv fenton and naclo treatments it is well known that heat activation of ps could produce sulfate radicals these radicals may attack c cl and c h bond of 24 dcp to form two sulfooxylated intermediates p222 and p256 respectively which were further transformed into p204 p300 and p272 by hydroxylation or p284 by sulfate substitution fig s6 4 hydroxy 1 2 benzoquinone p123b with a retention time of 4 77 min was produced during ozonation as presented in fig s7 uv illumination could yield 2 chloro 1 4 benzoquinone p140 1 2 3 5 tetrahydroxybenzene p141 and 1 chloro 3 7 dichlorodiphenyl ether p235 fig s8 while fenton regent oxidized 24 dcp into phenol p93 fig s9 by contrast tri to penta chlorophenols p194 p230 and p264 were produced after chlorination fig s10 in addition ring opening products p115 or and p170 were obtained in 24 dcp oxidation by kmno4 uv and fenton these comparisons demonstrated that the removal of 24 dcp was achieved through two general routes including hydroxylation and coupling reaction however the contribution of two routes will differ depending on the treatment methods furthermore additional reaction routes may also be involved in terms of the nature of oxidants in fact the seven oxidation systems used belong to three kinds of chemical oxidation namely direct oxidation fe vi mn vii and clo ultraviolet photodegradation and advanced oxidation heat ps o3 and fenton based on the aforementioned analysis the transformation pathways and their respective contributions to 24 dcp removal presented relatively large discrepancy among different treatments further demonstrating the vital role of the characteristics of oxidants themselves 3 5 theoretical calculations our previous studies have suggested that phenolic organic compounds or their hydroxyl containing intermediates can easily lose an electron to become corresponding radicals in an oxidizing environment and these radicals can further polymerize into dimers trimers and higher polymers pan et al 2018a chen et al 2018b and 2019 in this work we calculated the spin densities of 24 dcp 2 cp and 4 cp radicals to indicate the distribution of an unpaired electron for structural elucidation of dimers and trimers it was apparently seen from fig s14 that the unparied electron in the 24 dcp radical was most likely to appear at the phenolic hydroxyl oxygen namely o 7 and its conjugated para and ortho carbon sites c 3 c 5 and c 1 due to the relatively large values of mulliken atomic spin densities 0 378 0 347 0 287 and 0 276 respectively same results were also obtained in the 2 cp and 4 cp radicals these observations revealed that both self and cross coupling reaction could occur through c c and c o ways the detection of p286 and p322 verified the occurrence of coupling reactions via c o way fig 4 it should be noted that the relative abundance of p286 and p322 in seven systems was ordered as heat ps and o3 fenton kmno4 k2feo4 and clo fig 3 this was possibly explained by the relative higher redox potential of ps 2 01 v and o3 1 24 v than the rest three oxidants kmno4 0 59 v k2feo4 0 70 v and naclo 0 84 v as shown in table 1 the oxidant with higher e 0 value may abstract h atom or obtain an electron from phenolic organic compounds or their hydroxyl containing intermediates more easily to form the corresponding phenoxy radicals which finally polymerize into dimers trimers and other complex polymers although the e 0 value of h2o2 is comparable with that of ps and o3 these three systems have different reactive species which is another factor resulting in the observed trend of polymerization it is well known that fenton regent is a totally oh induced oxidation method while so4 and ps also co exist in heat ps situation when it comes to o3 system both o3 and oh are the oxidizing species using laser flash photolysis technology chen et al 2020 have measured a larger amount of phenoxy radicals during so4 driven oxidation i e electron transfer of phenol than that during ho mediated reaction namely h abstraction 3 6 mineralization degree mineralization degree of 24 dcp solutions at the end of reaction 3 min for kmno4 naclo k2feo4 and fenton reactions 5 min for o3 and 90 min for heat ps and uv irradiation was evaluated by toc measurement as depicted in fig 5 a mineralization degree was generally very low possibly due to the high initial concentration of 24 dcp 50 mg l and the formation of refractory intermediate products to be specific the toc removal was ordered as 49 heat ps 23 o3 21 uv 18 fenton kmno4 6 k2feo4 4 naclo it was unexpected that the largest toc removal was observed in heat ps system which had a high abundance of coupling products in addition we further explored reaction conditions leading to high mineralization in ps system as seen the nearly complete elimination of 24 dcp except for ph 11 0 where the residual 24 dcp was 11 together with the large discrepancy in toc removal was obtained at different experimental conditions specifically the removal of toc was significantly decreased when the initial ph was adjusted to ph 3 0 and especially ph 11 0 fig 5b this might be attributed to the ph dependent variation of polymerization degree qi et al 2021 when the reaction time was extended to 120 min the toc removal was slightly increased from 49 to 52 increasing oxidant dosage and reaction temperature were both favorable for mineralization where toc removal reached 78 and 79 respectively thus we may conduct the ps oxidation reaction at increased oxidant dosage or elevated temperature to eliminate the remaining organic contents overall toc removal was largely different in seven reaction systems which might be explained by the observation that the distribution of products changes with reaction medium in this work ps oxidation of 24 dcp was carried out at 53 2 c for 90 min the high reaction temperature and long reaction time may improve the reaction efficiency between mono ring products and reactive species which facilitates the mineralization of these products into co2 and h2o therefore the residual toc 51 was mainly attributed to the coupling products which are resistant to further oxidation this speculation was further supported by the data shown in fig s15 that the sum of peak area of mono ring products was much lower than that of coupling products after 90 min of ps oxidation similar phenomenon was found for o3 oxidation in which we continuously bubbled o3 into aqueous reaction solution the mineralization degree was very low for the cases of naclo and fe vi demonstrating that fe vi and especially naclo oxidation was unfavorable for toc removal a high degree of chlorination 90 led to very low mineralization level during chlorination consistent with our study yang et al 2020 found that bisphenol f bpf could be rapidly removed at the fe vi bpf molar ratio of 10 1 but only 5 2 of toc was eliminated similar findings were also observed by gombos et al 2013 3 7 toxicity assessment to evalute the toxicity variation of the reaction solutions the experiments were carried out at an initial concentration of 3 mg l 24 dcp where nearly complete removal was also observed in our prescribed reaction period the inhibition rates of the 24 dcp reaction solutions to p phosphoreum were shown in fig 6 as seen the intial 24 dcp solution was very toxic with an inhibition rate of around 80 during the reaction process only uv and fenton treatment decreased the acute toxicity while the inhibition rate slightly increased for o3 and ps oxidation as seen from table s2 the number of mono ring products under uv irradiation was 18 much higher than those in ps and o3 solutions although the number of mono ring products in fenton system was comparable to ps and o3 a relatively less amount of coupling products were formed after fenton oxidation as shown in fig 3c and d the toxicity results predicted by ecosar program fig s16 also demonstrated that coupling products are very toxic combining the variation trend of toxicity and intermediate product we might attribute the first increase and then decrease in inhibition rate observed in the ozone sample to the evolution of toxic dimers p286 and p322 therefore the inhibition rate of the 24 dcp reaction solutions to p phosphoreum was related with the product distribution in the reaction medium other scholars also observed the generation of more toxic brominated coupling products such as hydroxylated polybrominated diphenyl ethers and biphenyls oh pbdes oh pbbs when bromophenols was treated by potassium permanganate sunlight irradiation and peroxydisulfate jiang et al 2014 zhao et al 2015 guan et al 2017 according to our study 24 dcp would definitely polymerize into more toxic chlorinated diphenyl ethers in common water treatment process therefore much more attention should be paid to the formation of toxic intermediates during 24 dcp removal due to the low abundance of toxic coupling products fig 3 and the gentle reaction condition uv irradiation is considered a better option for 24 dcp removal in water and wastewaters 4 conclusions according to our study we could obtain the following conclusions 1 seven chemical oxidation techniques could rapidly eliminate 24 dcp the time required for complete removal of 50 mg l 24 dcp ranges from 3 5 min for fe vi kmno4 naclo fenton and o3 treatments to 90 min for heat ps and uv irradiation 2 a total of 41 intermediates were identified and five pathways including dechlorination hydroxylation coupling chlorination and sulfate substitution were proposed 3 hydroxyl substitution and coupling reaction were common routes for 24 dcp removal a high degree of chlorination 90 and coupling 45 was observed for naclo and ps oxidation respectively 4 the relatively high mineralization degree together with the low toxicity showed that uv operated at the gentle

17128,arsenopyrite is a common metal sulfide mineral and weathers readily in the open environment releases as and pollutes the surrounding environment humic acid ha is ubiquitous in soils sediments and waters and contains various functional groups and complex with arsenic iron and other metal ions that affect the weathering behavior of arsenopyrite because as iron and ha are redox active compounds electrochemical techniques including polarization curves electrochemical impedance spectroscopy eis and cyclic voltammetry cv were used to fundamentally investigate the weathering process and mechanism of arsenopyrite over a wide range of environmental relevant conditions polarization curves showed higher ha concentrations 0 1000 mg l 1 higher temperatures 5 35 c or acidities ph 1 0 7 0 promoted arsenopyrite weathering there was a linear relationship between the corrosion current density i corr temperature t and acidity ph i corr 3691 2 t 13 942 and i corr 0 2445ph 2 2125 respectively arsenopyrite weathering readily occurred in the presence of ha as confirmed by its activation energy of 24 1 kj mol 1 and eis measurements confirmed that the kinetics were controlled by surface reaction as confirmed by decreased double layer resistance cv and surface characterization ftir and xps showed that arsenopyrite initially oxidized to s0 as iii and fe2 then s0 and fe2 were ultimately converted into so4 2 and fe3 while as iii oxidized to as v furthermore the carboxyl cooh and phenolic oh of ha could bind with as iii v and fe3 via a ligand exchange mechanism forming as iii v ha and as iii v fe ha complexes that hinders the formation of feaso4 and decreases the bioavailability of as findings gained from this study are valuable for the understanding of the fate and transport of as in acidic conditions and have powerful implications for the remediation and management of as bearing sites affected by mining activities graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords arsenopyrite humic acid electrochemical techniques speciation transformation arsenic transformation 1 introduction arsenic is a ubiquitous non metallic toxic element ranking 20th in the earth s crust content because of its high bioavailability arsenic enters the food chain via plants and animals and eventually ingested by humans sharma et al 2014 long term human intake of arsenic contaminated food or water can cause cancers such as skin lungs and kidneys and negatively impact the intellectual development of children kumarathilaka et al 2018 the world health organization has set the limit of arsenic in drinking water to 10 μg l and it is estimated that 140 million people in 50 countries are at risk of arsenic poisoning glodowska et al 2020 in addition to anthropogenic arsenic pollution the most widespread occurrence of arsenic comes from the weathering of arsenic containing sulfide minerals such as arsenopyrite feass realgar as2s2 and orpiment as2s3 walker et al 2006 as one of the most abundant sulfide mineral arsenopyrite oxidation not only releases toxic arsenic ions into the environment which affects groundwater and irrigation water but also causes acid mine drainage and heavy metal ion pollution the weathering and oxidation of arsenopyrite involve a variety of electrochemical processes such as redox reactions interface interactions and adsorption of intermediate products almeida and giannetti 2003 deng and gu 2018 therefore the electrochemical behavior of arsenopyrite under various conditions has been investigated by many groups lazaro et al 1997 proposed that electrochemical oxidation in acidic media occurred via two steps initial arsenopyrite oxidation to fe ii and as2s2 followed by oxidation to fe iii arsenite and arsenate in contrast some scholars have speculated that arsenopyrite reacts with water molecules to undergo surface hydroxylation and oxidize to as2s3 almeida and giannetti 2003 or aso2 3 zhu et al 2014 and s and then each element oxidizes further recent studies have suggested ass 2 sequentially oxidizes to arsenite and arsenate hong et al 2018 the difference between neutral and alkaline conditions is that iron converts to feooh and fe oh 3 lara et al 2016 which effectively adsorb arsenic species in an actual natural environment ramirez aldaba et al 2016 used electrochemical impedance spectroscopy to explore and control environmental parameters they strengthened the idea that as v in the system benefitted the production of more stable surface products neil et al 2014 believed that engineered processes such as managed aquifer recharge mar could dramatically impact on the redox potential in the groundwater environment and trigger the oxidative dissolution of arsenopyrite which is the dominant cause of arsenic mobilization in mar as a product of chemical and microbial degradation of terrestrial and aquatic animals as well as plants humic acid ha is ubiquitous and the primary organic component in soils sediments and waters generally ha contains myriad oxygen containing functional groups that provides electron pairs such as carboxyl phenols hydroxyl and amines arsenic andiron ions can directly bind with ha to form inner sphere as ha and fe ha complexes via a ligand exchange mechanism sharma et al 2010 for arsenic ions the binding sites in ha can be loosely divided into a small number of strong binding sites such as amine groups and relatively weak binding sites that account for more than 90 of the total sites such as carboxyl and phenolic hydroxyl groups fakour and lin 2014 however the carboxyl and hydroxyl groups of ha can combine with fe to form a very stable fe ha complex and fe can act as a cation bridge to promote the binding of as on ha thereby forming a ternary complex as fe ha the complexation of metal bridges has been considered as one of the mechanisms by which ha binds as liu et al 2011 the molecular structure model of the complexes of as fe and ha hypothesized by wang and mulligan 2006 and sharma et al 2010 can intuitively show the complexity and diversity of this complex reaction the formation of as ha complexes has a significant impact on the fate mobilization and bioavailability of arsenic and expedites the release of arsenic from the natural and as contaminated environments therefore the influence of ha should be considered when examining the impact of arsenic on the environment fakour and lin 2014 liu and cai 2013 xu et al 2017 studied the effect of sulfide minerals on the leaching of gold by thiosulfate found that ha facilitated the dissolution of sulfide minerals and suggested it inhibited surface passivation this was consistent with zhang et al 2020a who reported that ha promoted arsenic immobilization it s believed that oxidation of as bearing sulfides as a major source of as pollution mckibben et al 2008 wu et al 2019 in addition the formation of as ha complexes facilitate the release of as from contaminated aquifer materials soils and sediments into groundwater liu et al 2011 wang and mulligan 2006 therefore it is necessary to study the oxidative dissolution of arsenopyrite under the influence of ha including the release and transformation of as and the effect on the surrounding water body but relatively few studies about this have been reported as mentioned above arsenopyrite weathers easily which releases as and metal ions ha can complex with these arsenic iron and metal ions and hence affects the weathering behaviors of arsenopyrite to the best of our knowledge there has been no report concerning the mechanisms of arsenopyrite oxidation from natural electrochemical interactions in the absence and presence of ha hence in this work different electrochemical techniques as well as surface analysis methods were adopted to characterize the weathering of arsenopyrite in both the presence and absence of ha at different acidities and temperatures with the following aims 1 to understand arsenopyrite weathering tendencies 2 to quantitatively obtain arsenopyrite weathering rates plus the transformations and electron transfer processes of elemental as fe and s and 3 ultimately reveal the weathering of arsenopyrite to shed light on the environmental implications for arsenopyrite pollution in natural waters 2 materials and methods 2 1 arsenopyrite sample and electrode preparation the sample of natural high purity arsenopyrite in this experiment was collected from a carlin type gold deposit in guangxi province china an x ray diffraction xrd analysis indicated the sample was pure or that impurity levels were below the detection limit of the device and corresponded to the diffraction pattern on jcpds card no 99 0014 the sample was cut into a cube with a bottom surface area of 0 25 cm2 the arsenopyrite sample was sealed in an epoxy resin and connected to a copper wire using silver paint to enhance the electrical contact of the mineral electrode and exposed only to the bottom surface of the solution muñoz et al 1998 detailed the method for making electrodes to ensure reproducibility the electrode was polished with silicon carbide sandpaper using 1000 3000 5000 mesh to obtain a mirror like surface before each experiment degreased using alcohol cleaned ultrasonically using deionized water and dried in circulating air the arsenopyrite powder used for the immersion tests was crushed and ground to 200 mesh using an agate mortar and pestle with an alcohol solvent the resulting powder was dried under nitrogen placed in a sealed plastic bag and stored in a vacuum drying dish to minimize oxidation 2 2 humic acid electrolyte the experiments were carried out in a humic acid electrolyte cas 1415 93 6 shanghai aladdin bio chem technology co ltd which contained more than 90 wt as fulvic acid after dissolving the ha in deionized water to obtain 0 10 100 and 1000 mg l electrolyte solutions the ph of each solution was adjusted to 1 0 3 0 5 0 and 7 0 respectively using hno3 and naoh solutions liu et al 2018 2 3 immersion eroded experiments eight 0 5 cm 0 5 cm 0 2 cm polished arsenopyrite block samples were used for surface morphology analyses the one of them was untreated and the other seven samples were immersed in seven different solutions 1 25 c ph 3 0 0 mg l 1 ha 2 25 c ph 3 0 1000 mg l 1 ha 3 25 c ph 3 0 100 mg l 1 ha 4 25 c

sample and the remaining seven samples were immersed in the seven different solutions add 2 0 g of arsenopyrite powder in 100 ml of the solution under the corresponding conditions into an erlenmeyer flask a ph meter measured ph changes of the four 25 c solutions 1 ph 3 0 0 mg l 1 ha 2 ph 3 0 1000 mg l 1 ha 3 ph 3 0 100 mg l 1 ha and 4 ph 5 0 100 mg l 1 ha each set of experiments were conducted in triplicate 2 4 electrochemical methods electrochemical experiments were conducted using an electrochemical workstation parstat 2273 princeton applied research coupled to a personal computer a conventional three electrode electrolytic cell was used in this study the arsenopyrite electrode platinum electrode and saturated calomel electrode sce were used as the working auxiliary and reference electrodes respectively a luggin capillary connected with the reference electrode was used to minimize the reference solution between the working and reference electrodes all potentials in this work were referenced to the sce 0 242 v vs standard hydrogen electrode at 25 c and e t 0 2412 6 61 10 4 t 25 1 75 10 6 t 25 2 9 0 10 10 t 25 3 v bard and faulkner 2001 in this work cyclic voltammetry cv polarization curves and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy eis were utilized to study the electrochemical character of arsenopyrite weathering cv is commonly used to describe the natural weathering of sulfide minerals since the technique can control the energetics of the interface between mineral electrolyte polarization curves and eis obtained weathering rates and information about the interface and structure during arsenopyrite oxidation the open circuit potential ocp of the arsenopyrite electrode was measured before conducting any electrochemical tests and only after the ocp reached a quasi steady state were those tests conducted the quasi stable state criterion was that a change did not exceed 2 0 mv per 5 min and remained stable for 400 s the value obtained was taken as the ocp value cv studies were conducted at a scan rate of 20 mv s 1 for positive scans the positive scan was from the ocp to 750 mv then reversed by 750 mv and finally back to the ocp the scanning rate was 10 mv s 1 for polarization curves and obtained by automatically changing the arsenopyrite electrode potential from 250 mv to 250 mv vs ocp eis experiments were conducted in a frequency range from 0 01 10000 hz with a sinusoidal signal amplitude of 10 mv and zsimpwin 3 20 2004 software was used to fit the impedance data to ensure reproducibility all electrochemical tests were conducted in triplicate 2 5 characterizations the untreated arsenopyrite block sample and the other seven weathered block samples were characterized using raman spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy sem jsm 6460lv to avoid surface damage surface of the mineral samples by the laser raman spectra british renishaw used 50 mw laser power at 514 nm and a collection time of 10 s samples for untreated arsenopyrite power and other weathered power were characterized by ftir and xps after weathering for two months ftir spectra were collected on a bruker vertex 70 ftir spectrometer coupled to an attenuated total reflectance atr accessory range from 600 4000 cm 1 resolution 4 cm 1 16 scans the as s related species and elemental chemical states on the arsenopyrite surface were determined by xps escalab 250xi and the spectra fitted using avantage 5 948 software for xps spectra all as 3d and s 2p were fitted by double peaks with spin orbit splitting of 0 68 ev and 1 19 ev and intensity ratios of 3 2 and 2 1 respectively two peaks in a doublet with the same chemical state have the same full width half maximum fwhm and all photoelectron binding energies be were referenced to c1s adventitious contamination peaks set at 285 0 ev be 3 results and discussions 3 1 electrochemical analysis 3 1 1 ocp study as reported previously ocp is a mixed potential and consists of the anodic oxidation of the mineral surface and cathodic reduction of dissolved oxygen pecina et al 2006 fig 1 a shows the ocp curves of arsenopyrite in ha solutions at different concentrations as a function of time after approximately 20 min the oc potential reached a quasi steady state and a passive film had spontaneously formed on the electrode surface the arsenopyrite ocp values at different conditions are listed in table 1 the ocp gradually increased as the ha concentration increased in solutions with ph 3 and 25 c the ocp value reflects electrode stability lower ocp levels correspond to easily occur eroded increasing in ha concentration may improve electrode stability by increasing ha adsorption onto the electrode surface to increase surface film resistance liu et al 2018 when changes to the electrolyte temperature were examined those results showed that temperature increases lowered the ocp of the arsenopyrite electrode as shown in fig 1 b and table 1 this may be due to the destruction of the surface passivation film at higher temperatures which lowers its stability and makes a more likely reaction at the electrode changing the electrolyte acidity at 25 c and 100 mg l 1 ha shown in fig 1 c and table 1 illustrate an inverse relationship between ph and ocp as ph increases led to oc potential decreases these results agree with moslemi et al 2011 who studied the effect of ph changes on the ocp of pyrite and pyrrhotite and concluded that lower ph caused an increase in the chemical activity of sulfide minerals ocp reflects the thermodynamic properties of the system when the ocp changes and attains a quasi steady state it means the spontaneously formed passive film on the mineral surface has stabilized and the system is thermodynamically stable the ocp reveals the weathering tendencies of the mineral i e a more negative ocp corresponds to easier oxidation and more weathering the ocp results showed that lower ha concentrations increasing temperatures or increasing solution ph all caused the ocp to drop a higher weathering tendency does not imply a faster weathering rate as that is a kinetic parameter and discussed in the next section 3 1 2 cv study cv tests of arsenopyrite in ha solutions at different temperatures 5 15 25 and 35 c and concentrations 0 100 and 1000 mol l are illustrated in fig 2 the voltammograms at different conditions were similar and means that changes in temperature or ha concentration did not change the electrochemical oxidation mechanism of arsenopyrite fig 2 shows that at the same scan potential increasing the temperature or ha concentration increases the current change and there is an imbalance and disproportion between the anode and cathode current values this indicated that most of the oxidation products are soluble and the oxidation is irreversible lara et al 2016 the arsenopyrite cv curves contained three anodic peaks a1 a2 and a3 and three cathodic peaks c1 c2 and c3 when the potential was swept from the oc potential to 0 75 v an anodic peak a1 appeared at 200 mv and was attributed to the oxidation of arsenopyrite reaction 1 deng et al 2018a substances formed in a1 oxidized further a2 at potentials from 500 600 mv as the scanning potential increased the anode current density increased sharply which correspond to electrochemical reactions 2 4 based on previous reports deng and gu 2018 lin and zheng 1996 1 a1 feass 3h2o aso3 3 fe2 s0 6h 5e 2 a2 fe2 fe3 e 3 s0 4h2o 8h so4 2 6e 4 aso3 3 h2o aso4 3 2h 2e in the reverse scan the first reduction peak c1 appeared at approximately 400 mv and may be associated with the reduction of ferric ions to ferrous ions reaction 5 the second reduction peak c2 appeared 150 mv lazaro et al 1997 and almeida and giannetti 2003 attributed c2 to the reduction of as v to as iii as seen in reaction 6 and the species change in the reaction is possible based on the eh ph diagram of arsenopyrite lu and zhu 2010 near 550 mv the third reduction peak c3 was detected reaction 7 which was caused by the formation of h2s liu et al 2020 when the potential was scanned in the positive direction again a small oxidation peak a3 appears 100 mv reaction 8 which corresponded to the reverse c3 giannetti et al 2001 5 c1 fe3 e fe2 6 c2 aso4 3 2h 2e aso3 3 h2o 7 c3 s0 2h 2e h2s 8 a3 h2s s0 2h 2e 3 1 3 polarization curves study polarization curves examine the corrosion resistance and oxidation mechanisms in materials such as semiconductor minerals and alloys mansfeld 2005 noted that a polarization curve was an effective method for monitoring the corrosion rate and can be used to obtain the polarization resistance polarization curves allow for the rapid collection of the corrosion potential e corr and corrosion current density i corr for sulfide minerals the mineral e corr and i corr values yield thermodynamic and kinetic information respectively due to their excellent semiconductor properties the corrosion potential indicates the stability and the potential for mineral reaction activity a higher e corr suggests higher stability according to faraday s law a larger i corr reflects a faster corrosion rate which can be calculated quantitatively based on i corr to evaluate the environmental impact fig 3 shows the polarization curves of arsenopyrite in ha solutions at different concentrations a temperatures b and acidities c all polarization curves have similar shapes indicating the redox reactions that occur under different conditions operate by the same electrochemical mechanism the i corr values were obtained by the tafel extrapolation method which extrapolates the tafel lines of the cathode and anode to the e corr bard and faulkner 2001 the polarization curve fitting results are listed in table 2 differences between the e corr and the oc potential may be caused by the charging current related to the scan rate zhang et al 2009 when at larger ha concentrations the polarization curve moved slightly to the upper right which indicated an increase in the e corr and i corr of arsenopyrite the i corr increased from 1 16 to 1 33 µa cm 2 when the ha concentration went from 0 to 10 mg l 1 increased to 1 57 µa cm 2 at 100 mg l 1 and reached 1 65 µa cm 2 at a ha concentration of 1000 mg l 1 this means that increasing the ha concentration promoted the oxidative dissolution of arsenopyrite but the e corr continued to shift in a positive direction with increasing ha concentration and suggested difficulty in arsenopyrite erosion the two opposite conclusions are not contradictory the dissolution of arsenopyrite in an acidic environment is undoubtedly an electrochemical reaction the anode and cathode reactions are shown in reactions 1 and 9 respectively according to previous studies liu and cai 2013 liu et al 2011 ha can coordinate with as iii as v and fe to form stable as ha fe ha and as fe ha complexes through ligand exchange mechanism formation of these stable complexes promoted the anodic reaction and increases electron transfer as reaction 1 progresses more elemental sulfur accumulated on the surface which passivates of arsenopyrite and led to the positive e corr these two effects worked concurrently and the promotion caused by complexation dominates and intensifies mineral corrosion 9 o2 4h 4e 2h2o when the ha electrolyte temperature rose the polarization curves simultaneously shifted to the right and down which indicated an increased i corr and a negative shift of e corr at higher temperatures higher internal energy and faster ion transfer are conducive to weathering when the temperature increased from 5 to 15 c the i corr increased from 0 71 to 1 07 µa cm 2 and reached 1 57 and 1 98 µa cm 2 at 25 and 35 c respectively when the electrolyte ph increased the e corr of arsenopyrite decreased which is consistent with the change in ocp it showed that increasing the ph lowered the thermodynamic stability of the arsenopyrite electrode and the reason for that change will be explained in the following section reaction 9 shows that the hydrogen ion acts as the reactant at the cathode in an acidic environment therefore increasing the h concentration promoted the reaction progress therefore lowered ph levels increased the i corr within the ph tested range the i corr dropped from 1 95 to 0 56 µa cm 2 when the ph increased from 1 0 to 7 0 as mentioned above the corrosion current density i corr reflects the corrosion rate when the ha concentration increased the corrosion current density i corr also increased and due to ha complexation with metal ions which was greater than its adsorption on the mineral surface this was reflected in the eis data a small increase in passivation film resistance r f and a dramatically decreased of the charge transfer resistance r t furthermore fakour and lin 2014 calculated the conditional distribution coefficient k d of arsenate and arsenate binding to ha and used that to characterize the capacity of as binding to ha from the mass perspective they pointed out that an increase in ha concentration did not impact the k d values therefore there was no linear relationship between the ha concentration and i corr ha does not participate in the oxidation reaction but complexes with weathering products when the electrolyte temperature increased the corrosion current density i corr increased and that increase was due to decreases in both the passivation resistance r f and charge transfer resistance r t furthermore i corr and temperature t displayed a good linear relationship over the experimental temperature range 5 35 c i corr 3691 2 t 13 942 r 2 0 994 as shown in fig 4 a when the electrolyte acidity increased the corrosion current density i corr increased and due to a larger decrease of charge transfer resistance r t with higher acidity furthermore i corr and ph displayed good linearity over the experimental ph range ph 1 0 7 0 i corr 0 2445ph 2 2125 r 2 0 977 as shown in fig 4 b oxidative dissolution rate is an important parameter for environmental evaluation the oxidative dissolution rate of arsenopyrite can be quantitatively determined depends on the faraday formula v m i corr n f using the following parameters v is the dissolution rate g m 2 h 1 n is the valence state f is the faraday constant 96485 c mol 1 m is the atomic weight g mol 1 table 3 shows the dissolution rate of arsenopyrite at different ha concentrations temperatures and solution ph the dissolution rate of arsenopyrite was 2 40 10 8 mol m 2 s 1 at 25 c ph 3 0 without ha meaning 1 m2 of arsenopyrite would release 56 81 g of as iii yearly into the surrounding environment the dissolution rate increased to 3 42 10 8 mol m 2 s 1 when the ha concentration increased to 1000 mg l 1 meaning 80 81 g as iii would be released per year activation energy e a conveys the potential and difficulty of a chemical process and also reveals the rate limiting step of a reaction the activation energy e a of arsenopyrite can be calculated using the arrhenius deformation formula based on the corrosion current density i corr obtained from electrochemical measurements 10 l n i corr 2 i corr 1 l n k 2 k 1 e a r 1 t 2 1 t 1 where k is the rate constant r is the universal gas constant 8 314 j mol 1 k 1 t is the absolute temperature k and e a is the apparent activation energy kj mol 1 here the activation energy of arsenopyrite was 24 1 kj mol 1 at ph 3 0 and 100 mg l 1 ha this result revealed the oxidative dissolution kinetics of arsenopyrite were controlled by the surface reaction lasaga 1998 who pointed out the interaction was controlled by the surface reaction if the activation energy was 20 kj mol 1 as the most common mineral containing arsenic it is necessary to study the activation energies of arsenopyrite reactions in aquatic and terrestrial environments which helps assess its potential threat to the environment previous activation energy calculations were carried out in flow reactors or autoclaves table 4 yu et al 2007 employed a short term 6 8 h mixed flow reactor and reported an arsenopyrite activation energy of 43 0 ph 1 8 and 57 0 kj mol 1 ph 5 9 asta et al 2010 spent 600 4500 h experimenting in a flow through reactor at ph 1 0 and 8 7 mg l input dissolved o2 and found its activation energy was 18 5 1 6 kj mol 1 rodríguez rodríguez et al 2018 used a cylindrical glass reactor and calculated an activation energy of just 4 1 kj mol 1 in the presence of ozone 0 079 g o3 l in this work we utilized a different methodology to determine activation energy 3 1 4 electrochemical impedance spectroscopy study eis tests were performed to understand the faradaic and diffusion reactions at the mineral electrode lasia 2002 and explain the polarization curve conclusions fig 5 depicts the nyquist a b c and bode a b c plots of arsenopyrite electrodes in ha solutions at different concentrations a a temperatures b b and acidities c c all bode diagrams show two time constants which indicated the electrochemical corrosion mechanism remained the same regardless of the conditions two capacitive loops were present in the high and low frequency regions the high frequency capacitive loop corresponded to the pseudo capacitance and the resistance of the surface layer while the low frequency capacitive loop was associated with the double layer capacitance of the solution mineral interface and the charge transfer resistance based on this analysis the electrochemical weathering process that occurs at the mineral solution interface was modeled by an electrochemical equivalent circuit eec shown in fig 6 where r f r t and r s are the passive film resistance charge transfer resistance and ohmic resistance of the solution respectively the constant phase element of cpe f and cpe dl was adopted to replace the pure capacitances of the passive film and double layer since the loops deviated from an ideal semicircle c f and c dl represent the capacitance levels of the cpe f and cpe dl the experimental data and fitting results are listed in table 5 comparing the fitting parameters in table 5 lower ha concentrations higher temperatures or higher ph lowered the r f increased the c f and indicated a smaller passive film resistance for the charge transfer resistance r t higher ha concentrations higher temperatures and greater electrolyte acidity lead to a lower charge transfer resistance that symbolized the double layer transmission capacity enhancement these data support the polarization curve results that a larger current occurs at higher ha concentration temperature or acidity increasing the ha concentration reflected a small increase in passivation film resistance r f and a dramatic decrease of the charge transfer resistance r t in the eis data the i corr increase was due to decreases in the passivation resistance r f and charge transfer resistance r t when temperature increased moreover a more considerable decrease of charge transfer resistance r t with higher acidity the changing trends of r t and c dl are always opposite an increase in c dl means a local dielectric constant increase the value of n usually adopted to describe the deviation of the cpe from the ideal capacitive córdoba torres et al 2012 as well as the roughness or heterogeneity of the electrode surface the value of n decreased as the ha concentration temperature and acidity all increased which indicated a more intense reaction and the arsenopyrite surface became more heterogeneous and rough 3 2 characterizations 3 2 1 as 3d 5 2 and s 2p 3 2 xps analysis xps spectra for the unreacted and eroded arsenopyrite samples under different ha solutions are shown in fig s1 a series of narrow scans were detected to identify the element states and determine the levels at of as 3d and s 2p based on the areas under peaks the fitted peak parameters of as 3d and s 2p are shown in tables s1 and s2 the unreacted spectra of xps as shown by the as 3d 5 2 fig s1a and s 2p 3 2 fig s1a shows the arsenic species consisted of as 0 42 20 ev as iii o 44 20 ev as v o 45 40 ev and a major component as i s 41 60 ev that accounted for 56 11 the sulfur species consisted of s2 161 90 ev s0 164 10ev small fractions of so3 2 166 70 ev and so4 2 168 80 ev besides the major peak ass 2 at 162 70 ev and accounted for 57 19 the as 3d 5 2 fig s1b h and s 2p 3 2 fig s1b h show the xps spectra of oxidized arsenopyrite combined with table s1 from b to h the intensity of the as v o peak gradually increased and changed from 29 81 to 46 94 while the peak intensity of as i s gradually decreased from 38 73 to 25 94 this indicated the oxidation of as gradually intensified and agreed with the increasing corrosion current in the polarization curve in addition as the s 2p 3 2 spectra shows the degree of oxidation of s gradually increased in the same way as and the amount of so4 2 increased from 6 78 to 12 72 sn 2 wasn t detected during the experiment velásquez et al 2005 and may be because sn 2 is the normal precursor to s0 steudel 1996 and readily degrades into s0 and h2s in acidic solution woollins 2006 the xps spectra results showed that higher temperatures lower ph and higher ha concentrations accelerate the oxidation of arsenopyrite and unambiguously confirm the electrochemical conclusions 3 2 2 raman spectra analysis raman spectroscopy was used to identify the phases of oxidation product precipitates after arsenopyrite weathering and those spectra are shown in fig s2 for the unreacted arsenopyrite four peaks were detected at 212 274 334 and 582 cm 1 which corresponded to characteristic arsenopyrite raman peaks according to previous reports mernagh and trudu 1993 wu et al 2019 three more peaks at 155 388 and 845 cm 1 were detected in the raman spectra of arsenopyrite after two months of weathering as compared with the unreacted sample the peak at 388 cm 1 was still attributed to arsenopyrite mernagh and trudu 1993 while the peaks at 155 and 845 cm 1 were derived from elemental sulfur murciego et al 2019 and arsenate v 3 asymmetric stretching mode in ferric arsenates gomez et al 2010 murciego et al 2011 confirmation of the s0 raman peak verifies the rationality of the electrochemical anode reaction 1 previous studies on the reaction scheme of sulfur in the oxidation process of arsenopyrite have been reported fernandez et al 1996b believe that sulfur in the crystal lattice was initially oxidized to thiosulfate and then a portion of the s2o3 2 decomposed into s0 and so3 2 while the other portion combined to form s4o6 2 in the presence of as iii so3 2 and s4o6 2 both oxidize to the final product sulfate mcguire et al 2001 showed that thiosulfate decomposed to form s0 and proposed that there must be another reaction scheme with low oxidation state sulfur for instance s0 must be the initial product instead of directly forming high oxidation state oxygen containing sulfides because the production of s0 exceeded 50 of the total sulfur this view is in accord with zhu et al 2014 who contend that s came from the precursor sn 2 and oxidized further to so3 2 and so4 2 the aso3 3 and fe2 formed by reaction 1 could further oxidize to form aso4 3 and fe3 due to the low solubility of feaso4 log k sp feas o 4 20 2 aso4 3 and fe3 can form a stable iron arsenate precipitate that adheres to the mineral surface 3 2 3 ftir spectra analysis for the binding of ha and elements fe as the ftir spectra for ha the unreacted and eroded arsenopyrite samples in the absence and presence of ha after two months are shown in fig s3 a b the absorption peaks in the unreacted arsenopyrite sample occurred at 435 1127 and 1637 cm 1 and agreed with previously reported data henao and godoy 2010 khummalai and boonamnuayvitaya 2005 for the raw ha the ftir data showed it contained three different functional groups namely a carboxyl peak at 1600 cm 1 coo c o stretching and possibly aromatic c c skeletal vibrations and phenol peaks at 1385 and 1035 cm 1 oh vibrations of phenols amir et al 2010 for the eroded sample spectra in the absence of ha two new peaks appeared at 840 and 1040 cm 1 which correspond to the stretching vibrations of ferric arsenate compounds gomez et al 2010 whereas in the presence of ha in addition to the two bands that appeared at 840 and 1040 cm 1 another band at 1385 cm 1 also appeared and was assigned to the phenol group which suggested that some ha adsorbed on the mineral surface peaks from ha complexations were not observed perhaps due to the amount of arsenic and iron ions from arsenopyrite weathering was too small to detect to verify that ha can form complexes with arsenic and iron ions additional immersion experiments were conducted by adding 50 mg ha to a 20 ml solution with ph 3 0 containing 0 0048 mol l as v and or fe iii fig s3 c shows the ftir results complexation of carboxyl cooh and phenol hydroxyl oh groups with metal ions through ligand exchange mechanisms results in the frequency shift and shape change of the infrared peaks of the functional groups the coo peak at 1600 cm 1 shifted to 1615 cm 1 in fe ha system caused by the formation of fe ha complexes and indicating binding of fe to ha via coo in contrast when as was added to system and formed as ha and as fe ha complexes the peak of coo moved further to 1630 cm 1 sharma et al 2010 the frequency shifts of oh peaks from 1385 to 1395 cm 1 and 1035 to 1060 cm 1 were observed in as v ha and as v fe ha systems which may be due to the formation of as v o ha through oh via ligand exchange zhang et al 2020a unlike the predecessors our ftir did not detect the peak of arsenic complexing with ha through amine groups this may be due to the fact that the amine group content in ha is too small to be detected fakour and lin 2014 a new peak at 940 cm 1 appeared for the as v fe ha system and attributed to an asymmetric ν as as o fe vibration which indicated that as v binding with fe ha and formed a ternary complex as v fe ha through metal bridges mechanisms many researchers pothier et al 2020 believe that the formation of as iii v fe ha and as iii v ha decreases their bioavailability in the presence of ha which reduces the risks of as to the surrounding organisms 3 3 summarized mechanisms for arsenopyrite weathering absence presence of ha combining electrochemical measurements with and raman ftir and xps surface analyses the interaction of arsenopyrite oxidation in an ha solution is summarized in fig 7 initially arsenopyrite oxidized to s0 as iii and fe2 s0 and fe2 gradually converted to so4 2 and fe3 and as iii oxidized to as v arsenate as v and fe3 could generate iron arsenate feaso4 feaso4 and the aggregation of s0 attached to the arsenopyrite surface inhibited arsenopyrite weathering when the solution contained ha it weakened passivation by complexation with as iii v and fe3 to form amorphous as iii v fe ha and as iii v ha which hindered feaso4 formation of liu et al 2011 eis tests showed that r t values dropped significantly as the concentration of ha increased 3 4 changes in ph during soaking tests bulk mineral samples were immersed in seven different solutions and characterized by both raman spectroscopy and sem after weathering for two months according to corrosion current densities i corr table 2 and dissolution rate constants table 3 degree of mineral weathering in these seven solutions follows this order 5 c ph 3 0 100 mg l 1 ha 25 c ph 5 0 100 mg l 1 ha 15 c ph 3 0 100 mg l 1 ha 25 c ph 3 0 0 mg l 1 ha 25 c ph 3 0 100 mg l 1 ha 25 c ph 3 0 1000 mg l 1 ha 35 c ph 3 0 100 mg l 1 ha sem images of the unreacted and eroded samples are shown in fig s4 the morphologies showed the product layer on the surface of the mineral became thicker as the degree of corrosion increased fig s5 shows the variation in ph with time in ph 3 0 0 mg l 1 ha ph 3 0 1000 mg l 1 ha ph 3 0 100 mg l 1 ha and ph 5 0 100 mg l 1 ha at 25 c within five days of the initial soaking the ph in the ph 3 0 solution gradually increased and differed slightly from changes that occurred in the ph 5 0 solution which the ph value decreased rapidly at the beginning five minutes of the arsenopyrite power soaked in the solution but increased during the following five days the increase in ph may be due to arsenopyrite oxidation which produced s0 fe2 aso3 3 haso3 2 and h2aso3 similar situations have also appeared in previous studies deng et al 2018b zhang et al 2020b as s0 gradually oxidized into sulfite and sulfate the acidity of the solution gradually increased the solution ph fluctuated because fe2 to fe3 oxidation consumes hydrogen ions while the hydroxylation of fe3 produced hydrogen ions in an acidic environment at lower ph fe3 has a lower degree of hydroxylation and preferably combines with ha buschmann et al 2006 which may contribute to the final solution order of ph 3 0 1000 mg l 1 ha ph 3 0 100 mg l 1 ha ph 5 0 100 mg l 1 ha ph 3 0 0 mg l 1 ha the release and accumulation of hydrogen ions from sulfide minerals have always been an environmental problem that cannot be ignored we have proven through electrochemical tests that high h concentrations promote arsenopyrite weathering and aggravate the pollution of toxic as iii v however it should be noted that ha inhibits the behavior of hydrogen ion contamination to a certain extent observed during immersion experiments and alleviates its pollution to the surrounding areas around the mines as previously reported zhang et al 2020a zheng et al 2019 4 environmental implications in natural water environment the weathering of arsenopyrite is a spontaneous electrochemical process which is strongly affected by the environmental conditions such as temperature ph and ha concentration using a suite of electrochemical techniques we reported that high temperature large acidity and high ha concentration promoted arsenopyrite weathering rate specifically the small apparent activation energy meaning arsenopyrite weathering easily occur during the weathering process higher temperature stronger acidity or larger concentration of ha accelerated arsenopyrite weathering that could enhance as release risk arsenopyrite initially oxidized to as iii and ultimately to as v in the absence of ha in contrast formation of as iii v fe ha and as iii v ha in the presence of ha decreases as bioavailability and thus decrease the risks of as to the aqueous environment when assessing a reality water environment effects from arsenopyrite weathering special attention should be paid to temperature differences caused by different latitudes longitudes and seasonal changes in addition to the ha concentration and ph 5 conclusions the weathering behavior of arsenopyrite in solutions of ha was studied using electrochemical and surface analysis techniques the presence of ha significantly affected the oxidation of arsenopyrite and the conversion of fe and as species 1 ha combined with iron and arsenic oxidation products to form as fe ha and as ha complexes via ligand exchange mechanisms and consequently suppressed the generation of passivation iron arsenate the mineral adsorbed ha enriched the attack of fe3 on the surface which noticeably enhanced arsenopyrite oxidation 2 electrochemical tests showed that higher ha concentration temperature or acidity can facilitate the weathering of arsenopyrite across the duration of the experiment 3 polarization curve tests indicated that temperature and ph of the environment had a considerable impact on the arsenopyrite oxidation rate there were both positive and negative linear relationships with the corrosion current density namely i corr 3691 2 t 13 942 and i corr 0 2445ph 2 2125 4 the activation energy of arsenopyrite oxidation in ph 3 0 and 100 mg l 1 ha solution was 24 1 kj mol 1 and the rate of as iii released in the ha solution under various conditions were between 1 16 10 8 and 4 10 10 8 mol m 2 s 1 these experiments provided a demonstration of a rapid and quantitative calculation for arsenic pollution using electrochemical techniques in containing arsenopyrite around mining sites they also showed the significance in assessing the risks of arsenopyrite in the presence of ha to the surrounding area declaration of competing interest the authors declare that

17128,arsenopyrite is a common metal sulfide mineral and weathers readily in the open environment releases as and pollutes the surrounding environment humic acid ha is ubiquitous in soils sediments and waters and contains various functional groups and complex with arsenic iron and other metal ions that affect the weathering behavior of arsenopyrite because as iron and ha are redox active compounds electrochemical techniques including polarization curves electrochemical impedance spectroscopy eis and cyclic voltammetry cv were used to fundamentally investigate the weathering process and mechanism of arsenopyrite over a wide range of environmental relevant conditions polarization curves showed higher ha concentrations 0 1000 mg l 1 higher temperatures 5 35 c or acidities ph 1 0 7 0 promoted arsenopyrite weathering there was a linear relationship between the corrosion current density i corr temperature t and acidity ph i corr 3691 2 t 13 942 and i corr 0 2445ph 2 2125 respectively arsenopyrite weathering readily occurred in the presence of ha as confirmed by its activation energy of 24 1 kj mol 1 and eis measurements confirmed that the kinetics were controlled by surface reaction as confirmed by decreased double layer resistance cv and surface characterization ftir and xps showed that arsenopyrite initially oxidized to s0 as iii and fe2 then s0 and fe2 were ultimately converted into so4 2 and fe3 while as iii oxidized to as v furthermore the carboxyl cooh and phenolic oh of ha could bind with as iii v and fe3 via a ligand exchange mechanism forming as iii v ha and as iii v fe ha complexes that hinders the formation of feaso4 and decreases the bioavailability of as findings gained from this study are valuable for the understanding of the fate and transport of as in acidic conditions and have powerful implications for the remediation and management of as bearing sites affected by mining activities graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords arsenopyrite humic acid electrochemical techniques speciation transformation arsenic transformation 1 introduction arsenic is a ubiquitous non metallic toxic element ranking 20th in the earth s crust content because of its high bioavailability arsenic enters the food chain via plants and animals and eventually ingested by humans sharma et al 2014 long term human intake of arsenic contaminated food or water can cause cancers such as skin lungs and kidneys and negatively impact the intellectual development of children kumarathilaka et al 2018 the world health organization has set the limit of arsenic in drinking water to 10 μg l and it is estimated that 140 million people in 50 countries are at risk of arsenic poisoning glodowska et al 2020 in addition to anthropogenic arsenic pollution the most widespread occurrence of arsenic comes from the weathering of arsenic containing sulfide minerals such as arsenopyrite feass realgar as2s2 and orpiment as2s3 walker et al 2006 as one of the most abundant sulfide mineral arsenopyrite oxidation not only releases toxic arsenic ions into the environment which affects groundwater and irrigation water but also causes acid mine drainage and heavy metal ion pollution the weathering and oxidation of arsenopyrite involve a variety of electrochemical processes such as redox reactions interface interactions and adsorption of intermediate products almeida and giannetti 2003 deng and gu 2018 therefore the electrochemical behavior of arsenopyrite under various conditions has been investigated by many groups lazaro et al 1997 proposed that electrochemical oxidation in acidic media occurred via two steps initial arsenopyrite oxidation to fe ii and as2s2 followed by oxidation to fe iii arsenite and arsenate in contrast some scholars have speculated that arsenopyrite reacts with water molecules to undergo surface hydroxylation and oxidize to as2s3 almeida and giannetti 2003 or aso2 3 zhu et al 2014 and s and then each element oxidizes further recent studies have suggested ass 2 sequentially oxidizes to arsenite and arsenate hong et al 2018 the difference between neutral and alkaline conditions is that iron converts to feooh and fe oh 3 lara et al 2016 which effectively adsorb arsenic species in an actual natural environment ramirez aldaba et al 2016 used electrochemical impedance spectroscopy to explore and control environmental parameters they strengthened the idea that as v in the system benefitted the production of more stable surface products neil et al 2014 believed that engineered processes such as managed aquifer recharge mar could dramatically impact on the redox potential in the groundwater environment and trigger the oxidative dissolution of arsenopyrite which is the dominant cause of arsenic mobilization in mar as a product of chemical and microbial degradation of terrestrial and aquatic animals as well as plants humic acid ha is ubiquitous and the primary organic component in soils sediments and waters generally ha contains myriad oxygen containing functional groups that provides electron pairs such as carboxyl phenols hydroxyl and amines arsenic andiron ions can directly bind with ha to form inner sphere as ha and fe ha complexes via a ligand exchange mechanism sharma et al 2010 for arsenic ions the binding sites in ha can be loosely divided into a small number of strong binding sites such as amine groups and relatively weak binding sites that account for more than 90 of the total sites such as carboxyl and phenolic hydroxyl groups fakour and lin 2014 however the carboxyl and hydroxyl groups of ha can combine with fe to form a very stable fe ha complex and fe can act as a cation bridge to promote the binding of as on ha thereby forming a ternary complex as fe ha the complexation of metal bridges has been considered as one of the mechanisms by which ha binds as liu et al 2011 the molecular structure model of the complexes of as fe and ha hypothesized by wang and mulligan 2006 and sharma et al 2010 can intuitively show the complexity and diversity of this complex reaction the formation of as ha complexes has a significant impact on the fate mobilization and bioavailability of arsenic and expedites the release of arsenic from the natural and as contaminated environments therefore the influence of ha should be considered when examining the impact of arsenic on the environment fakour and lin 2014 liu and cai 2013 xu et al 2017 studied the effect of sulfide minerals on the leaching of gold by thiosulfate found that ha facilitated the dissolution of sulfide minerals and suggested it inhibited surface passivation this was consistent with zhang et al 2020a who reported that ha promoted arsenic immobilization it s believed that oxidation of as bearing sulfides as a major source of as pollution mckibben et al 2008 wu et al 2019 in addition the formation of as ha complexes facilitate the release of as from contaminated aquifer materials soils and sediments into groundwater liu et al 2011 wang and mulligan 2006 therefore it is necessary to study the oxidative dissolution of arsenopyrite under the influence of ha including the release and transformation of as and the effect on the surrounding water body but relatively few studies about this have been reported as mentioned above arsenopyrite weathers easily which releases as and metal ions ha can complex with these arsenic iron and metal ions and hence affects the weathering behaviors of arsenopyrite to the best of our knowledge there has been no report concerning the mechanisms of arsenopyrite oxidation from natural electrochemical interactions in the absence and presence of ha hence in this work different electrochemical techniques as well as surface analysis methods were adopted to characterize the weathering of arsenopyrite in both the presence and absence of ha at different acidities and temperatures with the following aims 1 to understand arsenopyrite weathering tendencies 2 to quantitatively obtain arsenopyrite weathering rates plus the transformations and electron transfer processes of elemental as fe and s and 3 ultimately reveal the weathering of arsenopyrite to shed light on the environmental implications for arsenopyrite pollution in natural waters 2 materials and methods 2 1 arsenopyrite sample and electrode preparation the sample of natural high purity arsenopyrite in this experiment was collected from a carlin type gold deposit in guangxi province china an x ray diffraction xrd analysis indicated the sample was pure or that impurity levels were below the detection limit of the device and corresponded to the diffraction pattern on jcpds card no 99 0014 the sample was cut into a cube with a bottom surface area of 0 25 cm2 the arsenopyrite sample was sealed in an epoxy resin and connected to a copper wire using silver paint to enhance the electrical contact of the mineral electrode and exposed only to the bottom surface of the solution muñoz et al 1998 detailed the method for making electrodes to ensure reproducibility the electrode was polished with silicon carbide sandpaper using 1000 3000 5000 mesh to obtain a mirror like surface before each experiment degreased using alcohol cleaned ultrasonically using deionized water and dried in circulating air the arsenopyrite powder used for the immersion tests was crushed and ground to 200 mesh using an agate mortar and pestle with an alcohol solvent the resulting powder was dried under nitrogen placed in a sealed plastic bag and stored in a vacuum drying dish to minimize oxidation 2 2 humic acid electrolyte the experiments were carried out in a humic acid electrolyte cas 1415 93 6 shanghai aladdin bio chem technology co ltd which contained more than 90 wt as fulvic acid after dissolving the ha in deionized water to obtain 0 10 100 and 1000 mg l electrolyte solutions the ph of each solution was adjusted to 1 0 3 0 5 0 and 7 0 respectively using hno3 and naoh solutions liu et al 2018 2 3 immersion eroded experiments eight 0 5 cm 0 5 cm 0 2 cm polished arsenopyrite block samples were used for surface morphology analyses the one of them was untreated and the other seven samples were immersed in seven different solutions 1 25 c ph 3 0 0 mg l 1 ha 2 25 c ph 3 0 1000 mg l 1 ha 3 25 c ph 3 0 100 mg l 1 ha 4 25 c

sample and the remaining seven samples were immersed in the seven different solutions add 2 0 g of arsenopyrite powder in 100 ml of the solution under the corresponding conditions into an erlenmeyer flask a ph meter measured ph changes of the four 25 c solutions 1 ph 3 0 0 mg l 1 ha 2 ph 3 0 1000 mg l 1 ha 3 ph 3 0 100 mg l 1 ha and 4 ph 5 0 100 mg l 1 ha each set of experiments were conducted in triplicate 2 4 electrochemical methods electrochemical experiments were conducted using an electrochemical workstation parstat 2273 princeton applied research coupled to a personal computer a conventional three electrode electrolytic cell was used in this study the arsenopyrite electrode platinum electrode and saturated calomel electrode sce were used as the working auxiliary and reference electrodes respectively a luggin capillary connected with the reference electrode was used to minimize the reference solution between the working and reference electrodes all potentials in this work were referenced to the sce 0 242 v vs standard hydrogen electrode at 25 c and e t 0 2412 6 61 10 4 t 25 1 75 10 6 t 25 2 9 0 10 10 t 25 3 v bard and faulkner 2001 in this work cyclic voltammetry cv polarization curves and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy eis were utilized to study the electrochemical character of arsenopyrite weathering cv is commonly used to describe the natural weathering of sulfide minerals since the technique can control the energetics of the interface between mineral electrolyte polarization curves and eis obtained weathering rates and information about the interface and structure during arsenopyrite oxidation the open circuit potential ocp of the arsenopyrite electrode was measured before conducting any electrochemical tests and only after the ocp reached a quasi steady state were those tests conducted the quasi stable state criterion was that a change did not exceed 2 0 mv per 5 min and remained stable for 400 s the value obtained was taken as the ocp value cv studies were conducted at a scan rate of 20 mv s 1 for positive scans the positive scan was from the ocp to 750 mv then reversed by 750 mv and finally back to the ocp the scanning rate was 10 mv s 1 for polarization curves and obtained by automatically changing the arsenopyrite electrode potential from 250 mv to 250 mv vs ocp eis experiments were conducted in a frequency range from 0 01 10000 hz with a sinusoidal signal amplitude of 10 mv and zsimpwin 3 20 2004 software was used to fit the impedance data to ensure reproducibility all electrochemical tests were conducted in triplicate 2 5 characterizations the untreated arsenopyrite block sample and the other seven weathered block samples were characterized using raman spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy sem jsm 6460lv to avoid surface damage surface of the mineral samples by the laser raman spectra british renishaw used 50 mw laser power at 514 nm and a collection time of 10 s samples for untreated arsenopyrite power and other weathered power were characterized by ftir and xps after weathering for two months ftir spectra were collected on a bruker vertex 70 ftir spectrometer coupled to an attenuated total reflectance atr accessory range from 600 4000 cm 1 resolution 4 cm 1 16 scans the as s related species and elemental chemical states on the arsenopyrite surface were determined by xps escalab 250xi and the spectra fitted using avantage 5 948 software for xps spectra all as 3d and s 2p were fitted by double peaks with spin orbit splitting of 0 68 ev and 1 19 ev and intensity ratios of 3 2 and 2 1 respectively two peaks in a doublet with the same chemical state have the same full width half maximum fwhm and all photoelectron binding energies be were referenced to c1s adventitious contamination peaks set at 285 0 ev be 3 results and discussions 3 1 electrochemical analysis 3 1 1 ocp study as reported previously ocp is a mixed potential and consists of the anodic oxidation of the mineral surface and cathodic reduction of dissolved oxygen pecina et al 2006 fig 1 a shows the ocp curves of arsenopyrite in ha solutions at different concentrations as a function of time after approximately 20 min the oc potential reached a quasi steady state and a passive film had spontaneously formed on the electrode surface the arsenopyrite ocp values at different conditions are listed in table 1 the ocp gradually increased as the ha concentration increased in solutions with ph 3 and 25 c the ocp value reflects electrode stability lower ocp levels correspond to easily occur eroded increasing in ha concentration may improve electrode stability by increasing ha adsorption onto the electrode surface to increase surface film resistance liu et al 2018 when changes to the electrolyte temperature were examined those results showed that temperature increases lowered the ocp of the arsenopyrite electrode as shown in fig 1 b and table 1 this may be due to the destruction of the surface passivation film at higher temperatures which lowers its stability and makes a more likely reaction at the electrode changing the electrolyte acidity at 25 c and 100 mg l 1 ha shown in fig 1 c and table 1 illustrate an inverse relationship between ph and ocp as ph increases led to oc potential decreases these results agree with moslemi et al 2011 who studied the effect of ph changes on the ocp of pyrite and pyrrhotite and concluded that lower ph caused an increase in the chemical activity of sulfide minerals ocp reflects the thermodynamic properties of the system when the ocp changes and attains a quasi steady state it means the spontaneously formed passive film on the mineral surface has stabilized and the system is thermodynamically stable the ocp reveals the weathering tendencies of the mineral i e a more negative ocp corresponds to easier oxidation and more weathering the ocp results showed that lower ha concentrations increasing temperatures or increasing solution ph all caused the ocp to drop a higher weathering tendency does not imply a faster weathering rate as that is a kinetic parameter and discussed in the next section 3 1 2 cv study cv tests of arsenopyrite in ha solutions at different temperatures 5 15 25 and 35 c and concentrations 0 100 and 1000 mol l are illustrated in fig 2 the voltammograms at different conditions were similar and means that changes in temperature or ha concentration did not change the electrochemical oxidation mechanism of arsenopyrite fig 2 shows that at the same scan potential increasing the temperature or ha concentration increases the current change and there is an imbalance and disproportion between the anode and cathode current values this indicated that most of the oxidation products are soluble and the oxidation is irreversible lara et al 2016 the arsenopyrite cv curves contained three anodic peaks a1 a2 and a3 and three cathodic peaks c1 c2 and c3 when the potential was swept from the oc potential to 0 75 v an anodic peak a1 appeared at 200 mv and was attributed to the oxidation of arsenopyrite reaction 1 deng et al 2018a substances formed in a1 oxidized further a2 at potentials from 500 600 mv as the scanning potential increased the anode current density increased sharply which correspond to electrochemical reactions 2 4 based on previous reports deng and gu 2018 lin and zheng

associated with the reduction of ferric ions to ferrous ions reaction 5 the second reduction peak c2 appeared 150 mv lazaro et al 1997 and almeida and giannetti 2003 attributed c2 to the reduction of as v to as iii as seen in reaction 6 and the species change in the reaction is possible based on the eh ph diagram of arsenopyrite lu and zhu 2010 near 550 mv the third reduction peak c3 was detected reaction 7 which was caused by the formation of h2s liu et al 2020 when the potential was scanned in the positive direction again a small oxidation peak a3 appears 100 mv reaction 8 which corresponded to the reverse c3 giannetti et al 2001 5 c1 fe3 e fe2 6 c2 aso4 3 2h 2e aso3 3 h2o 7 c3 s0 2h 2e h2s 8 a3 h2s s0 2h 2e 3 1 3 polarization curves study polarization curves examine the corrosion resistance and oxidation mechanisms in materials such as semiconductor minerals and alloys mansfeld 2005 noted that a polarization curve was an effective method for monitoring the corrosion rate and can be used to obtain the polarization resistance polarization curves allow for the rapid collection of the corrosion potential e corr and corrosion current density i corr for sulfide minerals the mineral e corr and i corr values yield thermodynamic and kinetic information respectively due to their excellent semiconductor properties the corrosion potential indicates the stability and the potential for mineral reaction activity a higher e corr suggests higher stability according to faraday s law a larger i corr reflects a faster corrosion rate which can be calculated quantitatively based on i corr to evaluate the environmental impact fig 3 shows the polarization curves of arsenopyrite in ha solutions at different concentrations a temperatures b and acidities c all polarization curves have similar shapes indicating the redox reactions that occur under different conditions operate by the same electrochemical mechanism the i corr values were obtained by the tafel extrapolation method which extrapolates the tafel lines of the cathode and anode to the e corr bard and faulkner 2001 the polarization curve fitting results are listed in table 2 differences between the e corr and the oc potential may be caused by the charging current related to the scan rate zhang et al 2009 when at larger ha concentrations the polarization curve moved slightly to the upper right which indicated an increase in the e corr and i corr of arsenopyrite the i corr increased from 1 16 to 1 33 µa cm 2 when the ha concentration went from 0 to 10 mg l 1 increased to 1 57 µa cm 2 at 100 mg l 1 and reached 1 65 µa cm 2 at a ha concentration of 1000 mg l 1 this means that increasing the ha concentration promoted the oxidative dissolution of arsenopyrite but the e corr continued to shift in a positive direction with increasing ha concentration and suggested difficulty in arsenopyrite erosion the two opposite conclusions are not contradictory the dissolution of arsenopyrite in an acidic environment is undoubtedly an electrochemical reaction the anode and cathode reactions are shown in reactions 1 and 9 respectively according to previous studies liu and cai 2013 liu et al 2011 ha can coordinate with as iii as v and fe to form stable as ha fe ha and as fe ha complexes through ligand exchange mechanism formation of these stable complexes promoted the anodic reaction and increases electron transfer as reaction 1 progresses more elemental sulfur accumulated on the surface which passivates of arsenopyrite and led to the positive e corr these two effects worked concurrently and the promotion caused by complexation dominates and intensifies mineral corrosion 9 o2 4h 4e 2h2o when the ha electrolyte temperature rose the polarization curves simultaneously shifted to the right and down which indicated an increased i corr and a negative shift of e corr at higher temperatures higher internal energy and faster ion transfer are conducive to weathering when the temperature increased from 5 to 15 c the i corr increased from 0 71 to 1 07 µa cm 2 and reached 1 57 and 1 98 µa cm 2 at 25 and 35 c respectively when the electrolyte ph increased the e corr of arsenopyrite decreased which is consistent with the change in ocp it showed that increasing the ph lowered the thermodynamic stability of the arsenopyrite electrode and the reason for that change will be explained in the following section reaction 9 shows that the hydrogen ion acts as the reactant at the cathode in an acidic environment therefore increasing the h concentration promoted the reaction progress therefore lowered ph levels increased the i corr within the ph tested range the i corr dropped from 1 95 to 0 56 µa cm 2 when the ph increased from 1 0 to 7 0 as mentioned above the corrosion current density i corr reflects the corrosion rate when the ha concentration increased the corrosion current density i corr also increased and due to ha complexation with metal ions which was greater than its adsorption on the mineral surface this was reflected in the eis data a small increase in passivation film resistance r f and a dramatically decreased of the charge transfer resistance r t furthermore fakour and lin 2014 calculated the conditional distribution coefficient k d of arsenate and arsenate binding to ha and used that to characterize the capacity of as binding to ha from the mass perspective they pointed out that an increase in ha concentration did not impact the k d values therefore there was no linear relationship between the ha concentration and i corr ha does not participate in the oxidation reaction but complexes with weathering products when the electrolyte temperature increased the corrosion current density i corr increased and that increase was due to decreases in both the passivation resistance r f and charge transfer resistance r t furthermore i corr and temperature t displayed a good linear relationship over the experimental temperature range 5 35 c i corr 3691 2 t 13 942 r 2 0 994 as shown in fig 4 a when the electrolyte acidity increased the corrosion current density i corr increased and due to a larger decrease of charge transfer resistance r t with higher acidity furthermore i corr and ph displayed good linearity over the experimental ph range ph 1 0 7 0 i corr 0 2445ph 2 2125 r 2 0 977 as shown in fig 4 b oxidative dissolution rate is an important parameter for environmental evaluation the oxidative dissolution rate of arsenopyrite can be quantitatively determined depends on the faraday formula v m i corr n f using the following parameters v is the dissolution rate g m 2 h 1 n is the valence state f is the faraday constant 96485 c mol 1 m is the atomic weight g mol 1 table 3 shows the dissolution rate of arsenopyrite at different ha concentrations temperatures and solution ph the dissolution rate of arsenopyrite was 2 40 10 8 mol m 2 s 1 at 25 c ph 3 0 without ha meaning 1 m2 of arsenopyrite would release 56 81 g of as iii yearly into the surrounding environment the dissolution rate increased to 3 42 10 8 mol m 2 s 1 when the ha concentration increased to 1000 mg l 1 meaning 80 81 g as iii would be released per year activation energy e a conveys the potential and difficulty of a chemical process and also reveals the rate limiting step of a reaction the activation energy e a of arsenopyrite can be calculated using the arrhenius deformation formula based on the corrosion current density i corr obtained from electrochemical measurements 10 l n i corr 2 i corr 1 l n k 2 k 1 e a

energy of arsenopyrite was 24 1 kj mol 1 at ph 3 0 and 100 mg l 1 ha this result revealed the oxidative dissolution kinetics of arsenopyrite were controlled by the surface reaction lasaga 1998 who pointed out the interaction was controlled by the surface reaction if the activation energy was 20 kj mol 1 as the most common mineral containing arsenic it is necessary to study the activation energies of arsenopyrite reactions in aquatic and terrestrial environments which helps assess its potential threat to the environment previous activation energy calculations were carried out in flow reactors or autoclaves table 4 yu et al 2007 employed a short term 6 8 h mixed flow reactor and reported an arsenopyrite activation energy of 43 0 ph 1 8 and 57 0 kj mol 1 ph 5 9 asta et al 2010 spent 600 4500 h experimenting in a flow through reactor at ph 1 0 and 8 7 mg l input dissolved o2 and found its activation energy was 18 5 1 6 kj mol 1 rodríguez rodríguez et al 2018 used a cylindrical glass reactor and calculated an activation energy of just 4 1 kj mol 1 in the presence of ozone 0 079 g o3 l in this work we utilized a different methodology to determine activation energy 3 1 4 electrochemical impedance spectroscopy study eis tests were performed to understand the faradaic and diffusion reactions at the mineral electrode lasia 2002 and explain the polarization curve conclusions fig 5 depicts the nyquist a b c and bode a b c plots of arsenopyrite electrodes in ha solutions at different concentrations a a temperatures b b and acidities c c all bode diagrams show two time constants which indicated the electrochemical corrosion mechanism remained the same regardless of the conditions two capacitive loops were present in the high and low frequency regions the high frequency capacitive loop corresponded to the pseudo capacitance and the resistance of the surface layer while the low frequency capacitive loop was associated with the double layer capacitance of the solution mineral interface and the charge transfer resistance based on this analysis the electrochemical weathering process that occurs at the mineral solution interface was modeled by an electrochemical equivalent circuit eec shown in fig 6 where r f r t and r s are the passive film resistance charge transfer resistance and ohmic resistance of the solution respectively the constant phase element of cpe f and cpe dl was adopted to replace the pure capacitances of the passive film and double layer since the loops deviated from an ideal semicircle c f and c dl represent the capacitance levels of the cpe f and cpe dl the experimental data and fitting results are listed in table 5 comparing the fitting parameters in table 5 lower ha concentrations higher temperatures or higher ph lowered the r f increased the c f and indicated a smaller passive film resistance for the charge transfer resistance r t higher ha concentrations higher temperatures and greater electrolyte acidity lead to a lower charge transfer resistance that symbolized the double layer transmission capacity enhancement these data support the polarization curve results that a larger current occurs at higher ha concentration temperature or acidity increasing the ha concentration reflected a small increase in passivation film resistance r f and a dramatic decrease of the charge transfer resistance r t in the eis data the i corr increase was due to decreases in the passivation resistance r f and charge transfer resistance r t when temperature increased moreover a more considerable decrease of charge transfer resistance r t with higher acidity the changing trends of r t and c dl are always opposite an increase in c dl means a local dielectric constant increase the value of n usually adopted to describe the deviation of the cpe from the ideal capacitive córdoba torres et al 2012 as well as the roughness or heterogeneity of the electrode surface the value of n decreased as the ha concentration temperature and acidity all increased which indicated a more intense reaction and the arsenopyrite surface became more heterogeneous and rough 3 2 characterizations 3 2 1 as 3d 5 2 and s 2p 3 2 xps analysis xps spectra for the unreacted and eroded arsenopyrite samples under different ha solutions are shown in fig s1 a series of narrow scans were detected to identify the element states and determine the levels at of as 3d and s 2p based on the areas under peaks the fitted peak parameters of as 3d and s 2p are shown in tables s1 and s2 the unreacted spectra of xps as shown by the as 3d 5 2 fig s1a and s 2p 3 2 fig s1a shows the arsenic species consisted of as 0 42 20 ev as iii o 44 20 ev as v o 45 40 ev and a major component as i s 41 60 ev that accounted for 56 11 the sulfur species consisted of s2 161 90 ev s0 164 10ev small fractions of so3 2 166 70 ev and so4 2 168 80 ev besides the major peak ass 2 at 162 70 ev and accounted for 57 19 the as 3d 5 2 fig s1b h and s 2p 3 2 fig s1b h show the xps spectra of oxidized arsenopyrite combined with table s1 from b to h the intensity of the as v o peak gradually increased and changed from 29 81 to 46 94 while the peak intensity of as i s gradually decreased from 38 73 to 25 94 this indicated the oxidation of as gradually intensified and agreed with the increasing corrosion current in the polarization curve in addition as the s 2p 3 2 spectra shows the degree of oxidation of s gradually increased in the same way as and the amount of so4 2 increased from 6 78 to 12 72 sn 2 wasn t detected during the experiment velásquez et al 2005 and may be because sn 2 is the normal precursor to s0 steudel 1996 and readily degrades into s0 and h2s in acidic solution woollins 2006 the xps spectra results showed that higher temperatures lower ph and higher ha concentrations accelerate the oxidation of arsenopyrite and unambiguously confirm the electrochemical conclusions 3 2 2 raman spectra analysis raman spectroscopy was used to identify the phases of oxidation product precipitates after arsenopyrite weathering and those spectra are shown in fig s2 for the unreacted arsenopyrite four peaks were detected at 212 274 334 and 582 cm 1 which corresponded to characteristic arsenopyrite raman peaks according to previous reports mernagh and trudu 1993 wu et al 2019 three more peaks at 155 388 and 845 cm 1 were detected in the raman spectra of arsenopyrite after two months of weathering as compared with the unreacted sample the peak at 388 cm 1 was still attributed to arsenopyrite mernagh and trudu 1993 while the peaks at 155 and 845 cm 1 were derived from elemental sulfur murciego et al 2019 and arsenate v 3 asymmetric stretching mode in ferric arsenates gomez et al 2010 murciego et al 2011 confirmation of the s0 raman peak verifies the rationality of the electrochemical anode reaction 1 previous studies on the reaction scheme of sulfur in the oxidation process of arsenopyrite have been reported fernandez et al 1996b believe that sulfur in the crystal lattice was initially oxidized to thiosulfate and then a portion of the s2o3 2 decomposed into s0 and so3 2 while the other portion combined to form s4o6 2 in the presence of as iii so3 2 and s4o6 2 both oxidize to the final product sulfate mcguire et al 2001 showed that thiosulfate decomposed to form s0 and proposed that there must be another reaction scheme with low oxidation state sulfur for instance s0 must be the initial product instead of directly forming high oxidation state oxygen containing sulfides because the production of s0 exceeded 50 of the total sulfur this view is in accord with zhu et al 2014 who contend that s came from the precursor sn 2 and oxidized further to so3 2 and so4 2 the aso3 3 and fe2 formed by reaction 1 could further oxidize to form aso4 3 and fe3 due to the low solubility of feaso4 log k sp feas o 4 20 2 aso4 3 and fe3 can form a stable iron arsenate precipitate that adheres to the mineral surface 3 2 3 ftir spectra analysis for the binding of ha and elements fe as the ftir spectra for ha the unreacted and eroded arsenopyrite samples in the absence and presence of ha after two months are shown in fig s3 a b the absorption peaks in the unreacted arsenopyrite sample occurred at 435 1127 and 1637 cm 1 and agreed with previously reported data henao and godoy 2010 khummalai and boonamnuayvitaya 2005 for the raw ha the ftir data showed it contained three different functional groups namely a carboxyl peak at 1600 cm 1 coo c o stretching and possibly aromatic c c skeletal vibrations and phenol peaks at 1385 and 1035 cm 1 oh vibrations of phenols amir et al 2010 for the eroded sample spectra in the absence of ha two new peaks appeared at 840 and 1040 cm 1 which correspond to the stretching vibrations of ferric arsenate compounds gomez et al 2010 whereas in the presence of ha in addition to the two bands that appeared at 840 and 1040 cm 1 another band at 1385 cm 1 also appeared and was assigned to the phenol group which suggested that some ha adsorbed on the mineral surface peaks from ha complexations were not observed perhaps due to the amount of arsenic and iron ions from arsenopyrite weathering was too small to detect to verify that ha can form complexes with arsenic and iron ions additional immersion experiments were conducted by adding 50 mg ha to a 20 ml solution with ph 3 0 containing 0 0048 mol l as v and or fe iii fig s3 c shows the ftir results complexation of carboxyl cooh and phenol hydroxyl oh groups with metal ions through ligand exchange mechanisms results in the frequency shift and shape change of the infrared peaks of the functional groups the coo peak at 1600 cm 1 shifted to 1615 cm 1 in fe ha system caused by the formation of fe ha complexes and indicating binding of fe to ha via coo in contrast when as was added to system and formed as ha and as fe ha complexes the peak of coo moved further to 1630 cm 1 sharma et al 2010 the frequency shifts of oh peaks from 1385 to 1395 cm 1 and 1035 to 1060 cm 1 were observed in as v ha and as v fe ha systems which may be due to the formation of as v o ha through oh via ligand exchange zhang et al 2020a unlike the predecessors our ftir did not detect the peak of arsenic complexing with ha through amine groups this may be due to the fact that the amine group content in ha is too small to be detected fakour and lin 2014 a new peak at 940 cm 1 appeared for the as v fe ha system and attributed to an asymmetric ν as as o fe vibration which indicated that as v binding with fe ha and formed a ternary complex as v fe ha through metal bridges mechanisms many researchers pothier et al 2020 believe that the formation of as iii v fe ha and as iii v ha decreases their bioavailability in the presence of ha which reduces the risks of as to the surrounding organisms 3 3 summarized mechanisms for arsenopyrite weathering absence presence of ha combining electrochemical measurements with and raman ftir and xps surface analyses the interaction of arsenopyrite oxidation in an ha solution is summarized in fig 7 initially arsenopyrite oxidized to s0 as iii and fe2 s0 and fe2 gradually converted to so4 2 and fe3 and as iii oxidized to as v arsenate as v and fe3 could generate iron arsenate feaso4 feaso4 and the aggregation of s0 attached to the arsenopyrite surface inhibited arsenopyrite weathering when the solution contained ha it weakened passivation by complexation with as iii v and fe3 to form amorphous as iii v fe ha and as iii v ha which hindered feaso4 formation of liu et al 2011 eis tests showed that r t values dropped significantly as the concentration of ha increased 3 4 changes in ph during soaking tests bulk mineral samples were immersed in seven different solutions and characterized by both raman spectroscopy and sem after weathering for two months according to corrosion current densities i corr table 2 and dissolution rate constants table 3 degree of mineral weathering in these seven solutions follows this order 5 c ph 3 0 100 mg l 1 ha 25 c ph 5 0 100 mg l 1 ha 15 c ph 3 0 100 mg l 1 ha 25 c ph 3 0 0 mg l 1 ha 25 c ph 3 0 100 mg l 1 ha 25 c ph 3 0 1000 mg l 1 ha 35 c ph 3 0 100 mg l 1 ha sem images of the unreacted and eroded samples are shown in fig s4 the morphologies showed the product layer on the surface of the mineral became thicker as the degree of corrosion increased fig s5 shows the variation in ph with time in ph 3 0 0 mg l 1 ha ph 3 0 1000 mg l 1 ha ph 3 0 100 mg l 1 ha and ph 5 0 100 mg l 1 ha at 25 c within five days of the initial soaking the ph in the ph 3 0 solution gradually increased and differed slightly from changes that occurred in the ph 5 0 solution which the ph value decreased rapidly at the beginning five minutes of the arsenopyrite power soaked in the solution but increased during the following five days the increase in ph may be due to arsenopyrite oxidation which produced s0 fe2 aso3 3 haso3 2 and h2aso3 similar situations have also appeared in previous studies deng et al 2018b zhang et al 2020b as s0 gradually oxidized into sulfite and sulfate the acidity of the solution gradually increased the solution ph fluctuated because fe2 to fe3 oxidation consumes hydrogen ions while the hydroxylation of fe3 produced hydrogen ions in an acidic environment at lower ph fe3 has a lower degree of hydroxylation and preferably combines with ha buschmann et al 2006 which may contribute to the final solution order of ph 3 0 1000 mg l 1 ha ph 3 0 100 mg l 1 ha ph 5 0 100 mg l 1 ha ph 3 0 0 mg l 1 ha the release and accumulation of hydrogen ions from sulfide minerals have always been an environmental problem that cannot be ignored we have proven through electrochemical tests that high h concentrations promote arsenopyrite weathering and aggravate the pollution of toxic as iii v however it should be noted that ha inhibits the behavior of hydrogen ion contamination to a certain extent observed during immersion experiments and alleviates its pollution to the surrounding areas around the mines as previously reported zhang et al 2020a zheng et al 2019 4 environmental implications in natural water environment the weathering of arsenopyrite is a spontaneous electrochemical process which is strongly affected by the environmental conditions such as temperature ph and ha concentration using a suite of electrochemical techniques we reported that high temperature large acidity and high ha concentration promoted arsenopyrite weathering rate specifically the small apparent activation energy meaning arsenopyrite weathering easily occur during the weathering process higher temperature stronger acidity or larger concentration of ha accelerated arsenopyrite weathering that could enhance as release risk arsenopyrite initially oxidized to as iii and ultimately to as v in the absence of ha in contrast formation of as iii v fe ha and as iii v ha in the presence of ha decreases as bioavailability and thus decrease the risks of as to the aqueous environment when assessing a reality water environment effects from arsenopyrite weathering special attention should be paid to temperature differences caused by different latitudes longitudes and seasonal changes in addition to the ha concentration and ph 5 conclusions the weathering behavior of arsenopyrite in solutions of ha was studied using electrochemical and surface analysis techniques the presence of ha significantly affected the oxidation of arsenopyrite and the conversion of fe and as species 1 ha combined with iron and arsenic oxidation products to form as fe ha and as ha complexes via ligand exchange mechanisms and consequently suppressed the generation of passivation iron arsenate the mineral adsorbed ha enriched the attack of fe3 on the surface which noticeably enhanced arsenopyrite oxidation 2 electrochemical tests showed that higher ha concentration temperature or acidity can facilitate the weathering of arsenopyrite across the duration of the experiment 3 polarization curve tests indicated that temperature and ph of the environment had a considerable impact on the arsenopyrite oxidation rate there were both positive and negative linear relationships with the corrosion current density namely i corr 3691 2 t 13 942 and i corr 0 2445ph 2 2125 4 the activation energy of arsenopyrite oxidation in ph 3 0 and 100 mg l 1 ha solution was 24 1 kj mol 1 and the rate of as iii released in the ha solution under various conditions were between 1 16 10 8 and 4 10 10 8 mol m 2 s 1 these experiments provided a demonstration of a rapid and quantitative calculation for arsenic pollution using electrochemical techniques in containing arsenopyrite around mining sites they also showed the significance in assessing the risks of arsenopyrite in the presence of ha to the surrounding area declaration of competing interest the authors declare that

17129,understanding of microplastics transport mechanism is highly important for soil contamination and remediation the transport behaviors of microplastics in soils are complex and influenced by various factors including soil and particle properties hydrodynamic conditions and biota activities via a microfluidic experiments we study liquid film entrainment and microplastics transport and retention during two phase displacement in microchannels with one end connected to the air and the other connected to the liquid with suspended particles we discover three transport patterns of microplastic particles ranging from no deposition to particle entrapment and to particle layering within liquid films depending on the suspension withdrawal rates and the particle volume fraction in the suspension the general behavior of particle motion is effectively captured by the film thickness evolution which is shown to be dependent on a modified capillary number ca0 taking into account the effects of flow velocity particle volume fraction and channel shape we also provide a theoretical prediction of the critical capillary number ca0 for particle entrapment consistent with the experimental results in addition the probability of microplastics being dragged into the trailing liquid film near the gas invading front is found to be proportional to both particle volume fraction and the capillary number this work elucidates the microplastics transport mechanism during unsaturated flow and therefore is of theoretical and practical importance to understand the contaminant migration in many natural and engineered systems spanning from groundwater sources to water treatment facilities graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords microplastics retention unsaturated flow film entrainment suspension 1 introduction omnipresent as pollutants and pollutant carriers microplastics have been extensively detected not only in the terrestrial system but also in the freshwater system globally eerkes medrano et al 2015 ding et al 2019 koelmans et al 2019 rochman 2018 groundwater and soil contamination by microplastics has drawn serious concern recently because of their potential impact on environment and human health koelmans et al 2017 rochman 2018 mintenig et al 2019 for example previous studies have shown that microplastic pollution can change the physical properties of soil and subsequently affect the soil biodiversity de souza machado et al 2018 commonly involved in these contamination scenarios is the fundamental process of microplastic particles transport in the pores and retention on the grain walls a mechanistic understanding of the transport and retention mechanisms of these contaminants in the pore space under various flow conditions is a prerequisite for accurate prediction of the fate of microplastics and assessment of the contaminant risks a detailed picture of the particle transport behaviors in fluid flows is also of paramount importance for many industrial processes and environmental restoration including froth filtration and water purification dai et al 1999 edzwald 2010 zlokarnik 1998 and soil erosion and karstification goeppert and goldscheider 2019 considerable efforts have been devoted to investigation of flow driven particle migration by means of laboratory and field experiments as well as theoretical analysis parameters that have been found to affect the fate of particles include particle size goeppert and goldscheider 2019 flow velocity and solution ionic strength kim et al 2010 addition of biochar tong et al 2020 pore structure lehoux et al 2017 and surface roughness li et al 2020b these findings allow new insights into the transport and retention behavior of pollutant particles in natural soil systems the above parameters are in turn influenced by additional complexities including macropores or preferential flowpaths induced by biota rillig et al 2017a huerta lwanga et al 2017 guo et al 2020 bioturbation rillig et al 2017b yu et al 2019 weathering liu et al 2019 2020 and dry wet cycles majdalani et al 2008 j li et al 2020 furthermore microorganism induced changes of particle properties and flow conditions may also have an important impact on the fate of microplastics however the coupled effects of all these factors remain unclear which hinders a full understanding of microplastics transport and retention behaviors in the complex soil system hence there is still a need to corroborate the most essential and fundamental mechanisms in the coupling previous studies e g wan and tokunaga 1997 bradford et al 2002 zhuang et al 2005 have revealed that attachment at solid liquid interface film straining air water interfacial capture and pore exclusion are the dominant mechanisms for colloid transport similarly to reach groundwater the microplastics often have to be transported by infiltrating water through the unsaturated or vadose zone where the air liquid two phase flow occurs in the void space of pores or fractures xue et al 2020 yang et al 2019 up to now only a few studies about microplastic particles transport under unsaturated conditions have been reported bradford and torkzaban 2008 zhuang et al 2007 qi et al 2020 in the vadose zone the water can be displaced by air resulting in a liquid film adhering to the solid surface which triggers a discussion about the effects of liquid film entrainment on the fate of microplastic particles suspended in the water on the other hand the presence of particles also affects the effective properties of the liquid a typical example is the dramatic influence of particles on the detachment of droplets where the particles can evidently accelerate the droplet detachment bonnoit et al 2012 miskin and jaeger 2012 in the process of water being displaced by air the particles suspended in the liquid can aggregate at the interface due to shear induced migration hooshanginejad et al 2019 which can change the stability of the interface and can in the limit of high particle concentration cause the displacement to exhibit unique flow patterns such as granular fingers cheng et al 2008 labyrinth structures sandnes et al 2007 stick slip bubbles sandnes et al 2011 capillary fracturing meng et al 2020 and clogging in confined flows dressaire and sauret 2017 therefore the mechanisms of the coupling between film entrainment and microplastic particles transport and retention under different flow conditions need to be elucidated in this work we experimentally study the fundamental processes of film entrainment and microplastic particles migration and retention during gas invasion in a suspension filled microchannel using microfluidic experiments we first characterize the gas suspension displacement behavior and microplastics deposition patterns under various particle concentrations flow velocity and channel geometry subsequently through theoretical analysis we elucidate the mechanism of the coupling between film entrainment and microplastics retention and predict the critical conditions for microplastics retention under different conditions we further discuss the role of flow velocity and particle concentration in the evolution of microplastics detainment probability by tracking the particles near the interface 2 materials and methods 2 1 microchannels and suspension we conduct experiments of displacement of liquid with suspended microplastic particles by air in rectangular microchannels fabricated using the polydimethylsiloxane pdms soft lithography technique all the microchannels used in the experiments have a width w of 400 μm and a height h of either 50 μm or 100 μm and they have a length l 1 cm with one end connected to a syringe pump and the other end exposed to air fig 1 a the suspension is prepared by immersing monodisperse polyethylene particles cospheric llc in silicone oil with density ρf 0 980 g cm3 dynamic viscosity η 0 50 mpa s and interfacial tension γ 20 mn m with respect to air at 20 c the particles are spherical with an average diameter d 35 μm 32 µm d 38 µm the density of the particles is ρ p 0 98 g cm3 or 1 00 g cm3 the former is a density matched case and the latter a slightly mismatched case we use silicone oil as a proxy of groundwater in our experiments in order to make the particles more easily and uniformly dispersed in the liquid which can effectively avoid the impact of particle agglomeration similar to groundwater silicone oil is the wetting phase to the solid walls so our experimental results are generally applicable to the scenario of microplastics transport in the unsaturated zone when there is a density mismatch the stokes settling velocity of microplastic particles in a quiescent fluid can be calculated as v ρ p ρf gd 2f ϕ 18η 0 where f ϕ 1 ϕ 4 4 is the hindrance function capturing the effects of many particle sedimentation xu and lee 2019 and ϕ denotes the particle volume fraction given the experimental parameters and the range of 5 ϕ 20 the settling velocity is estimated to range between 0 1 μm s to 0 21 μm s when ρ p 1 00 g cm3 on the other hand particle migration in a confined channel is also affected by shear gradient induced lift forces in the opposite direction of the gravity force for poiseuille flow the lift force is proportional to the square of the velocity fl u 2 amini et al 2014 di carlo et al 2009 2007 segre and silberg 1961 at high velocities 1000 μm s the lift force starts to balance the gravity force given the short time scale from 1 s to about 1 min considered in this study and the focus on the particle deposition on the side walls not the top and bottom walls the effect of particle settlement is expected to be insignificant 2 2 visualization and quantification the experimental setup is sketched in fig 1a in each experiment the microchannel is placed horizontally on the stage of an inverted optical microscope carl zeiss axio vert a1 and the gas suspension displacement process is imaged from the bottom with frame rates 10 fps the resolution of the microscope is 0 66 μm pixel and the field of view 1600 μm by 500 μm is located at the center of the channel we first fill the microchannel with particle suspension and then withdraw it at a constant flow rate q so that air invades the channel and displaces the suspension at atmospheric pressure a mean velocity of the displacement u is determined by analyzing images of the advancing air liquid interface tip recorded with the microscope as the air liquid interface advances the particles slightly accumulate at the front of the interface as illustrated in fig 1b once the interface enters the field of view we set the region of interest roi as the area in the suspension phase within a distance of 3d from the advancing meniscus fig 1b the quantification and analysis of the suspension properties will be based on this region unless stated otherwise in the following we denote the volume fraction of particles in suspension by ϕ defined as the ratio of the volume of particles vp to the total volume of suspension v in the roi the volume fraction of particles in our experiments varies between 0 and 20 unless otherwise specified ϕ is the particle volume fraction of the roi for each ϕ five experiments are carried out at different withdrawal rates resulting in meniscus advancing speeds between 0 05 mm s and 5 mm s corresponding to a capillary number ca η 0 u γ between 1 3 10 4 and 1 3 10 2 the reynolds number defined as r e ρf ud h η 0 ranges between 8 7 10 5 and 1 6 10 2 where d h is the hydraulic diameter defining as 2wh w h the thickness h of the films attached to the side walls can be measured from images by using matlab fig s1 because of the entrainment of particles the film thickness around the particles can become non uniform in which case we measure the average thickness h along the channel wall within the field of view in addition three dimensional effects can render the film thickness non uniform in the channel section due to transversal liquid drainage toward the low pressure corners khodaparast et al 2018 in the following we refer to h as the minimum of the thickness on the cross section i e the thickness of the liquid film between the gas and the center of the wall fig 1b to validate the reliability of the data we repeat each experiment at least three times 3 results and discussion 3 1 microplastics transport behaviors one key challenge in assessing the migration of particulate pollutants in groundwater relates to the variability of particle properties and flow conditions in order to study the control of the particle volume fraction ϕ and withdrawal rate u on the microplastics displacement and deposition regimes we carry out experiments in the rectangular channels with aspect ratios of 8 and 4 α w h to characterize the observed deposition morphologies we present an experimental phase diagram in the ϕ u space fig 2 the corresponding experimental images after gas breakthrough in the field of view can be found in the supporting information fig s2 the emergent patterns can be visually classified into three regimes i no deposition regime ii particle entrapment regime and iii particle layering regime as illustrated in fig 2 when ϕ 0 no particles are present only film flow can be examined see quantitative analysis in the next section at low displacement velocities see e g top row in fig 2 air fills almost the entire cross section of the microchannel except in the corners of the rectangular channel which effectively prevents particles from being entrained in the liquid film regime i as u increases generally to 1 0 mm s individual particles become entrapped behind the main meniscus and isolated from the suspension regime ii which is a manifestation of the increased resistance exerted on the particles as compared with the drag and the interface deformation induced capillary force colosqui et al 2013 sauret et al 2019 causing a velocity difference between the particles and the meniscus when ϕ is large 20 the particle entrapment regime emerges at a smaller u 0 5 mm s a general feature of this regime is that the liquid surrounding the trapped particles is not in good connection with the suspension because the gas phase extends to sidewalls at various locations away from the trapped particles however it should be noticed that the liquid can still be in hydraulic communication with the suspension phase through the corners fig 1b even though no continuous film forms in the longitudinal direction when u is large 5 0 mm s for ϕ below 10 or 3 0 mm s for ϕ above 15 a continuous suspension film is observed and this regime is referred to as the particle layering regime iii it is evident that the number of deposited particles increases with ϕ in regime iii 3 2 relationship between film entrainment and microplastics retention theory of the film entrainment during gas invasion in a microchannel initially filled with a viscous fluid was first proposed in 1961 by taylor 1961 and bretherton 1961 since then a significant amount of experimental and theoretical work has been devoted to study the thickness of liquid film han et al 2015 kreutzer et al 2005 inertial effects yao et al 2013 the influence of channel geometry de lózar et al 2008 al housseiny et al 2012 shapes and dynamics of bubble ajaev and homsy 2006 dewetting of thin liquid films khodaparast et al 2018 and flow patterns triplett et al 1999 yue et al 2008 2007 during gas liquid displacement based on the thin film theory bretherton 1961 showed that the film thickness h depends on the capillary number ca and the channel size as 1 h r 1 34 c a 2 3 bretherton 1961 did not consider the presence of particles but this theory offers a good starting point for our analysis of film thickness in this work we take r as the half width of the channel i e r 200 μm the film thickness h is measured through image analysis note that due to image resolution limit on the order of 1 μm liquid films of thickness below this scale cannot be detected and thus are neglected i e h 0 it is shown in fig 3 that h is influenced not only by the capillary number ca but also by the particle volume fraction ϕ for a given ϕ the film formation is suppressed h 0 at small ca and no particles are entrained or trapped increasing the capillary number to some critical value leads to emergence of entrainment of liquid and particles beyond this critical ca h increases with ca fig 3a the experimental results show that the critical capillary number required for film entrainment is smaller when ϕ is larger in order to better understand the coupling between the film entrainment and microplastics retention we present the results of the film thickness h as a function of ϕ for different withdrawal rates fig 3b as shown in fig 3b three trends are evident regarding the relationship between h and ϕ at low ca log10ca 3 9 film entrainment is not affected by the particle volume fraction h 0 correspondingly since the film thickness is small enough the trapping of particles in the liquid film is effectively prevented at intermediate ca e g log10ca 2 3 h is sensitive to variation of ϕ since the particle velocity adopts a parabolic profile in the channel that is the particle velocity on both sides of the channel is lower than the interface tip velocity the particles aggregation near the interface is more significant with the increase of particle volume fraction the enhanced interparticle interactions due to the accumulation of particles near the interface result in more particles being entrained and the film thickness therefore increases on the other hand with the increase of film thickness the deformation of the gas liquid interface caused by the particle entrainment from the bulk flow into the liquid film decreases that is to say the particles can be trapped in the liquid film by overcoming a smaller capillary force which further increases the probability of microplastics retention gao et al 2008 wan and tokunaga 1997 this finding is crucial for groundwater remediation since the deposited particulate pollutants can act as a long term source of secondary contamination and may impact groundwater quality for decades pak et al 2020 at high ca log10ca 1 9 the thickness h becomes to some extent independent of ϕ indicating that the role played by suspended microplastic particles becomes overshadowed in the film entrainment during the displacement at large flow rates 3 3 modified capillary number as shown in the previous sections both the capillary number and particle volume fraction influence the gas invasion process in a microchannel filled with particle suspension it is therefore of interest to find a new dimensionless number unifying the two controlling parameters the increase of particle volume fraction in suspension results in enhanced hydrodynamic interaction between the particles and the liquid which in turn increases the viscosity of the suspension de bruyn 2011 by replacing the fluid viscosity in the capillary number definition with an expression of effective viscosity of the suspension as a function of ϕ we introduce an effective capillary number ca ϕ based on the particle volume fraction in the roi following zarraga et al 2000 the viscosity of a suspension of non brownian and neutrally buoyant particles is calculated as 2 η ϕ η 0 exp 2 34 ϕ 1 ϕ ϕ m 3 where η 0 is the viscosity of the interstitial fluid and ϕ m 0 62 denotes the maximum particle volume fraction in a suspension note that other rheological models have also been proposed to calculate the viscosity of the suspension boyer et al 2011 guazzelli and pouliquen 2018 krieger and dougherty 1959 stickel and powell 2005 within our particle volume fraction range 0 ϕ 20 the effective viscosities calculated by different models are generally consistent with only small differences fig s3 s4 the effective capillary number is thus defined as 3 c a ϕ η 0 u exp 2 34 ϕ γ 1 ϕ ϕ m 3 the corners of microchannel can have a significant effect on the dynamics of displacement khodaparast et al 2018 2017 de lózar et al 2007 have shown that for rectangular channels the capillary number can be modified as 1 0 12 α 1 0 018 α 1 2 ca to take into account the effect of channel shape where α w h is the aspect ratio of a rectangular channel with w and h being the width and height respectively this relation is adopted in this study to account for the effect of the high aspect ratio finally we have a modified capillary number ca0 as 4 c a 0 1 0 12 α 1 0 018 α 1 2 c a ϕ in fig 4 we plot the experimental results of h for different withdrawal rates particle volume fractions and channel aspect ratios against the modified capillary number the experimental results of suspensions with different particle densities are also compared the settling of particles caused by the density mismatch between particles and liquid has no effect on our experimental results fig s5 and there is no obvious difference in the behavior between the two types of particles used in the experiment the data points for all cases nicely collapse to the bretherton relationship with the modified capillary number suggesting that the modified capillary number is a valid description of the control of flow rate and particle volume fraction on film and microplastics entrainment in addition the prediction by the modified bretherton theory with the new capillary number h 1 34rca0 2 3 is compared to the data as shown in fig 4 the film is not detected in the experiments i e the thickness 0 when ca0 ca0 corresponding to no deposition regime in addition the theoretical prediction of film thickness is in good agreement with the experiments at large flow rates high ca0 which corresponds to the particle layering regime at intermediate capillary numbers there is a transition phase namely particle entrapment regime however it is evident that the critical behavior in h is not described by the modified bretherton theory 3 4 critical capillary number for microplastics entrapment avoiding particle attachment on solid surfaces is desired for a variety of industrial processes and environmental remediation for example the filtration capacities of membrane and deep beds decrease with increasing particle attachment on these surfaces t li et al 2020 likewise the use of nanomaterials for in situ soil remediation is very limited since they are readily attached to soil surfaces song et al 2019 previous work wan and tokunaga 1997 suggests that particles may be captured in the thin film due to the film straining when the film thickness is less than the particle diameter deformation of the air liquid interface induces an additional capillary force on the particles which can be decomposed into a lateral component that tends to push the particles toward the bulk liquid and a vertical capillary force that pins the particles on the wall of the channels gao et al 2008 the particle entrapment can only be observed when the total resistance fr acting on the particles approaches the sum of the lateral capillary force and hydrodynamic drag force fd in the opposite direction colosqui et al 2013 veerapaneni et al 2000 fig 1c as shown in fig 4 there appears to be a critical capillary number for the emergence of the particle entrapment a previous analysis colosqui et al 2013 suggests that the critical condition for a particle to enter the film is equivalent to h d where h is the meniscus thickness at the stagnation point s in fig 1b the stagnation point is the position where the speed of the interface vanishes and the flow streamline ending at this point defines the boundary between the shear flow region and recirculation flow region colosqui et al 2013 gans et al 2019 however to the best of our knowledge theoretical study of the meniscus thickness at the stagnation point of plug flows in microchannels has not been reported in the literature a recent experimental study yu et al 2018 of particle filtering by a bubble in circular channels with parameter range 0 55 d h 2 2 0 005 ca 0 05 showed that when d h 1 it is possible for the particles to enter the film by deforming the interface however the critical particle size relative to the film thickness was not investigated previous studies of coating flows have shown that h is related to the film thickness away from the meniscus and satisfies the relation of h 3 h gans et al 2019 krechetnikov 2010 interestingly substituting the critical condition d h 3 h in the modified bretherton equation we obtain a critical modified capillary number as c a 0 d 4 02 r 3 2 9 1 10 3 which seems to be in the good agreement with the critical transition at modified capillary number about 8 0 10 3 in the experimental results see fig 4 this agreement suggests that the relation of h 3 h might also be applicable to square microchannels similar to those in this study the results also indicate that the particle retention largely depends on the confinement ratio r d of particles in the channel for a smaller particles the critical ca0 for retention is smaller meaning that a lower flow velocity is required for the particles to enter the water films additionally the pore channel geometry and particle shape are also important factors affecting particle transport the particle shape is particularly interesting since nonspherical particles are more likely to become entangled in the matrix than spherical ones rillig et al 2017a our results also show that with the capillary number ca0 further increases a continuous liquid film with particle layers emerges see fig 4 however a theoretical description of this transition merits future study 3 5 probability of microplastics detainment to better understand the microscopic mechanism of microplastics being dragged into the trailing liquid film we further study the probability p of microplastics detained behind the main meniscus as either particle film layers or entrapped particles p the number of particles detained nd divided by the total number of particles in the roi nt by tracking the particles using imagej in the channel with a width of 400 μm and a height of 50 μm fig s6 shown in fig 5 is the particle detainment probability p as a function of volume fraction ϕ for different withdrawal rates the results show that p is equal to zero in the limit of low ca 1 3 10 4 for ϕ in the range of 0 20 the probability increases with the particle volume fraction if the capillary number exceeds a critical value this can be attributed to the increase of resistance fr caused by interactions between particles and between the particles and the liquid de bruyn 2011 additionally it can be observed that in general p increases with the withdrawal rate at high ca and large ϕ p approaches 100 which means that all microplastics in the roi will eventually be detained and separated from the suspension phase the results of microplastics detainment probability are consistent with the film thickness results to explain the influence of the capillary number on particle motion we measure the velocity up of individual particles near the invading front by particle tracking fig 6 shows the velocity distribution of the particles in a transverse cross section of the microchannel with a width of 400 μm and a height of 50 μm at low u the particle velocity distribution is essentially uniform across the channel width and highly consistent with the interfacial tip velocity fig 6a this indicates that the air the fluid and the particles all move at a coordinated speed at low capillary number as shown in the movies note that the red dashed line in the fig 6 is only used to contrast the velocity profile of the particles with the average velocity of the interface tip and does not represent the velocity profile of the gas liquid interface in the cross section of the microchannel at high u the particle velocities exhibit a parabolic profile i e the particle velocity is largest at the center of the channel and gradually decreases toward the side walls fig 6c d in addition the particle velocities are considerably lower than the meniscus velocity which leads to particles near the interface being squeezed to the side walls of the channel due to the meniscus shape increasing u on the one hand leads to enlarged velocity difference between the particles and the interface u u p which indicates that a greater force is required to keep particles moving forward with the interface on the other hand the film thickness increases with the flow rate which directly causes the film straining to decrease when the particles enter the liquid film both effects make particles more likely to be entrained in the liquid film however the interface has a negligible blocking effect on particle entrainment since the film straining becomes invalid when the film thickness is greater than the particle diameter wan and tokunaga 1997 in this case the probability of particles trailing behind the meniscus is greatly increased in this work a relatively simple system is used to obtain a fundamental understanding of the transport mechanism of microplastics under two phase flow conditions it is straightforward for future work to build on this understanding to consider additional complexities in this sense our results can as a benchmark be compared with results from further studies of microplastics migration in complex systems for example weathering and dissolved organic matter can affect the hydrophobicity of microplastics by generating rough surface and oxygen functional groups playing an important role in microplastics transport liu et al 2020 this issue can be explored by changing the wettability and particle roughness with minor modifications to our experimental setup in addition the biota can also greatly affect the transport of microplastics e g by altering flow geometries and hydrodynamics creating burrows as preferential pathways rillig et al 2017b in our microfluidic experiments we can customize the pore shape and geometries to systematically study the impact of these factors 4 conclusions in this work we have performed a series of microfluidic experiments and elucidated the mechanisms of transport and retention of microplastic particles in microchannels under unsaturated conditions the main conclusions can be summarized as follows three regimes of microplastics transport are characterized which are affected by flow velocity and particle volume fraction in the suspension the general behavior of microplastics motion is effectively captured by the film thickness evolution which is shown to be dependent on a modified capillary number that takes into account the influences of the flow velocity and the particle volume fraction as well as the aspect ratio of channel the synergistic effect of film entrainment and particle volume fraction on microplastic particle retention is revealed as the film thickness increases the particles can be trapped into the liquid film by overcoming a smaller capillary force resulting in an increase of the probability of particle retention in addition the increase in the number of retained particles in turn promotes film entrainment a theoretical prediction of the critical capillary number for microplastics capture and entrapment based on lubrication theory and force balance analysis is consistent with the experimental results the probability of microplastics retention increases both with particle volume fraction and with the capillary number this work can contribute to understanding the particulate contaminant fate in the subsurface our results suggest that microsplastic particles are more likely to deposit on pore walls at high flow rates than at low flow rate in other words the flow rate can be controlled to improve the detachment efficiency of particles our work is also of direct relevance to the problem of clogging under the unsaturated condition at a sufficiently high flow rate the suspended particles can deposit successively on pore walls leading to shrinkage of the pore space and even clogging this research focuses solely on transport of pristine plastic particles while the future focus should be on more environmentally relevant plastic with complexities stemming from irregular shapes a disperse size range and temporal changes of the properties of microplastics under continuous environmental

17129,understanding of microplastics transport mechanism is highly important for soil contamination and remediation the transport behaviors of microplastics in soils are complex and influenced by various factors including soil and particle properties hydrodynamic conditions and biota activities via a microfluidic experiments we study liquid film entrainment and microplastics transport and retention during two phase displacement in microchannels with one end connected to the air and the other connected to the liquid with suspended particles we discover three transport patterns of microplastic particles ranging from no deposition to particle entrapment and to particle layering within liquid films depending on the suspension withdrawal rates and the particle volume fraction in the suspension the general behavior of particle motion is effectively captured by the film thickness evolution which is shown to be dependent on a modified capillary number ca0 taking into account the effects of flow velocity particle volume fraction and channel shape we also provide a theoretical prediction of the critical capillary number ca0 for particle entrapment consistent with the experimental results in addition the probability of microplastics being dragged into the trailing liquid film near the gas invading front is found to be proportional to both particle volume fraction and the capillary number this work elucidates the microplastics transport mechanism during unsaturated flow and therefore is of theoretical and practical importance to understand the contaminant migration in many natural and engineered systems spanning from groundwater sources to water treatment facilities graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords microplastics retention unsaturated flow film entrainment suspension 1 introduction omnipresent as pollutants and pollutant carriers microplastics have been extensively detected not only in the terrestrial system but also in the freshwater system globally eerkes medrano et al 2015 ding et al 2019 koelmans et al 2019 rochman 2018 groundwater and soil contamination by microplastics has drawn serious concern recently because of their potential impact on environment and human health koelmans et al 2017 rochman 2018 mintenig et al 2019 for example previous studies have shown that microplastic pollution can change the physical properties of soil and subsequently affect the soil biodiversity de souza machado et al 2018 commonly involved in these contamination scenarios is the fundamental process of microplastic particles transport in the pores and retention on the grain walls a mechanistic understanding of the transport and retention mechanisms of these contaminants in the pore space under various flow conditions is a prerequisite for accurate prediction of the fate of microplastics and assessment of the contaminant risks a detailed picture of the particle transport behaviors in fluid flows is also of paramount importance for many industrial processes and environmental restoration including froth filtration and water purification dai et al 1999 edzwald 2010 zlokarnik 1998 and soil erosion and karstification goeppert and goldscheider 2019 considerable efforts have been devoted to investigation of flow driven particle migration by means of laboratory and field experiments as well as theoretical analysis parameters that have been found to affect the fate of particles include particle size goeppert and goldscheider 2019 flow velocity and solution ionic strength kim et al 2010 addition of biochar tong et al 2020 pore structure lehoux et al 2017 and surface roughness li et al 2020b these findings allow new insights into the transport and retention behavior of pollutant particles in natural soil systems the above parameters are in turn influenced by additional complexities including macropores or preferential flowpaths induced by biota rillig et al 2017a huerta lwanga et al 2017 guo et al 2020 bioturbation rillig et al 2017b yu et al 2019 weathering liu et al 2019 2020 and dry wet cycles majdalani et al 2008 j li et al 2020 furthermore microorganism induced changes of particle properties and flow conditions may also have an important impact on the fate of microplastics however the coupled effects of all these factors remain unclear which hinders a full understanding of microplastics transport and retention behaviors in the complex soil system hence there is still a need to corroborate the most essential and fundamental mechanisms in the coupling previous studies e g wan and tokunaga 1997 bradford et al 2002 zhuang et al 2005 have revealed that attachment at solid liquid interface film straining air water interfacial capture and pore exclusion are the dominant mechanisms for colloid transport similarly to reach groundwater the microplastics often have to be transported by infiltrating water through the unsaturated or vadose zone where the air liquid two phase flow occurs in the void space of pores or fractures xue et al 2020 yang et al 2019 up to now only a few studies about microplastic particles transport under unsaturated conditions have been reported bradford and torkzaban 2008 zhuang et al 2007 qi et al 2020 in the vadose zone the water can be displaced by air resulting in a liquid film adhering to the solid surface which triggers a discussion about the effects of liquid film entrainment on the fate of microplastic particles suspended in the water on the other hand the presence of particles also affects the effective properties of the liquid a typical example is the dramatic influence of particles on the detachment of droplets where the particles can evidently accelerate the droplet detachment bonnoit et al 2012 miskin and jaeger 2012 in the process of water being displaced by air the particles suspended in the liquid can aggregate at the interface due to shear induced migration hooshanginejad et al 2019 which can change the stability of the interface and can in the limit of high particle concentration cause the displacement to exhibit unique flow patterns such as granular fingers cheng et al 2008 labyrinth structures sandnes et al 2007 stick slip bubbles sandnes et al 2011 capillary fracturing meng et al 2020 and clogging in confined flows dressaire and sauret 2017 therefore the mechanisms of the coupling between film entrainment and microplastic particles transport and retention under different flow conditions need to be elucidated in this work we experimentally study the fundamental processes of film entrainment and microplastic particles migration and retention during gas invasion in a suspension filled microchannel using microfluidic experiments we first characterize the gas suspension displacement behavior and microplastics deposition patterns under various particle concentrations flow velocity and channel geometry subsequently through theoretical analysis we elucidate the mechanism of the coupling between film entrainment and microplastics retention and predict the critical conditions for microplastics retention under different conditions we further discuss the role of flow velocity and particle concentration in the evolution of microplastics detainment probability by tracking the particles near the interface 2 materials and methods 2 1 microchannels and suspension we conduct experiments of displacement of liquid with suspended microplastic particles by air in rectangular microchannels fabricated using the polydimethylsiloxane pdms soft lithography technique all the microchannels used in the experiments have a width w of 400 μm and a height h of either 50 μm or 100 μm and they have a length l 1 cm with one end connected to a syringe pump and the other end exposed to air fig 1 a the suspension is prepared by immersing monodisperse polyethylene particles cospheric llc in silicone oil with density ρf 0 980 g cm3 dynamic viscosity η 0 50 mpa s and interfacial tension γ 20 mn m with respect to air at 20 c the particles are spherical with an average diameter d 35 μm 32 µm d 38 µm the density of the particles is ρ p 0 98 g cm3 or 1 00 g cm3 the former is a density matched case and the latter a slightly mismatched case we use silicone oil as a proxy of groundwater in our experiments in order to make the particles more easily and uniformly dispersed in the liquid which can effectively avoid the impact of particle agglomeration similar to groundwater silicone oil is the wetting phase to the solid walls so our experimental results are generally applicable to the scenario of microplastics transport in the unsaturated zone when there is a density mismatch the stokes settling velocity of microplastic particles in a quiescent fluid can be calculated as v ρ p ρf gd 2f ϕ 18η 0 where f ϕ 1 ϕ 4 4 is the hindrance function capturing the effects of many particle sedimentation xu and lee 2019 and ϕ denotes the particle volume fraction given the experimental parameters and the range of 5 ϕ 20 the settling velocity is estimated to range between 0 1 μm s to 0 21 μm s when ρ p 1 00 g cm3 on the other hand particle migration in a confined channel is also affected by shear gradient induced lift forces in the opposite direction of the gravity force for poiseuille flow the lift force is proportional to the square of the velocity fl u 2 amini et al 2014 di carlo et al 2009 2007 segre and silberg 1961 at high velocities 1000 μm s the lift force starts to balance the gravity force given the short time scale from 1 s to about 1 min considered in this study and the focus on the particle deposition on the side walls not the top and bottom walls the effect of particle settlement is expected to be insignificant 2 2 visualization and quantification the experimental setup is sketched in fig 1a in each experiment the microchannel is placed horizontally on the stage of an inverted optical microscope carl zeiss axio vert a1 and the gas suspension displacement process is imaged from the bottom with frame rates 10 fps the resolution of the microscope is 0 66 μm pixel and the field of view 1600 μm by 500 μm is located at the center of the channel we first fill the microchannel with particle suspension and then withdraw it at a constant flow rate q so that air invades the channel and displaces the suspension at atmospheric pressure a mean velocity of the displacement u is determined by analyzing images of the advancing air liquid interface tip recorded with the microscope as the air liquid interface advances the particles slightly accumulate at the front of the interface as illustrated in fig 1b once the interface enters the field of view we set the region of interest roi as the area in the suspension phase within a distance of 3d from the advancing meniscus fig 1b the quantification and analysis of the suspension properties will be based on this region unless stated otherwise in the following we denote the volume fraction of particles in suspension by ϕ defined as the ratio of the volume of particles vp to the total volume of suspension v in the roi the volume fraction of particles in our experiments varies between 0 and 20 unless otherwise specified ϕ is the particle volume fraction of the roi for each ϕ five experiments are carried out at different withdrawal rates resulting in meniscus advancing speeds between 0 05 mm s and 5 mm s corresponding to a capillary number ca η 0 u γ between 1 3 10 4 and 1 3 10 2 the reynolds number defined as r e ρf ud h η 0 ranges between 8 7 10 5 and 1 6 10 2 where d h is the hydraulic diameter defining as 2wh w h the thickness h of the films attached to the side walls can be measured from images by using matlab fig s1 because of the entrainment of particles the film thickness around the particles can become non uniform in which case we measure the average thickness h along the channel wall within the field of view in addition three dimensional effects can render the film thickness non uniform in the channel section due to transversal liquid drainage toward the low pressure corners khodaparast et al 2018 in the following we refer to h as the minimum of the thickness on the cross section i e the thickness of the liquid film between the gas and the center of the wall fig 1b to validate the reliability of the data we repeat each experiment at least three times 3 results and discussion 3 1 microplastics transport behaviors one key challenge in assessing the migration of particulate pollutants in groundwater relates to the variability of particle properties and flow conditions in order to study the control of the particle volume fraction ϕ and withdrawal rate u on the microplastics displacement and deposition regimes we carry out experiments in the rectangular channels with aspect ratios of 8 and 4 α w h to characterize the observed deposition morphologies we present an experimental phase diagram in the ϕ u space fig 2 the corresponding experimental images after gas breakthrough in the field of view can be found in the supporting information fig s2 the emergent patterns can be visually classified into three regimes i no deposition regime ii particle entrapment regime and iii particle layering regime as illustrated in fig 2 when ϕ 0 no particles are present only film flow can be examined see quantitative analysis in the next section at low displacement velocities see e g top row in fig 2 air fills almost the entire cross section of the microchannel except in the corners of the rectangular channel which effectively prevents particles from being entrained in the liquid film regime i as u increases generally to 1 0 mm s individual particles become entrapped behind the main meniscus and isolated from the suspension regime ii which is a manifestation of the increased resistance exerted on the particles as compared with the drag and the interface deformation induced capillary force colosqui et al 2013 sauret et al 2019 causing a velocity difference between the particles and the meniscus when ϕ is large 20 the particle entrapment regime emerges at a smaller u 0 5 mm s a general feature of this regime is that the liquid surrounding the trapped particles is not in good connection with the suspension because the gas phase extends to sidewalls at various locations away from the trapped particles however it should be noticed that the liquid can still be in hydraulic communication with the suspension phase through the corners fig 1b even though no continuous film forms in the longitudinal direction when u is large 5 0 mm s for ϕ below 10 or 3 0 mm s for ϕ above 15 a continuous suspension film is observed and this regime is referred to as the particle layering regime iii it is evident that the number of deposited particles increases with ϕ in regime iii 3 2 relationship between film entrainment and microplastics retention theory of the film entrainment during gas invasion in a microchannel initially filled with a viscous fluid was first proposed in 1961 by taylor 1961 and bretherton 1961 since then a significant amount of experimental and theoretical work has been devoted to study the thickness of liquid film han et al 2015 kreutzer et al 2005 inertial effects yao et al 2013 the influence of channel geometry de lózar et al 2008 al housseiny et al 2012 shapes and dynamics of bubble ajaev and homsy 2006 dewetting of thin liquid films khodaparast et al 2018 and flow patterns triplett et al 1999 yue et al 2008 2007 during gas liquid displacement based on the thin film theory bretherton 1961 showed that the film thickness h depends on the capillary number ca and the channel size as 1 h r 1 34 c a 2 3 bretherton 1961 did not consider the presence of particles but this theory offers a good starting point for our analysis of film thickness in this work we take r as the half width of the channel i e r 200 μm the film thickness h is measured through image analysis note that due to image resolution limit on the order of 1 μm liquid films of thickness below this scale cannot be detected and thus are neglected i e h 0 it is shown in fig 3 that h is influenced not only by the capillary number ca but also by the particle volume fraction ϕ for a given ϕ the film formation is suppressed h 0 at small ca and no particles are entrained or trapped increasing the capillary number to some critical value leads to emergence of entrainment of liquid and particles beyond this critical ca h increases with ca fig 3a the experimental results show that the critical capillary number required for film entrainment is smaller when ϕ is larger in order to better understand the coupling between the film entrainment and microplastics retention we present the results of the film thickness h as a function of ϕ for different withdrawal rates fig 3b as shown in fig 3b three trends are evident regarding the relationship between h and ϕ at low ca log10ca 3 9 film entrainment is not affected by the particle volume fraction h 0 correspondingly since the film thickness is small enough the trapping of particles in the liquid film is effectively prevented at intermediate ca e g log10ca 2 3 h is sensitive to variation of ϕ since the particle velocity adopts a parabolic profile in the channel that is the particle velocity on both sides of the channel is lower than the interface tip velocity the particles aggregation near the interface is more significant with the increase of particle volume fraction the enhanced interparticle interactions due to the accumulation of particles near the interface result in more particles being entrained and the film thickness therefore increases on the other hand with the increase of film thickness the deformation of the gas liquid interface caused by the particle entrainment from the bulk flow into the liquid film decreases that is to say the particles can be trapped in the liquid film by overcoming a smaller capillary force which further increases the probability of microplastics retention gao et al 2008 wan and tokunaga 1997 this finding is crucial for groundwater remediation since the deposited particulate pollutants can act as a long term source of secondary contamination and may impact groundwater quality for decades pak et al 2020 at high ca log10ca 1 9 the thickness h becomes to some extent independent of ϕ indicating that the role played by suspended microplastic particles becomes overshadowed in the film entrainment during the displacement at large flow rates 3 3 modified capillary number as shown in the previous sections both the capillary number and particle volume fraction influence the gas invasion process in a microchannel filled with particle suspension it is therefore of interest to find a new dimensionless number unifying the two controlling parameters the increase of particle volume fraction in suspension results in enhanced hydrodynamic interaction between the particles and the liquid which in turn increases the viscosity of the suspension de bruyn 2011 by replacing the fluid viscosity in the capillary number definition with an expression of effective viscosity of the suspension as a function of ϕ we introduce an effective capillary number ca ϕ based on the particle volume fraction in the roi following zarraga et al 2000 the viscosity of a suspension of non brownian and neutrally buoyant particles is calculated as 2 η ϕ η 0 exp 2 34 ϕ 1 ϕ ϕ m 3 where η 0 is the viscosity of the interstitial fluid and ϕ m 0 62 denotes the maximum particle volume fraction in a suspension note that other rheological models have also been proposed to calculate the viscosity of the suspension boyer et al 2011 guazzelli and pouliquen 2018 krieger and dougherty 1959 stickel and powell 2005 within our particle volume fraction range 0 ϕ 20 the effective viscosities calculated by different models are generally consistent with only small differences fig s3 s4 the effective capillary number is thus defined as 3 c a ϕ η 0 u exp 2 34 ϕ γ 1 ϕ ϕ m 3 the corners of microchannel can have a significant effect on the dynamics of displacement khodaparast et al 2018 2017 de lózar et al 2007 have shown that for rectangular channels the capillary number can be modified as 1 0 12 α 1 0 018 α 1 2 ca to take into account the effect of channel shape where α w h is the aspect ratio of a rectangular channel with w and h being the width and height respectively this relation is adopted in this study to account for the effect of the high aspect ratio finally we have a modified capillary number ca0 as 4 c a 0 1 0 12 α 1 0 018 α 1 2 c a ϕ in fig 4 we plot the experimental results of h for different withdrawal rates particle volume fractions and channel aspect ratios against the modified capillary number the experimental results of suspensions with different particle densities are also compared the settling of particles caused by the density mismatch between particles and liquid has no effect on our experimental results fig s5 and there is no obvious difference in the behavior between the two types of particles used in the experiment the data points for all cases nicely collapse to the bretherton relationship with the modified capillary number suggesting that the modified capillary number is a valid description of the control of flow rate and particle volume fraction on film and microplastics entrainment in addition the prediction by the modified bretherton theory with the new capillary number h 1 34rca0 2 3 is compared to the data as shown in fig 4 the film is not detected in the experiments i e the thickness 0 when ca0 ca0 corresponding to no deposition regime in addition the theoretical prediction of film thickness is in good agreement with the experiments at large flow rates high ca0 which corresponds to the particle layering regime at intermediate capillary numbers there is a transition phase namely particle entrapment regime however it is evident that the critical behavior in h is not described by the modified bretherton theory 3 4 critical capillary number for microplastics entrapment avoiding particle attachment on solid surfaces is desired for a variety of industrial processes and environmental remediation for example the filtration capacities of membrane and deep beds decrease with increasing particle attachment on these surfaces t li et al 2020 likewise the use of nanomaterials for in situ soil remediation is very limited since they are readily attached to soil surfaces song et al 2019 previous work wan and tokunaga 1997 suggests that particles may be captured in the thin film due to the film straining when the film thickness is less than the particle diameter deformation of the air liquid interface induces an additional capillary force on the particles which can be decomposed into a lateral component that tends to push the particles toward the bulk liquid and a vertical capillary force that pins the particles on the wall of the channels gao et al 2008 the particle entrapment can only be observed when the total resistance fr acting on the particles approaches the sum of the lateral capillary force and hydrodynamic drag force fd in the opposite direction colosqui et al 2013 veerapaneni et al 2000 fig 1c as shown in fig 4 there appears to be a critical capillary number for the emergence of the particle entrapment a previous analysis colosqui et al 2013 suggests that the critical condition for a particle to enter the film is equivalent to h d where h is the meniscus thickness at the stagnation point s in fig 1b the stagnation point is the position where the speed of the interface vanishes and the flow streamline ending at this point defines the boundary between the shear flow region and recirculation flow region colosqui et al 2013 gans et al 2019 however to the best of our knowledge theoretical study of the meniscus thickness at the stagnation point of plug flows in microchannels has not been reported in the literature a recent experimental study yu et al 2018 of particle filtering by a bubble in circular channels with parameter range 0 55 d h 2 2 0 005 ca 0 05 showed that when d h 1 it is possible for the particles to enter the film by deforming the interface however the critical particle size relative to the film thickness was not investigated previous studies of coating flows have shown that h is related to the film thickness away from the meniscus and satisfies the relation of h 3 h gans et al 2019 krechetnikov 2010 interestingly substituting the critical condition d h 3 h in the modified bretherton equation we obtain a critical modified capillary number as c a 0 d 4 02 r 3 2 9 1 10 3 which seems to be in the good agreement with the critical transition at modified capillary number about 8 0 10 3 in the experimental results see fig 4 this agreement suggests that the relation of h 3 h might also be applicable to square microchannels similar to those in this study the results also indicate that the particle retention largely depends on the confinement ratio r d of particles in the channel for a smaller particles the critical ca0 for retention is smaller meaning that a lower flow velocity is required for the particles to enter the water films additionally the pore channel geometry and particle shape are also important factors affecting particle transport the particle shape is particularly interesting since nonspherical particles are more likely to become entangled in the matrix than spherical ones rillig et al 2017a our results also show that with the capillary number ca0 further increases a continuous liquid film with particle layers emerges see fig 4 however a theoretical description of this transition merits future study 3 5 probability of microplastics detainment to better understand the microscopic mechanism of microplastics being dragged into the trailing liquid film we further study the probability p of microplastics detained behind the main meniscus as either particle film layers or entrapped particles p the number of particles detained nd divided by the total number of particles in the roi nt by tracking the particles using imagej in the channel with a width of 400 μm and a height of 50 μm fig s6 shown in fig 5 is the particle detainment probability p as a function of volume fraction ϕ for different withdrawal rates the results show that p is equal to zero in the limit of low ca 1 3 10 4 for ϕ in the range of 0 20 the probability increases with the particle volume fraction if the capillary number exceeds a critical value this can be attributed to the increase of resistance fr caused by interactions between particles and between the particles and the liquid de bruyn 2011 additionally it can be observed that in general p increases with the withdrawal rate at high ca and large ϕ p approaches 100 which means that all microplastics in the roi will eventually be detained and separated from the suspension phase the results of microplastics detainment probability are consistent with the film thickness results to explain the influence of the capillary number on particle motion we measure the velocity up of individual particles near the invading front by particle tracking fig 6 shows the velocity distribution of the particles in a transverse cross section of the microchannel with a width of 400 μm and a height of 50 μm at low u the particle velocity distribution is essentially uniform across the channel width and highly consistent with the interfacial tip velocity fig 6a this indicates that the air the fluid and the particles all move at a coordinated speed at low capillary number as shown in the movies note that the red dashed line in the fig 6 is only used to contrast the velocity profile of the particles with the average velocity of the interface tip and does not represent the velocity profile of the gas liquid interface in the cross section of the microchannel at high u the particle velocities exhibit a parabolic profile i e the particle velocity is largest at the center of the channel and gradually decreases toward the side walls fig 6c d in addition the particle velocities are considerably lower than the meniscus velocity which leads to particles near the interface being squeezed to the side walls of the channel due to the meniscus shape increasing u on the one hand leads to enlarged velocity difference between the particles and the interface u u p which indicates that a greater force is required to keep particles moving forward with the interface on the other hand the film thickness increases with the flow rate which directly causes the film straining to decrease when the particles enter the liquid film both effects make particles more likely to be entrained in the liquid film however the interface has a negligible blocking effect on particle entrainment since the film straining becomes invalid when the film thickness is greater than the particle diameter wan and tokunaga 1997 in this case the probability of particles trailing behind the meniscus is greatly increased in this work a relatively simple system is used to obtain a fundamental understanding of the transport mechanism of microplastics under two phase flow conditions it is straightforward for future work to build on this understanding to consider additional complexities in this sense our results can as a benchmark be compared with results from further studies of microplastics migration in complex systems for example weathering and dissolved organic matter can affect the hydrophobicity of microplastics by generating rough surface and oxygen functional groups playing an important role in microplastics transport liu et al 2020 this issue can be explored by changing the wettability and particle roughness with minor modifications to our experimental setup in addition the biota can also greatly affect the transport of microplastics e g by altering flow geometries and hydrodynamics creating burrows as preferential pathways rillig et al 2017b in our microfluidic experiments we can customize the pore shape and geometries to systematically study the impact of these factors 4 conclusions in this work we have performed a series of microfluidic experiments and elucidated the mechanisms of transport and retention of microplastic particles in microchannels under unsaturated conditions the main conclusions can be summarized as follows three regimes of microplastics transport are characterized which are affected by flow velocity and particle volume fraction in the suspension the general behavior of microplastics motion is effectively captured by the film thickness evolution which is shown to be dependent on a modified capillary number that takes into account the influences of the flow velocity and the particle volume fraction as well as the aspect ratio of channel the synergistic effect of film entrainment and particle volume fraction on microplastic particle retention is revealed as the film thickness increases the particles can be trapped into the liquid film by overcoming a smaller capillary force resulting in an increase of the probability of particle retention in addition the increase in the number of retained particles in turn promotes film entrainment a theoretical prediction of the critical capillary number for microplastics capture and entrapment based on lubrication theory and force balance analysis is consistent with the experimental results the probability of microplastics retention increases both with particle volume fraction and with the capillary number this work can contribute to understanding the particulate contaminant fate in the subsurface our results suggest that microsplastic particles are more likely to deposit on pore walls at high flow rates than at low flow rate in other words the flow rate can be controlled to improve the detachment efficiency of particles our work is also of direct relevance to the problem of clogging under the unsaturated condition at a sufficiently high flow rate the suspended particles can deposit successively on pore walls leading to shrinkage of the pore space and even clogging this research focuses solely on transport of pristine plastic particles while the future focus should be on more environmentally relevant plastic with complexities stemming from irregular shapes a disperse size range and temporal changes of the properties of microplastics under continuous environmental
