mechanisms that can allow cooperation to emerge in a world of defectors to become an evolutionarily stable strategy a big debate started with the proposal by w d hamilton of kin selection in terms of cost sustained by the cooperators and benefits received by related conspecifics after this four other main rules for the evolution of cooperation have been suggested however one of the main problems of these five rules is the assumption that the payoffs obtained by either cooperating or defeating are quite well known by the parties before they interact and do not change during the time or after repeated encounters this is not always the case in real life following each rule blindly there is a risk for individuals to get stuck in an unfavorable situation axelrod 1984 highlighted that the main problem is how to obtain benefits from cooperation without passing through several trials and errors which are slow and painful with a better understanding of this process individuals can use their

such as ants wasps termites and bees school of fishes flocks of birds herd of herbivores pack of wolves group of primates human families cities and even institutions all offer good evidence that competition might not be the most important natural selector though nature has long been considered red in tooth and claw fry 2012 such as to justify the competitive behavior of our species from cultural biological and economic perspectives gould 1992 hull 1999 marriott 2002 numbers and numbers 2003 altruism may be more advantageous in an individual s lifespan and lead to the long term evolution of cooperation nowak et al 2000 gatti 2011 several studies proposed that rather than continually fighting wasting energy and time species can evolve mutualistic relationships which over time makes the avoidance of competition more convenient than the competition itself and can emerge in symbiotic kiers and heijden 2006 endosymbiotic o malley 2015 and endogenosymbiotic cazzolla gatti 2016 2018 interspecific relations these mutualistic networks stabilize the ecosystems bastolla et al 2009 cazzolla gatti et al 2017 2018 and improve their resilience and productivity thébault and fontaine 2010 however mutualism as well as inter and intra specific cooperation can be stable and prosperous but can be undermined by cheaters or selfish behaviours nonetheless the benefits of intraspecific cooperation the altruistic help provided by one to an individual of its same species remain a controversial issue in evolutionary biology because it is thought that being selfish is an intrinsic feature of our genes dawkins 2016 and most times it is the best choice in social situations midgley 1983 evolution would favor egoistic individuals increasing their fitness i e the number of their offspring or their reproductive success jost 2003 in fact it seems undeniable that in simplified non zero sum games such as the prisoner s dilemma lave 1962 where players individually interact with each other just once or for a fixed number of times defeating cooperation seems the best choice an evolutionary stable strategy ess i e a nash equilibrium hofbauer 2001 although not the most advantageous in terms of maximum reachable payoff during the last fifty years prolific research has been conducted on the mechanisms that can allow cooperation to emerge in a world of defectors to become an ess an interesting debate started with the simple but genial kin selection proposed by w d hamilton 1964 which following the rule named after its author can be beneficial for both the donor and the recipient of an altruistic act an action costly to perform but benefitting another individual of the same species if they are enough related for instance two siblings would have more interest to cooperate than two strangers because they share a higher percentage about 50 more of their genes successively based on hamilton s reasoning in terms of cost sustained by the cooperators and benefits received by conspecifics the other four main rules for the evolution of cooperation have been suggested nowak 2006 however one of the main problems of these five rules is the assumption that the payoffs obtained by either cooperating or defeating are quite well known by the parties before they interact and do not change during the time or after repeated encounters nowak et al 2017 obviously this is not always the case in real life moreover this does not assume that all individuals of a population have to benefit from a cooperative strategy the strategy may only be beneficial at the population level over evolutionary timescales any optimization at the individual level may counteract this which indicates that individuals may not optimally explore the consequence of their behavior to obtain an evolutionarily successful strategy at the same time following each rule blindly there is a risk for individuals to get stuck in an unfavorable situation nonetheless this is not necessarily universal altruism may not always provide an advantage for the individual donor therefore decisions may just happen by instinct and not because these decisions are actively judged every time the main problem is how to obtain benefits from cooperation without passing through several trials and errors which are slow and painful axelrod 1984 this would also increase the costs investment of time energy etc over the benefits of altruistic behavior in fact even if the conditions for cooperation are convenient in the long term individuals may not have sufficient time to explore the strategies to obtain a stable reward from their altruism in the evolution of cooperation axelrod 1984 wrote that if we understand the process we can use our foresight to speed up the evolution of cooperation here i show that a multi armed bandit mab model a classic problem in decision sciences is naturally employed by individuals to opt for the best choice most of the time following the hierarchical nestedness of the rules accelerating the evolution of the altruistic behavior and solving the abovementioned problems the proposed algorithm takes also into account situations of instinctive altruism that omits any active judgment that many cooperating individuals may not be able to practice 2 background the 5 rules for the evolution of cooperation their limits and optimization the basic rules for the evolution of cooperation kin selection and direct reciprocity are accepted by many evolutionary biologists and seem widespread among almost all groups of living beings rothstein and pierotti 1988 zahavi 1995 nevertheless it is obvious that at least some members of our species do not act altruistically only with relatives or people that expect to meet in the future we often offer help to unrelated people that we surely meet once in a life do we behave in this way because we are just a good citizen in terms of darwinian fitness this does not make any sense because we waste our energy time resources etc sustaining a cost that reduces our own fitness to provide support donate a benefit that increases another person s fitness to a competitor in a classic evolutionary definition being altruists with a stranger must give us an advantage natural selection states here is where other forms of cooperation show off table 1 all the forms of cooperation described in table 1 could represent a widespread interaction model even for some lower taxa of animals invertebrates plants fungi and microorganisms see table 2 nonetheless some authors have argued that the 5 rules for the evolution of cooperation are actually not all distinct from each other and represent a continuum in the evolutionary pattern toward cooperation lehmann and rousset 2014 west et al 2007 it is easy to notice that all these five rules are related by the a priori estimation of costs and benefits and that to be evolutionary stable each parameter r w q 1 k 1 1 n m must exceed the c b ratio the costs must be lower than the benefits to have an evolutionary advantage of course if the costs are higher than benefits none of the five rules can stabilize cooperation because for instance no relatedness value can exceed the unit i e meeting with a perfect clone twin or no probability higher than 100 to meet another individual again quantify benefits and costs particularly in the case of kin selection is not an easy task because these parameters are related to the variation in average trait value and therefore cannot predict that change nowak et al 2017 for instance hamilton s rule seems able to estimate only the data that have already been provided and this makes impossible any reliable empirical test because social interactions are usually multilateral and nonlinear it is difficult to constrain them with unique benefit and cost values nowak et al 2017 complex population structures cannot be captured by a single relatedness quantity in reciprocal altruism nonetheless tit for tat is evolutionarily stable only if the interactions between the individuals have enough probability to continue in the future axelrod and dion 1988 however always defect is also evolutionary stable even with a low probability of future interactions imhof et al 2005 therefore how cooperative behavior can start at the beginning there must be a first step that allows some probabilities of altruistic acts before moving to reciprocity genetic kinship seems to be a likely way to bypass the defection equilibrium then the reciprocal forms of cooperation can take the place of kin selection reciprocity both direct and indirect however can stabilize in species with the ability to discriminate against other conspecifics but when the group is too big and variable or there are cognitive impediments for group member s recognition cooperation can be still stable other mechanisms which do not require a high level of discrimination include territoriality with set location network establishment grouping and gregarize akçay et al 2010 grinnell 2002 these lead altruism towards network and group selection besides the difficulties in estimating the cost and benefits of an altruistic act and the instability of a single specific cooperation mechanism there is the risk for individuals following blindly each rule to stuck into an unfavorable situation for instance continuing to cooperate if the conditions change over time aging or illness of the partner might change the convenience of an altruistic act decreasing or even sometimes increasing e g in the case of keeping in the grace of the old member of a group to receive its legacy the propensity to cooperate szolnoki et al 2009 optimizing the strategies that fit best in each situation is another relevant issue which has been investigated in several other behavioral contexts such as feeding optimization see for instance vadas et al 1994 and lupatsch et al 2001 cooperative foraging optimization see for instance chen et al 2009 avoidance of predation optimization see for instance cazzolla gatti et al 2020 travel optimization see for instance lihoreau et al 2010 habitat choice optimization see for instance schmitz 1991 reproductive optimization see for instance oksanen and lundberg 1995 etc for a general review on optimization theory in evolution see smith 1978 and rosenhouse 2002 3 the model 3 1 a multi armed bandit to speed up the evolution of cooperation consider the following situation you meet a person in a train station who needs help to find his her train but you have just a few minutes to get on your own train your help could cost you to wait more than two hours for the next train would you however help this person how do you decide what to do in a few seconds the theory says that if this person is enough related to you he is your brother she is your cousin etc you might afford a cost to provide a benefit to him her if r c b this could be a quick choice assuming if you know the grade of relatedness with this person however it is not so easy to correctly evaluate in a hurry situation whether your w chance to meet this person again q someone is paying attention to your act etc exceeds the costs to benefits ratio human beings have brains but not computers we have a theory of mind but cannot perform an accurate calculus in a train station we can even find it difficult to evaluate the real costs and benefits of our actions i e to build a payoff matrix as in game theory and keep track of their changes during time other species might not have all these reasonings behind their altruistic acts most have the skills to generate the benefits but a few are recognized to have those for distributing them calcott 2008 markvoort et al 2014 in most cases animals may find it difficult even to identify the level of relatedness with other members of their populations schweinfurth and taborsky 2018 stiver et al 2005 therefore how can individuals choose the best option more frequently anticipating hamilton s rule 1964 it is narrated that once haldane said i would gladly give up my life for two brothers or eight cousins gorrell et al 2010 yet this does not help in coupled interactions with a single brother cousin etc if b c does not compensate for the fact that r 1 or b and c are difficult to estimate therefore how species can speed up the evolution of cooperation invoked by axelrod which leads to higher payoff for everyone when it stabilizes the multi armed bandit mab a classic problem in decision sciences even dar et al 2006 could help opt for the best choice most of the time accelerating the evolution of the altruistic behavior and solving the previous paradoxes its name origins from old slot machines where to win money you need to pull an arm called bandit because they steal money from the player if you have in front of you two or more machines and you know that their payoff i e how much money you get pulling a certain arm is not equal between the machines your best option is to identify the machine with the highest payoff once you have this guess you start to pull this machine more than the other one this is a problem of optimal resource allocation under uncertainty how do i most efficiently identify the best machine to play while efficiently exploring the other option in real time so i can exploit the best an get the highest payoff this approach has the power to bring the theoretical assumptions described so far to the everyday situation in which an individual has to decide whether to cooperate or not with someone else the basic model to decide which strategy to select in an unknown or poorly known strategy payoff is to perform repeated a b tests which can be time consuming and inefficient if the choice on the model takes too much time the response could be delayed and useless in the optimal decision making process in the example of the train station if i took too long to decide whether to help the person needing advice both trains could leave and both will pay only costs without receiving benefits similarly if i accelerate my decision and i base it on pure chance or a few a b test scores i have higher probabilities to take the wrong choice and my costs as a donor may outperform the benefits for the recipient moreover even in the simplest event of kin selection when i am interacting with a sibling there could be changing situations aging or illness for instance those in which i cannot clearly evaluate costs and benefits and whether their ratio is lower than 50 etc should i miss my train to help my brother to take his one although cooperation can evolve by natural selection without a conscious understanding of the evolutionary rationale of it for individuals of species that lack a theory of mind the rational evaluation of the pros and cons of an action is impossible thus there should be an easy quick and reliable way living beings take conscious or unconscious decisions to increase the likelihood of adopting the right strategy 3 2 the epsilon greedy algorithm for the evolution of cooperation evolution is a matter of chances and necessities monod 1974 and it always seeks the simplest way to explore solutions and exploit the best ones carroll 2001 furthermore adaptation is a matter of time of fast rearrangement of strategies considering that the best choice now might not be the optimal one in the future bandit algorithms are models to real time and real life decision making that represent an efficient trade off between sufficiently exploring the best options during the time and exploiting the optimal action in current situations this is the kind of trade off favored by natural selection when striking a balance between the two is critically important firstly the variant space needs to be sufficiently explored such that the best choice is identified by first identifying then continuing to exploit the optimal action it is possible to maximize the total payoff that is available to an individual from the environment however an individual also wants to continue to explore other feasible variants in case they provide better returns in the future if some conditions will change that is you want to avoid committing yourself when faced with a difficult choice somewhat by continuing to explore a little sub optimal variants if the related payoff changes for instance becoming older you might not have any doubt whether to help your sister at the train station if she has to be in time at a job interview and you are a plenty of time retired person even if this means that you will have to wait two hours for the next train nonetheless you could get no gratitude no reward and no reputation from your altruism and the result would be that being late you just missed your favorite tv show while your sister is having professional egoistic success similarly for a social bee altruism towards an aging queen could become less advantageous in terms of scarifying workers reproduction de loof 2011 thus the choice to be selfish is still on the plate what to do then if the conditions change adapting to new situations the bandit algorithm will consider this variation and will begin selecting a new strategic behavior for a new meeting during the exploration of the costs and benefits the interacting individuals even if unconsciously learn more about the average payoff rate and what is the distribution of uncertainty around that akçay and roughgarden 2011 the evolutionary key which could make a real difference on an individual s fitness i e gene survival during the decision process is therefore to assess how best to balance the exploration exploitation tradeoff a common mab model which applies extremely well to the evolution of cooperation to balance this tradeoff is the epsilon greedy ε greedy algorithm sutton and barto 1998 this algorithm after an initial period of exploration biological history which can either be considered as evolutionary history in the case of kin network and group selection or life history in the case of shorter term adaptive interactions such as direct or indirect reciprocity greedily exploits the best option ε percent of the time for example if ε 0 95 the algorithm will exploit the best variant 95 of the time and will explore random alternatives 1 ε 5 of the time depending on the environment which might be the full set of resources and conditions available at that specific time an individual runs a bandit algorithm in its mind enough automatic easy and fast to do not require a high cognitive level and an estimation of costs and benefits to decide what strategy to take it then performs the action observes the payoff and updates its knowledge of the reward with a sort of reinforcement learning rl kalidindi and bowman 2007 evolution would lead each individual to get a basic knowledge of its payoff while interacting with another party and to take advantage of this information to exploit during its life the best choice more frequently ε of times but leave a bit of space to exploration 1 ε to adapt to the changing conditions a formal description of an epsilon greedy algorithm is the following initialize for a 1 to k q a 0 n a 0 loop for n times a a r g m a x a q a w i t h p r o b a b i l i t y ε a r a n d o m a c t i o n w i t h p r o b a b i l i t y 1 ε r bandit a n a n a 1 q a q a 1 n a r q a where a is a random number of k actions q a is the estimate of expected reward for taking the action a n a is the number of time action a is selected r is the set of rewards obtained and a is the set of actions taken a slightly modified version of the epsilon greedy algorithm for the evolution of cooperation fig 1 can therefore be described as the following randomly choose cooperation c or defection d for n trials biological history on each trial estimate the payoff of variant c and d set the parameters r w q 1 k 1 1 n m ε after n learning trials biological history if c payoff d payoff a select exploit ε of the time the variant c b 1 ε of the time sample explore from the variants c and d randomly when d payoff c payoff a switch the choice σ and select exploit 1 ε of the time the variant d b ε of the time sample explore from the variants d and c randomly it is important to point out that this is a slightly modified version of the original epsilon greedy algorithm here a switch σ is included this is because the parameters r w q 1 k 1 1 n m are the epsilon value thus ε represents the number of times cooperation should be exploited when its payoff is higher than that of selfishness obviously the higher the parameter value ε the more convenient to exploit cooperation ε of the time therefore the epsilon value is predetermined by evolutionary constraints and depends on the biological history of relationships and interactions among interacting individuals if however during interactions the best payoff switches to selfishness the individual starts to explore both variants ε of the time fig 1 in this case in fact the lower the parameter value ε the more convenient to exploit selfishness 1 ε of the time this switch easily corrects for evaluation mistakes and bias in payoff estimations after the learning trials for instance even if r is 0 5 there might be situations when d payoff is evaluated higher than c payoff and this would lead to overexploitation of relatives without a switch function σ the initial exploration trials of the epsilon greedy algorithm follow an evolutionary development evo devo pattern they are performed by some individuals during evolutionary history evo and selected for the best fitness this constitutes pre birth information genetically transferred as in the case of kin and group selection but they can be also performed during the life history of every single individual devo that could be advantaged in its fitness this constitutes learning from life experiences as in the case of direct indirect and network reciprocity in both cases these trials provide an estimate of the initial payoff for cooperation and defection about the parameters r w q etc following a hierarchical decision making process of the five rules in sequence fig 2 individuals select ε i e r w q etc of the time to exploit the payoff rate gained from cooperation however an individual will select 1 ε of the time to sample from two variants either cooperation can be selected 1 ε 2 of times or to move to the lower cooperative rule can be selected with the same probability 1 ε 2 randomly like just flipping an imaginary coin to leave a bit of space to exploration to adapt to the changing conditions in future if after the hierarchical exploration of all the five rules or of only those species specific that apply see table 1 cooperation is not achieved then the individual will defect and behave selfishly after each interaction however through reinforcement learning each individual will acquire more knowledge of its payoff for potential next interaction with the same individual or group if the payoff for selfishness becomes higher than that assumed for cooperation the individual switches σ to exploit selfishness 1 ε of the time and explore randomly between the two variants ε 2 of the time in the five circumstances depicted in fig 2 it emerges that ε 1 ε 2 1 ε 2 for any ε r w q 1 k and 1 1 n m therefore when c payoff d payoff cooperation quickly evolves with a minimum probability pecmin ε 1 ε 2 whereas selfishness has a maximum probability to evolve of pesmax 1 ε 2 for instance if r 0 5 two siblings interact ε 0 5 and 0 5 0 25 0 25 0 75 0 25 the probability of cooperation to evolve is minimum 75 and the probability of exploration for the alternative variant lower hierarchical cooperation level and eventually selfishness is maximum 25 if w 0 25 two interacting individuals have 1 out of 4 chances to meet again ε 0 25 and 0 25 0 375 0 375 0 575 0 375 the probability of cooperation to evolve is minimum 57 7 and the probability of exploration for the alternative variant is maximum 37 5 if q 0 125 the probability of knowing someone s reputation in presence of 7 other unknown individuals ε 0 125 and 0 125 0 4375 0 4375 0 5625 0 4375 the probability of cooperation to evolve is minimum 56 25 and the probability of exploration for the alternative variant is maximum 43 75 it is trivial to prove that for any value of r w q 1 k and 1 1 n m pec is always 0 5 hence cooperation has always more chances to evolve than competition following one of the five rules when this epsilon greedy algorithm is applied in decision making and the payoff for cooperation is the highest skipping the need to estimate costs and benefits of an interaction nonetheless besides speeding up the evolution of cooperation the algorithm still keeps some space open to evolving conditions with a 1 ε 2 probability to explore other choices selfishness in this case and improve the future payoff 4 discussion this mab model encompasses and provides a comprehensive framework for the five rules of cooperation therefore the model is not an alternative to the five rules but a logic structure for optimizing them the five rules for the evolution of cooperation through a multi armed bandit choice selection will still hold without keeping an individual in an inconvenient situation if it cannot exactly estimate the costs and benefits and or the environmental changes including variations in individual behavior network and group compositions etc during the time an evident hierarchical ranking exists among the five rules for the evolution of cooperation fig 2 with kin selection at the first level followed by direct indirect and network reciprocity and then by group selection this means that 1 r 2 of times an individual before opting to be a selfish i e defeat cooperation moves its decision making process to the lower hierarchical level and evaluates the choice based on the second parameter w probability of next round again 1 w 2 of the times the decision shifts to the next level and so on until it reaches the last one group selection where 1 1 1 n m 2 of times selfishness is the only likely option this hierarchical shifting of cooperation rules can be summarized by the expression r q w 1 k 1 1 n m ε cooperation 1 ε exploration from this whole scenario it emerges that cooperation through the epsilon greedy decision making algorithm evolves as a multilayer process horizontally algorithmically and vertically hierarchically it is interesting to notice that in an evolutionary scenario of cooperation based on this multi armed bandit model haplodiploidy results in one the highest probability of cooperation in nature this is the sex determination system of hymenoptera and other taxa of invertebrates in which males develop from unfertilized eggs and are haploid and females develop from fertilized eggs and are diploid therefore insects with a coefficient r of relatedness of 0 75 which is common between the sisterhood of worker bees in a hive have r ε 0 75 pecmin 0 875 and pesmax 0 125 however while haplodiploid females are more closely related to their sisters than to their offspring they still share more genes with their offspring than with their brothers r 0 25 previous research suggests that the evolutionary burden of raising low value brothers would therefore offset the advantages of rearing high value sisters nonetheless the epsilon greedy algorithm resolves this imbalance already at the first level kin selection because when r ε 0 25 pecmin is still 65 and pesmax is 25 therefore cooperating with brothers is still worth it in a cooperative hive i e where initial trials during biological history assessed that c payoff is generally higher than d payoff overall from the hierarchical epsilon greedy algorithm we can predict that cooperation has the following general probability to evolve when c payoff d payoff p ec r w q 1 k 1 1 n m in the previous example of a beehive with a sisterhood of worker bees relatedness r among sisters is 0 75 and the probability of a next interaction w between two of them is extremely high let s assume 0 9 considering that there is no evidence of indirect reciprocity for invertebrates see table 1 but network and group selections have been suggested at least for social insects fewell 2003 cooperation among social bees evolves with a probability 0 75 0 9 1 k 1 1 n m which is 0 675 1 k 1 n m this means that besides relatedness and direct reciprocity the evolution of eusociality is strongly dependent on the number of neighbors k and the size number of groups 1 n m this confirms the recent evidence field toyoizumi 2020 from hymenoptera with more specialized morphological castes that two common features of eusociality i e saturating birth rates and group size significantly determine whether eusociality outperforms other strategies 4 conclusions how well hamilton s rule can account for all the different forms of altruism is a long debated topic in evolutionary biology the key point relates to the levels of selection kin selection favors more cooperation among related individuals and on the other extreme group selection enlarges the interactions within and between entire groups of organisms so far the problem resided in the idea that selection between groups cannot be stable enough to promote adaptations because selection acts mostly at the individual and not group level classical evolutionary biology considered between group a very special case that cannot account for most of the cooperative interactions though recently some evidence that kin selection and multilevel selection can be mathematically equivalent has emerged the continuum of different cooperation levels and its hierarchical interconnection has been largely ignored the relation between heritable traits and fitness has been mostly based on direct versus indirect for kin selection and within groups versus between groups for group selection benefits hamilton s rule and group selection instead should be considered just as the starting and ending point of multilevel interactions examining the evolution of cooperation on actual individuals biologists should follow a matryoshka model proposed by wilson and wilson 2008 because natural selection operates at multiple levels of the biological hierarchy the matryoshka model combined with the epsilon greedy algorithm should be used to evaluate the importance of each level on a case by case basis fig 3 as shown above the interacting layers of the evolution of cooperation are like a matryoshka nested one within another at each hierarchical level natural selection favors a different rule of cooperation the general rule is that cooperation at a certain level requires a corresponding process of selection at that level and might be weakened by selection at lower levels case by case it should be shown how a cooperative level of selection is strong enough to counterbalance the higher selective advantage for selfishness an interesting example comes from a model organism mentioned by wilson and wilson 2008 the amoebae dictyostelium discoides is an important species for the study of evolutionary development evo devo in these organisms the stalk cells in the multicellular slug seem to sacrifice their lives for the good of the group following the principles of multilevel selection in fact the spore cells in the head of the fruiting body successfully disperse and pass their genes to the next generation only if other cells form a stalk and sacrifice their own reproduction but why some altruistic cells should give up to improve their own fitness to give an advantage to other selfish cells it might be that altruistic cells recognize themselves and aggregate only with others that carry the same altruistic genes so that each stalk is genetically similar in this case however natural selection would favor cooperation at the group level but altruistic genes in the stalk would be reduced up to almost disappear after a certain number of selfish generations in the fruiting body a more plausible explanation is now offered by the multilevel selection matryoshka model applied to the epsilon greedy algorithm as in a lottery process some individuals make the ultimate sacrifice to become stalk cells but they are a random sample deriving from the ε exploration of cooperative and selfish strategies in this way there is no genetic selection within a group and the altruistic genes have a higher chance to survive at the next generations both to the benefit of the individual carrying cells and whole multicellular organisms to better investigate the evolution of cooperation we must therefore look first to kin selection but if this does not seem the likely reason of an altruistic act we should move forward at a higher level to include other ecological evolutionary and developmental eco evo devo variables relevant to explain a specific interaction through the epsilon greedy algorithm the empirical analysis of the evolution of cooperation should follow a five question scheme 1 what is the percentage of the individual s relatedness with its partner 2 what is the probability it has to meet its partner again 3 what is the chance that someone is looking at its interaction with its partner 4 what is the number of cooperative neighbors in its social network 5 what is the number of cooperative members and groups in its environment this approach may be the basis for further more application oriented studies through reinforcement learning a subtype of artificial intelligence based on the idea that a computer learns as a living being does with trials and errors we would have a powerful tool to better understand and even probabilistically quantify the chances cooperation has to evolve in a specific situation this would solve most of the problems of estimating a priori costs and benefits of an altruistic act and adapt to the dynamical change of the external conditions for instance a behavioral ecologist studying the interactions among members of a group or individuals of different species may use a computer simulation to understand the dynamics and the evolution of decision making and predict the probability of cooperation evolution by i gathering information about the biological history of the individuals species involved to check if the payoff was higher in previous cooperative

the parameters and the payoffs change during a pre established time e g number of encounters this multi armed bandit model to the evolution of cooperation answers the question of how should an individual dedicate a defined amount of resources to different options when it cannot be sure what will come of i e which payoff pulling each one with the epsilon greedy algorithm as life and

random action just to make sure that it s not missing anything using this learning algorithm the individual converges to the optimal strategy in choosing between cooperation and selfishness credit

24710,most evolutionary biologists consider selfishness an intrinsic feature of our genes and as the best choice in social situations during the last years prolific research has been conducted on the mechanisms that can allow cooperation to emerge in a world of defectors to become an evolutionarily stable strategy a big debate started with the proposal by w d hamilton of kin selection in terms of cost sustained by the cooperators and benefits received by related conspecifics after this four other main rules for the evolution of cooperation have been suggested however one of the main problems of these five rules is the assumption that the payoffs obtained by either cooperating or defeating are quite well known by the parties before they interact and do not change during the time or after repeated encounters this is not always the case in real life following each rule blindly there is a risk for individuals to get stuck in an unfavorable situation axelrod 1984 highlighted that the main problem is how to obtain benefits from cooperation without passing through several trials and errors which are slow and painful with a better understanding of this process individuals can use their foresight to speed up the evolution of cooperation here i show that a multi armed bandit mab model a classic problem in decision sciences is naturally employed by individuals to opt for the best choice most of the time accelerating the evolution of the altruistic behavior and solving the abovementioned problems a common mab model that applies extremely well to the evolution of cooperation is

cultural biological and economic perspectives gould 1992 hull 1999 marriott 2002 numbers and numbers 2003 altruism may be more advantageous in an individual s lifespan and lead to the long term evolution of cooperation nowak et al 2000 gatti 2011 several studies proposed that rather than continually fighting wasting energy and time species can evolve mutualistic relationships which over time makes the avoidance of competition more convenient than the competition itself and can emerge in symbiotic kiers and heijden 2006 endosymbiotic o malley 2015 and endogenosymbiotic cazzolla gatti 2016 2018 interspecific relations these mutualistic networks stabilize the ecosystems bastolla et al 2009 cazzolla gatti et al 2017 2018 and improve their resilience and productivity thébault and fontaine 2010 however mutualism as well as inter and intra specific cooperation can be stable and prosperous but can be undermined by cheaters or selfish behaviours nonetheless the benefits of intraspecific cooperation the altruistic help provided by one to an individual of its same species remain a controversial issue in evolutionary biology because it is thought that being selfish is an intrinsic feature of our genes dawkins 2016 and most times it is the best choice in social situations midgley 1983 evolution would favor egoistic individuals increasing their fitness i e the number of their offspring or their reproductive success jost 2003 in fact it seems undeniable that in simplified non zero sum games such as the prisoner s dilemma lave 1962 where players individually interact with each other just once or for a fixed number of times defeating cooperation seems the best choice an evolutionary stable strategy ess i e a nash equilibrium hofbauer 2001 although not the most advantageous in terms of maximum reachable payoff during the last fifty years prolific research has been conducted on the mechanisms that can allow cooperation to emerge in a world of defectors to become an ess an interesting debate started with the simple but genial kin selection proposed by w d hamilton 1964 which following the rule named after its author can be beneficial for both the donor and the recipient of an altruistic act an action costly to perform but benefitting another individual of the same species if they are enough related for instance two siblings would have more interest to cooperate than two strangers because they share a higher percentage about 50 more of their genes successively based on hamilton s reasoning in terms of cost sustained by the cooperators and benefits received by conspecifics the other four main rules for the evolution of cooperation have been suggested nowak 2006 however one of the main problems of these five rules is the assumption that the payoffs obtained by either cooperating or defeating are quite well known by the parties before they interact and do not change during the time or after repeated encounters nowak et al 2017 obviously this is not always the case in real life moreover this does not assume that all individuals of a population have to benefit from a cooperative strategy the strategy may only be beneficial at the population level over evolutionary timescales any optimization at the individual level may counteract this which indicates that individuals may not optimally explore the consequence of their behavior to obtain an evolutionarily successful strategy at the same time following each rule blindly there is a risk for individuals to get stuck in an unfavorable situation nonetheless this is not necessarily universal altruism may not always provide an advantage for the individual donor therefore decisions may just happen by instinct and not because these decisions are actively judged every time the main problem is how to obtain benefits from cooperation without passing through several trials and errors which are slow and painful axelrod 1984 this would also increase the costs investment of time energy etc over the benefits of altruistic behavior in fact even if the conditions for cooperation are convenient in the long term individuals may not have sufficient time to explore the strategies to obtain a stable reward from their altruism in the evolution of cooperation axelrod 1984 wrote that if we understand the process we can use our foresight to speed up the evolution of cooperation here i show that a multi armed bandit mab model a classic problem in decision sciences is naturally employed by individuals to opt for the best choice most of the time following the hierarchical nestedness of the rules accelerating the evolution of the altruistic behavior and solving the abovementioned problems the proposed algorithm takes also into account situations of instinctive altruism that omits any active judgment that many cooperating individuals may not be able to practice 2 background the 5 rules for the evolution of cooperation their limits and optimization the basic rules for the evolution of cooperation kin selection and direct reciprocity are accepted by many evolutionary biologists and seem widespread among almost all groups of living beings rothstein and pierotti 1988 zahavi 1995 nevertheless it is obvious that at least some members of our species do not act altruistically only with relatives or people that expect to meet in the future we often offer help to unrelated people that we surely meet once in a life do we behave in this way because we are just a good citizen in terms of darwinian fitness this does not make any sense because we waste our energy time resources etc sustaining a cost that reduces our own fitness to provide support donate a benefit that increases another person s fitness to a competitor in a classic evolutionary definition being altruists with a stranger must give us an advantage natural selection states here is where other forms of cooperation show off table 1 all the forms of cooperation described in table 1 could represent a widespread interaction model even for some lower taxa of animals invertebrates plants fungi and microorganisms see table 2 nonetheless some authors have argued that the 5 rules for the evolution of cooperation are actually not all distinct from each other and represent a continuum in the evolutionary pattern toward cooperation lehmann and rousset 2014 west et al 2007 it is easy to notice that all these five rules are related by the a priori estimation of costs and benefits and that to be evolutionary stable each parameter r w q 1 k 1 1 n m must exceed the c b ratio the costs must be lower than the benefits to have an evolutionary advantage of course if the costs are higher than benefits none of the five rules can stabilize cooperation because for instance no relatedness value can exceed the unit i e meeting with a perfect clone twin or no probability higher than 100 to meet another individual again quantify benefits and costs particularly in the case of kin selection is not an easy task because these parameters are related to the variation in average trait value and therefore cannot predict that change nowak et al 2017 for instance hamilton s rule seems able to estimate only the data that have already been provided and this makes impossible any reliable empirical test because social interactions are usually multilateral and nonlinear it is difficult to constrain them with unique benefit and cost values nowak et al 2017 complex population structures cannot be captured by a single relatedness quantity in reciprocal altruism nonetheless tit for tat is evolutionarily stable only if the interactions between the individuals have enough probability to continue in the future axelrod and dion 1988 however always defect is also evolutionary stable even with a low probability of future interactions imhof et al 2005 therefore how cooperative behavior can start at the beginning there must be a first step that allows some probabilities of altruistic acts before moving to reciprocity genetic kinship seems to be a likely way to bypass the defection equilibrium then the reciprocal forms of cooperation can take the place of kin selection reciprocity both direct and indirect however can stabilize in species with the ability to discriminate against other conspecifics but when the group is too big and variable or there are cognitive impediments for group member s recognition cooperation can be still stable other mechanisms which do not require a high level of discrimination include territoriality with set location network establishment grouping and gregarize akçay et al 2010 grinnell 2002 these lead altruism towards network and group selection besides the difficulties in estimating the cost and benefits of an altruistic act and the instability of a single specific cooperation mechanism there is the risk for individuals following blindly each rule to stuck into an unfavorable situation for instance continuing to cooperate if the conditions change over time aging or illness of the partner might change the convenience of an altruistic act decreasing or even sometimes increasing e g in the case of keeping in the grace of the old member of a group to receive its legacy the propensity to cooperate szolnoki et al 2009 optimizing the strategies that fit best in each situation is another relevant issue which has been investigated in several other behavioral contexts such as feeding optimization see for instance vadas et al 1994 and lupatsch et al 2001 cooperative foraging optimization see for instance chen et al 2009 avoidance of predation optimization see for instance cazzolla gatti et al 2020 travel optimization see for instance lihoreau et al 2010 habitat choice optimization see for instance schmitz 1991 reproductive optimization see for instance oksanen and lundberg 1995 etc for a general review on optimization theory in evolution see smith 1978 and rosenhouse 2002 3 the model 3 1 a multi armed bandit to speed up the evolution of cooperation consider the following situation you meet a person in a train station who needs help to find his her train but you have just a few minutes to get on your own train your help could cost you to wait more than two hours for the next train would you however help this person how do you decide what to do in a few seconds the theory says that if this person is enough related to you he is your brother she is your cousin etc you might afford a cost to provide a benefit to him her if r c b this could be a quick choice assuming if you know the grade of relatedness with this person however it is not so easy to correctly evaluate in a hurry situation whether your w chance to meet this person again q someone is paying attention to your act etc exceeds the costs to benefits ratio human beings have brains but not computers we have a theory of mind but cannot perform an accurate calculus in a train station we can even find it difficult to evaluate the real costs and benefits of our actions i e to build a payoff matrix as in game theory and keep track of their changes during time other species might not have all these reasonings behind their altruistic acts most have the skills to generate the benefits but a few are recognized to have those for distributing them calcott 2008 markvoort et al 2014 in most cases animals may find it difficult even to identify the level of relatedness with other members of their populations schweinfurth and taborsky 2018 stiver et al 2005 therefore how can individuals choose the best option more frequently anticipating hamilton s rule 1964 it is narrated that once haldane said i would gladly give up my life for two brothers or eight cousins gorrell et al 2010 yet this does not help in coupled interactions with a single brother cousin etc if b c does not compensate for the fact that r 1 or b and c are difficult to estimate therefore how species can speed up the evolution of cooperation invoked by axelrod which leads to higher payoff for everyone when it stabilizes the multi armed bandit mab a classic problem in decision sciences even dar et al 2006 could help opt for the best choice most of the time accelerating the evolution of the altruistic behavior and solving the previous paradoxes its name origins from old slot machines where to win money you need to pull an arm called bandit because they steal money from the player if you have in front of you two or more machines and you know that their payoff i e how much money you get pulling a certain arm is not equal between the machines your best option is to identify the machine with the highest payoff once you have this guess you start to pull this machine more than the other one this is a problem of optimal resource allocation under uncertainty how do i most efficiently identify the best machine to play while efficiently exploring the other option in real time so i can exploit the best an get the highest payoff this approach has the power to bring the theoretical assumptions described so far to the everyday situation in which an individual has to decide whether to cooperate or not with someone else the basic model to decide which strategy to select in an unknown or poorly known strategy payoff is to perform repeated a b tests which can be time consuming and inefficient if the choice on the model takes too much time the response could be delayed and useless in the optimal decision making process in the example of the train station if i took too long to decide whether to help the person needing advice both trains could leave and both will pay only costs without receiving benefits similarly if i accelerate my decision and i base it on pure chance or a few a b test scores i have higher probabilities to take the wrong choice and my costs as a donor may outperform the benefits for the recipient moreover even in the simplest event of kin selection when i am interacting with a sibling there could be changing situations aging or illness for instance those in which i cannot clearly evaluate costs and benefits and whether their ratio is lower than 50 etc should i miss my train to help my brother to take his one although cooperation can evolve by natural selection without a conscious understanding of the evolutionary rationale of it for individuals of species that lack a theory of mind the rational evaluation of the pros and cons of an action is impossible thus there should be an easy quick and reliable way living beings take conscious or unconscious decisions to increase the likelihood of adopting the right strategy 3 2 the epsilon greedy algorithm for the evolution of cooperation evolution is a matter of chances and necessities monod 1974 and it always seeks the simplest way to explore solutions and exploit the best ones carroll 2001 furthermore adaptation is a matter of time of fast rearrangement of strategies considering that the best choice now might not be the optimal one in the future bandit algorithms are models to real time and real life decision making that represent an efficient trade off between sufficiently exploring the best options during the time and exploiting the optimal action in current situations this is the kind of trade off favored by natural selection when striking a balance between the two is critically important firstly the variant space needs to be sufficiently explored such that the best choice is identified by first identifying then continuing to exploit the optimal action it is possible to maximize the total payoff that is available to an individual from the environment however an individual also wants to continue to explore other feasible variants in case they provide better returns in the future if some conditions will change that is you want to avoid committing yourself when faced with a difficult choice somewhat by continuing to explore a little sub optimal variants if the related payoff changes for instance becoming older you might not have any doubt whether to help your sister at the train station if she has to be in time at a job interview and you are a plenty of time retired person even if this means that you will have to wait two hours for the next train nonetheless you could get no gratitude no reward and no reputation from your altruism and the result would be that being late you just missed your favorite tv show while your sister is having professional egoistic success similarly for a social bee altruism towards an aging queen could become less advantageous in terms of scarifying workers reproduction de loof 2011 thus the choice to be selfish is still on the plate what to do then if the conditions change adapting to new situations the bandit algorithm will consider this variation and will begin selecting a new strategic behavior for a new meeting during the exploration of the costs and benefits the interacting individuals even if unconsciously learn more about the average payoff rate and what is the distribution of uncertainty around that akçay and roughgarden 2011 the evolutionary key which could make a real difference on an individual s fitness i e gene survival during the decision process is therefore to assess how best to balance the exploration exploitation tradeoff a common mab model which applies extremely well to the evolution of cooperation to balance this tradeoff is the epsilon greedy ε greedy algorithm sutton and barto 1998 this algorithm after an initial period of exploration biological history which can either be considered as evolutionary history in the case of kin network and group selection or life history in the case of shorter term adaptive interactions such as direct or indirect reciprocity greedily exploits the best option ε percent of the time for example if ε 0 95 the algorithm will exploit the best variant 95 of the time and will explore random alternatives 1 ε 5 of the time depending on the environment which might be the full set of resources and conditions available at that specific time an individual runs a bandit algorithm in its mind enough automatic easy and fast to do not require a high cognitive level and an estimation of costs and benefits to decide what strategy to take it then performs the action observes the payoff and updates its knowledge of the reward with a sort of reinforcement learning rl kalidindi and bowman 2007 evolution would lead each individual to get a basic knowledge of its payoff while interacting with another party and to take advantage of this information to exploit during its life the best choice more frequently ε of times but leave a bit of space to exploration 1 ε to adapt to the changing conditions a formal description of an epsilon greedy algorithm is the following initialize for a 1 to k q a 0 n a 0 loop for n times a a r g m a x a q a w i t h p r o b a b i l i t y ε a r a n d o m a c t i o n w i t h p r o b a b i l i t y 1 ε r bandit a n a n a 1 q a q a 1 n a r q a where a is a random number of k actions q a is the estimate of expected reward for taking the action a n a is the number of time action a is selected r is the set of rewards obtained and a is the set of actions taken a slightly modified version of the epsilon greedy algorithm for the evolution of cooperation fig 1 can therefore be described as the following randomly choose cooperation c or defection d for n trials biological history on each trial estimate the payoff of variant c and d set the parameters r w q 1 k 1 1 n m ε after n learning trials biological history if c payoff d payoff a select exploit ε of the time the variant c b 1 ε of the time sample explore from the variants c and d randomly when d payoff c payoff a switch the choice σ and select exploit 1 ε of the time the variant d b ε of the time sample explore from the variants d and c randomly it is important to point out that this is a slightly modified version of the original epsilon greedy algorithm here a switch σ is included this is because the parameters r w q 1 k 1 1 n m are the epsilon value thus ε represents the number of times cooperation should be exploited when its payoff is higher than that of selfishness obviously the higher the parameter value ε the more convenient to exploit cooperation ε of the time therefore the epsilon value is predetermined by evolutionary constraints and depends on the biological history of relationships and interactions among interacting individuals if however during interactions the best payoff switches to selfishness the individual starts to explore both variants ε of the time fig 1 in this case in fact the lower the parameter value ε the more convenient to exploit selfishness 1 ε of the time this switch easily corrects for evaluation mistakes and bias in payoff estimations after the learning trials for instance even if r is 0 5 there might be situations when d payoff is evaluated higher than c payoff and this would lead to overexploitation of relatives without a switch function σ the initial exploration trials of the epsilon greedy algorithm follow an evolutionary development evo devo pattern they are performed by some individuals during evolutionary history evo and selected for the best fitness this constitutes pre birth information genetically transferred as in the case of kin and group selection but they can be also performed during the life history of every single individual devo that could be advantaged in its fitness this constitutes learning from life experiences as in the case of direct indirect and network reciprocity in both cases these trials provide an estimate of the initial payoff for cooperation and defection about the parameters r w q etc following a hierarchical decision making process of the five rules in sequence fig 2 individuals select ε i e r w q etc of the time to exploit the payoff rate gained from cooperation however an individual will select 1 ε of the time to sample from two variants either cooperation can be selected 1 ε 2 of times or to move to the lower cooperative rule can be selected with the same probability 1 ε 2 randomly like just flipping an imaginary coin to leave a bit of space to exploration to adapt to the changing conditions in future if after the hierarchical exploration of all the five rules or of only those species specific that apply see table 1 cooperation is not achieved then the individual will defect and behave selfishly after each interaction however through reinforcement learning each individual will acquire more knowledge of its payoff for potential next interaction with the same individual or group if the payoff for selfishness becomes higher than that assumed for cooperation the individual switches σ to exploit selfishness 1 ε of the time and explore randomly between the two variants ε 2 of the time in the five circumstances depicted in fig 2 it emerges that ε 1 ε 2 1 ε 2 for any ε r w q 1 k and 1 1 n m therefore when c payoff d payoff cooperation quickly evolves with a minimum probability pecmin ε 1 ε 2 whereas selfishness has a maximum probability to evolve of pesmax 1 ε 2 for instance if r 0 5 two siblings interact ε 0 5 and 0 5 0 25 0 25 0 75 0 25 the probability of cooperation to evolve is minimum 75 and the probability of exploration for the alternative variant lower hierarchical cooperation level and eventually selfishness is maximum 25 if w 0 25 two interacting individuals have 1 out of 4 chances to meet again ε 0 25 and 0 25 0 375 0 375 0 575 0 375 the probability of cooperation to evolve is minimum 57 7 and the probability of exploration for the alternative variant is maximum 37 5 if q 0 125 the probability of knowing someone s reputation in presence of 7 other unknown individuals ε 0 125 and 0 125 0 4375 0 4375 0 5625 0 4375 the probability of cooperation to evolve is minimum 56 25 and the probability of exploration for the alternative variant is maximum 43 75 it is trivial to prove that for any value of r w q 1 k and 1 1 n m pec is always 0 5 hence cooperation has always more chances to evolve than competition following one of the five rules when this epsilon greedy algorithm is applied in decision making and the payoff for cooperation is the highest skipping the need to estimate costs and benefits of an interaction nonetheless besides speeding up the evolution of cooperation the algorithm still keeps some space open to evolving conditions with a 1 ε 2 probability to explore other choices selfishness in this case and improve the future payoff 4 discussion this mab model encompasses and provides a comprehensive framework for the five rules of cooperation therefore the model is not an alternative to the five rules but a logic structure for optimizing them the five rules for the evolution of cooperation through a multi armed bandit choice selection will still hold without keeping an individual in an inconvenient situation if it cannot exactly estimate the costs and benefits and or the environmental changes including variations in individual behavior network and group compositions etc during the time an evident hierarchical ranking exists among the five rules for the evolution of cooperation fig 2 with kin selection at the first level followed by direct indirect and network reciprocity and then by group selection this means that 1 r 2 of times an individual before opting to be a selfish i e defeat cooperation moves its decision making process to the lower hierarchical level and evaluates the choice based on the second parameter w probability of next round again 1 w 2 of the times the decision shifts to the next level and so on until it reaches the last one group selection where 1 1 1 n m 2 of times selfishness is the only likely option this hierarchical shifting of cooperation rules can be summarized by the expression r q w 1 k 1 1 n m ε cooperation 1 ε exploration from this whole scenario it emerges that cooperation through the epsilon greedy decision making algorithm evolves as a multilayer process horizontally algorithmically and vertically hierarchically it is interesting to notice that in an evolutionary scenario of cooperation based on this multi armed bandit model haplodiploidy results in one the highest probability of cooperation in nature this is the sex determination system of hymenoptera and other taxa of invertebrates in which males develop from unfertilized eggs and are haploid and females develop from fertilized eggs and are diploid therefore insects with a coefficient r of relatedness of 0 75 which is common between the sisterhood of worker bees in a hive have r ε 0 75 pecmin 0 875 and pesmax 0 125 however while haplodiploid females are more closely related to their sisters than to their offspring they still share more genes with their offspring than with their brothers r 0 25 previous research suggests that the evolutionary burden of raising low value brothers would therefore offset the advantages of rearing high value sisters nonetheless the epsilon greedy algorithm resolves this imbalance already at the first level kin selection because when r ε 0 25 pecmin is still 65 and pesmax is 25 therefore cooperating with brothers is still worth it in a cooperative hive i e where initial trials during biological history assessed that c payoff is generally higher than d payoff overall from the hierarchical epsilon greedy algorithm we can predict that cooperation has the following general probability to evolve when c payoff d payoff p ec r w q 1 k 1 1 n m in the previous example of a beehive with a sisterhood of worker bees relatedness r among sisters is 0 75 and the probability of a next interaction w between two of them is extremely high let s assume 0 9 considering that there is no evidence of indirect reciprocity for invertebrates see table 1 but network and group selections have been suggested at least for social insects fewell 2003 cooperation among social bees evolves with a probability 0 75 0 9 1 k 1 1 n m which is 0 675 1 k 1 n m this means that besides relatedness and direct reciprocity the evolution of eusociality is strongly dependent on the number of neighbors k and the size number of groups 1 n m this confirms the recent evidence field toyoizumi 2020 from hymenoptera with more specialized morphological castes that two common features of eusociality i e saturating birth rates and group size significantly determine whether eusociality outperforms other strategies 4 conclusions how well hamilton s rule can account for all the different forms of altruism is a long debated topic in evolutionary biology the key point relates to the levels of selection kin selection favors more cooperation among related individuals and on the other extreme group selection enlarges the interactions within and between entire groups of organisms so far the problem resided in the idea that selection between groups cannot be stable enough to promote adaptations because selection acts mostly at the individual and not group level classical evolutionary biology considered between group a very special case that cannot account for most of the cooperative interactions though recently some evidence that kin selection and multilevel selection can be mathematically equivalent has emerged the continuum of different cooperation levels and its hierarchical interconnection has been largely ignored the relation between heritable traits and fitness has been mostly based on direct versus indirect for kin selection and within groups versus between groups for group selection benefits hamilton s rule and group selection instead should be considered just as the starting and ending point of multilevel interactions examining the evolution of cooperation on actual individuals biologists should follow a matryoshka model proposed by wilson and wilson 2008 because natural selection operates at multiple levels of the biological hierarchy the matryoshka model combined with the epsilon greedy algorithm should be used to evaluate the importance of each level on a case by case basis fig 3 as shown above the interacting layers of the evolution of cooperation are like a matryoshka nested one within another at each hierarchical level natural selection favors a different rule of cooperation the general rule is that cooperation at a certain level requires a corresponding process of selection at that level and might be weakened by selection at lower levels case by case it should be shown how a cooperative level of selection is strong enough to counterbalance the higher selective advantage for selfishness an interesting example comes from a model organism mentioned by wilson and wilson 2008 the amoebae dictyostelium discoides is an important species for the study of evolutionary development evo devo in these organisms the stalk cells in the multicellular slug seem to sacrifice their lives for the good of the group following the principles of multilevel selection in fact the spore cells in the head of the fruiting body successfully disperse and pass their genes to the next generation only if other cells form a stalk and sacrifice their own reproduction but why some altruistic cells should give up to improve their own fitness to give an advantage to other selfish cells it might be that altruistic cells recognize themselves and aggregate only with others that carry the same altruistic genes so that each stalk is genetically similar in this case however natural selection would favor cooperation at the group level but altruistic genes in the stalk would be reduced up to almost disappear after a certain number of selfish generations in the fruiting body a more plausible explanation is now offered by the multilevel selection matryoshka model applied to the epsilon greedy algorithm as in a lottery process some individuals make the ultimate sacrifice to become stalk cells but they are a random sample deriving from the ε exploration of cooperative and selfish strategies in this way there is no genetic selection within a group and the altruistic genes have a higher chance to survive at the next generations both to the benefit of the individual carrying cells and whole multicellular organisms to better investigate the evolution of cooperation we must therefore look first to kin selection but if this does not seem the likely reason of an altruistic act we should move forward at a higher level to include other ecological evolutionary and developmental eco evo devo variables relevant to explain a specific interaction through the epsilon greedy algorithm the empirical analysis of the evolution of cooperation should follow a five question scheme 1 what is the percentage of the individual s relatedness with its partner 2 what is the probability it has to meet its partner again 3 what is the chance that someone is looking at its interaction with its partner 4 what is the number of cooperative neighbors in its social network 5 what is the number of cooperative members and groups in its environment this approach may be the basis for further more application oriented studies through reinforcement learning a subtype of artificial intelligence based on the idea that a computer learns as a living being does with trials and errors we would have a powerful tool to better understand and even probabilistically quantify the chances cooperation has to evolve in a specific situation this would solve most of the problems of estimating a priori costs and benefits of an altruistic act and adapt to the dynamical change of the external conditions for instance a behavioral ecologist studying the interactions among members of a group or individuals of different species may use a computer simulation to understand the dynamics and the evolution of decision making and predict the probability of cooperation evolution by i gathering information about the biological history of the individuals species involved to check if the payoff was higher in previous cooperative or competitive interactions i e whether the switch is set on payoff c d or payoff d c ii setting the parameters r w q k 1 n m that apply to the subject involved in the study iii using the matryoshka ε greedy algorithm proposed here to estimate the ε 1 ε 2 at each step of the nested hierarchical roles iv running the model to look at the dynamical variation of the cooperative selfish behavior when the parameters and the payoffs change during a pre established time e g number of encounters this multi armed bandit model to the evolution of cooperation answers the question of how should an individual dedicate a defined amount of resources to different options when it cannot be sure what will come of i e which payoff pulling each one with the epsilon greedy algorithm as life and evolutionary time goes on and the individual is choosing different options it will get a sense of which choices are returning it with the highest reward however from time to time it will choose a random action just to make sure that it s not missing anything using this learning algorithm the individual converges to the optimal strategy in choosing between cooperation and selfishness credit

24711,across the tropics millions of rural families rely on non timber forest products for protein subsistence and other financial or cultural uses often communities exploit biotically dispersed trees and their mammalian or avian seed disperser empirical findings have indicated that many plant and animal resources are overexploited presenting challenges for biodiversity conservation and sustainable rural livelihoods however there has been limited research investigating the impacts of harvest that targets both seed dispersers and zoochoric trees we formulated a discrete time model for interacting

2013 models focused exclusively on animal harvest neglect the impact that reduced plant food or shelter resources may exert on disperser populations peres et al 2003 conversely models of plant harvest may fail to capture germination failure as disperser populations collapse caughlin et al 2015 granados et al 2017 to that end we modeled the harvesting and hunting dynamics of plants and their seed dispersers specifically we formulated a discrete time population model of co harvested plant disperser pairs a more holistic representation of the interactive effects of harvest on plant disperser pairs would provide greater insight for conservation management indeed such an approach would yield insights that a single species model may fail to produce an integrated framework would benefit conservation by anticipating and identifying species co management thresholds beyond these thresholds both species could be driven to deterministic extinction using our model we examine the following questions using the brazil nut agouti plant disperser pair as an illustrative example 1 what is the impact of different hunting and harvest regimes denoting animal hunting and plant ntfp harvest on long run plant disperser pair population sizes 2 for a specific set of biological life history parameters how could managers identify a sustainable harvest level for both species 3 for a given harvest regime how does the interaction strength between the pair affect long run population size 4 in this modeling framework which parameters exhibit the greatest importance 2 methods we now introduce our general modeling framework which can be used to simulate population dynamics of any interacting plant disperser pair in harvesting and hunting regimes we model the plant disperser harvest system using the population dynamics of the plant and its disperser and we introduce terms that represent both harvest rates we only consider animals mature enough to disperse seeds fig 1 presents an overview of the modeling framework that we used we chose to model a plant disperser harvesting system in discrete time time step one year our chosen time step corresponds to standard tropical plant monitoring protocols and existing plant projection matrices thus our approach can accommodate the vast majority of existing plant projection matrices the plant dynamics p eq 1 are given by a discrete time population projection matrix in this matrix α i represents the probability of survival within the same stage β i is the probability of transitioning to the next stage and ρ i is the number of seedlings stage 1 produced by each adult tree from stage i we incorporate the impact of seed dispersers denoted as n t on the plant population v t by including them as a parameter in p t 1 v t 1 p t n t v t p t α 1 0 ρ i g t g n t ρ n g t g n t β 1 α 2 0 0 0 β 2 0 0 α i s t 0 0 0 β i α n s t we represent plant harvesting as a reduced germination or fecundity rates e g from the removal of fruits b reduced survivorship probability for the adult plant e g damage sustained from bark harvest or c a combination of both thus plant harvest is represented by the multipliers g t fecundity multiplier and s t survivorship multiplier when g t s t 1 then the system s maximal germination and or adult survival rate is attained conversely when g t s t 0 these rates fall to 0 moreover we also model the effect of the seed disperser on fecundity with another scalar g n t for all three multipliers note that 0 g t s t g n t 1 we also extend this framework to incorporate plant density dependence allen 1989 see si section 1 1 for the model and analyses the disperser s population dynamics are given by discrete time logistic growth eq 2 hunting enters as a rate removing a proportion of the population r t ˆ which corresponds to how hunting rates are often quantified using interview data we then assume that plants affect faunal population dynamics by modifying their carrying capacity eq 3 sibly and hone 2002 2 n t 1 r m a x n t 1 n t k d f v a t n t 1 r t ˆ 0 if n t δ n t 0 we represent the impact of adult plants on disperser carrying capacity using the multiplier function 3 f v a t where v a t denotes the population of adult plants we restrict the multiplier to be 0 f v a t 1 so when f v a t 1 the carrying capacity of the seed disperser is at maximum and when f v a t 0 the carrying capacity is severely limited 2 1 functional forms relating plant disperser interactions in general empirical data that could be used to specify functional forms for g n t the impact of the disperser on plant germination rates and f v a t the impact of the adult plant population on disperser carrying capacity do not exist muller landau 2007 caughlin et al 2015 thus we specified functional forms to represent g n t and f v a t that accounted for 1 abundance function relationships and 2 species interactions as both g n t and f v a t 0 1 we used a sigmoid functional form denoted by f x as it is bound to the interval of 0 and 1 eq 4 4 f x 1 1 e q x x 0 for both g n t and f v a t the terms x 0 and q denote the midpoint of the sigmoid function and its steepness respectively for g n t we specified that the midpoint of this function x 0 would be half of the disperser s carrying capacity based on the assumption that germination would fall to half when the disperser is at k 2 note that in eq 4 q represents the steepness of the curve when q is large a small change in x here the disperser population size n t would result in excessively large changes to f x we chose a value for q that would make eq 4 roughly map the interval 0 k to 0 1 that is when there are no more seed dispersers n 0 then there would be no more germination f x n 0 on the other hand if the population of seed dispersers was at its carrying capacity n k then germination would be at its maximum f x n 1 to determine a suitable value of q we imposed the condition that f m k m for some m 0 1 this condition is equivalent to saying that if the animal population were at m proportion of its carrying capacity then germination would be at m proportion of its maximum thus 5 f m k m 6 m 1 1 e q m k k 2 7 q log 1 m log m m 1 2 k we included a term denoting the interaction strength δ 0 1 between the disperser and plant in ecology the term interaction strength connotes the degree to which one or more species is affected by changes in the abundance of other species with which it interacts such relationships are often quantified from time series data evaluating changes to population abundance or other functional outcomes wootton and emmerson 2005 a δ value of 0 indicates no dependence between the plant and the disperser perhaps corresponding to a pair of generalist species that do not rely on each other for long term persistence conversely δ 1 represents strong dependence which could correspond to specialist species that rely on a unique set of resources δ could be estimated from studies quantifying diet breadth or other metrics of ecological interaction between species by including the term 1 δ in eq 4 f x thus lies between 1 δ and 1 8 f x δ 1 e q x x 0 1 δ we used separate δ terms to describe the impact of the plant population on the disperser and that of the disperser on the plant δ d p represents the reliance of the plant on the seed disperser and δ p d the seed disperser s reliance on the plant for resources such as food or shelter incorporating these components produces the functional forms g n t the dispersers effect on plant fecundity and f v a t the effect of plants on disperser carrying capacity 9 g n t δ d p 1 e q p n t k d 2 1 δ d p 10 f v a t δ p d 1 e q d v a t k a 2 1 δ p d 11 where q i log 1 m log m m 1 2 k i where k d denotes the carrying capacity of the disperser and k a the equilibrium maximum population size of adult plants regarding the parameter m in fig 5 we observe that m generally has negligible effect on the long run behavior of the plant disperser system as long as m is within the interval 0 01 0 1 within this interval the sigmoid curve appears reasonable and outside the interval the sigmoid becomes too steep thus we chose a roughly midpoint value of 0 05 for m though it may not necessarily be better than other values of m in that interval 2 2 case study description and parameter estimation the brazil nut and agouti disperser pair are an excellent focal example to illustrate the model and its application for conservation management and sustainable use the brazil nut is a long lived tropical tree that produces large seeds encased in a hard woody capsule that is extremely difficult to extract pires 1984 mori and prance 1990 without a disperser to crack open the seed case the brazil nut seed experiences severely compromised germination rates peres et al 2003 the agouti and in particular the red rumped agouti dasyprocta leporina is one of the most effective dispersal agents for the brazil nut scoles and gribel 2012 peres and baider 1997 found that in the absence of agoutis the mortality rate for brazil nut seeds was 100 both brazil nuts and agoutis are harvested extensively contributing to local food intake and livelihoods in the brazilian amazon where the brazil nut and the agouti are widely distributed up to 8 million rural people may consume wild animals and agoutis are among the most intensely exploited species peres 2000 thomas et al 2015 brazil nut harvests are also important to rural communities contributing 14 43 of total household income for harvesters measured in 12 communities in bolivia and brazil duchelle et al 2011 to model this system we obtained a life history projection matrix p zuidema 2000 and field realistic model parameter values e g harvest rates for the brazil nut and agouti from several sources table 1 currently there exists no experimental approach to explicitly determine the dependence parameters of our model δ d p δ p d given our understanding of the high dependence of the brazil nut trees on the agouti as the primary seed disperser we assign δ d p 1 however the agouti is known to be a generalist seed disperser which can consume multiple food resources including brazil nuts thus we set δ p d 0 5 furthermore while there is limited evidence that traditional forms of brazil nut harvest e g collecting fallen fruits from the forest floor are highly deleterious to adult trees for other zoochoric trees with valuable fruits or nuts harvesters sometimes cause reduced adult survivorship from damage associated with bark removal or other intensive activities guedje et al 2007 gaoue and ticktin 2007 hence we assume a high adult survival rate for the brazil nut tree in our model 2 3 sensitivity analysis oftentimes tropical systems where plants and animals are both harvested exhibit extreme data paucity and uncertainty to evaluate the sensitivity of the model to its parameters we performed global sensitivity analysis using the fourier amplitude sensitivity test fast method to estimate sobol indices for the model parameters saltelli et al 1999 nossent et al 2011 the sobol index quantifies the contribution that any given parameter has on the variance of long run plant and animal populations that is it quantifies how important the parameter is to the persistence of the plant or animal more specifically the fast method calculates first order and total order sensitivity indices the first order indices show how the long run plant and disperser populations would change when perturbing one parameter at a time while the total order indices indicate the sensitivity when perturbing all the parameters at once and thus considers interaction effects with other parameters we used the fast99 function from the r package sensitivity saltelli et al 1999 iooss and lemaître 2015 iooss and janon 2019 to vary each parameter within its estimated range and generate the sobol indices 3 results 3 1 population persistence under varying harvest and hunting regimes we initially varied the harvest and hunting regime holding all other parameter values constant the term harvest regime or hunting regime denotes the combination of multipliers 0 1 that scaled plant survivorship and germination rates as well as a hunting rate which removed a proportion of the disperser population we found that high rates of harvesting drove the brazil nut agouti pair to extinction fig 2 given that the brazil nut is highly reliant on the agouti for seed dispersal we observed that even modest rates of plant harvest e g harvest 0 1 and extensive rates of hunting e g hunting 0 5 could drive the brazil nut to deterministic extinction λ 1 on the other hand the agouti population persisted even under a moderate rate of plant harvest our model indicated critical thresholds where the impact of the harvesting regime exhibited a discontinuity in its impact on the brazil nut and agouti populations we observed that under low harvesting and hunting rates the plant and disperser contour lines were non linear indicating the importance of both parameters on long run species pair dynamics 3 2 sustainable harvest hunting threshold level for plant disperser pair we used our model to estimate sustainable upper limits for harvesting regimes plant harvest and hunting rates below this threshold given the model dynamics the plant disperser pair should persist fig 3 our model indicated that the brazil nut s sustainable harvest regime threshold was lower than the agouti s k d 2 threshold given its complete dependence on agoutis for germination we observed distinct shifts in the sustainable threshold levels when altering harvest and hunting levels independently and when considering their combined effect on the persistence of the brazil nut and agouti population for more details see the supplementary figure s9 in general the model indicated that lower levels of inter dependence would correspond to higher limits for the sustainable harvest regime we also observe a region of high sensitivity in the disperser population graph around the harvest hunting value of 0 11 where small changes in harvest hunting result in large changes in long run disperser population fig 3 this corresponds to the threshold level of harvest hunting from the plant graph at which the average population growth rate is stable and not declining fig 3 a when the average growth rate λ is 1 then in our modeling framework the brazil nut population could support a large agouti population however when λ 1 then the brazil nut would exponentially decay to 0 which would permit only a fraction of the agouti population to persist based on δ p d 0 5 fig 3 b 3 3 the role of plant disperser interaction strength on population persistence we evaluated how the interaction strength between a plant disperser pair would affect long run population outcomes using a static set of values for the harvest regime fig 4 given a specific harvest regime a stronger species interaction was associated with more pronounced declines for the brazil nut and agouti the model indicated that when δ d p was low the impact of δ p d was less substantial particularly for the brazil nut population growth rate figs 4 a 4 b however we observed that larger δ d p values tended to exert a deleterious impact on both the brazil nut λ and the long run agouti abundance n disp even when δ p d values were low the effect of δ p d on the agouti population was more pronounced at moderate δ d p values conversely the brazil nut exhibited different dynamics based on its reliance on the agouti under low levels of δ d p the brazil nut s growth rate remained relatively constant and high across a wide range of interaction strengths specifically δ p d 0 1 when δ d p 0 4 however as δ d p increased we began to see interacting effects between δ p d and δ d p on the population growth rate of the brazil nut the plant growth rate was primarily affected by δ d p with δ p d mostly impacting plant growth during high values of δ d p this was not the case for the seed disperser s population which showed a more non linear pattern the combined effect of δ d p and δ p d exhibited a stronger interactive impact on the disperser population than on the stochastic growth rate of the brazil nut nevertheless when plant harvest rates were high the model indicated that δ d p did not significantly affect agouti equilibrium abundance supplementary figure s8 additionally in comparing the impacts of harvesting brazil nut fruits vs reducing adult survival we observed that fruit harvest reflected in decreased germination exhibited a much smaller effect on reducing long run population growth rate supplementary figure s10 3 4 quantifying the impact of parameter uncertainty and parameter importance the sobol variance based global sensitivity analysis indicated that s t impact of harvest on adult brazil nut tree survivorship was the most important factor influencing the brazil nut population both as an individual parameter and one interacting with other parameters in the system fig 5 first and total order sobol indices respectively subsequently the next most important parameters were g t germination rate δ d p reliance of the brazil nut on the agouti and r t ˆ the agouti hunting rate for the agouti while the hunting rate r t ˆ was generally the most critical variable the reliance of the agouti on the brazil nut δ p d was also a prominent variable brazil nut adult survivorship and the intrinsic rate of increase for the agouti population were also critical to long run agouti population size the total order sobol indices provide information on the relative importance of each parameter in concert with all of the other parameters under both the first and total order sobol indices hunting rate s t and the reliance of brazil nut on agouti δ d p were important factors we observed that δ d p had a greater contribution to the variation in long run population dynamics in the total order versus first order sobol indices this highlights that changes in δ d p have a much greater effect on long run plant population when coupled with changes in all other parameters indicating that δ d p interacts strongly with other parameters fig 5 total order index 4 discussion our study presents a mathematical framework that combines the effect of sub lethal plant harvest and hunting that targets animal seed dispersers using a case study of the brazil nut and agouti our model identified a sustainable rate of harvesting and hunting where both species could persist we found that the impacts of a harvesting regime were more deleterious when species interaction strength was greater all other things equal additionally we illustrated how researchers and practitioners could use the fourier amplitude sensitivity test to identify variable importance and estimate the effects of parameter uncertainty on long run population dynamics due to the agouti s ability to exploit plant resources beyond the brazil nut it could persist as long as the hunting rate was sufficiently low even under high levels of plant harvest however our model indicated that if the agouti was overexploited the brazil nut could not persist even under low plant harvest rates this was driven by the brazil nut s high reliance on the agouti peres et al 1997 haugaasen et al 2010 this prediction of our model aligns with empirical observations that suppressed agouti abundance due to hunting can severely disrupt brazil nut recruitment and population persistence peres et al 2003 kainer et al 2007 more generally the loss of mammalian dispersers can cause recruitment failure and the collapse of biotically dispersed tree populations jansen et al 2012 bello et al 2015 peres et al 2016 the global sensitivity analysis presented here can be used as a framework to determine the most sensitive parameters for prioritizing research and management effort our model indicates several key areas for future applied research on the brazil nut and agouti as adult survivorship under harvest and agouti hunting rate have the greatest impact on long term sustainability future researchers should carefully quantify these rates for prediction and management additionally within any brazil nut population our model indicates that preserving adult trees should be a high priority echoing previous findings peres et al 2003 kainer et al 2007 activities that substantially reduce adult survival such as deep cuts in adult trees for harvesters to climb up and extract fruit should be limited gaoue et al 2011 harvesting the brazil nut fruits had a much smaller effect supplementary figure s10 indicating that the harvest of brazil nuts could be sustainable if other factors such as the agouti hunting rate are controlled more generally our model predicted that under modest rates of hunting that did not completely remove the agouti the brazil nut population could persist under low to medium rates of harvest this model finding aligns with research across the amazon basin which has repeatedly found that brazil nut populations can be sustainably harvested when agoutis are present zuidema and boot 2002 wadt et al 2008 scoles and gribel 2012 similar to recent findings on wild animal harvest and based on our results we suggest that managers should prioritize controlling the rate of offtake targeting the disperser dirzo et al 2014 ripple et al 2015 yet so long as the disperser has some degree of reliance on the harvested plant ensuring a sustainable hunting rate alone is insufficient the plant harvest rate must also be below a specific threshold to ensure long run persistence of both species the model highlights the importance of considering species interactions as we found that greater interaction strength between the species pair tended to constrain the space of a sustainable harvesting hunting regime this finding reflects the mutualistic relationship between the seed disperser and plant that we considered wacker 1999 in other contexts such as terrestrial wildlife or fisheries management researchers have shown that moving beyond individual species is necessary as competitive predatory or other species interactions can dramatically affect the sustainable harvest level relative to a single species model damania et al 2003 baskett et al 2007 in fact samhouri et al 2017 show that recovery plans for overharvested species are more efficient when managers account for the interaction structure between co harvested species while our model provides a framework for understanding the impacts of harvested and hunted plant disperser pairs there are several limitations one limitation of our model is that we do not specify a dynamic harvesting regime that responds to different control measures such as penalties for over harvest or incentives for certain behaviors damania et al 2003 rowcliffe et al 2004 nielsen et al 2018 in the context of the brazil nut and agouti we caution that we used parameter values estimated across multiple sites and that for several of the model variables we were unable to find any estimates from the published or gray literatures we also note that estimating species interaction strength is often extremely challenging wootton and emmerson 2005 when the required data are available at a fine grained site level our model could be used to predict the impacts of harvesting and hunting plant disperser pairs allowing for more informed management decisions however under parameter uncertainty future researchers and managers could interrogate parameter uncertainty using the sensitivity analysis approach that we illustrated with our case study finally our model does not specify any density dependence for the plant species thus our model cannot be used to predict how harvesters would respond to different incentives or penalties which would in turn affect the harvesting and hunting offtake rates observed in the system recent findings in terrestrial harvesting highlights that harvester decision making and gear choices are critical to dictating the outcome of harvest rowcliffe et al 2004 levi et al 2011 moreover the values that harvesters hold such as the monetary value of harvested goods or the cultural or spiritual significance of certain harvesting practices can affect the sustainable level of harvest in non obvious ways kellner et al 2011 the results presented in this paper may serve as the basis for future work we note the importance of comparing the results of our simulations with previous and current practices to the best of our knowledge the time series data required to facilitate this comparison does not exist at present for the brazil nut and agouti future work may also include natural phenomena which has been left outside the scope of our research for example one could explore the impact of seed production variation across time and seed disperser satiation as a result of seed abundance additionally our model is spatially implicit in any specific setting mismatches or alignment between seed disperser movements harvester site selection and seed germination rates as a function of distance to the parent tree can all influence the sustainability of multi species harvest one avenue for future work would be to extend our model to a multi patch model to accommodate such dynamics in conclusion our model illustrates how to account for interacting species pairs when determining management decisions for harvested plants and dispersers in tropical systems our work shows that such an integrated approach identifies more conservative harvest thresholds to ensure species persistence credit authorship contribution statement kevin de angeli

24711,across the tropics millions of rural families rely on non timber forest products for protein subsistence and other financial or cultural uses often communities exploit biotically dispersed trees and their mammalian or avian seed disperser empirical findings have indicated that many plant and animal resources are overexploited presenting challenges for biodiversity conservation and sustainable rural livelihoods however there has been limited research investigating the impacts of harvest that targets both seed dispersers and zoochoric trees we formulated a discrete time model for interacting seed dispersers and plants under harvest we found that the more dependent species will dictate the sustainable threshold level of harvest and that higher levels of dependence could drive the species pair to local extinction we illustrated the application of sensitivity analysis to our modeling framework in order to facilitate future analyses and applications using this approach keywords quantitative ecology conservation science tropical forest coupled human natural systems harvesting model 1 introduction wild plants and animals are harvested across the world and in many cases provide an important source of food and livelihood gaoue 2016 nielsen et al 2018 fao 2019 yet there are widespread challenges to sustainable harvest presenting grave consequences for biodiversity conservation peres et al 2016 benítez lópez et al 2017 ecosystem function young et al 2016 and livelihoods fa et al 2002 golden et al 2011 these challenges are particularly notable in the tropics and sub tropics where reliance upon wild resources is highest milner gulland and bennett 2003 nielsen et al 2018 one key challenge facing managers is the absence of a framework to model and anticipate the impacts of harvesting that exploits both seed dispersers and plants morales et al 2003 soulé et al 2005 harvested species often include vertebrate seed dispersers as well as long lived tropical tree species that play critical roles in ecosystem function schmidt et al 2011 bello et al 2015 caughlin et al 2015 peres et al 2016 the loss of the largest animal dispersed trees and important vertebrate dispersers can have significant consequences for carbon sequestration osuri et al 2016 peres et al 2016 forest tree composition markl et al 2012 and predator prey interactions terborgh et al 2001 furthermore products derived from wildlife can be a critical source of nutrients and income generation particularly for poor and remote communities with limited access to alternatives fa et al 2002 nielsen et al 2018 thus understanding the circumstances under which wildlife and plant harvests are sustainable is of paramount importance to balance the needs of people and wildlife stakeholders concerned with managing natural resources ultimately need to understand the sustainability of harvest practices assessing sustainability is challenging and methods and models have been developed to deal with differing quality and availability of data on the harvest system weinbaum et al 2013 young et al 2016 where sustainability models have been applied they have often focused solely on either the animal harvest damania et al 2003 rowcliffe et al 2004 sirén et al 2004 levi et al 2011 or that of plant products e g fruit bark or roots ticktin 2004 gaoue and ticktin 2010 garcía et al 2016 yet in many tropical regions communities often harvest both fruiting trees and their disperser populations hereafter referred to as a plant disperser pair in tandem we model a two species non timber forest product ntfp harvest where components of a zoochoric plant are harvested and the plant s animal disperser is hunted examples of plant ntfps include the removal of foliage or bark for medicinal uses and fruit and nut harvest the term ntfp distinguishes this form of foliage bark and fruit harvest from timber extraction by logging notable examples of important harvested plant disperser pairs

questions using the brazil nut agouti plant disperser pair as an illustrative example 1 what is the impact of different hunting and harvest regimes denoting animal hunting and plant ntfp harvest on long run plant disperser pair population sizes 2 for a specific set of biological life history parameters how could managers identify a sustainable harvest level for both species 3 for a given harvest regime how does the interaction strength between the pair affect long run population size 4 in this modeling framework which parameters exhibit the greatest importance 2 methods we now introduce our general modeling framework which can be used to simulate population dynamics of any interacting plant disperser pair in harvesting and hunting regimes we model the plant disperser harvest system using the population dynamics of the plant and its disperser and we introduce terms that represent both harvest rates we only consider animals mature enough to disperse seeds fig 1 presents an overview of the modeling framework that we used we chose to model a plant disperser harvesting system in discrete time time step one year our chosen time step corresponds to standard tropical plant monitoring protocols and existing plant projection matrices thus our approach can accommodate the vast majority of existing plant projection matrices the plant dynamics p eq 1 are given by a discrete time population projection matrix in this matrix α i represents the probability of survival within the same stage β i is the probability of transitioning to the next stage and ρ i is the number of seedlings stage 1 produced by each adult tree from stage i we incorporate the impact of seed dispersers denoted as n t on the plant population v t by including them as a parameter in p t 1 v t 1 p t n t v t p t α 1 0 ρ i g t g n t ρ n g t g n t β 1 α 2 0 0 0 β 2 0 0 α i s t 0 0 0 β i α n s t we represent plant harvesting as a reduced germination or fecundity rates e g from the removal of fruits b reduced survivorship probability for the adult plant e g damage sustained from bark harvest or c a combination of both thus plant harvest is represented by the multipliers g t fecundity multiplier and s t survivorship multiplier when g t s t 1 then the system s maximal germination and or adult survival rate is attained conversely when g t s t 0 these rates fall to 0 moreover we also model the effect of the seed disperser on fecundity with another scalar g n t for all three multipliers note that 0 g t s t g n t 1 we also extend this framework to incorporate plant density dependence allen 1989 see si section 1 1 for the model and analyses the disperser s population dynamics are given by discrete time logistic growth eq 2 hunting enters as a rate removing a proportion of the population

hone 2002 2 n t 1 r m a x n t 1 n t k d f v a t n t 1 r t ˆ 0 if n t δ n t 0 we represent the impact of adult plants on disperser carrying capacity using the multiplier function 3 f v a t where v a t denotes the population of adult plants we restrict the multiplier to be 0 f v a t 1 so when f v a t 1 the carrying capacity of the seed disperser is at maximum and when f v a t 0 the carrying capacity is severely limited 2 1 functional forms relating plant disperser interactions in general empirical data that could be used to specify functional forms for g n t the impact of the disperser on plant germination rates and f v a t the impact of the adult plant population on disperser carrying capacity do not exist muller landau 2007 caughlin et al 2015 thus we specified functional forms to represent g n t and f v a t that accounted for 1 abundance function relationships and 2 species interactions as both g n t and f v a t 0 1 we used a sigmoid functional form denoted by f x as it is bound to the interval of 0 and 1 eq 4 4 f x 1 1 e q x x 0 for both g n t and f v a t the terms x 0 and q denote the midpoint of the sigmoid function and its steepness respectively for g n t we specified that the midpoint of this function x 0 would be half of the disperser s carrying capacity based on the assumption that germination would fall to half when the disperser is at k 2 note that in eq 4 q represents the steepness of the curve when q is large a small change in x here the disperser population size n t would result in excessively large changes to f x we chose a value for q that would make eq 4 roughly map the interval 0 k to 0 1 that is when there are no more seed dispersers n 0 then there would be no more germination f x n 0 on the other hand if the population of seed dispersers was at its carrying capacity n k then germination would be at its maximum f x n 1 to determine a suitable value of q we imposed the condition that f m k m for some m 0 1 this condition is equivalent to saying that if the animal population were at m proportion of its carrying capacity then germination would be at m proportion of its maximum thus 5 f m k m 6 m 1 1 e q m k k 2 7 q log 1 m log m m 1 2 k we included a term denoting the interaction strength δ 0 1 between the disperser and plant in ecology the term interaction strength connotes the degree to which one or more species is affected by changes in the abundance of other species with which it interacts such relationships are often quantified from time series data evaluating changes to population abundance or other functional outcomes wootton and emmerson 2005 a δ value of 0 indicates no dependence between the plant and the disperser perhaps corresponding to a pair of generalist species that do not rely on each other for long term persistence conversely δ 1 represents strong dependence which could correspond to specialist species that rely on a unique set of resources δ could be estimated from studies quantifying diet breadth or other metrics of ecological interaction between species by including the term 1 δ in eq 4 f x thus lies between 1 δ and 1 8 f x δ 1 e q x x 0 1 δ we used separate δ terms to describe the impact of the plant population on the disperser and that of the disperser on the plant δ d p represents the reliance of the plant on the seed disperser and δ p d the seed disperser s reliance on the plant for resources such as food or shelter incorporating these components produces the functional forms g n t the dispersers effect on plant fecundity and f v a t the effect of plants on disperser carrying capacity 9 g n t δ d p 1 e q p n t k d 2 1 δ d p 10 f v a t δ p d 1 e q d v a t k a 2 1 δ p d 11 where q i log 1 m log m m 1 2 k i where k d denotes the carrying capacity of the disperser and k a the equilibrium maximum population size of adult plants regarding the parameter m in fig 5 we observe that m generally has negligible effect on the long run behavior of the plant disperser system as long as m is within the interval 0 01 0 1 within this interval the sigmoid curve appears reasonable and outside the interval the sigmoid becomes too steep thus we chose a roughly midpoint value of 0 05 for m though it may not necessarily be better than other values of m in that interval 2 2 case study description and parameter estimation the brazil nut and agouti disperser pair are an excellent focal example to illustrate the model and its application for conservation management and sustainable use the brazil nut is a long lived tropical tree that produces large seeds encased in a hard woody capsule that is extremely difficult to extract pires 1984 mori and prance 1990 without a disperser to crack open the seed case the brazil nut seed experiences severely compromised germination rates peres et al 2003 the agouti and in particular the red rumped agouti dasyprocta leporina is one of the most effective dispersal agents for the brazil nut scoles and gribel 2012 peres and baider 1997 found that in the absence of agoutis the mortality rate for brazil nut seeds was 100 both brazil nuts and agoutis are harvested extensively contributing to local food intake and livelihoods in the brazilian amazon where the brazil nut and the agouti are widely distributed up to 8 million rural people may consume wild animals and agoutis are among the most intensely exploited species peres 2000 thomas et al 2015 brazil nut harvests are also important to rural communities contributing 14 43 of total household income for harvesters measured in 12 communities in bolivia and brazil duchelle et al 2011 to model this system we obtained a life history projection matrix p zuidema 2000 and field realistic model parameter values e g harvest rates for the brazil nut and agouti from several sources table 1 currently there exists no experimental approach to explicitly determine the dependence parameters of our model δ d p δ p d given our understanding of the high dependence of the brazil nut trees on the agouti as the primary seed disperser we assign δ d p 1 however the agouti is known to be a generalist seed disperser which can consume multiple food resources including brazil nuts thus we set δ p d 0 5 furthermore while there is limited evidence that traditional forms of brazil nut harvest e g collecting fallen fruits from the forest floor are highly deleterious to adult trees for other zoochoric trees with valuable fruits or nuts harvesters sometimes cause reduced adult survivorship from damage associated with bark removal or other intensive activities guedje et al 2007 gaoue and ticktin 2007 hence we assume a high adult survival rate for the brazil nut tree in our model 2 3 sensitivity analysis oftentimes tropical systems where plants and animals are both harvested exhibit extreme data paucity and uncertainty to evaluate the sensitivity of the model to its parameters we performed global sensitivity analysis using the fourier amplitude sensitivity test fast method to estimate sobol indices for the model parameters saltelli et al 1999 nossent et al 2011 the sobol index quantifies the contribution that any given parameter has on the variance of long run plant and animal populations that is it quantifies how important the parameter is to the persistence of the plant or animal more specifically the fast method calculates first order and total order sensitivity indices the first order indices show how the long run plant and disperser populations would change when perturbing one parameter at a time while the total order indices indicate the sensitivity when perturbing all the parameters at once and thus considers interaction effects with other parameters we used the fast99 function from the r package sensitivity saltelli et al 1999 iooss and lemaître 2015 iooss and janon 2019 to vary each parameter within its estimated range and generate the sobol indices 3 results 3 1 population persistence under varying harvest and hunting regimes we initially varied the harvest and hunting regime holding all other parameter values constant the term harvest regime or hunting regime denotes the combination of multipliers 0 1 that scaled plant survivorship and germination rates as well as a hunting rate which removed a proportion of the disperser population we found that high rates of harvesting drove the brazil nut agouti pair to extinction fig 2 given that the brazil nut is highly reliant on the agouti for seed dispersal we observed that even modest rates of plant harvest e g harvest 0 1 and extensive rates of hunting e g hunting 0 5 could drive the brazil nut to deterministic extinction λ 1 on the other hand the agouti population persisted even under a moderate rate of plant harvest our model indicated critical thresholds where the impact of the harvesting regime exhibited a discontinuity in its impact on the brazil nut and agouti populations we observed that under low harvesting and hunting rates the plant and disperser contour lines were non linear indicating the importance of both parameters on long run species pair dynamics 3 2 sustainable harvest hunting threshold level for plant disperser pair we used our model to estimate sustainable upper limits for harvesting regimes plant harvest and hunting rates below this threshold given the model dynamics the plant disperser pair should persist fig 3 our model indicated that the brazil nut s sustainable harvest regime threshold was lower than the agouti s k d 2 threshold given its complete dependence on agoutis for germination we observed distinct shifts in the sustainable threshold levels when altering harvest and hunting levels independently and when considering their combined effect on the persistence of the brazil nut and agouti population for more details see the supplementary figure s9 in general the model indicated that lower levels of inter dependence would correspond to higher limits for the sustainable harvest regime we also observe a region of high sensitivity in the disperser population graph around the harvest hunting value of 0 11 where small changes in harvest hunting result in large changes in long run disperser population fig 3 this corresponds to the threshold level of harvest hunting from the plant graph at which the average population growth rate is stable and not declining fig 3 a when the average growth rate λ is 1 then in our modeling framework the brazil nut population could support a large agouti population however when λ 1 then the brazil nut would exponentially decay to 0 which would permit only a fraction of the agouti population to persist based on δ p d 0 5 fig 3 b 3 3 the role of plant disperser interaction strength on population persistence we evaluated how the interaction strength between a plant disperser pair would affect long run population outcomes using a static set of values for the harvest regime fig 4 given a specific harvest regime a stronger species interaction was associated with more pronounced declines for the brazil nut and agouti the model indicated that when δ d p was low the impact of δ p d was less substantial particularly for the brazil nut population growth rate figs 4 a 4 b however we observed that larger δ d p values tended to exert a deleterious impact on both the brazil nut λ and the long run agouti abundance n disp even when δ p d values were low the effect of δ p d on the agouti population was more pronounced at moderate δ d p values conversely the brazil nut exhibited different dynamics based on its reliance on the agouti under low levels of δ d p the brazil nut s growth rate remained relatively constant and high across a wide range of interaction strengths specifically δ p d 0 1 when δ d p 0 4 however as δ d p increased we began to see interacting effects between δ p d and δ d p on the population growth rate of the brazil nut the plant growth rate was primarily affected by δ d p with δ p d mostly impacting plant growth during high values of δ d p this was not the case for the seed disperser s population which showed a more non linear pattern the combined effect of δ d p and δ p d exhibited a stronger interactive impact on the disperser population than on the stochastic growth rate of the brazil nut nevertheless when plant harvest rates were high the model indicated that δ d p did not significantly affect agouti equilibrium abundance supplementary figure s8 additionally in comparing the impacts of harvesting brazil nut fruits vs reducing adult survival we observed that fruit harvest reflected in decreased germination exhibited a much smaller effect on reducing long run population growth rate supplementary figure s10 3 4 quantifying the impact of parameter uncertainty and parameter importance the sobol variance based global sensitivity analysis indicated that s t impact of harvest on adult brazil nut tree survivorship was the most important factor influencing the brazil nut population both as an individual parameter and one interacting with other parameters in the system fig 5 first and total order sobol indices respectively subsequently the next most important parameters were g t germination rate δ d p reliance of the brazil nut on the agouti and r t ˆ the agouti hunting rate for the agouti while the hunting rate r t ˆ was generally the most critical variable the reliance of the agouti on the brazil nut δ p d was also a prominent variable brazil nut adult survivorship and the intrinsic rate of increase for the agouti population were also critical to long run agouti population size the total order sobol indices provide information on the relative importance of each parameter in concert with all of the other parameters under both the first and total order sobol indices hunting rate s t and the reliance of brazil nut on agouti δ d p were important factors we observed that δ d p had a greater contribution to the variation in long run population dynamics in the total order versus first order sobol indices this highlights that changes in δ d p have a much greater effect on long run plant population when coupled with changes in all other parameters indicating that δ d p interacts strongly with other parameters fig 5 total order index 4 discussion our study presents a mathematical framework that combines the effect of sub lethal plant harvest and hunting that targets animal seed dispersers using a case study of the brazil nut and agouti our model identified a sustainable rate of harvesting and hunting where both species could persist we found that the impacts of a harvesting regime were more deleterious when species interaction strength was greater all other things equal additionally we illustrated how researchers and practitioners could use the fourier amplitude sensitivity test to identify variable importance and estimate the effects of parameter uncertainty on long run population dynamics due to the agouti s ability to exploit plant resources beyond the brazil nut it could persist as long as the hunting rate was sufficiently low even under high levels of plant harvest however our model indicated that if the agouti was overexploited the brazil nut could not persist even under low plant harvest rates this was driven by the brazil nut s high reliance on the agouti peres et al 1997 haugaasen et al 2010 this prediction of our model aligns with empirical observations that suppressed agouti abundance due to hunting can severely disrupt brazil nut recruitment and population persistence peres et al 2003 kainer et al 2007 more generally the loss of mammalian dispersers can cause recruitment failure and the collapse of biotically dispersed tree populations jansen et al 2012 bello et al 2015 peres et al 2016 the global sensitivity analysis presented here can be used as a framework to determine the most sensitive parameters for prioritizing research and management effort our model indicates several key areas for future applied research on the brazil nut and agouti as adult survivorship under harvest and agouti hunting rate have the greatest impact on long term sustainability future researchers should carefully quantify these rates for prediction and management additionally within any brazil nut population our model indicates that preserving adult trees should be a high priority echoing previous findings peres et al 2003 kainer et al 2007 activities that substantially reduce adult survival such as deep cuts in adult trees for harvesters to climb up and extract fruit should be limited gaoue et al 2011 harvesting the brazil nut fruits had a much smaller effect supplementary figure s10 indicating that the harvest of brazil nuts could be sustainable if other factors such as the agouti hunting rate are controlled more generally our model predicted that under modest rates of hunting that did not completely remove the agouti the brazil nut population could persist under low to medium rates of harvest this model finding aligns with research across the amazon basin which has repeatedly found that brazil nut populations can be sustainably harvested when agoutis are present zuidema and boot 2002 wadt et al 2008 scoles and gribel 2012 similar to recent findings on wild animal harvest and based on our results we suggest that managers should prioritize controlling the rate of offtake targeting the disperser dirzo et al 2014 ripple et al 2015 yet so long as the disperser has some degree of reliance on the harvested plant ensuring a sustainable hunting rate alone is insufficient the plant harvest rate must also be below a specific threshold to ensure long run persistence of both species the model highlights the importance of considering species interactions as we found that greater interaction strength between the species pair tended to constrain the space of a sustainable harvesting hunting regime this finding reflects the mutualistic relationship between the seed disperser and plant that we considered wacker 1999 in other contexts such as terrestrial wildlife or fisheries management researchers have shown that moving beyond individual species is necessary as competitive predatory or other species interactions can dramatically affect the sustainable harvest level relative to a single species model damania et al 2003 baskett et al 2007 in fact samhouri et al 2017 show that recovery plans for overharvested species are more efficient when managers account for the interaction structure between co harvested species while our model provides a framework for understanding the impacts of harvested and hunted plant disperser pairs there are several limitations one limitation of our model is that we do not specify a dynamic harvesting regime that responds to different control measures such as penalties for over harvest or incentives for certain behaviors damania et al 2003 rowcliffe et al 2004 nielsen et al 2018 in the context of the brazil nut and agouti we caution that we used parameter values estimated across multiple sites and that for several of the model variables we were unable to find any estimates from the published or gray literatures we also note that estimating species interaction strength is often extremely challenging wootton and emmerson 2005 when the required data are available at a fine grained site level our model could be used to predict the impacts of harvesting and hunting plant disperser pairs allowing for more informed management decisions however under parameter uncertainty future researchers and managers could interrogate parameter uncertainty using the sensitivity analysis approach that we illustrated with our case study finally our model does not specify any density dependence for the plant species thus our model cannot be used to predict how harvesters would respond to different incentives or penalties which would in turn affect the harvesting and hunting offtake rates observed in the system recent findings in terrestrial harvesting highlights that harvester decision making and gear choices are critical to dictating the outcome of harvest rowcliffe et al 2004 levi et al 2011 moreover the values that harvesters hold such as the monetary value of harvested goods or the cultural or spiritual significance of certain harvesting practices can affect the sustainable level of harvest in non obvious ways kellner et al 2011 the results presented in this paper may serve as the basis for future work we note the importance of comparing the results of our simulations with previous and current practices to the best of our knowledge the time series data required to facilitate this comparison does not exist at present for the brazil nut and agouti future work may also include natural phenomena which has been left outside the scope of our research for example one could explore the impact of seed production variation across time and seed disperser satiation as a result of seed abundance additionally our model is spatially implicit in any specific setting mismatches or alignment between seed disperser movements harvester site selection and seed germination rates as a function of distance to the parent tree can all influence the sustainability of multi species harvest one avenue for future work would be to extend our model to a multi patch model to accommodate such dynamics in conclusion our model illustrates how to account for interacting species pairs when determining management decisions for harvested plants and dispersers in tropical systems our work shows that such an integrated approach identifies more conservative harvest thresholds to ensure species persistence credit authorship contribution statement kevin de angeli

24712,we have used the coverages of renewable emergy input developed from satellite derived data to determine the emergy supporting ecosystem productivity and biotic natural capital in addition the impact on global productivity and biotic natural capital that has resulted from human induced land cover change was evaluated the actual evapotranpiration aet which is the portion of rain that is used by vegetation was the most significant driver of ecosystems however the accumulation of biomass over time is not only affected by the available water used but also by solar input and negatively affected by wind additionally we have estimated the value of ecosystem function and storages in pre anthroponcene era total annual emdollar value of global gross primary production was em 12 3 trillion and the total emdollar value of biotic natural capital which includes below and above ground biomass as well as the soil carbon was em 578 5 trillion however total losses of biotic natural capital from land cover change since the anthropocene began equal to em 88 5 trillion or about 16 of total pre anthropocene value keywords emergy gis renewable energy ecosystem productivity biotic natural capital 1 introduction recently there has been much attention given to valuing ecosystems based on their service contributions to humans under the rubric of ecosystem services in this study we discard the term ecosystem services in favor of ecosystem functions biological geochemical and physical processes that take place within an ecosystem that global ecosystems perform we draw a distinction between services a truly anthropogenic term i e services to whom and functions the naturally occurring processes of ecosystems that support not only humans but also the biosphere as a whole by separating these two concepts issues of anthropocentrism are minimized services are things that human value and benefit from which can be evaluated based on human preferences or technological expenditures to replace them ecosystem functions on the other hand are not easily valued within a human value system for they have no markets and people do not know what they are worth violating the two basic tenets of economic valuation a functioning market and perfect information therefore to better estimate the value of ecosystem function a donor determined value such as emergy can be used emergy is the available energy of one kind previously used up directly and indirectly to make a service or product odum 1996 1988 1 1 emergy basis for global ecosystem global ecosystems are driven by a tripartite combination of renewable emergy that has been termed the geobiosphere emergy baseline or geb brown et al 2016 brown and ulgiati 2016a brown and ulgiati 2010 composed of solar radiation tidal momentum absorbed by the earth and relic geothermal energy from within the planet partitioning of the geb between the countless physical and ecological systems of earth has become increasingly important as more and more emphasis has been placed on understanding and quantifying global flows of renewable resources supporting humanity at the global scale figure 1 the primary emergy of the geb is partitioned into secondary precipitation and wind and tertiary chemical and geo potentials of runoff ocean currents renewable flows brown and ulgiati 2016b it is the geb that supported all life on earth through millions of years of planetary evolution developing ecosystems hydrologic systems and atmospheric systems and the interconnections between them it is the amalgamation of the primary flows of the geb with the secondary and tertiary renewable flows that provides the emergy basis for ecosystem structure and functions measuring the emergy basis of global ecosystems will provide necessary quantification for determining global values of ecosystem structure and functions 1 2 emergy and ecosystem development a main theoretical paradigm of energy systems theory odum 2007 1996 1994 1983 is that the quantity and quality of a system s output is directly related to the quantity of available energy of its inputs with one caveat if the inputs are too energetic output may diminish as a result of induced stresses from an emergy perspective theory suggests that with increased inputs of emergy ecosystems should have higher productivities and produce greater quantities of biomass also subject to the above mentioned caveat on the other hand productivity may be enhanced less by the total emergy input and instead output maybe maximized with an appropriate mix of different emergy inputs emergy signature 1 1 emergy signature is the characteristic distribution of quantities of emergy among inputs to a system in an amalgamation of primary secondary and tertiary renewable sources we next review the literature regarding evaluations of global ecosystems and biomes beginning with economic evaluations and ending with emergy evaluations of biomes 1 3 economic evaluations of global ecosystem the value of global ecosystems was estimated by costanza et al 1997 updated in 2011 costanza et al 2014 and recently future values were modeled kubiszewski et al 2017 based on economic valuation techniques the original paper costanza et al 1997 valued the earth s ecosystem services at 33 trillion per year in 2014 costanza et al 2014 re evaluated their earlier estimate placing it at 145 trillion they then valued global ecosystem services in 2011 as 125 trillion per year suggesting a 20 trillion decrease between 1997 and 2011 the 2011 value was used as the baseline for the future projections by kubiszewski et al 2017 which resulted in projections between a decline of 51 trillion per year and an increase of 30 trillion per year depending on the future scenario using the global land cover dataset and the ecosystem service values from costanza et al 1997 patterns of conventional gdp and the value of non marketed ecosystem services were spatially analyzed 1 km2 resolution by sutton and costanza 2002 to estimate the total value of the ecosystem services of the lands and waters of each nation several indices gross domestic product ecosystems services product subtotal ecological economic product ecosystem product were calculated for each square kilometer of land surface and then aggregated for each nation of the world indices were compared to the environmental sustainability index and the ecological footprint index de groot et al 2012 using a database of value estimates from literature sources provided an overview of the value of 10 main earth biomes in monetary units they did not attempt to sum values of biomes to provide a global value but did provide mean minimum and maximum values for each on a hectare basis mean values ranged from int 490 ha 1 yr 1 for the open ocean to int 350 000 ha 1 yr 1 for coral reefs the dynamics of seven ecosystem services were modeled globally using a stella model named gumbo global unified metamodel of the biosphere across eleven biomes by boumans et al 2002 a range of five future scenarios representing base case and four future scenarios the relative value of ecosystem services was estimated to be about 4 5 times the value of gross world product gwp in the year 2000 on the other hand alexander et al 1998 investigated several approaches for valuing global ecosystem services instead of using willingness to pay wtp or other value transfer methods the global ecosystem was assumed to be owned by a monopolist who was charging the population for the services their estimates indicated that global ecosystem services are worth between 44 and 88 of the global gdp patterson 2002 used ecological pricing theory applied to the valuation of biosphere processes and services in 1994 and obtained a total value of primary ecological services to be nearly us 25 trillion ecological prices measure value of nature in terms of the biophysical interdependencies in the system ultimately quantifying how much value is contributed to an ecological commodity e g plant biomass by another commodity in this case solar energy in the system 1 5 emergy evaluations of global ecosystems while there many papers that use the emergy method to assess the value of ecosystem services of small scale systems we restrict our review here to those that are large in scale such as global systems or biomes brown and ulgiati 1999 estimated the emergy value of the earth s natural capital environmental resources including freshwater soil organic matter and plant and animal biomass totaling 575 e 25 sej or 5 3 e 15 based on 1998 dollars water and soil organic matter were responsible for 51 and 40 of the total emergy value respectively using economic values of ecosystem services from sutton and costanza 2002 coscieme et al 2014 derived emergy money ratios for ecosystem services for countries calculating values that varied between 2 02 e 11 sej 1 and 6 82 e 11 sej 1 values equal to 1 to 2 orders of magnitude lower than the emergy money ratio of the country when non renewable emergy is included they suggested that this difference means that ecosystems can provide services at much lower costs than the economy can lu et al 2017 computed the donor value of the subtropical forests in southeast china by using emergy analysis and compared it with the receiver value estimated by monetary value to estimate the efficiency of different types of ecosystem their result revealed that forests and plantations had 2 orders of magnitude higher efficiency than the current chinese economic system in providing service showing the importance of afforestation rugani et al 2014 estimated the solar energy demand sed annual emergy used in luxembourg from 1995 to 2009 the sed of luxembourg was 23 times larger on average than all of the free energy raw materials and natural cycles associated with the territorial system of luxembourg choi 2010 has estimated the emergy values of terrestrial plants using annual emergy input npp and phytomass transformity of annual increment of phytomass was computed by dividing the emergy input by the dry mass of annual npp to compute the emergy of biomass storage choi multiplied standing stock by the transformity of npp not recognizing that the transformity of npp is not an appropriate transformity for biomass which is an accumulation of annual npp over the biomass turnover time recently yang et al 2020 conducted an emergy based ecosystem service valuation of china s grasslands by spatially analyzing the emergy values of provisioning regulating cultural and supporting services of china s grasslands zhang et al 2019 evaluated the ecosystem services of tidal wetlands fresh water wetlands and agricultural systems of chongming island in eastern china using emergy yang et al 2019 used emergy to evaluate ecosystem services of aquatic systems of china xu et al 2020 evaluated the changes in ecosystem services in northwestern china before and after the conversion of a desert shrub system to a plantation system based on emergy analysis sun et al 2018 estimated marine ecosystem services values in 11 coastal provinces and cities of china from 2005 to 2014 and then analyzed the changes in services values across the different regions and across time in 2012 campbell and brown using the emergy approach estimated the value of ecosystem service provided by the national forests managed by the us forest service usfs to be em 197 billion emdollars in 2005 and its natural capital to be em 24 3 trillion campbell and brown 2012 they used the ecosystem service categories suggested in millennium ecosystems assessment 2005 which categorizes ecosystem services into 4 main categories of provisioning services regulating services supporting services and cultural services campbell and tilley 2014 computed biophysical quantities for the yearly provision of ecosystem services from a typical hectare of forest in maryland and converted them to emergy by multiplying by the solar equivalent exergy see 2 2 solar equivalent exergy is computed as an equivalence between solar energy and the other exergy sources comprising the geb tidal and geothermal recognizing that these independent sources driving the geobiosphere are not transformations of solar energy as was discussed by brown et al 2016 required per biophysical unit of exergy the quantity of ecosystem services was assessed for the national economy and national ecosystem mosaic of brazil in historical series 1981 2011 giannetti et al 2017 showing that the contributions from renewable sources have fallen from about 75 of the total economy in 1981 to about 20 in 2011 almeida et al 2018 assessed the ecosystems service of urban parks by accounting climate regulation evapotranspiration and co2 sequestration water regulation water retention in soil and supporting service net primary production they considered evapotranspiration and co2 sequestration as a co product while considering climate regulation and water regulation as a split emergy of ecosystem service in regions of china have been done by several authors dong et al 2012 2014 ma et al 2015 sun et al 2018 wang et al 2019 these studies selected a few services from the ecosystem service categories suggested in millennium ecosystems assessment 2005 and summed the emergy value of each service estimated by multiplying the products e g energy of evapotranspired water energy of biomass in net primary production with its unit emergy values uevs from other studies 1 6 summary of global evaluations all in all while emergy has been applied to evaluation of numerous ecosystems and regions only one attempt has previously been made to evaluate global ecosystems using emergy brown and ulgiati 1999 in that study the emergy of global natural capital was estimated on the basis of assessments of total mass of soil organic matter fresh surface and ground water and animal and plant biomass that study did not evaluate the spatial distribution of natural capital only relying on global estimates of mass several studies have been completed using a variety of economic methods to estimate the value of global ecosystem services to humans including at least one spatial analysis these studies did not evaluate ecosystem functions per se but rather ecosystem services this is not a criticism of economic valuation only to say that they did not evaluate ecosystem functions in general few previous studies whether economic or emergy evaluations have valued functions instead they have focused on services to our knowledge there have been no economic evaluations of global natural capital even though at least one of the global papers costanza et al 1997 included the term in its title in this study we answer the following questions using emergy and gis data sets 1 what is the emergy supporting global ecosystems biomes 2 what is the emergy of global ecosystem biomass and soil carbon 3 do ecosystems maximize total emergy or is maximum productivity and biomass the result of the interplay of the suite of renewable emergy sources what is the impact on global productivity gpp and biotic natural capital bnc that has resulted from human induced land cover change combined these questions are intended to facilitate a better understanding of some very fundamental questions assertions and suppositions of emergy theory the first question above relates to a fundamental question how to evaluate ecosystems and their properties we suggest that evaluation using emergy leads one to distinctly separate ecosystem services from ecosystem functions in order to answer what is the emergy of ecosystem functions we must answer the first question above what is the emergy supporting global ecosystem productivity according to emergy accounting procedures the emergy of productivity is equal to the emergy driving the system thus by evaluating the emergy driving the global biomes we have identified the emergy of all functions of these biomes the second question above relates to the assertion that the value of a stored product is the emergy required to produce it thus evaluating the driving emergy question 1 is essential to answering this question along with the knowledge of the turnover time of the stored product as a consequence the most valuable stored resource is not always the result of the largest driving energy but can be the largest because of a longer generation time with this quantitative understanding of donor value comparisons can be made and policies directed to better serve global sustainability objectives the third question relates to a supposition that the structure and productivity of systems is directly proportional to the emergy driving the system i e the more emergy the more productive the more emergy the larger structure can be supported numerous researchers have suggested that systems may not respond to total emergy but instead produce maximum production and structure from the interplay of suite of input energies brown et al 2006 ulgiati and brown 2009 ulgiati et al 2011 with this data set we are better positioned to confirm that supposition but unfortunately it leads to still another quandary if systems produce maximum productivity or biomass that is a function of the emergy signature rather than the quantity of driving emergy then evaluating ecosystem functions based on the driving emergy in a static accounting may not be appropriate instead it may be that dynamic evaluations must be conducted rather than static ones that assume steady state conditions but this is a topic for another paper the fourth question relates to an overall concern regarding human sustainability on planet earth how far down the path of unstainable development have we gone tracking anthropogenic alteration in a quantitative manner can provide benchmarks of human destruction of planetary ecosystems or progress if we begin to regenerate natural systems tracking both biomass and productivity losses provide needed benchmarks that offer information on the flows and storages of ecosystems with which appropriate sustainable policy can be generated 2 methods in this study we used gis and the emergy analysis method to compute values of global ecosystem functions ef and biotic natural capital bnc 3 3 we use the term biotic natural capital to refer to above and below ground biomass and soil organic matter as carbon of ecosystems to distinguish them from other natural capital such as minerals fossil fuels water etc emergy values of annual ef of global biomes were computed by using the renewable emergy coverages developed in lee and brown 2019 and a global biome boundary coverage olson et al 2001 at 10 arc minute resolution the emergy values of bnc were computed using biomass estimates of major biomes gibbs 2006 and a soil carbon coverage produced by the oak ridge national laboratory usa ruesch and gibbs 2008 the most recent global emergy baseline geb 12 0 e 24 sej yr 1 brown et al 2016 was used as the basis from which all unit emergy values were computed 2 1 biome categorization shown in figure 2 is the biome and habitat classification scheme used in this study olson et al 2001 delineated 14 biomes as well as lakes and ice rocky areas and ocean we added estuaries and rivers to their biome coverage yielding a total of 19 distinct habitats the boundary data of estuaries was derived from the sea around us project alder 2003 the river habitat based on stream order higher than six vanote et al 1980 was developed using the flow accumulation routine in arcgis and assigning any 10 arc minute cell with stream order greater than 6 as river habitat 2 2 estimating driving emergy of biomes and habitats emergy of biomes was evaluated by clipping global renewable emergy coverages lee and brown 2019 with a global biome coverage in all there were 9 renewable emergy coverages solar geothermal tidal wind rain chemical potential actual evapotranspiration aet runoff chemical potential runoff geopotential and water chemical potential the water chemical potential coverage was computed as the sum of aet and runoff chemical potential a final coverage of renewable emergy inputs was produced by applying the max renewable algorithm from brown and ulgiati 2016a on a biome basis as follows r m a x m a x s t g w p r g p h 2 o c p the max renewable algorithm was used to minimize double counting of renewable sources the computation was done in the following order first each of the 9 renewable emergy inputs was summed on a cell by cell basis within each biome yielding a total renewable emergy for each input within each biome then the max renewable algorithm was computed at the biome level based on the totals of each input yielding the maximum renewable input maxr for each biome once annual maxr inputs for each biome were derived from the coverages of renewable emergy inputs biome aerial empower intensity aei was computed by dividing by the area of each biome additionally the annual maxr was used to compute the input to biome gpp and biomass 2 3 estimating gpp of biomes and habitats nasa s land processes distributed active archive center lp daac developed the terra modis npp and gpp product mod17a3 which provides yearly average global npp and gpp in 30 arc second resolution zhao et al 2005 total annual global gpp was used as the total work performed by global biomes a coverage of average global gpp for the year 2001 2003 is provided in the supplemental material figure s 2 since these data included areas of land that were occupied by human dominated uses it was necessary to evaluate pre anthropocene gpp by removing all cells that were within agricultural and urban classifications using the anthropogenic biome data ellis 2015 ellis et al 2010 ellis and ramankutty 2008 all cells that were occupied by their land cover classifications that were primarily urban built up and agricultural details are provided in supplemental material were removed the remaining cells were then clipped with the biome coverage and an average gpp per unit area was computed by summing the gpp of all cells and dividing by the area of those cells the concept of anthropocene has evolved since it was first proposed crutzen 2002 however this study uses the european industrial resolution as a turning point between pre anthropocene and anthropocene brondizio et al 2016 since the gpp data from nasa only contained the data for terrestrial biomes it was necessary to add data for land cover classes not included by the nasa data terrestrial biome data was augmented with gpp data from whittaker and likens 1975 for river 0 25 kg c m 2yr 1 lake 0 25 kg c m 2yr 1 estuary 1 5 kg c m 2yr 1 and ocean 0 13 kg c m 2yr 1 2 4 estimating biotic natural capital bnc of biomes and habitats we considered two aspects of bnc biomass sum of above and below ground and soil carbon first we compute bnc for the earth during the pre anthropocene and second we subtract areas of urban and agriculture ellis 2015 to compute the change as of 2010 methods and data sources for biomass and soil carbon are given next 2 4 1 biomass whittaker and likens 1975 provided one of the first comprehensive estimates of global biomass followed by olson et al 1985 who developed a database of carbon in live vegetation above and below ground in major world ecosystems gibbs 2006 updated olson s database using more contemporary land cover conditions of the global land cover database glc2000 based on vega 2000 dataset from spot 4 satellite in this study we used gibbs 2006 data combined with data from both whittaker and likens 1975 and olson et al 1985 to develop the biomass data listed in the final column of table 1 to yield a global coverage of above and below ground biomass kg c m 2 for each 10 arc minute cell of the biomes figure s 3 supplemental material 2 4 2 soil carbon soil carbon figure s 4 supplemental material was derived from the international geosphere biosphere program data and information system igbp dis coverage at a resolution of 5 arc minute global soil data task group 2000 the data were clipped using the global biome coverage to yield total soil carbon for each biome 2 5 emergy of biotic natural capital emergy value of biotic natural capital of each biome was computed from the biome s annual emergy input and turn over time of the soil and biomass compartments 2 5 1 biomass the annual emergy input for each 10 arc minute cell was derived from the emergy coverages as outlined above turnover time of biome biomass was estimated using a autocatalytic simulation model odum and odum 2000 and emergy input lee and brown 2019 the supplemental material provides details of the simulation model total emergy of biomass was computed as the product of annual emergy input and turnover time 2 5 2 soil carbon the international geosphere biosphere program data and information system igbp dis provided 5 arc minute resolution global surface data for soil carbon density kg c m 2 turnover time of soil carbon was derived from literature estimates raich and schlesinger 1992 the emergy of soil carbon of each biome was computed by multiplying the emergy input by soil carbon turnover time 2 6 analyzing relation between gpp and biomass to driving emergy to answer the question pertaining to the relation between emergy and productivity and standing stock the relations were tested using simple linear regression multiple regression and classification and regression trees cart first scatter plots of the data were developed which showed that aet and maxr had the greatest promise to predict gpp and biomass then simple linear regressions of aet vs biomass aet vs gpp maxr vs biomass and maxr vs gpp were conducted to test if additional forms of driving emergy might help to explain some of the error in the simple regressions multiple regressions on gpp and biomass were conducted using all the input emergy forms aet solar rain wind geothermal and maxr finally classification regression trees cart were constructed using the driving emergy sources solar geothermal wind rain and aet as drivers of gpp and biomass of biomes to create models that predict gpp and biomass during the analysis of the relation between driving emergy and gpp and biomass we observed that there appeared to be differences in the variance between the same biomes on different continents ultimately the idea was that instead of classifying the geobiosphere into 16 biomes a more fine grained approach might be warranted as a result the global coverages were reclassified into biomes by continent and then a t test of the differences in mean values of aet and maxr between the same biomes on different continents was conducted see supplemental material under the null hypothesis that the means were the same 2 7 estimating the global impacts of land cover change to estimate the changes in gpp and biotic natural capital that has resulted from human induced land cover change we used the coverage of anthropogenic biomes ellis 2015 ellis et al 2010 ellis and ramankutty 2008 the change in above and below ground biomass was computed by subtracting all areas occupied by urban settlements and villages croplands and populated rangelands to estimate the change in gpp we used the most recent data from the terra modis npp and gpp product zhao et al 2005 and compared these data to the constructed gpp coverage as outlined above the difference between the two coverages represents the net effect on global gpp we report the data on a biome by biome basis to estimate the changes in gpp and biotic natural capital that have resulted from human induced land cover change we used the coverage of anthropogenic biomes ellis 2015 the change in above and below ground biomass was computed by subtracting all areas occupied by urban settlements and villages croplands and populated rangelands to estimate the change in gpp we used the most recent data from the terra modis npp and gpp product zhao et al 2005 and compared these data to the constructed gpp coverage as outlined above the difference between the two coverages represents the net effect on global gpp we report the data on a biome by biome basis to compute the change in biomass the following assumptions were made first it was assumed that 100 of above and belowground biomass was removed from forested lands that were occupied by anthropogenic land cover second 50 of above and belowground biomass was removed from grassland and scrub biomes that were occupied by anthropogenic land cover the change in soil carbon was estimated based on the data and analysis of sanderman et al 2017 where they found that 133 pgc have been lost due to soil erosion across nearly all biomes the total loss of carbon 133 pgc was proportioned between each of the biomes based on the percent change of land cover within each biome finally the emdollar value of the losses was estimated by converting biomass and soil carbon to emergy see above for the method of computing emergy of bnc and then dividing by a global emergy dollar ratio of 2 0 e 12 sej the purpose of this study is to estimate the emergy value of ecosystem functions however to make it easier to sense the magnitude of these values we also present the results as emdollars using the average global conversion factor emergy money ratio 3 results 3 1 empower of global biomes given in table 2 are the renewable inputs to global biomes starred values in the table are the maxr values for each system the dominant emergy sources for a majority of the biomes is water chemical potential sum of aet and runoff chemical potential wind is the largest input in montane grasslands shrublands tundra deserts xeric shrublands and rock ice biomes rivers are dominated by runoff geopotential figure 3 shows graphs of emergy signatures for the global biomes ocean is not included wind and rain dominate the renewable inputs in almost all biomes rivers are the exception where runoff geopotential is the dominant input of interest is the three largest inputs to estuaries rainfall runoff chemical and geopotential emergy as might be expected after analysis of the global data revealed differences in empower driving biomes on different continents we analyzed maxr for biomes by continent a global coverage of the continental boundaries is given in figure s 8 supplemental material figure 4 summarizes the continental maxr data for each of the biomes the data indicated some interesting outcomes specifically note that the oceanic continent composed primarily of australia has the largest difference from the global mean data and the largest standard deviation for most biomes except for the desert and shrubland biome this may be due to the fact that more than half of the australian landcover consists of desert and shrubland while other biomes are in small sizes and fragmented which is likely to result in larger standard deviation 3 2 aerial empower intensity of global biomes summarized in table 3 is the aerial empower intensity aei of the global biomes computed by dividing the biome empower by the area of each biome estuaries have the highest aei of all biomes followed by rivers and then tropical subtropical moist forests estuaries possess an aei that is over 8x the aei of tropical subtropical moist forests the result of the very large input of chemical potential energy of terrestrial runoff not surprising is the fact that rivers have a large aei due to the geopotential energy of runoff that is concentrated within the river systems of the globe 3 3 biome gpp and biotic natural capital table 4 and figure 5 summarize pre anthropocene gpp and biomass for global biomes of the total terrestrial gpp 122 7 pgc yr 1 the largest single contribution is from tropical and subtropical moist forests 48 5 pgc yr 1 followed by tropical and subtropical grass schrublands savannas 22 5 pgc yr 1 the computed global gpp of 122 7 pgc yr 1 was within 2 of the total 125 pgc yr 1 suggested by zhang et al 2017 when expressed on an areal basis the most productive biomes were the tropical and subtropical moist and dry forests 25 4 mgc ha 1 yr 1 and 20 3 mgc ha 1 yr 1 respectively followed by mangroves 15 5 mgc ha 1 yr 1 and tropical and subtropical coniferous forests 13 1 mgc ha 1 yr 1 total global terrestrial biomass table 4 was 583 0 pgc of which tropical and subtropical moist forests contributed the largest percentage about 33 or 229 pgc followed by temperate broadleaf and mixed forests about 16 or 112 3 pgc expressed on an areal basis the largest standing stock per unit area was coniferous temperate forests 130 mgc ha 1 followed by tropical subtropical moist broadleaf forest tropical subtropical coniferous forest and mangroves all have a standing stock of about 120 mgc ha 1 the ocean and estuary make up an insignificant portion about 0 2 of total global biomass while contributing about 28 of global gpp table 5 lists the biomes and computed soil carbon by far the largest stock of soil carbon is found in the boreal forests 348 pgc followed by tropical and subtropical moist forests 223 pgc and tropical and subtropical grasslands savanna and shrubland 166 pgc when expressed on an areal basis the largest stocks are still the boreal forest 23 5 kgc m 2 followed by mangrove forests 19 9 kgc m 2 temperate conifer forests 13 6 kgc m 2 and tropical subtropical coniferous forest 13 1 kgc m 2 3 4 the relation between driving emergy and biome biomass and productivity scatter plots of pre anthropocene gpp and biomass versus a suite of driving emergy is shown in figures 6 and 7 each data point in the graphs represents one 1 arc degree cell from the global coverage the y axis is gpp and biomass gc m 2 yr 1 or gc m 2 and the x axis is the log of driving emergy sej m 2 yr 1 forms of driving emergy that exhibited the best gpp and biomass predictive value were aet water chem chemical potential of aet plus runoff and maxr aet and water chem appears to be the stronger predictor and very similar of both gpp and biomass with slightly more scatter exhibited by maxr in addition to the scatter plots a principal component analysis pca was conducted where all the driving emergy forms were included the analysis revealed the first principal component was aet and the second was solar input see supplemental material screening of the data helped to inform further analysis of the relations between emergy and productivity and standing stock figures 8 and 9 show linear regressions of the emergy of aet rain waterchem and maxr vs gpp and biomass for terrestrial biomes aet rain and waterchem are all generally good predictors of gpp r2 0 89 90 f 0 001 the lower r2 r2 0 75 of maxr is due to several biomes lower on the productivity scale that had wind as the dominate emergy source montane grasslands shrublands tundra deserts xeric shrublands and rock ice the regressions of aet rain waterchem and maxr vs biomass figure 9 were not as good at explaining variation as the gpp regressions yielding r2 of 37 and 0 28 respectively in all cases significance f 0 01 because of the observation that there were differences in the variance in gpp between the same biomes on different continents we also generated linear regressions of gpp by continent vs aet and maxr figure s 10 supplemental material it is apparent that there is greater variability in the data and thus the regressions are somewhat weaker aet r2 0 79 and maxr r2 0 65 but still significant f 0 001 checking to determine if multiple emergy sources may be responsible for global productivity and that the interplay of these sources might generate stronger predictive models multiple linear regressions of gpp and biomass were conducted tables 6 and 7 show the output from the r software package showing that each of driving energy sources explains some of the error with the exception of wind for gpp and solar and geothermal for biomass as expected aet had the largest explanatory power p 0 001 followed by rain p 0 001 for gpp as with biomass the largest explanatory power for biomass was aet p 001 followed by rain p 001 and wind p 0 001 the driving emergy that was not significant p 0 1 for biomass was geothermal the adjusted r2 for both multiple regressions were 0 79 and 0 84 for gpp and biomass prospectively finally we explored in three dimensional plots of the two most important driving emergy sources and their relation to gpp biomass and soil carbon figures 10 11 and 12 the plots use aet and solar energy which are from the previous analyses suggested the strongest relations to gpp and biomass the color plots show very well the locations of the biomes in the space defined by aet and solar radiation 3 5 emergy and emdollar value of global gpp given in table 8 are the emergy and emdollar value of the gpp of global biomes in the pre anthropocene total emdollar value of global gpp was em 12 3 trillion the largest contributor was the ocean em 4 9 trillion followed by estuaries em 1 8 trillion and rain forests em 1 4 trillion to place emdollar value of the work of ecosystems of the biosphere in perspective the gdp of usa in 2004 was equal to 12 3 trillion usbea 2019 in recent years others have evaluated global ecosystem services costanza et al 2014 1997 de groot et al 2012 determining that they were worth between 33 trillion and 145 trillion per year 3 6 emergy and emdollar value of biotic natural capital bnc the emergy of pre anthropocene bnc was evaluated using the turnover time of the stock multiplied by the aei of each biome table 9 lists the emergy and emdollar value of soil carbon and table 10 lists the emergy and emdollar value of biomass total emergy of soil carbon was 708 3 e 24 sej equivalent to em 354 2 trillion biomes with the larges emergy in soil carbon were tundra 358

of the emergy of soil carbon table 10 the equivalent emdollar value of biomass was em 224 3 trillion biomes with the largest biomass were tropical subtropical moist broadleaf forests 140 e 24 sej em 70 trillion followed by boreal forest taiga 61 5 e 24 sej em 30 7trillion combine the total global emergy and emdollar value of biotic natural capital was 1156 9 e 24 sej and em 578 5 trillion for reference the estimated nominal gross world product gwp in 2017 was 80 3 trillion cia 2019 or only about 14 of the emdollar value of natural capital 3 7 impact of human induced land cover change we compared pre anthropocene gpp with the gpp derived from terra modis npp and gpp product ca 2000 zhao et al 2005 to estimate the impact of land cover change on the global productivity table 11 lists estimates of land cover change and changes in gpp for the pre anthropocene and the year 2000 based on zhao et al 2005 land cover change has resulted in rather dramatic decreases in the area of many biomes between 43 and 82 of all tropical and subtropical ecosystems have been altered nearly 80 of mediterranean forest woodland and scrub ecosystems have been converted and over 60 of tropical and flooded grassland savanna systems our analysis suggests that the tundra biome for all intents and purposes remains untouched while the boreal forest ecosystems show a decline of about 4 in cover land cover area of mangrove ecosystems has declined over 50 it is interesting to note that estuarine areas of declined by about 42 in all total cover of pre anthropocene terrestrial biomes has declined by 38 it is most interesting that the models used to estimate gpp do not agree with the land cover changes table 11 gross primary production as measured by satellite does not show nearly the same magnitudes of decrease in fact while all biomes show a decrease in area with the exception of the tundra some biomes show increases in gpp some remarkably much greater than the pre anthropocene production montane grassland shrubland 100 temperate grassland savanna shrubland 37 desert xeric shrubland 38 the largest decreases in gpp were exhibited by tropical subtropical dry broadleaf forest 33 and temperate broadleaf mixed forest 15 obviously when some ecosystems are replaced by irrigated and fertilized agriculture the greenness and therefore the estimates of gpp may be considerably higher than the initial ecosystem resulting in the fact that many biomes show increases in gpp while their initial land cover has been much reduced overall our analysis suggests that while 43 of the original land cover has been altered this has resulted in only an overall decline in gpp of 5 changes in biotic natural capital bnc were also evaluated as the sum of the losses of biomass and soil carbon storage the assumption was that 100 of standing forest biomass and 50 of biomass on nonforested biomes was removed on areas dominated by human uses given in table 12 are estimates of the decreases in terrestrial biomass total emdollar value of terrestrial biomass loss was em 70 trillion or about 12 of total bnc value the largest losses occurred in tropical subtropical moist broadleaf forest em 30 1 trillion and temperate broadleaf mixed forest em 18 4 trillion no land cover changes were observed in the tundra biome table 13 lists the emergy and emdollar losses of soil carbon due to land cover change total losses equal to em 18 5 trillion the largest of which resulted from land cover change in tropical forests em 7 8 trillion and flooded grassland savanna em 2 5 trillion overall the total losses of bnc from land cover change since the anthropocene began 310 years equal em 88 5 trillion or about 16 of total pre anthropocene value and roughly equal to the world gross domestic product in 2017 80 3 trillion cia 2019 4 discussion this study explored four questions related to global ecosystems and their driving emergy designed to elicit a better understanding of some very fundamental questions assertions and suppositions of emergy theory the questions were as follows 1 what is the emergy supporting global ecosystem productivity 2 what is the emergy of global ecosystem biomass and soil carbon 3 do ecosystems maximize total emergy or is maximum productivity and biomass the result of the interplay of the suite of renewable emergy sources 4 what is the impact on global productivity gpp and biotic natural capital bnc that has resulted from human induced land cover change to answer these questions global coverages of earth s renewable driving energy multiplied by transformities to convert to emergy were combined with global coverages of productivity gpp soil carbon and biomass we begin this discussion by first examining two constraints that are the result of the data we used and thoughts regarding services vs functions we then turn to addressing each of the above questions and their related theoretical questions assertions and suppositions 4 1 biomes biomes play a significant role in this study as the concept is used to explore the relationships between driving emergy and structure and productivity of global ecosystems how the world s ecological systems are classified ultimately dictates relations one might find between driving emergy and ecosystem properties the geobiosphere composed of numerous ecosystems has been classified into generalized biomes or collections of flora and fauna with common characteristics occupying a shared environment having similar climatic conditions the term was first used by clements 1917 to describe biotic community tansley 1935 added a soil component and climatic conditions to the concept the international biological program 1964 74 an internationally coordinated effort to conduct large scale ecosystem studies increased awareness of the concept following the ibp program there were and continue numerous efforts to classify global biotic communities allee et al 1949 bailey 1989 holdridge 1947 olson et al 2001 olson and dinerstein 1998 whittaker 1962 most of the classification schemes that have been devised rely on two abiotic elements water and temperature for water while evapotranspiration is sometimes used the most common water parameter in the majority of the classification schemes was annual precipitation the classification scheme of olson et al 2001 adopted here relied on climatic zones or regions tropic subtropic temperate etc and moisture regimes humid semi humid arid etc thus it is somewhat obvious if the classification scheme relies in a large part on water availability and temperature solar input then the most important driving energy sources would be highly correlated to these two variables 4 2 biome productivity the productivity of global biomes figure 5 and table 4 was derived from global coverages generated as one of the many products of nasa s moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis program since the gpp data derived from modis is contemporaneous it was necessary to derive gpp for biomes without the presence of human land uses this required that we subsample the modis data for areas without human land cover change by masking all human dominated areas this left in some regions of the globe a relatively small number of pixels from which to compute gpp for the entire biome table b 5 supplemental material it also became apparent that the same biome on different continents exhibited different mean gpp figure 13 while few of these differences were statically significant the differences did point out the fact that a global biome map that homogenizes all similar ecosystems across the planet may be a simplification that helps to hide some relationships between driving emergy and productivity the relatively small number of pixels in some biomes continents may have contributed to the observed differences in gpp when computed separately by continent 4 3 ecosystem services vs ecosystem functions ecosystem services es are the ecological characteristics functions or processes that directly or indirectly contribute to human wellbeing that is the benefits that people derive from functioning ecosystems costanza et al 1997 millennium ecosystem assessment mea 2005 ecosystem functions ef on the other hand are the ecological processes that control the fluxes of energy nutrients and organic matter through an ecological system there is a very simple yet important reason for this distinction on our part that is a direct result of emergy accounting principles since the functions of ecosystems are co products i e they occur simultaneously within systems driving by the same emergy they cannot be added thus the emergy assigned to gpp is the same emergy assigned to evapotranspiration or nutrient cycling or o2 production or co2 sequestration of a particular ecosystem simply put the value of an ecosystem s functions is the emergy driving the system services are another thing they are first and foremost a product of human imagination services are aimed at humans and are defined as actions of assisting or doing work for someone therefore ess are actions by ecosystems that help or do work for humans there are numerous ways of evaluating ess mostly in monetary terms avoided cost replacement cost factor income travel cost hedonic pricing and contingent valuation it is these methods of evaluation that make the distinction between functions and services important each of these methods rely on some form of willingness to pay and therefore are receiver value systems emergy is a donor value system so to evaluate ecosystem functions we compute the emergy required to produce them to evaluate the services that and ecosystem provides we compute what people are willing to pay for it quite simply to opposing views of value in this paper we have compared our computed values of ecosystem functions to economic values by converting emergy to monetary units using a global emergy money ratio we have refrained from suggesting that one is better than the other since they measure two very different things the utility of converting to emdollars is merely the fact that humans recognize dollar values and are proficient at distinguishing relative importance based on them 4 4 drivers of biome productivity and structure throughout the analysis of biomes and driving emergy water and temperature played significant roles in determining productivity and structure of global biomes the analysis of biome driving emergy showed that the chemical potential emergy of water aet runoff was the dominant emergy table 2 for a majority of the biomes 11 out of 16 terrestrial biomes plus the coastal estuary biome these corresponded to the moist climatic provinces 4 4 moist climates are those with a positive moisture index and dry provinces are those with a negative index thornthwaite 1948 perhumid 5 5 defined by thornthwaite 1948 as the wettest type of climate having a humidity index value greater than 100 humid and subhumid interestingly the biomes of the dry climatic provinces semiarid and arid were dominated by wind as the driving energy the dominate input emergy of a system has been termed maxr which is a contraction of maximum renewable according to emergy theory systems should respond to the emergy driving them therefore one might expect that the higher the emergy input the greater total work that can be done by a system in ecosystems total work is measured by gpp thus correlations between gpp and maxr should be a test of the general proposition generally this is true gpp as a measure of total work shows an increasing trend with increasing driving emergy compare data in tables 3 and 4 the suite of emergy inputs to ecosystems also called emergy signature was shown in figure 3 the two dominate driving emergy forms for nearly all biomes were rain and wind in the moist climatic regimes rain dominated while in the dry regimes wind was the dominate input if the theory that systems respond to emergy and not necessarily to the form of the emergy input then a test of correlation between maxr and productivity should yield strong correlation regardless of the input emergy forms simple linear regressions of maxr vs gpp figure 8 yielded strong correlations especially with those biomes whose dominate input was rain r2 0 75 in the same regression biomes whose dominate input was wind exhibited lower than expected gpp suggesting that the proposition that maximum emergy regardless of form is a strong indicator of productivity is inaccurate a second regression of aet vs gpp found a much stronger correlation between the two variables r2 0 89 further explaining the lack of correlation of the dryer biomes who were dominated by wind the fact that the r2 improved when aet was used implies a stronger relation to available water rather than just maximum emergy when gpp was computed for each continental biome and then the results regressed against aet and maxr figure 9 the regressions that resulted were a bit weaker r2 079 and r2 0 65 for aet and maxr respectively the suggestion is that the smoothing that results from computing global means for biome gpp results in a stronger relation between driving emergy and ecosystem productivity in other words using global means for gpp rather than using gpp for each continental biome reduces the variability in overall gpp and therefore increases the r2 of the regressions when regressions were conducted to evaluate correlations of aet and maxr with biome biomass the results were far less strong bottom graphs in figure 8 the variability was much greater yielding an r2 0 37 for aet vs biomass and r2 0 28 for maxr vs biomass it appears that accumulation of biomass is only slightly related to the intensity of the driving emergy other factors may be involved for instance temperature which modify environmental conditions 4 5 maximum emergy or multiplicity of emergy multiple regression analysis of biome productivity and biomass tables 6 and 7 suggested that while all the forms of driving renewable emergy explained some of the variation in gpp and biomass by far rain and solar energy were the most important and positively correlated while wind and geothermal were negatively correlated interestingly the multivariate adjusted r2 values were quite different from the r2 of the univariate regressions the multivariant adjusted r2 for gpp table 6 r2 0 79 decreased from the univariate aet vs gpp value figure 8 r2 0 89 while the multivariate adjusted r2 for biomass table 7 r2 0 84 was relatively similar to the univariate regression for rain and aet figure 9 r2 0 87 and r2 0 81 respectively the addition of solar energy had a positive effect in explaining some of the variance in biomass while it had little or no effect on gpp apparently while rain alone is a relatively good predictor of gpp the best model for biomass was a multiple regression that included solar energy and to a lesser degree wind it should be kept in mind that aet is always between 95 and 99 of maxr see table 2 in the moist ecosystems since maxr is composed of aet and runoff chemical potential in the dry biomes aet makes up only between 3 rock and ice biome and 50 desert biome of maxr the better fit of aet alone compared to maxr for the univariate regressions does suggest that runoff chemical potential might add a confounding factor to maxr it also suggests that while maxr is a pretty good correlate with productivity water used is a stronger one without the dry biomes maxr appears to be as good a predictor as aet the univariate and multiple regressions tables 6 and 7 suggest that rain and aet are the most important variables explaining variation in gpp odum 1996 had hypothesized based on computations of transformities of global rainfall in many of land based systems analyzed in his book that rain and more specifically the portion of rain that is used by vegetation aet was the most significant driver of ecosystems the analysis of multiple driving emergy sources confirms odum s original evaluations and strongly suggests that the water used by ecosystems aet is the dominate determinant of productivity interestingly the best model for biomass was a multivariant regression the strongest variable of which were aet solar and wind negative effect presumably the accumulation of biomass over time is not only affected by the available water used but by solar input and negatively affected by wind wind can be both a positive and negative influence on ecosystems at low velocities wind can be a positive driver of productivity by increasing evapotranspiration which in turn increases nutrient transport from roots to leaves for example at high velocities it has an increasing negative impact on the development of biomass as a result of defoliation and windthrow the univariant regressions supported a singular dominate driver rain but the addition of solar and geothermal resulted in a slight increase in explaining the variation in biomass 4 6 the impact of human induced land use change without question humans have altered the land cover of planet earth the year 1700 was taken as the boundary between pre anthropocene and the anthropocene it was felt that prior to 1700 there was very little influence from fossil fuel use for it was the arrival of the industrial revolution in mid 1700 that coal began to replace biomass as the main source of energy in the roughly 300 years since 1700 there has been a significant change in land cover resulting in 38 of the pre anthropocene terrestrial biome land area changed to human dominated land cover table 11 a majority of the terrestrial biomes nine out of 16 exhibit per cent change greater than 50 the large tundra 0 change and boreal forests 4 change are the reason that the total pre anthropocene terrestrial landcover is not greater than 50 using satellite imagery to evaluate current 2010 gpp and comparing to our estimates of pre anthropocene gpp resulted in a net change of 5 with many biomes exhibiting positive changes table 11 while we did not include agricultural lands in our analysis they were subtracted out before doing analysis of gpp those biomes with the largest increases in gpp were the biomes where human influences were dominated by agriculture this is presumably the result of several things first it is possible that some agricultural lands were inadvertently included and not masked out and when viewed from satellite sensors show the relatively high productivities characteristic of irrigated and fertilized land cover a second possibility is that of a spill over effect where runoff from agricultural lands increases productivity of surrounding natural areas of course the difference in production is not only that measured as gpp but also the ultimate fate of the productivity on the pre anthropocene earth productivity was cycled and recycled within ecological systems supporting diverse food chains of organisms in the current system the productivity increases that are seen in most biomes is used to support a diverse and complex human system with such declines in available productivity there must be an accompanying decline in the quantity and diversity of organisms that the global ecosystems can support studies of the human appropriation of net primary production hanpp have shown that between 13 and 40 of npp is being appropriated by humans haberl et al 2014 2007 krausmann et al 2013 vitousek et al 1986 if we assume that the areas of human occupation are equivalent to appropriated productivity then this study quantifies the hanpp in 2000 to be 38 of total available productivity table 11 a quantity within the upper bounds of the current estimates interestingly not only has this quantity of productivity been sequestered by humans but actually the productivity of these lands has been increased through management fertilization and irrigation so that if we again assume that all the lands under human domination are subsidized with water and nutrients the quantity of npp has increased while the overall decrease exhibited about 5 table 11 can be attributed to bare and urban lands without detailed measurements of standing biomass we can only estimate the losses of bnc that have resulted from human induced land use changes from available aerial coverage data the assumption of losses of 100 of above and below ground biomass from forested lands converted to other uses and 50 of above and below ground biomass from grassland and shrubland biomes resulted in losses totaling about 12 of standing biomass table 12 when converted to emdollars the loss represents em 70 trillion we used the data of sanderman et al 2017 to estimate soil carbon losses at 133pgc since the beginning of the anthropocene table 13 which when converted to emdollars totaled about em 18 5 trillion 5 conclusion the emergy supporting the geobiosphere based on the solar tidal and geothermal inputs totals 12 0 e 24 sej yr 1 when the emergy supporting the biomes of the geobiosphere is summed it totals 24 5 e 24 sej yr 1 see table 7 global total slightly over twice the geobiosphere emergy baseline geb many would ask how is this possible there is more energy supporting the biomes than is supporting the geobiosphere as a whole either there is an accounting error or there is some sort of double counting it is possible that there is some double counting but there are two factors that contribute the most to this apparent problem the first factor is a interesting and well known phenomena in spatial analysis known as the modifiable areal unit problem maup that we identified in a previous paper lee and brown 2019 the maup results from spatial aggregation and scale of analysis and ultimately results in statistical bias when summary statistics are computed from spatial data the second factor contributing this this apparent problem is related to the fact that the geobiosphere is a complex network of energy conversion processes where primary renewable emergy sources solar tidal and geothermal are transformed into secondary and then tertiary sources lags in the system storages of materials and potential energy storages result in more emergy transfer between components than is driving the system the dynamic interconnected nature of the geobiosphere strongly presupposes that simple static addition of the driving emergy does not account for feedback or cycling of emergy over time scales greater than one year while static evaluation considers inputs over a 1 year timeframe it is well known that the atmosphere oceans and land masses have turnover times much greater than one year it is therefore entirely reasonable that when the driving emergy of each biome is summed it totals more than twice the emergy that annually drives the geobiosphere as aristotle and many individuals since his time have stated the whole is greater than the sum of its parts each biome is driven by a unique signature of emergy sources yet emergy theory suggests that it is not the sum of the emergy inputs that drives ecosystems but the largest since embodied in each input is some emergy from the other inputs because of the interconnected nature of the biosphere network of emergy flows and transformations this study questions that assumption the simplistic mathematical conversion of taking the largest is just that simplistic it does not recognize the complexity of the geobiosphere network but assumes a series of rather linear transformations of the geb that result in rain wind river geopotential etc if this study did nothing else it calls into question this rather naive assumption of linearity the impact of humans on the geobiosphere is pervasive and far reaching still there are large areas of earth that remain somewhat untouched the tundra and boreal forests for instance while exhibiting nearly imperceptible land use change non the less they are under significant potential change from global climate effects how they adapt to these changes whether they will increase in productivity or whether biomass decreases markedly from fire and human exploitation remains uncertain while in the past it was suggested that the great expanse of tropical and sub tropical rain forests were the earth s systems that provided large scale buffering to global changes as they show marked signs of increased human induced change the only biomes left relatively intact may soon begin to go the way of all the others currently about 12 of the earth s biomass has been lost and about 8 of soil carbon this begs the question what is the appropriate quantity of untouched ecosystem function required to maintain a stable earth ecosystem are we approaching that limit dong joo lee methodology formal analysis data curation writing original draft mark brown conceptualization methodology writing reviewing

24712,we have used the coverages of renewable emergy input developed from satellite derived data to determine the emergy supporting ecosystem productivity and biotic natural capital in addition the impact on global productivity and biotic natural capital that has resulted from human induced land cover change was evaluated the actual evapotranpiration aet which is the portion of rain that is used by vegetation was the most significant driver of ecosystems however the accumulation of biomass over time is not only affected by the available water used but also by solar input and negatively affected by wind additionally we have estimated the value of ecosystem function and storages in pre anthroponcene era total annual emdollar value of global gross primary production was em 12 3 trillion and the total emdollar value of biotic natural capital which includes below and above ground biomass as well as the soil carbon was em 578 5 trillion however total losses of biotic natural capital from land cover change since the anthropocene began equal to em 88 5 trillion or about 16 of total pre anthropocene value keywords emergy gis renewable energy ecosystem productivity biotic natural capital 1 introduction recently there has been much attention given to valuing ecosystems based on their service contributions to humans under the rubric of ecosystem services in this study we discard the term ecosystem services in favor of ecosystem functions biological geochemical and physical processes that take place within an ecosystem that global ecosystems perform we draw a distinction between services a truly anthropogenic term i e services to whom and functions the naturally occurring processes of ecosystems that support not only humans but also the biosphere as a whole by separating these two concepts issues of anthropocentrism are minimized services are things that human value and benefit from which can be evaluated based on human preferences or technological expenditures to replace them ecosystem functions on the other hand are not easily valued within a human value system for they have no markets and people do not know what they are worth violating the two basic tenets of economic valuation a functioning market and perfect information therefore to better estimate the value of ecosystem function a donor determined value such as emergy can be used emergy is the available energy of one kind previously used up directly and indirectly to make a service or product odum 1996 1988 1 1 emergy basis for global ecosystem global ecosystems are driven by a tripartite combination of renewable emergy that has been termed the geobiosphere emergy baseline or geb brown et al 2016 brown and ulgiati 2016a brown and ulgiati 2010 composed of solar radiation tidal momentum absorbed by the earth and relic geothermal energy from within the planet partitioning of the geb between the countless physical and ecological systems of earth has become increasingly important as more and more emphasis has been placed on understanding and quantifying global flows of renewable resources supporting humanity at the global scale figure 1 the primary emergy of the geb is partitioned into secondary precipitation and wind and tertiary chemical and geo potentials of runoff ocean currents renewable flows brown and ulgiati 2016b it is the geb that supported all life on earth through millions of years of planetary evolution developing ecosystems hydrologic systems and atmospheric systems and the interconnections between them it is the amalgamation of the primary flows of the geb with the secondary and tertiary renewable flows that provides the emergy basis for ecosystem structure and functions measuring the emergy basis of global ecosystems will provide necessary quantification for determining global values of ecosystem structure and functions 1 2 emergy and ecosystem development a main theoretical paradigm of energy systems theory odum 2007 1996 1994 1983 is that the quantity and quality of a system s output is directly related to the quantity of available energy of its inputs with one caveat if the inputs are too energetic output may diminish as a result of induced stresses from an emergy perspective theory suggests that with increased inputs of emergy ecosystems should have higher productivities and produce greater quantities of biomass also subject to the above mentioned caveat on the other hand productivity may be enhanced less by the total emergy input and instead output maybe maximized with an appropriate mix of different emergy inputs emergy signature 1 1 emergy signature is the characteristic distribution of quantities of emergy among inputs to a system in an amalgamation of primary secondary and tertiary renewable sources we next review the literature regarding evaluations of global ecosystems and biomes beginning with economic evaluations and ending with emergy evaluations of biomes 1 3 economic evaluations of global ecosystem the value of global ecosystems was estimated by costanza et al 1997 updated in 2011 costanza et al 2014 and recently future values were modeled kubiszewski et al 2017 based on economic valuation techniques the original paper costanza et al 1997 valued the earth s ecosystem services at 33 trillion per year in 2014 costanza et al 2014 re evaluated their earlier estimate placing it at 145 trillion they then valued global ecosystem services in 2011 as 125 trillion per year suggesting a 20 trillion decrease between 1997 and 2011 the 2011 value was used as the baseline for the future projections by kubiszewski et al 2017 which resulted in projections between a decline of 51 trillion per year and an increase of 30 trillion per year depending on the future scenario using the global land cover dataset and the ecosystem service values from costanza et al 1997 patterns of conventional gdp and the value of non marketed ecosystem services were spatially analyzed 1 km2 resolution by sutton and costanza 2002 to estimate the total value of the ecosystem services of the lands and waters of each nation several indices gross domestic product ecosystems services product subtotal ecological economic product ecosystem product were calculated for each square kilometer of land surface and then aggregated for each nation of the world indices were compared to the environmental sustainability index and the ecological footprint index de groot et al 2012 using a database of value estimates from literature sources provided an overview of the value of 10 main earth biomes in monetary units they did not attempt to sum values of biomes to provide a global value but did provide mean minimum and maximum values for each on a hectare basis mean values ranged from int 490 ha 1 yr 1 for the open ocean to int 350 000 ha 1 yr 1 for coral reefs the dynamics of seven ecosystem services were modeled globally using a stella model named gumbo global unified metamodel of the biosphere across eleven biomes by boumans et al 2002 a range of five future scenarios representing base case and four future scenarios the relative value of ecosystem services was estimated to be about 4 5 times the value of gross world product gwp in the year 2000 on the other hand alexander et al 1998 investigated several approaches for valuing global ecosystem services instead of using willingness to pay wtp or other value transfer methods the global ecosystem was assumed to be owned by a monopolist who was charging the population for the services their estimates indicated that global ecosystem services are worth between 44 and 88 of the global gdp patterson 2002 used ecological pricing theory applied to the valuation of biosphere processes and services in 1994 and obtained a total value of primary ecological services to be nearly us 25 trillion ecological prices measure value of nature in terms of the biophysical interdependencies in the system ultimately quantifying how much value is contributed to an ecological commodity e g plant biomass by another commodity in this case solar energy in the system 1 5 emergy evaluations of global ecosystems while there many papers that use the emergy method to assess the value of ecosystem services of small scale systems we restrict our review here to those that are large in scale such as global systems or biomes brown and ulgiati 1999 estimated the emergy value of the earth s natural capital environmental resources including freshwater soil organic matter and plant and animal biomass totaling 575 e 25 sej or 5 3 e 15 based on 1998 dollars water and soil organic matter were responsible for 51 and 40 of the total emergy value respectively using economic values of ecosystem services from sutton and costanza 2002 coscieme et al 2014 derived emergy money ratios for ecosystem services for countries calculating values that varied between 2 02 e 11 sej 1 and 6 82 e 11 sej 1 values equal to 1 to 2 orders of magnitude lower than the emergy money ratio of the country when non renewable emergy is included they suggested that this difference means that ecosystems can provide services at much lower costs than the economy can lu et al 2017 computed the donor value of the subtropical forests in southeast china by using emergy analysis and compared it with the receiver value estimated by monetary value to estimate the efficiency of different types of ecosystem their result revealed that forests and plantations had 2 orders of magnitude higher efficiency than the current chinese economic system in providing service showing the importance of afforestation rugani et al 2014 estimated the solar energy demand sed annual emergy used in luxembourg from 1995 to 2009 the sed of luxembourg was 23 times larger on average than all of the free energy raw materials and natural cycles associated with the territorial system of luxembourg choi 2010 has estimated the emergy values of terrestrial plants using annual emergy input npp and phytomass transformity of annual increment of phytomass was computed by dividing the emergy input by the dry mass of annual npp to compute the emergy of biomass storage choi multiplied standing stock by the transformity of npp not recognizing that the transformity of npp is not an appropriate transformity for biomass which is an accumulation of annual npp over the biomass turnover time recently yang et al 2020 conducted an emergy based ecosystem service valuation of china s grasslands by spatially analyzing the emergy values of provisioning regulating cultural and supporting services of china s grasslands zhang et al 2019 evaluated the ecosystem services of tidal wetlands fresh water wetlands and agricultural systems of chongming island in eastern china using emergy yang et al 2019 used emergy to evaluate ecosystem services of aquatic systems of china xu et al 2020 evaluated the changes in ecosystem services in northwestern china before and after the conversion of a desert shrub system to a plantation system based on emergy analysis sun et al 2018 estimated marine ecosystem services values in 11 coastal provinces and cities of china from 2005 to 2014 and then analyzed the changes in services values across the different regions and across time in 2012 campbell and brown using the emergy approach estimated the value of ecosystem service provided by the national forests managed by the us forest service usfs to be em 197 billion emdollars in 2005 and its natural capital to be em 24 3 trillion campbell and brown 2012 they used the ecosystem service categories suggested in millennium ecosystems assessment 2005 which categorizes ecosystem services into 4 main categories of provisioning services regulating services supporting services and cultural services campbell and tilley 2014 computed biophysical quantities for the yearly provision of ecosystem services from a typical hectare of forest in maryland and converted them to emergy by multiplying by the solar equivalent exergy see 2 2 solar equivalent exergy is computed as an equivalence between solar energy and the other exergy sources comprising the geb tidal and geothermal recognizing that these independent sources driving the geobiosphere are not transformations of solar energy as was discussed by brown et al 2016 required per biophysical unit of exergy the quantity of ecosystem services was assessed for the national economy and national ecosystem mosaic of brazil in historical series 1981 2011 giannetti et al 2017 showing that the contributions from renewable sources have fallen from about 75 of the total economy in 1981 to about 20 in 2011 almeida et al 2018 assessed the ecosystems service of urban parks by accounting climate regulation evapotranspiration and co2 sequestration water regulation water retention in soil and supporting service net primary production they considered evapotranspiration and co2 sequestration as a co product while considering climate regulation and water regulation as a split emergy of ecosystem service in regions of china have been done by several authors dong et al 2012 2014 ma et al 2015 sun et al 2018 wang et al 2019 these studies selected a few services from the ecosystem service categories suggested in millennium ecosystems assessment 2005 and summed the emergy value of each service estimated by multiplying the products e g energy of evapotranspired water energy of biomass in net primary production with its unit emergy values uevs from other studies 1 6 summary of global evaluations all in all while emergy has been applied to evaluation of numerous ecosystems and regions only one attempt has previously been made to evaluate global ecosystems using emergy brown and ulgiati 1999 in that study the emergy of global natural capital was estimated on the basis of assessments of total mass of soil organic matter fresh surface and ground water and animal and plant biomass that study did not evaluate the spatial distribution of natural capital only relying on global estimates of mass several studies have been completed using a variety of economic methods to estimate the value of global ecosystem services to humans including at least one spatial analysis these studies did not evaluate ecosystem functions per se but rather ecosystem services this is not a criticism of economic valuation only to say that they did not evaluate ecosystem functions in general few previous studies whether economic or emergy evaluations have valued functions instead they have focused on services to our knowledge there have been no economic evaluations of global natural capital even though at least one of the global papers costanza et al 1997 included the term in its title in this study we answer the following questions using emergy and gis data sets 1 what is the emergy supporting global ecosystems biomes 2 what is the emergy of global ecosystem biomass and soil carbon 3 do ecosystems maximize total emergy or is maximum productivity and biomass the result of the interplay of the suite of renewable emergy sources what is the impact on global productivity gpp and biotic natural capital bnc that has resulted from human induced land cover change combined these questions are intended to facilitate a better understanding of some very fundamental questions assertions and suppositions of emergy theory the first question above relates to a fundamental question how to evaluate ecosystems and their properties we suggest that evaluation using emergy leads one to distinctly separate ecosystem services from ecosystem functions in order to answer what is the emergy of ecosystem functions we must answer the first question above what is the emergy supporting global ecosystem productivity according to emergy accounting procedures the emergy of productivity is equal to the emergy driving the system thus by evaluating the emergy driving the global biomes we have identified the emergy of all functions of these biomes the second question above relates to the assertion that the value of a stored product is the emergy required to produce it thus evaluating the driving emergy question 1 is essential to answering this question along with the knowledge of the turnover time of the stored product as a consequence the most valuable stored resource is not always the result of the largest driving energy but can be the largest because of a longer generation time with this quantitative understanding of donor value comparisons can be made and policies directed to better serve global sustainability objectives the third question relates to a supposition that the structure and productivity of systems is directly proportional to the emergy driving the system i e the more emergy the more productive the more emergy the larger structure can be supported numerous researchers have suggested that systems may not respond to total emergy but instead produce maximum production and structure from the interplay of suite of input energies brown et al 2006 ulgiati and brown 2009 ulgiati et al 2011 with this data set we are better positioned to confirm that supposition but unfortunately it leads to still another quandary if systems produce maximum productivity or biomass that is a function of the emergy signature rather than the quantity of driving emergy then evaluating ecosystem functions based on the driving emergy in a static accounting may not be appropriate instead it may be that dynamic evaluations must be conducted rather than static ones that assume steady state conditions but this is a topic for another paper the fourth question relates to an overall concern regarding human sustainability on planet earth how far down the path of unstainable development have we gone tracking anthropogenic alteration in a quantitative manner can provide benchmarks of human destruction of planetary ecosystems or progress if we begin to regenerate natural systems tracking both biomass and productivity losses provide needed benchmarks that offer information on the flows and storages of ecosystems with which appropriate sustainable policy can be generated 2 methods in this study we used gis and the emergy analysis method to compute values of global ecosystem functions ef and biotic natural capital bnc 3 3 we use the term biotic natural capital to refer to above and below ground biomass and soil organic matter as carbon of ecosystems to distinguish them from other natural capital such as minerals fossil fuels water etc emergy values of annual ef of global biomes were computed by using the renewable emergy coverages developed in lee and brown 2019 and a global biome boundary coverage olson et al 2001 at 10 arc minute resolution the emergy values of bnc were computed using biomass estimates of major biomes gibbs 2006 and a soil carbon coverage produced by the oak ridge national laboratory usa ruesch and gibbs 2008 the most recent global emergy baseline geb 12 0 e 24 sej yr 1 brown et al 2016 was used as the basis from which all unit emergy values were computed 2 1 biome categorization shown in figure 2 is the biome and habitat classification scheme used in this study olson et al 2001 delineated 14 biomes as well as lakes and ice rocky areas and ocean we added estuaries and rivers to their biome coverage yielding a total of 19 distinct habitats the boundary data of estuaries was derived from the sea around us project alder 2003 the river habitat based on stream order higher than six vanote et al 1980 was developed using the flow accumulation routine in arcgis and assigning any 10 arc minute cell with stream order greater than 6 as river habitat 2 2 estimating driving emergy of biomes and habitats emergy of biomes was evaluated by clipping global renewable emergy coverages lee and brown 2019 with a global biome coverage in all there were 9 renewable emergy coverages solar geothermal tidal wind rain chemical potential actual evapotranspiration aet runoff chemical potential runoff geopotential and water chemical potential the water chemical potential coverage was computed as the sum of aet and runoff chemical potential a final coverage of renewable emergy inputs was produced by applying the max renewable algorithm from brown and ulgiati 2016a on a biome basis as follows r m a x m a x s t g w p r g p h 2 o c p the max renewable algorithm was used to minimize double counting of renewable sources the computation was done in the following order first each of the 9 renewable emergy inputs was summed on a cell by cell basis within each biome yielding a total renewable emergy for each input within each biome then the max renewable algorithm was computed at the biome level based on the totals of each input yielding the maximum renewable input maxr for each biome once annual maxr inputs for each biome were derived from the coverages of renewable emergy inputs biome aerial empower intensity aei was computed by dividing by the area of each biome additionally the annual maxr was used to compute the input to biome gpp and biomass 2 3 estimating gpp of biomes and habitats nasa s land processes distributed active archive center lp daac developed the terra modis npp and gpp product mod17a3 which provides yearly average global npp and gpp in 30 arc second resolution zhao et al 2005 total annual global gpp was used as the total work performed by global biomes a coverage of average global gpp for the year 2001 2003 is provided in the supplemental material figure s 2 since these data included areas of land that were occupied by human dominated uses it was necessary to evaluate pre anthropocene gpp by removing all cells that were within agricultural and urban classifications using the anthropogenic biome data ellis 2015 ellis et al 2010 ellis and ramankutty 2008 all cells that were occupied by their land cover classifications that were primarily urban built up and agricultural details are provided in supplemental material were removed the remaining cells were then clipped with the biome coverage and an average gpp per unit area was computed by summing the gpp of all cells and dividing by the area of those cells the concept of anthropocene has evolved since it was first proposed crutzen 2002 however this study uses the european industrial resolution as a turning point between pre anthropocene and anthropocene brondizio et al 2016 since the gpp data from nasa only contained the data for terrestrial biomes it was necessary to add data for land cover classes not included by the nasa data terrestrial biome data was augmented with gpp data from whittaker and likens 1975 for river 0 25 kg c m 2yr 1 lake 0 25 kg c m 2yr 1 estuary 1 5 kg c m 2yr 1 and ocean 0 13 kg c m 2yr 1 2 4 estimating biotic natural capital bnc of biomes and habitats we considered two aspects of bnc biomass sum of above and below ground and soil carbon first we compute bnc for the earth during the pre anthropocene and second we subtract areas of urban and agriculture ellis 2015 to compute the change as of 2010 methods and data sources for biomass and soil carbon are given next 2 4 1 biomass whittaker and likens 1975 provided one of the first comprehensive estimates of global biomass followed by olson et al 1985 who developed a database of carbon in live vegetation above and below ground in major world ecosystems gibbs 2006 updated olson s database using more contemporary land cover conditions of the global land cover database glc2000 based on vega 2000 dataset from spot 4 satellite in this study we used gibbs 2006 data combined with data from both whittaker and likens 1975 and olson et al 1985 to develop the biomass data listed in the final column of table 1 to yield a global coverage of above and below ground biomass kg c m 2 for each 10 arc minute cell of the biomes figure s 3 supplemental material 2 4 2 soil carbon soil carbon figure s 4 supplemental material was derived from the international geosphere biosphere program data and information system igbp dis coverage at a resolution of 5 arc minute global soil data task group 2000 the data were clipped using the global biome coverage to yield total soil carbon for each biome 2 5 emergy of biotic natural capital emergy value of biotic natural capital of each biome was computed from the biome s annual emergy input and turn over time of the soil and biomass compartments 2 5 1 biomass the annual emergy input for each 10 arc minute cell was derived from the emergy coverages as outlined above turnover time of biome biomass was estimated using a autocatalytic simulation model odum and odum 2000 and emergy input lee and brown 2019 the supplemental material provides details of the simulation model total emergy of biomass was computed as the product of annual emergy input and turnover time 2 5 2 soil carbon the international geosphere biosphere program data and information system igbp dis provided 5 arc minute resolution global surface data for soil carbon density kg c m 2 turnover time of soil carbon was derived from literature estimates raich and schlesinger 1992 the emergy of soil carbon of each biome was computed by multiplying the emergy input by soil carbon turnover time 2 6 analyzing relation between gpp and biomass to driving emergy to answer the question pertaining to the relation between emergy and productivity and standing stock the relations were tested using simple linear regression multiple regression and classification and regression trees cart first scatter plots of the data were developed which showed that aet and maxr had the greatest promise to predict gpp and biomass then simple linear regressions of aet vs biomass aet vs gpp maxr vs biomass and maxr vs gpp were conducted to test if additional forms of driving emergy might help to explain some of the error in the simple regressions multiple regressions on gpp and biomass were conducted using all the input emergy forms aet solar rain wind geothermal and maxr finally classification regression trees cart were constructed using the driving emergy sources solar geothermal wind rain and aet as drivers of gpp and biomass of biomes to create models that predict gpp and biomass during the analysis of the relation between driving emergy and gpp and biomass we observed that there appeared to be differences in the variance between the same biomes on different continents ultimately the idea was that instead of classifying the geobiosphere into 16 biomes a more fine grained approach might be warranted as a result the global coverages were reclassified into biomes by continent and then a t test of the differences in mean values of aet and maxr between the same biomes on different continents was conducted see supplemental material under the null hypothesis that the means were the same 2 7 estimating the global impacts of land cover change to estimate the changes in gpp and biotic natural capital that has resulted from human induced land cover change we used the coverage of anthropogenic biomes ellis 2015 ellis et al 2010 ellis and ramankutty 2008 the change in above and below ground biomass was computed by subtracting all areas occupied by urban settlements and villages croplands and populated rangelands to estimate the change in gpp we used the most recent data from the terra modis npp and gpp product zhao et al 2005 and compared these data to the constructed gpp coverage as outlined above the difference between the two coverages represents the net effect on global gpp we report the data on a biome by biome basis to estimate the changes in gpp and biotic natural capital that have resulted from human induced land cover change we used the coverage of anthropogenic biomes ellis 2015 the change in above and below ground biomass was computed by subtracting all areas occupied by urban settlements and villages croplands and populated rangelands to estimate the change in gpp we used the most recent data from the terra modis npp and gpp product zhao et al 2005 and compared these data to the constructed gpp coverage as outlined above the difference between the two coverages represents the net effect on global gpp we report the data on a biome by biome basis to compute the change in biomass the following assumptions were made first it was assumed that 100 of above and belowground biomass was removed from forested lands that were occupied by anthropogenic land cover second 50 of above and belowground biomass was removed from grassland and scrub biomes that were occupied by anthropogenic land cover the change in soil carbon was estimated based on the data and analysis of sanderman et al 2017 where they found that 133 pgc have been lost due to soil erosion across nearly all biomes the total loss of carbon 133 pgc was proportioned between each of the biomes based on the percent change of land cover within each biome finally the emdollar value of the losses was estimated by converting biomass and soil carbon to emergy see above for the method of computing emergy of bnc and then dividing by a global emergy dollar ratio of 2 0 e 12 sej the purpose of this study is to estimate the emergy value of ecosystem functions however to make it easier to sense the magnitude of these values we also present the results as emdollars using the average global conversion factor emergy money ratio 3 results 3 1 empower of global biomes given in table 2 are the renewable inputs to global biomes starred values in the table are the maxr values for each system the dominant emergy sources for a majority of the biomes is water chemical potential sum of aet and runoff chemical potential wind is the largest input in montane grasslands shrublands tundra deserts xeric shrublands and rock ice biomes rivers are dominated by runoff geopotential figure 3 shows graphs of emergy signatures for the global biomes ocean is not included wind and rain dominate the renewable inputs in almost all biomes rivers are the exception where runoff geopotential is the dominant input of interest is the three largest inputs to estuaries rainfall runoff chemical and geopotential emergy as might be expected after analysis of the global data revealed differences in empower driving biomes on different continents we analyzed maxr for biomes by continent a global coverage of the continental boundaries is given in figure s 8 supplemental material figure 4 summarizes the continental maxr data for each of the biomes the data indicated some interesting outcomes specifically note that the oceanic continent composed primarily of australia has the largest difference from the global mean data and the largest standard deviation for most biomes except for the desert and shrubland biome this may be due to the fact that more than half of the australian landcover consists of desert and shrubland while other biomes are in small sizes and fragmented which is likely to result in larger standard deviation 3 2 aerial empower intensity of global biomes summarized in table 3 is the aerial empower intensity aei of the global biomes computed by dividing the biome empower by the area of each biome estuaries have the highest aei of all biomes followed by rivers and then tropical subtropical moist forests estuaries possess an aei that is over 8x the aei of tropical subtropical moist forests the result of the very large input of chemical potential energy of terrestrial runoff not surprising is the fact that rivers have a large aei due to the geopotential energy of runoff that is concentrated within the river systems of the globe 3 3 biome gpp and biotic natural capital table 4 and figure 5 summarize pre anthropocene gpp and biomass for global biomes of the total terrestrial gpp 122 7 pgc yr 1 the largest single contribution is from tropical and subtropical moist forests 48 5 pgc yr 1 followed by tropical and subtropical grass schrublands savannas 22 5 pgc yr 1 the computed global gpp of 122 7 pgc yr 1 was within 2 of the total 125 pgc yr 1 suggested by zhang et al 2017 when expressed on an areal basis the most productive biomes were the tropical and subtropical moist and dry forests 25 4 mgc ha 1 yr 1 and 20 3 mgc ha 1 yr 1 respectively followed by mangroves 15 5 mgc ha 1 yr 1 and tropical and subtropical coniferous forests 13 1 mgc ha 1 yr 1 total global terrestrial biomass table 4 was 583 0 pgc of which tropical and subtropical moist forests contributed the largest percentage about 33 or 229 pgc followed by temperate broadleaf and mixed forests about 16 or 112 3 pgc expressed on an areal basis the largest standing stock per unit area was coniferous temperate forests 130 mgc ha 1 followed by tropical subtropical moist broadleaf forest tropical subtropical coniferous forest and mangroves all have a standing stock of about 120 mgc ha 1 the ocean and estuary make up an insignificant portion about 0 2 of total global biomass while contributing about 28 of global gpp table 5 lists the biomes and computed soil carbon by far the largest stock of soil carbon is found in the boreal forests 348 pgc followed by tropical and subtropical moist forests 223 pgc and tropical and subtropical grasslands savanna and shrubland 166 pgc when expressed on an areal basis the largest stocks are still the boreal forest 23 5 kgc m 2 followed by mangrove forests 19 9 kgc m 2 temperate conifer forests 13 6 kgc m 2 and tropical subtropical coniferous forest 13 1 kgc m 2 3 4 the relation between driving emergy and biome biomass and productivity scatter plots of pre anthropocene gpp and biomass versus a suite of driving emergy is shown in figures 6 and 7 each data point in the graphs represents one 1 arc degree cell from the global coverage the y axis is gpp and biomass gc m 2 yr 1 or gc m 2 and the x axis is the log of driving emergy sej m 2 yr 1 forms of driving emergy that exhibited the best gpp and biomass predictive value were aet water chem chemical potential of aet plus runoff and maxr aet and water chem appears to be the stronger predictor and very similar of both gpp and biomass with slightly more scatter exhibited by maxr in addition to the scatter plots a principal component analysis pca was conducted where all the driving emergy forms were included the analysis revealed the first principal component was aet and the second was solar input see supplemental material screening of the data helped to inform further analysis of the relations between emergy and productivity and standing stock figures 8 and 9 show linear regressions of the emergy of aet rain waterchem and maxr vs gpp and biomass for terrestrial biomes aet rain and waterchem are all generally good predictors of gpp r2 0 89 90 f 0 001 the lower r2 r2 0 75 of maxr is due to several biomes lower on the productivity scale that had wind as the dominate emergy source montane grasslands shrublands tundra deserts xeric shrublands and rock ice the regressions of aet rain waterchem and maxr vs biomass figure 9 were not as good at explaining variation as the gpp regressions yielding r2 of 37 and 0 28 respectively in all cases significance f 0 01 because of the observation that there were differences in the variance in gpp between the same biomes on different continents we also generated linear regressions of gpp by continent vs aet and maxr figure s 10 supplemental material it is apparent that there is greater variability in the data and thus the regressions are somewhat weaker aet r2 0 79 and maxr r2 0 65 but still significant f 0 001 checking to determine if multiple emergy sources may be responsible for global productivity and that the interplay of these sources might generate stronger predictive models multiple linear regressions of gpp and biomass were conducted tables 6 and 7 show the output from the r software package showing that each of driving energy sources explains some of the error with the exception of wind for gpp and solar and geothermal for biomass as expected aet had the largest explanatory power p 0 001 followed by rain p 0 001 for gpp as with biomass the largest explanatory power for biomass was aet p 001 followed by rain p 001 and wind p 0 001 the driving emergy that was not significant p 0 1 for biomass was geothermal the adjusted r2 for both multiple regressions were 0 79 and 0 84 for gpp and biomass prospectively finally we explored in three dimensional plots of the two most important driving emergy sources and their relation to gpp biomass and soil carbon figures 10 11 and 12 the plots use aet and solar energy which are from the previous analyses suggested the strongest relations to gpp and biomass the color plots show very well the locations of the biomes in the space defined by aet and solar radiation 3 5 emergy and emdollar value of global gpp given in table 8 are the emergy and emdollar value of the gpp of global biomes in the pre anthropocene total emdollar value of global gpp was em 12 3 trillion the largest contributor was the ocean em 4 9 trillion followed by estuaries em 1 8 trillion and rain forests em 1 4 trillion to place emdollar value of the work of ecosystems of the biosphere in perspective the gdp of usa in 2004 was equal to 12 3 trillion usbea 2019 in recent years others have evaluated global ecosystem services costanza et al 2014 1997 de groot et al 2012 determining that they were worth between 33 trillion and 145 trillion per year 3 6 emergy and emdollar value of biotic natural capital bnc the emergy of pre anthropocene bnc was evaluated using the turnover time of the stock multiplied by the aei of each biome table 9 lists the emergy and emdollar value of soil carbon and table 10 lists the emergy and emdollar value of biomass total emergy of soil carbon was 708 3 e 24 sej equivalent to em 354 2 trillion biomes with the larges emergy in soil carbon were tundra 358

reference the estimated nominal gross world product gwp in 2017 was 80 3 trillion cia 2019 or only about 14 of the emdollar value of natural capital 3 7 impact of human induced land cover change we compared pre anthropocene gpp with the gpp derived from terra modis npp and gpp product ca 2000 zhao et al 2005 to estimate the impact of land cover change on the global productivity table 11 lists estimates of land cover change and changes in gpp for the pre anthropocene and the year 2000 based on zhao et al 2005 land cover change has resulted in rather dramatic decreases in the area of many biomes between 43 and 82 of all tropical and subtropical ecosystems have been altered nearly 80 of mediterranean forest woodland and scrub ecosystems have been converted and over 60 of tropical and flooded grassland savanna systems our analysis suggests that the tundra biome for all intents and purposes remains untouched while the boreal forest ecosystems show a decline of about 4 in cover land cover area of mangrove ecosystems has declined over 50 it is interesting to note that estuarine areas of declined by about 42 in all total cover of pre anthropocene terrestrial biomes has declined by 38 it is most interesting that the models used to estimate gpp do not agree with the land cover changes table 11 gross primary production as measured by satellite does not show nearly the same magnitudes of decrease in fact while all biomes show a decrease in area with the exception of the tundra some biomes show increases in gpp some remarkably much greater than the pre anthropocene production montane grassland shrubland 100 temperate grassland savanna shrubland 37 desert xeric shrubland 38 the largest decreases in gpp were exhibited by tropical subtropical dry broadleaf forest 33 and temperate broadleaf mixed forest 15 obviously when some ecosystems are replaced by irrigated and fertilized agriculture the greenness and therefore the estimates of gpp may be considerably higher than the initial ecosystem resulting in the fact that many biomes show increases in gpp while their initial land cover has been much reduced overall our analysis suggests that while 43 of the original land cover has been altered this has resulted in only an overall decline in gpp of 5 changes in biotic natural capital bnc were also evaluated as the sum of the losses of biomass and soil carbon storage the assumption was that 100 of standing forest biomass and 50 of biomass on nonforested biomes was removed on areas dominated by human uses given in table 12 are estimates of the decreases in terrestrial biomass total emdollar value of terrestrial biomass loss was em 70 trillion or about 12 of total bnc value the largest losses occurred in tropical subtropical moist broadleaf forest em 30 1 trillion and temperate broadleaf mixed forest em 18 4 trillion no land cover changes were observed in the tundra biome table 13 lists the emergy and emdollar losses of soil carbon due to land cover change total losses equal to em 18 5 trillion the largest of which resulted from land cover change in tropical forests em 7 8 trillion and flooded grassland savanna em 2 5 trillion overall the total losses of bnc from land cover change since the anthropocene began 310 years equal em 88 5 trillion or about 16 of total pre anthropocene value and roughly equal to the world gross domestic product in 2017 80 3 trillion cia 2019 4 discussion this study explored four questions related to global ecosystems and their driving emergy designed to elicit a better understanding of some very fundamental questions assertions and suppositions of emergy theory the questions were as follows 1 what is the emergy supporting global ecosystem productivity 2 what is the emergy of global ecosystem biomass and soil carbon 3 do ecosystems maximize total emergy or is maximum productivity and biomass the result of the interplay of the suite of renewable emergy sources 4 what is the impact on global productivity gpp and biotic natural capital bnc that has resulted from human induced land cover change to answer these questions global coverages of earth s renewable driving energy multiplied by transformities to convert to emergy were combined with global coverages of productivity gpp soil carbon and biomass we begin this discussion by first examining two constraints that are the result of the data we used and thoughts regarding services vs functions we then turn to addressing each of the above questions and their related theoretical questions assertions and suppositions 4 1 biomes biomes play a significant role in this study as the concept is used to explore the relationships between driving emergy and structure and productivity of global ecosystems how the world s ecological systems are classified ultimately dictates relations one might find between driving emergy and ecosystem properties the geobiosphere composed of numerous ecosystems has been classified into generalized biomes or collections of flora and fauna with common characteristics occupying a shared environment having similar climatic conditions the term was first used by clements 1917 to describe biotic community tansley 1935 added a soil component and climatic conditions to the concept the international biological program 1964 74 an internationally coordinated effort to conduct large scale ecosystem studies increased awareness of the concept following the ibp program there were and continue numerous efforts to classify global biotic communities allee et al 1949 bailey 1989 holdridge 1947 olson et al 2001 olson and dinerstein 1998 whittaker 1962 most of the classification schemes that have been devised rely on two abiotic elements water and temperature for water while evapotranspiration is sometimes used the most common water parameter in the majority of the classification schemes was annual precipitation the classification scheme of olson et al 2001 adopted here relied on climatic zones or regions tropic subtropic temperate etc and moisture regimes humid semi humid arid etc thus it is somewhat obvious if the classification scheme relies in a large part on water availability and temperature solar input then the most important driving energy sources would be highly correlated to these two variables 4 2 biome productivity the productivity of global biomes figure 5 and table 4 was derived from global coverages generated as one of the many products of nasa s moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis program since the gpp data derived from modis is contemporaneous it was necessary to derive gpp for biomes without the presence of human land uses this required that we subsample the modis data for areas without human land cover change by masking all human dominated areas this left in some regions of the globe a relatively small number of pixels from which to compute gpp for the entire biome table b 5 supplemental material it also became apparent that the same biome on different continents exhibited different mean gpp figure 13 while few of these differences were statically significant the differences did point out the fact that a global biome map that homogenizes all similar ecosystems across the planet may be a simplification that helps to hide some relationships between driving emergy and productivity the relatively small number of pixels in some biomes continents may have contributed to the observed differences in gpp when computed separately by continent 4 3 ecosystem services vs ecosystem functions ecosystem services es are the ecological characteristics functions or processes that directly or indirectly contribute to human wellbeing that is the benefits that people derive from functioning ecosystems costanza et al 1997 millennium ecosystem assessment mea 2005 ecosystem functions ef on the other hand are the ecological processes that control the fluxes of energy nutrients and organic matter through an ecological system there is a very simple yet important reason for this distinction on our part that is a direct result of emergy accounting principles since the functions of ecosystems are co products i e they occur simultaneously within systems driving by the same emergy they cannot be added thus the emergy assigned to gpp is the same emergy assigned to evapotranspiration or nutrient cycling or o2 production or co2 sequestration of a particular ecosystem simply put the value of an ecosystem s functions is the emergy driving the system services are another thing they are first and foremost a product of human imagination services are aimed at humans and are defined as actions of assisting or doing work for someone therefore ess are actions by ecosystems that help or do work for humans there are numerous ways of evaluating ess mostly in monetary terms avoided cost replacement cost factor income travel cost hedonic pricing and contingent valuation it is these methods of evaluation that make the distinction between functions and services important each of these methods rely on some form of willingness to pay and therefore are receiver value systems emergy is a donor value system so to evaluate ecosystem functions we compute the emergy required to produce them to evaluate the services that and ecosystem provides we compute what people are willing to pay for it quite simply to opposing views of value in this paper we have compared our computed values of ecosystem functions to economic values by converting emergy to monetary units using a global emergy money ratio we have refrained from suggesting that one is better than the other since they measure two very different things the utility of converting to emdollars is merely the fact that humans recognize dollar values and are proficient at distinguishing relative importance based on them 4 4 drivers of biome productivity and structure throughout the analysis of biomes and driving emergy water and temperature played significant roles in determining productivity and structure of global biomes the analysis of biome driving emergy showed that the chemical potential emergy of water aet runoff was the dominant emergy table 2 for a majority of the biomes 11 out of 16 terrestrial biomes plus the coastal estuary biome these corresponded to the moist climatic provinces 4 4 moist climates are those with a positive moisture index and dry provinces are those with a negative index thornthwaite 1948 perhumid 5 5 defined by thornthwaite 1948 as the wettest type of climate having a humidity index value greater than 100 humid and subhumid interestingly the biomes of the dry climatic provinces semiarid and arid were dominated by wind as the driving energy the dominate input emergy of a system has been termed maxr which is a contraction of maximum renewable according to emergy theory systems should respond to the emergy driving them therefore one might expect that the higher the emergy input the greater total work that can be done by a system in ecosystems total work is measured by gpp thus correlations between gpp and maxr should be a test of the general proposition generally this is true gpp as a measure of total work shows an increasing trend with increasing driving emergy compare data in tables 3 and 4 the suite of emergy inputs to ecosystems also called emergy signature was shown in figure 3 the two dominate driving emergy forms for nearly all biomes were rain and wind in the moist climatic regimes rain dominated while in the dry regimes wind was the dominate input if the theory that systems respond to emergy and not necessarily to the form of the emergy input then a test of correlation between maxr and productivity should yield strong correlation regardless of the input emergy forms simple linear regressions of maxr vs gpp figure 8 yielded strong correlations especially with those biomes whose dominate input was rain r2 0 75 in the same regression biomes whose dominate input was wind exhibited lower than expected gpp suggesting that the proposition that maximum emergy regardless of form is a strong indicator of productivity is inaccurate a second regression of aet vs gpp found a much stronger correlation between the two variables r2 0 89 further explaining the lack of correlation of the dryer biomes who were dominated by wind the fact that the r2 improved when aet was used implies a stronger relation to available water rather than just maximum emergy when gpp was computed for each continental biome and then the results regressed against aet and maxr figure 9 the regressions that resulted were a bit weaker r2 079 and r2 0 65 for aet and maxr respectively the suggestion is that the smoothing that results from computing global means for biome gpp results in a stronger relation between driving emergy and ecosystem productivity in other words using global means for gpp rather than using gpp for each continental biome reduces the variability in overall gpp and therefore increases the r2 of the regressions when regressions were conducted to evaluate correlations of aet and maxr with biome biomass the results were far less strong bottom graphs in figure 8 the variability was much greater yielding an r2 0 37 for aet vs biomass and r2 0 28 for maxr vs biomass it appears that accumulation of biomass is only slightly related to the intensity of the driving emergy other factors may be involved for instance temperature which modify environmental conditions 4 5 maximum emergy or multiplicity of emergy multiple regression analysis of biome productivity and biomass tables 6 and 7 suggested that while all the forms of driving renewable emergy explained some of the variation in gpp and biomass by far rain and solar energy were the most important and positively correlated while wind and geothermal were negatively correlated interestingly the multivariate adjusted r2 values were quite different from the r2 of the univariate regressions the multivariant adjusted r2 for gpp table 6 r2 0 79 decreased from the univariate aet vs gpp value figure 8 r2 0 89 while the multivariate adjusted r2 for biomass table 7 r2 0 84 was relatively similar to the univariate regression for rain and aet figure 9 r2 0 87 and r2 0 81 respectively the addition of solar energy had a positive effect in explaining some of the variance in biomass while it had little or no effect on gpp apparently while rain alone is a relatively good predictor of gpp the best model for biomass was a multiple regression that included solar energy and to a lesser degree wind it should be kept in mind that aet is always between 95 and 99 of maxr see table 2 in the moist ecosystems since maxr is composed of aet and runoff chemical potential in the dry biomes aet makes up only between 3 rock and ice biome and 50 desert biome of maxr the better fit of aet alone compared to maxr for the univariate regressions does suggest that runoff chemical potential might add a confounding factor to maxr it also suggests that while maxr is a pretty good correlate with productivity water used is a stronger one without the dry biomes maxr appears to be as good a predictor as aet the univariate and multiple regressions tables 6 and 7 suggest that rain and aet are the most important variables explaining variation in gpp odum 1996 had hypothesized based on computations of transformities of global rainfall in many of land based systems analyzed in his book that rain and more specifically the portion of rain that is used by vegetation aet was the most significant driver of ecosystems the analysis of multiple driving emergy sources confirms odum s original evaluations and strongly suggests that the water used by ecosystems aet is the dominate determinant of productivity interestingly the best model for biomass was a multivariant regression the strongest variable of which were aet solar and wind negative effect presumably the accumulation of biomass over time is not only affected by the available water used but by solar input and negatively affected by wind wind can be both a positive and negative influence on ecosystems at low velocities wind can be a positive driver of productivity by increasing evapotranspiration which in turn increases nutrient transport from roots to leaves for example at high velocities it has an increasing negative impact on the development of biomass as a result of defoliation and windthrow the univariant regressions supported a singular dominate driver rain but the addition of solar and geothermal resulted in a slight increase in explaining the variation in biomass 4 6 the impact of human induced land use change without question humans have altered the land cover of planet earth the year 1700 was taken as the boundary between pre anthropocene and the anthropocene it was felt that prior to 1700 there was very little influence from fossil fuel use for it was the arrival of the industrial revolution in mid 1700 that coal began to replace biomass as the main source of energy in the roughly 300 years since 1700 there has been a significant change in land cover resulting in 38 of the pre anthropocene terrestrial biome land area changed to human dominated land cover table 11 a majority of the terrestrial biomes nine out of 16 exhibit per cent change greater than 50 the large tundra 0 change and boreal forests 4 change are the reason that the total pre anthropocene terrestrial landcover is not greater than 50 using satellite imagery to evaluate current 2010 gpp and comparing to our estimates of pre anthropocene gpp resulted in a net change of 5 with many biomes exhibiting positive changes table 11 while we did not include agricultural lands in our analysis they were subtracted out before doing analysis of gpp those biomes with the largest increases in gpp were the biomes where human influences were dominated by agriculture this is presumably the result of several things first it is possible that some agricultural lands were inadvertently included and not masked out and when viewed from satellite sensors show the relatively high productivities characteristic of irrigated and fertilized land cover a second possibility is that of a spill over effect where runoff from agricultural lands increases productivity of surrounding natural areas of course the difference in production is not only that measured as gpp but also the ultimate fate of the productivity on the pre anthropocene earth productivity was cycled and recycled within ecological systems supporting diverse food chains of organisms in the current system the productivity increases that are seen in most biomes is used to support a diverse and complex human system with such declines in available productivity there must be an accompanying decline in the quantity and diversity of organisms that the global ecosystems can support studies of the human appropriation of net primary production hanpp have shown that between 13 and 40 of npp is being appropriated by humans haberl et al 2014 2007 krausmann et al 2013 vitousek et al 1986 if we assume that the areas of human occupation are equivalent to appropriated productivity then this study quantifies the hanpp in 2000 to be 38 of total available productivity table 11 a quantity within the upper bounds of the current estimates interestingly not only has this quantity of productivity been sequestered by humans but actually the productivity of these lands has been increased through management fertilization and irrigation so that if we again assume that all the lands under human domination are subsidized with water and nutrients the quantity of npp has increased while the overall decrease exhibited about 5 table 11 can be attributed to bare and urban lands without detailed measurements of standing biomass we can only estimate the losses of bnc that have resulted from human induced land use changes from available aerial coverage data the assumption of losses of 100 of above and below ground biomass from forested lands converted to other uses and 50 of above and below ground biomass from grassland and shrubland biomes resulted in losses totaling about 12 of standing biomass table 12 when converted to emdollars the loss represents em 70 trillion we used the data of sanderman et al 2017 to estimate soil carbon losses at 133pgc since the beginning of the anthropocene table 13 which when converted to emdollars totaled about em 18 5 trillion 5 conclusion the emergy supporting the geobiosphere based on the solar tidal and geothermal inputs totals 12 0 e 24 sej yr 1 when the emergy supporting the biomes of the geobiosphere is summed it totals 24 5 e 24 sej yr 1 see table 7 global total slightly over twice the geobiosphere emergy baseline geb many would ask how is this possible there is more energy supporting the biomes than is supporting the geobiosphere as a whole either there is an accounting error or there is some sort of double counting it is possible that there is some double counting but there are two factors that contribute the most to this apparent problem the first factor is a interesting and well known phenomena in spatial analysis known as the modifiable areal unit problem maup that we identified in a previous paper lee and brown 2019 the maup results from spatial aggregation and scale of analysis and ultimately results in statistical bias when summary statistics are computed from spatial data the second factor contributing this this apparent problem is related to the fact that the geobiosphere is a complex network of energy conversion processes where primary renewable emergy sources solar tidal and geothermal are transformed into secondary and then tertiary sources lags in the system storages of materials and potential energy storages result in more emergy transfer between components than is driving the system the dynamic interconnected nature of the geobiosphere strongly presupposes that simple static addition of the driving emergy does not account for feedback or cycling of emergy over time scales greater than one year while static evaluation considers inputs over a 1 year timeframe it is well known that the atmosphere oceans and land masses have turnover times much greater than one year it is therefore entirely reasonable that when the driving emergy of each biome is summed it totals more than twice the emergy that annually drives the geobiosphere as aristotle and many individuals since his time have stated the whole is greater than the sum of its parts each biome is driven by a unique signature of emergy sources yet emergy theory suggests that it is not the sum of the emergy inputs that drives ecosystems but the largest since embodied in each input is some emergy from the other inputs because of the interconnected nature of the biosphere network of emergy flows and transformations this study questions that assumption the simplistic mathematical conversion of taking the largest is just that simplistic it does not recognize the complexity of the geobiosphere network but assumes a series of rather linear transformations of the geb that result in rain wind river geopotential etc if this study did nothing else it calls into question this rather naive assumption of linearity the impact of humans on the geobiosphere is pervasive and far reaching still there are large areas of earth that remain somewhat untouched the tundra and boreal forests for instance while exhibiting nearly imperceptible land use change non the less they are under significant potential change from global climate effects how they adapt to these changes whether they will increase in productivity or whether biomass decreases markedly from fire and human exploitation remains uncertain while in the past it was suggested that the great expanse of tropical and sub tropical rain forests were the earth s systems that provided large scale buffering to global changes as they show marked signs of increased human induced change the only biomes left relatively intact may soon begin to go the way of all the others currently about 12 of the earth s biomass has been lost and about 8 of soil carbon this begs the question what is the appropriate quantity of untouched ecosystem function required to maintain a stable earth ecosystem are we approaching that limit dong joo lee methodology formal analysis data curation writing original draft mark brown conceptualization methodology writing reviewing

24713,framing environmental issues in a sustainability context requires that we highlight the interdependencies between ecological social and economic factors accordingly the socio ecological system ses which emphasizes the interplay between environmental and social dynamics seems to be the appropriate framework for analysis we applied this view to explore issues concerning the conservation of the remnant forests of the peri urban area of bogota colombia specifically we characterized this territory as a ses through a parsimonious set of fundamental across domain variables using elicitation based information we reconstructed interactions between these variables so that their interactive network could be visualized as alternative signed digraphs we analyzed these models by loop analysis to show that exploiting the structure of the interactions may help disentangling causative mechanisms for the response of remnant forests and other components of this ses to natural events loss of soil fertility policies subsidizing industrial production and social events internal migration social activism that we assumed as potential drivers of change our results highlight that integrating ecological and social variables in a unique interactive network can reveal important causal linkages that make remnant forests unexpectedly vulnerable to certain drivers but also that unexpected beneficial effects may occur clarifying why same drivers of change can be responsible for both deforestation and forest regrowth overall the analysis reveals that trade offs between desirable ecological and social outcomes are the rule and that potential win win outcomes across the triple bottom line of the sustainable development paradigm are difficult to achieve keywords forest conservation loop analysis socio ecological systems sustainability trade offs 1 introduction since the 1992 rio de janeiro summit on environment and development sustainability has become a uniting and purposeful focus for the twenty first century it recognizes that human society and nature are inevitably interdependent with causal connections that cross the classical boundaries within which scientific and operational knowledge have been settled azapagic 2003 gallopin 1994 fiksel 2006 pappas 2012 binder et al 2013 accordingly the socio ecological system ses seems to be the appropriate framework for comprehensive sustainability assessments berkes and folke 1998 ostrom 2009 levin et al 2012 berkes 2017 interdependencies propagate policy effects management actions and disturbances well beyond the targeted components anticipating the consequences may be important to design sustainable strategies but this requires clarifying causal linkages socio ecological interactions create multiple pathways through which impacts of the drivers of change can spread in the system pathway multiplicity creates an intricate scenario in which the chains of causally ordered events that produce the observed effects on system s components are not easy to reconstruct allen et al 2011 audouin et al 2013 vervoort et al 2014 we applied a qualitative modeling technique called loop analysis levins 1975 puccia and levins 1985 to the ses in which neotropical highly dynamic peri urban forest ecosystem adjacent to bogota colombia is embedded we used loop analysis to disentangle the complexity associated with policy formulation as well as planning and management in this ses loop analysis helps in this respect as it exploits the structure of the interactions to identify pathways responsible for the spreading of impacts and feedback that modulate their expression lambin and meyfroid 2010 huber et al 2013 dawson et al 2017 bodini et al 2018 bodini and clerici 2016 this allowed reconstructing causal linkages and predicting expected impacts of drivers of change qualitative analysis seems appropriate here because quantitative predictions require that the magnitude of pathways that spread impacts is known the lack of information concerning the form and intensity of most of the interactions precludes this possibility i e the intensity at which agricultural activity modulates the rate of human migration is unknown thus pathways could not be properly quantified so that predicting quantitatively their effect would be impossible we however overcame some of the problems of the pure qualitative approach by combining loop analysis with a numerical simulation technique which allowed us performing a semi quantitative analysis martone et al 2016 bodini et al 2018 we focus on colombia s capital bogota since similar to other urban areas in the andes it is surrounded by a large extent of peri urban forests and which are home to some of the highest levels of biodiversity and endemism in the world biodiversity hot spots van der hammen and cleef 1986 grau and aide 2008 moreno et al 2017 such ecosystems provide a large array of services to the growing andean population baldi and paruelo 2008 but they have been strongly impacted by socio political factors bogota and its surrounding suburban settlements for example have historically claimed agriculturally productive lands and large areas of natural forests and wetlands have been converted to productive areas baptista 2008 grau et al 2008 da gama torres 2011 sanchez cuervo and aide 2013a protecting the remnant forests has become a pillar for the sustainable development of the area baptiste et al 2017 clerici et al 2016 patterns of forest conversion and regrowth in the peri urban bogota and the neotropics have been said to depend on the interplay of multiple socio ecological factors and reflect the complexity of the processes occurring in such a highly transformed and densely populated region where the same factor can be a driver of both deforestation and recovery simultaneously bonilla moheno et al 2012 rubiano et al 2017 because of this complexity however cause and effect mechanisms responsible for these patterns are not fully understood further transformations are expected in this area because a future proliferation of economic and infrastructure development programs may follow the recent peace agreement between the colombian government and the guerrilla group fuerzas armadas revolucionarias de colombia farc has opened up understanding patterns of deforestation and anticipating the effects of development programs on the forest ecosystem can be possible if interdependencies between the components of this ses are explored and clarified the main objective of this paper is to show what useful insights loop analysis can provide to understand these interdependencies to this end we identified a parsimonious set of social and ecological variables to characterize the peri urban area of bogota as a ses then we mapped out their interactions and reconstructed a series of plausible network models for this ses finally we applied loop analysis to these simplified representations to i show how causal chains can be reconstructed by exploiting the structure of the interactions and identify pathways through which impacts spread in the ses ii predict the response of remnant forests and other components of this ses to selected across domain drivers of change and link the predicted impacts to their causal chains iii provide an explanation for the observed patterns of deforestation and forest regrowth and iv make an overall sustainability assessment by analyzing the effects of drivers of change on variables that can be used as proxies for indicators of environmental economic and social conditions 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study area is located around the colombian capital bogotá comprehending the vast sabana high elevation plain and neighboring mountain slopes fig 1 andean forests are characterized by different structures varying from young even aged shrub like forests dominated by pioneer tree species to more mature stands with a diverse species composition chazdon 2014 gonzález et al 2015 andean forests have undergone substantial land cover change in the region due to a complex interplay between deforestation land degradation and local forest regrowth rubiano et al 2017 most andean forests in this region were strongly exploited in the past century for wood production and substituted by cropping activities and cattle grazing etter et al 2008 steep slopes favor forest persistence more than 70 of the remnant forests are in fact located in areas with slopes over 25 mendoza and etter 2002 more accessible areas underwent transformation in which deforestation created patches of forests dispersed in a matrix of productive land etter and villa 2000 size reduction in forest patches is also the result of residential expansion road construction and industrial development that are connected to urban development fischer and lindenmayer 2007 botero garcia 2017 land conversion to productive or residential lands is still underway however loss of soil fertility and social drivers such as the colombian armed conflict have fueled land abandonment which has favored forest recovery acosta restrepo 2010 andrade núñez and aide 2018 shrubland locally known as rastrojo is an important component of the current landscape and it may correspond to vegetation which is gradually recovering from past disturbances or represents an arrested successional stage mesquita et al 2001 andean forests have the potential for being important biodiversity reservoirs and providing crucial ecosystem services armenteras et al 2007 girardin et al 2014 and their conservation has thus become matter of concern 2 2 loop analysis loop analysis is a qualitative technique that uses signed digraphs to represent networks of interacting variables levins 1975 puccia and levins 1985 the signed digraph depicts interactions between variables by only two types of connections arrows for positive effects and circle head links o for negative effects these links describe the effects of the variables on each other s rate of change loop analysis predicts the direction of change in the level e g biomass of a biological variable amount of a given production etc of system variables in response to parameter alteration targeted to one or more components i e press perturbations see bender et al 1984 bodini 2000 examples of press perturbations are the increased mortality or fecundity of a given species the increased rate of investment or the political actions of social activists in the local communities when a press perturbation increases the rate of change of the target variable this latter is said to undergo a positive input puccia and levins 1985 a negative input occurs when the press perturbation reduces the rate of change of the variable effects of an input may percolate to the other components that are connected to the target variable by the network their responses can be predicted using an algorithm whose main features are described in the supporting information appendix a these predictions give only the direction of change for the level of the variables increase decrease or no change 0 they are usually summarized in a table of predictions that accompanies any model examples of tables of predictions are presented in the figs 3 4 and 5 below each graph in models with few variables and or a limited number of connections expected changes for the variables can be tracked through the graph anatomy bodini 1998 2000 when variables and connections increase multiple pathways of interactions emerge and the probability that pathways have opposite effects increases i e some paths increase the variable others reduce its level consequently predictions may remain ambiguous to overcome this problem we used a numerical simulation based on a routine that converts in a matrix implementation the algorithm of loop analysis the routine assigns numerical values in the interval 0 1 to the coefficients of the community matrix i e the coefficients of the links in the signed digraph by randomly extracting them from a uniform distribution this procedure and the code for the r functions r core team 2014 are described in detail in the supporting information appendix a c 2 3 model development central to apply loop analysis is the possibility to diagram the structure of the interactions between the system s components first variables must be identified and the way they affect each other s rate of change must be translated in graphical terms according to the loop analysis symbolic language making these interconnections explicit implies translating an idea about the world into a signed digraph model because the multiplicity of the variables and their interactions in a ses would make this task overwhelming we simplified the analysis by focusing initially on a few key processes and a parsimonious set of variables and interactions according to the work of rubiano et al 2017 next we extended the list of the variables to include some of the potential drivers of change associated with likely developmental scenarios or that are currently under consideration literature analysis guided this effort etter and villa 2000 mendoza and etter 2002 armenteras et al 2007 armenteras et al 2011 rubiano et al 2017 we then evaluated these preliminary findings in a two day expert elicitation workshop with 10 invited experts in the areas of socio ecological systems urban planning landscape ecology forestry ecological modeling and geospatial analysis this participatory approach helped defining the study area the parsimonious set of variables to describe it as a ses their interactions and some of the most relevant factors and processes that acted as drivers for the observed change and some that likely will affect this ses this yielded an extended list of variables that were identified as being influential in the process of land cover change in the study area the models that we present in this work emphasize on realism and generality puccia and levins 1985 and necessarily leave out details in favor of a more general representation the characteristic approach that qualitative analysis privileges some of the approximations used in model representation will be elucidated while discussing the results 3 results and discussion 3 1 the study area core model variables interactions and graphs according to the literature acosta restrepo 2010 sanchez cuervo et al 2012 rubiano et al 2017 and references there in landscape transformations in the study area have been driven by the interplay of several processes forest conversion land reclamation for agricultural purposes urban expansion land abandonment human migration and forest recovery a minimal set of variables that could grasp the dynamics of the above listed processes were identified these core variables are described in table 1 the extension of forested land f c is the proxy for the forest cover urbanization and agricultural development were identified as main factors of forested land consumption anselm et al 2018 extension of the built up environment b l and of land converted to agricultural production a are their proxy variables water quality and availability w was selected because remnant forests play a key role in the water cycle and in the provisioning of this resource for human consumption ellison et al 2012 bonnesoeur et al 2019 the number of migrants m considers a relevant social factor migration which has been responsible for land transformation of this ses etter et al 2008 extension of shrubland s l completes the list because shrubland is the intermediate step through which abandoned agricultural land becomes forested land fig 2 depicts the interactions between the core variables according to the loop analysis symbolic language and describes their dynamic effects it must be pointed out that the relationships described in fig 2 in some cases can reproduce more general types of interaction but others are specific for the system under investigation such as for example interactions h and m in other contexts or systems in fact forest may reduce water availability through evapotranspiration and people can be forced to migration due to mechanization and substitution of labor for economic capital considering the latter phenomenon the specificity of the negative interaction between productive land and migration is due to the emphasis that in the workshop participants gave to the form of agricultural production that involve local communities and guarantee food security the possibility to have access to land would prevent people to migrate toward urban areas we assembled variables and interactions to form the networks to be analyzed qualitatively when knowledge about interactions is uncertain because the reports in the literature disagree information is unavailable or experts suggest different mechanisms of interaction then follow plausible alternatives here alternative graphs for the core model reflect different forms of land exploitation by the built up environment while there is no uncertainty about the urbanization of forested land it is not certain whether the built up environment grows also at the expenses of agricultural productive land and or shrubland thus we modeled four alternative configurations taking into account these possibilities these alternative graphs are illustrated in fig 3 in model 3a the built up land bl exploits only forested land fc in model 3b it grows at the expenses of forest cover and agricultural productive land a in model 3c exploitation is targeted to forest cover and shrubland sl and in model 3d the built up land exploits forested land shrubland and agricultural productive land we assumed all the variables as self regulated this depends on several factors which we summarize here in 1 mathematical convenience negative self loops tend to make the model qualitatively stable a necessary condition for the moving equilibrium approach to be applied puccia and levins 1985 2 realism the graphs unavoidably simplify a complex reality in which several factors affect the dynamics of the system but do not enter in the model as explicit variables to account for the connections with these external factors a self damping on the model variables can be added levins 1975 and puccia and levins 1985 detail the logic and the mathematics of this process because such connection exists for all the variables in the model it follows that self regulation can be extended to all of them thus adding a self damping term on all the variable can be realistic one example of these external factors is soil fertility which is also a prime cause of forest conversion to agricultural productive land because deforestation for agricultural purposes is targeted preferentially to more fertile soils aide and grau 2004 rubiano et al 2017 as this conversion proceeds more fertile areas become rarer in bogota s sabana high plain and this may slow down the process of land acquisition for agricultural production another crucial factor that controls deforestation is land morphology forest conversion to built up land and agricultural productive land occurs mainly in areas of lower altitude and less steep slopes rubiano et al 2017 mendoza and etter 2002 as the conversion of forested area proceeds less of the morphologically suitable land remains available for conversion this may slow down forested land conversion to agricultural productive land and built up land this mechanism thus can be thought of as a regulative factor for built up land and agricultural productive land dynamics it is considered in the self damping on a and b l 3 2 drivers of change soil fertility loss and migration factors considered to be drivers of land cover change were introduced in the models as press perturbations input on target variables forest regrowth has been taking over in the study area following land abandonment and the consequent migration toward urban areas aide and grau 2004 soil fertility loss and or agricultural intensification might have ignited this causal chain soil fertility has been indicated as favoring the rate of conversion of forested land into agricultural land aide and grau 2004 rubiano et al 2017 moran et al 2000 a reduced soil fertility thus acts as a negative press perturbation on a agricultural productive land for the sake of clarity in fig 4 we detail the predicted response of the system variables to this press perturbation using model 3c as reference rubiano et al 2017 observed in the sabana of bogotá an increasing trend in woody cover with a characteristic pattern in which forest regrowth is accompanied by land abandonment increased rural to urban migration and the occurrence of secondary succession on abandoned land a chain of causally ordered events was hypothesized to explain this pattern the loss of soil fertility might have ignited land abandonment thus fueling migration toward urban areas abandoned land may have undergone secondary succession that transformed fields no longer grazed or mowed in shrubland and then secondary forests similar dynamics have been documented in other areas of south america veldkamp et al 1992 rudel et al 2002 aide et al 2013 this chain of events implies i land abandonment ii increased number of migrants towards urban centers iii the augmentation of shrubland extension and forest cover and iv a reduction in the agricultural productive land the tables of prediction of model 3a and 3b reveal that such concomitant variations are possible following a negative press perturbation on variable a second row of the tables below the graphs inverted signs the number of migrant is predicted to augment m both shrubland s l and forest cover f c would increase and productive land is expected to decrease a as side effect the built up land is predicted to increase b l a plausible consequence of the augmented rural to urban migration indeed the sabana of bogotá has been experiencing soil degradation ministerio deambiente 2003 its population has been constantly increasing unisabana 2019 as well as the extension of built up land at the cost of productive land martínez herrera 2015 rodríguez et al 2013rodriguez et al 2013 projected land cover change in the colombian andes according to three different scenarios that they simulated using spatio temporal data on land use land cover change the one which was constructed by assuming an extension of cropland predicted a reduction of the forest cover in principle this scenario is simulated in our model assuming a positive input on a extension of crop land the models of fig 3 the only exception is model 3c yielded a response of forest cover and agricultural land that coincides with the outcomes of rodriguez et al simulations forest cover was predicted to diminish and agricultural land would increase the response of forest cover f c and shrubland s l to the negative input entering through a is different in the other models model 3c returns no expected change 0 in the table of predictions for both fc and sl model 3d predicts a tendency to increase for f c and no change for shrubland s l 0 the different articulation of the interactions in models 3c and 3d in respect to models 3a and 3b makes the number of pathways connecting a to f c and s l to increase in appendix b we single out the paths from a t o f c to help understanding this point positive paths responsible for the negative effect 1 1 it must be clarified here that according to the loop formula see appendix a because the sign of the path is multiplied by the sign of the press perturbation negative variation in the rate of change of a in this case positive paths carry a negative effect whereas negative paths produce positive effect increase in number contrasting the negative paths that carry a positive effect these positive paths counteract negative paths so that the positive predictions obtained in models 3a and 3b become null predictions this compensation depends on both the number of pathways and their magnitude this latter is obtained multiplying the intensity of the links that make the path see appendix a further insight can be obtained by focusing on the structure of the paths for example the negative input on a may yield a negative prediction for f c for particular combinations of link intensities 2 2 this possibility does not emerge from the numerical analysis because it mediates the outcomes of many simulation runs see appendix a and particular cases are obscured for the procedure takes averages three of the paths that carry positive effect and thus would decrease f c for a negative press on a are formed by the links that account for the exploitation of shrubland by the built up land s l b l b l o s l see appendix b if shrubland is intensively used to extend the built up land the null prediction may turn into a negative expectation for f c in model 3a and 3b in which b l does not exploit shrubland the loss of soil fertility negative press on a makes forest cover increasing with no uncertainty if the built up land expands on shrubland model 3c and 3d forest regrowth is less likely to occur because shrubland converted to urban area may not complete the succession to secondary forest in this framework the conspicuous forest regrowth documented in the area near bogota rubiano et al 2017 can be due to a moderate or null conversion of shrubland to built up land a hypothesis that we present with circumspection and that should be corroborated by further data analysis and observations according to these outcomes model 3a and model 3b seem to better represent the observed dynamics rubiano et al 2017 in colombia individuals internally displaced by conflicts produced strong migratory fluxes toward urban areas lozano garcia et al 2010 migration m has been selected as a core variable in the understanding that migratory flows have had a substantial impact on the territorial dynamics of the study area albuja and ceballos 2010 the incoming flow of individuals is described by assuming a constant positive parameter in the equation for the rate of change of m and this translates into a negative self loop link on variable m in the graph puccia and levins 1985puccia and levins 1985 and bodini 2000 explain why a positive constant flux in the dynamic equation for a variable becomes a negative self loop on its node in the graph the armed conflict augmented this migratory flow from outside the study area ibañez and vélez 2008 and a positive press perturbation can reasonably be assumed in the rate of change for m in fig 3 predictions about this positive press are listed along the rows labelled m the entry point of the perturbation forest cover shows a tendency to decrease across the models except for model 3b in which this component would be increasing f c a closer look to the pathways connecting the entry point of the perturbation variable m with the effect variables f c provides clues to understand model predictions see appendix b in model 3a three paths propagates to f c the effect of the migratory flow 1 m b l o f c s i g n 2 m b l o w a o f c s i g n 3 m b l o w a o s l f c s i g n effects of the paths can be causally interpreted by combining the nature sign of each link forming the path with the predicted variations of the variables along the path in path 1 migration flow increases the number of immigrants m this component exerts a positive effect on the rate of change of b l m b l and this latter is predicted to increase b l b l increases at the expenses of the forested land b l o f c which would be shrinking 3 3 this is not shown as a as a negative prediction on f c because the table of predictions shows the overall effect of the three paths f c on the contrary paths 2 and 3 have a positive effect on f c in 2 the augmented built up land increases water consumption rate b l o w and water availability diminishes w water shortage diminish the positive effect that this resource has on the rate of change of a w a and this latter variable is expected to decrease a as a possible consequence it can be abandoned and natural succession would take over to shrubland which in fact is predicted to increase s l the lower level for a reduces its negative effect on forested land a o f c with beneficial effect on this component path 3 includes also shrubland the lessening predicted for a diminish its negative action on the rate of change of sl so this latter would augment s l favoring forests s l f c the positive effects of paths 2 and 3 tend to mitigate the negative effect of the exploitation by the built up land which however remains preponderant the two positive pathways in fact are longer than the negative path and the magnitude of their effect attenuates along the path the overall effect can thus be a net loss of forested area model 3b predicts a tendency to increase for f c following the positive press on m increased migratory flow in building this graph we hypothesized that the built up environment b l would exploit also agricultural productive land corporación cactus 2014 el nuevo siglo 2020 due to this connection the number of paths linking m to f c increases by two positive paths in respect to model 3a they are m b l o a o f c and m b l o w a o f c overall there are 4 positive paths and one negative see appendix b and the numerical analysis shows that the former prevail making the level of f c increase in models 3c and 3d the different ways through which built up land exploits available land implies further paths but their overall effect remains negative and an increased migratory flow is predicted to negatively impact forest cover the causal interpretation of predictions based on the paths may help interpret the evidence that forest regrowth and deforestation that are opposing forces may act simultaneously rubiano et al 2017 suggesting in what circumstances one may prevail over the other so far two types of press perturbations have been considered reduced soil fertility and increased immigration rate in both cases we have shown that the existence of opposite paths may determine the occurrence of forest regrowth or deforestation by scrolling down the first column of each table in fig 3 one can make an overall assessment about the possibilities that same press perturbations may induce regrowth and deforestation the first column of each table in fig 3 shows expected changes in the level of forest cover for press perturbation entering through any of the system variables whenever a predictions is not certain 0 multiple paths with opposite effects exist that spread the impact of the press perturbation to f c this creates the conditions for deforestation or forest regrowth to occur following the same cause the press perturbation the occurrence of either effects depends on the strength of the paths and thus on the magnitude of the interaction links model 3d shows the highest number of uncertain predictions 4 out of 6 for press perturbation on a b l s l m in the other three models uncertain predictions are 2 out of 6 for each graph although not for the same input the highest number of uncertain predictions in model 3d depends on the complexity of its structure which accounts for the concomitant exploitation of forests shrubland and agricultural productive land for urban expansion also with more interactions the number of paths connecting any two variables may increase and the probability that these paths have different effect sign increases as well according to these results it can be hypothesized that the increment of forested land in the study area rubiano et al 2017 may not be as surprising as it may appear despite the many drivers that enhance deforestation through the analysis of the structure of the interactions that encompass a range of environmental and socioeconomic conditions factors that contribute to gains and losses of forest area may become explicit this suggests that also for other areas of colombia where forest regrowth was documented sanchez cuervo et al 2012 sanchez cuervo and aide 2013b elucidating the pathways that spread the effects of drivers might contribute to frame the observed changes in a causative perspective 3 3 the study area extended model variables interactions and graph the extended models for the study area are summarized in fig 5 they have been conceived to capture some of the complex transformations that have happened in this ses in the last decades meza 2008 armenteras et al 2007 acosta restrepo 2010 and references there in some of the main drivers of transformation were introduced as additional variables in the core models to allow a glimpse at the dilemmas that characterize potential developmental trajectories and their implications for forest conservation and sustainability in the study area a prominent feature of this territory is the development of industrial activities and services acosta restrepo 2010 they have been included as a unique variable called i s industry and services this component has been thought of as one that negatively affects the rate of change of variable a i s o a because medium industrial activity seeks for larger less congested less expensive locations to establish or resettle and it has progressively been leaving avoiding the city exploiting rural areas acosta restrepo 2010 if industry and services create job opportunities and attract migrants to the urban and suburban areas these opportunities are generally offered at low salary watkins 2001 gillin 2014 black 2015 cheap labor may have become a diffuse condition sustained by the consistent migration flows and it has been included in the models as a new variable named cl the models depict migration as if it favors the diffusion of cheap labor m c l which however may reduce the migratory flow c l o m because cheap labor may be perceived negatively by people cheap labor is depicted as having a positive effect on industry and services c l i s which in turn favor the rate of diffusion of cheap labor i s c l road networks shape the dynamics of this ses and affect the disperse occupation of the rural territory overall the transformation of rural areas into a developed urban continuum is sustained by a scattered and unplanned road expansion acosta restrepo 2010 to capture this uncoordinated development road network r n is thought of as responding only to the built up environment b l in a single connection with positive feedback r n is enhancing the rate of expansion of the built up land r n b l and the built up land returns a positive effect to r n b l r n because urban expansion requires access facilities the graphs of fig 5 5a 5b were obtained by superimposing these new connections onto models 3a and 3b the counterparts for models 3c and 3d did not add significant insights and are illustrated separately in the supplemental material appendix b p 10 13 forest conservation carries a value per se but in such a heavily modified environment like our study area it should be framed in an overall sustainability perspective in which environmental goals are combined with social and economic achievements the models in fig 5 help making this comprehensive sustainability assessment some of their variables in fact can be easily and intuitively associated to the three dimensions of sustainability forest cover f c enhances the conservation of ecological functions and the associated ecosystem services so that preserving it contributes to the environmental dimension of sustainability the same applies to water quality and availability w as it guarantees both human and wildlife survival as well as ecological functions i s industry and services designate the level of economic prosperity and can be considered a pillar of the economic dimension of sustainability finally the social dimension implies cohesion level of welfare and other attributes that could not be considered in full by the models presented here one variable that can be proxy for social conditions is c l cheap labor diffusion of cheap labor in fact implies low salaries for the workers with negative effect on family welfare less access to services education health care etc such conditions may disrupt social cohesion thus the diffusion of cheap labor reduces the quality of living and accordingly it may be considered as a cost proxy for social sustainability considering that fc and w are benefit proxies the higher their value the better it is an ideal scenario is one in which policies or management actions create conditions for the latter to increase and for the cost indicator to diminish on the other hand increasing fc and w and reducing cl match with some of the sustainable goals that the un defined to achieve a better and more sustainable future such as goal 1 no poverty goal 6 clean water and sanitation and goal 15 life on land among others griggs et al 2014 policies that increase the rate at which productive activities and services are created e g subsidizing incentives introduce a positive press perturbation in the system through variable i s expectations are that production and services would increase i s water quality and availability decrease w and a larger diffusion of underpaid work conditions is predicted c l and for model 5 b in this scenario forested land is expected to increase f c the analysis of the paths clarifies this result in model 5a as many as 11 paths connect i s to f c see appendix b 6 of them are positive and 5 negative the stronger and shorter are all positive i s o a o f c i s o a o s l f c i s o w a o f c i s o w b l o f c in these paths the positive effect on f c depends on the interference that i s produce along the path with variables that consume forested land mainly agricultural land and built up land in model 5b the overall number of paths that connect these two components increase to 17 of which 9 are negative still the shortest and stronger are positive and the overall effect on forested land is positive the predicted increase of forest cover combined with the positive prediction on shrubland s l indicates that model 5a and 5b replicate the model that rubiano et al 2017 proposed to explain the pattern of land cover change they observed in this area and that was characterized by a substantial regrowth of secondary forests they hypothesized that the development of productive activities and services could have made urban centers attractive to rural populations which moved to urban areas abandoned lands may have undergone succession passing through the state of shrubland to end in new secondary forests this mechanism has been underlined by calbi et al 2020 and matches with one of the two deforestation models conceived by rudel and roper 1997 according to which the deforestation rate should be reduced as the economy develops with beneficial effect on forest cover and their ecosystem services nevertheless the interpretation proposed by rubiano et al and the rudel and ruper s model imply a chain of events that includes land abandonment nonfarm jobs that might attract people to cities and consequent increased migration in this study model 5a predicts a null effect on the level of migration for a positive press on industry and services this discrepancy depends on the hypotheses we made that i cheap labor plays a crucial role in this ses and ii it may prevent people to migrate i s increases migration via the path i s o a o m but inhibits it through the other path i s c l o m so the two paths tend to compensate each other and this yields the null prediction however if cheap labor would not be a sufficient reason to prevent people to abandon then the outcomes of model 5a replicate in full the pattern of rudel and ruper s model overall if the economy connected with industry and services is expected to prosper following the press perturbation on i s it is not so for social welfare and ecosystem services water quality and availability tend to decrease although forest conservation seems to improve underpaid work is a threat for welfare the unions and or social activist act so as to curb the diffusion of this condition for example by increasing self consciousness of workers soliciting the governmental levels to enforce legislative working frameworks such as the minimum employment rights and increasing public opinion awareness watkins 2001 gillin 2014 black 2015 this activity enters the system as a negative press perturbation on cheap labor c l the models predicts that following this negative input reverse the signs in the last row of the tables of predictions in fig 5 cheap labor would decrease c l thus improving social sustainability the level of industrial production and services would be lower i s and a reduction in the extension of forested land f c would occur with negative consequences for economic and environmental sustainability water quality and availability is predicted not to change but still the multiplicity of paths that connect c l to w makes this prediction strongly dependent on paths strength if industrial production and service prosperity depended heavily on cheap labor for their prosperity then it is straightforward that i s would decrease following a reduction in the rate of diffusion of cheap labor this is a strong assumption of the models but it also reflects a reality of the developing colombia watkins 2001 gillin 2014 black 2015 an unexpected result is the predicted decrease of forest cover as due to initiatives against cheap labor browsing the paths that connect these two variables see appendix b sheds light on this outcome out of 13 paths connecting c l to f c as many as 8 are positive the shortest more intense paths are in this group accordingly positive paths prevail over negative ones and this prevalence is responsible for the negative effect to f c as explained about the core models positive paths reinforce the effect of the press perturbation if this latter is negative it reduces the rate of change of the affected variable c l in this case the effect is negative the causal chain at work here can be followed considering as an example the strongest path c l o m b l o f c combined with the concomitant variation predicted for the variables that make the path because c l is expected to decrease c l its negative action on m c l o m diminishes and this latter variable s rate of change would increase with a final beneficial effect on its level m the number of migrants positively affects the rate of urban expansion m b l and the extension of the built up land shows a tendency to increase b l finally because b l exploits forested land b l o f c this latter variable is predicted to decrease f c this discussion holds also for model 5b with a slightly higher level of uncertainty some predictions signal only tendencies to change as signs are accompanied by a question mark these results highlight that efforts toward social sustainability might have adverse effect on environmental sustainability to summarize for press perturbations on i s and c l trade offs between sustainability goals seem unavoidable because the response of the variables that can be associated to environmental social and economic sustainability is such that a win win situation that involves their concomitant improvement never occurs the intensification of road construction is a positive press perturbation on r n and the expected consequences slightly differ between models 5a and 5b the former predicts a tendency reduction of the forested land f c in agreement with acosta restrepo s 2010 statements model 5b leads to opposite conclusions f c this different behavior is clearly due to the exploitative dynamics of the built up land which concentrates on forested land in model 5a but it exploits also agricultural productive land in model 5b in particular there are 9 paths connecting r n to f c in model 5a of which only three are negative but they include the strongest paths the negative paths remain the same in model 5b but the number of positive paths increase and their overall effect prevails over that of the negative paths paths are listed in appendix b the tendency to increase shown by f c in model 5b is somehow counterintuitive and depends on the exploitation of agricultural land by the built up environment if b l grows more at the expenses of a than it consumes forested land the outcome may be a positive effect on forests here quantitative statements about the link strength would be necessary for exact predictions the response of the other components to the positive press perturbation on road network coincide in the two graphs cheap labor shows a tendency to increase c l in 5 a c l in 5 b water resources deteriorate both quantitatively and quantitatively c l in 5 a c l in 5 b w in 5 a w in 5 b industrial production and services are predicted to decrease in model 5a but they would increase in model 5b an unbalanced road network which simply tracks the urban expansion as it has been represented here does not seem at least according to our models predictions promoting environmental sustainability this is in agreement with acosta restrepo s 2010 and botero garcia s 2017 statements that this form of infrastructure production without integrating a rational environmentally sound road network has created a critical depletion of ecologically important corridors with negative effects on forests and has produced an overall degradation of the hydrological system road development has also revealed an explanatory variable in regression model aimed at explaining deforestation in this area rodríguez et al 2013rodriguez et al 2013 although in other regions it is not so armenteras et al 2013 protecting forests is a priority to preserve biodiversity and ecosystem services appropriate policies have been called for botero garcia 2017 and conservation efforts for example could focus on areas with low levels of protection and high rates of land transformation romero ruiz et al 2011 sanchez cuervo et al 2012 such as the study area remnant forests correspond to old growth forests harbor considerable levels of biodiversity and could therefore be used as core areas to implement a protected areas network that can integrate the increasing areas of regrowth forests to shield against the high conversion risks implementing protection can be done through a regulatory agency empowered to slow down urban expansion rate by controlling the release of permits for new constructions the action of such governmental agency is identified by variable p e p e protection effort in model 5c deforestation would activate the agency f c o p e which responds inhibiting urban expansion s rate p e o b l p e i s self damped because it can act only within its local mandate for enforcement and is bounded by state laws budget personnel bureaucratic lag time and is affected by lobbying pressure increasing the rate at which protection is made operational positive press perturbation on p e interestingly may have beneficial consequences on forested land f c water quality and availability w production and services i s and social welfare c l thus activating a mechanism of protection for forests seems to be under the hypotheses of this model exercise the sole action that can improve the overall sustainability and enhance ecosystem services identifying the direct and indirect drivers of deforestation and understanding the complexity of their interlinkages are often difficult studies that investigated causes of land cover change in colombia shared a common approach based on the analysis of land cover patterns from satellite images or aerial photographs combined with regression models that identified possible drivers of change among the explanatory variables that resulted significant rodríguez et al 2012rodriguez et al 2012 sanchez cuervo and aide 2013 rubiano et al 2017 these studies highlighted which variables could explain the observed patterns but did not inform about the mechanisms that produced such relationship in this we see the potential for integration of the statistical approach with the modeling approach discussed here for example qualitative models could be constructed using as variables the factors that resulted significant in explain the observed patters at the same time qualitative models developed through expert elicitation with their predictions can direct the selection of variables in the statistical analysis 4 conclusions contemporary environmental challenges call for research approaches in which the ecosystem is part of a larger unit of investigation that embeds socioeconomic dynamics in this study we have framed the dynamics of neotropical peri urban forests in and around the sabana de bogota in the context of its ses the results of this research confirm that integrating ecological and social variables in a unique interactive network can reveal unexpected causal linkages between across domain variables specifically the models presented here bring to light mechanisms that may explain the observed patterns of deforestation and forest regrowth in the study area any sess is challenging to model because their vast array of interactions confounds cause and effects that is why in the literature conceptual frameworks on the subject have flourished whereas less methodological and practical applications have seen the light bodin and tengö 2012 using a parsimonious set of variables we reduced the complexity of the system to become tractable and by exploiting its network structure we simulated the response of the core variables to impacts of natural events loss of soil fertility policies subsidizing industrial production and social events internal migration social activism our conclusions suggest hypothesis that need to be corroborated by further analysis the main hypotheses are that 1 remnant forests may be unexpectedly vulnerable to across domain drivers of change and also that unexpected beneficial effects may occur suggesting possible mechanisms through which the same drivers can be responsible for both deforestation and forest regrowth 2 trade offs between desirable ecological and social outcomes are the rule and that potential win win outcomes across the triple bottom line of the sustainable development paradigm are difficult to achieve the analysis of the causal paths may shed light on mechanisms responsible for overlapping and conflicts between desirable goals associated with nature conservation urban expansion and social life qualitative modeling may also help prioritize competing demands for forest protection ecosystem services economic and social benefits that said there are relevant variables that we did not include because their dynamics could not be clearly translated in the language of the loop models one such variable is land value formal and informal land market land price are powerful drivers but depend on a multiplicity of factors e g different income groups economic activities political pressures lobbying so that a clear pattern of interactions with the other variables was difficult to identify also certain variables have been considered with a simplified dynamic in forest cover for example patchiness was not taken into account despite its importance in forest dynamics simplification is both legitimate and necessary as long as we are cautious are willing to change the original underlying assumptions as necessary and build new models and carefully interpret the model s predictions in this work a rapid assessment of models predictions was conducted on the core models using evidences or hypotheses that emerged from the literature also extended models were developed to offer an example of the potential of the qualitative analysis applied to the study area s ses for a practical impact of qualitative models however predictions must be tested against field data to this end long term data set obtained under the effects of documented press perturbations are needed but in the case of this ses historical records of data pertaining the variables of interests are either not existent or not organized in a meaningful data set useful to assessing qualitative predictions bodini et al 2018 only through a validation by field data appropriate models can be developed accordingly this research has the merit to show the potential that loop analysis has in investigating complex sess loop analysis has the necessary adaptability and flexibility to be used in sess making predictions in that context will become more difficult because of the uncertainty associated with new unknown events changing dynamics and lack of quantitative data loop analysis allows including and discarding variables easily and above all they permit working with variables and links that are not readily measurable but their effects are crucial qualitative methods are also inexpensive therefore the process of qualitative modeling can be public reproducible and intelligible in a way that a large simulation project cannot be other methods of qualitative analysis are employed to explore the complexity of socio ecological systems causal loop diagrams sterman 2000 share a similar feedback approach to complex systems that loop analysis employs however although we recognize the validity and the aesthetics of the cld in our study especially because it included a participatory approach using loop analysis avoided misunderstandings about link definition polarity in the language of cld confusion between rates and stocks in variable selection in la variables are only stocks or levels and provided long term predictions a feature of la in the framework of moving equilibrium the conclusions derived from qualitative analysis do not allow for precise prediction or decisions about optimal courses of action but they do permit us to decide the particular directions to push on a system in order to move it in a desired e g sustainable direction often this is all we need initially for shaping trajectories for a development that is socially inclusive economically just and environmentally compatible however sustainability is certainly dynamic qualitative models outline that there may not be optimal

24713,framing environmental issues in a sustainability context requires that we highlight the interdependencies between ecological social and economic factors accordingly the socio ecological system ses which emphasizes the interplay between environmental and social dynamics seems to be the appropriate framework for analysis we applied this view to explore issues concerning the conservation of the remnant forests of the peri urban area of bogota colombia specifically we characterized this territory as a ses through a parsimonious set of fundamental across domain variables using elicitation based information we reconstructed interactions between these variables so that their interactive network could be visualized as alternative signed digraphs we analyzed these models by loop analysis to show that exploiting the structure of the interactions may help disentangling causative mechanisms for the response of remnant forests and other components of this ses to natural events loss of soil fertility policies subsidizing industrial production and social events internal migration social activism that we assumed as potential drivers of change our results highlight that integrating ecological and social variables in a unique interactive network can reveal important causal linkages that make remnant forests unexpectedly vulnerable to certain drivers but also that unexpected beneficial effects may occur clarifying why same drivers of change can be responsible for both deforestation and forest regrowth overall the analysis reveals that trade offs between desirable ecological and social outcomes are the rule and that potential win win outcomes across the triple bottom line of the sustainable development paradigm are difficult to achieve keywords forest conservation loop analysis socio ecological systems sustainability trade offs 1 introduction since the 1992 rio de janeiro summit on environment and development sustainability has become a uniting and purposeful focus for the twenty first century it recognizes that human society and nature are inevitably interdependent with causal connections that cross the classical boundaries within which scientific and operational knowledge have been settled azapagic 2003 gallopin 1994 fiksel 2006 pappas 2012 binder et al 2013 accordingly the socio ecological system ses seems to be the appropriate framework for comprehensive sustainability assessments berkes and folke 1998 ostrom 2009 levin et al 2012 berkes 2017 interdependencies propagate policy effects management actions and disturbances well beyond the targeted components anticipating the consequences may be important to design sustainable strategies but this requires clarifying causal linkages socio ecological interactions create multiple pathways through which impacts of the drivers of change can spread in the system pathway multiplicity creates an intricate scenario in which the chains of causally ordered events that produce the observed effects on system s components are not easy to reconstruct allen et al 2011 audouin et al 2013 vervoort et al 2014 we applied a qualitative modeling technique called loop analysis levins 1975 puccia and levins 1985 to the ses in which neotropical highly dynamic peri urban forest ecosystem adjacent to bogota colombia is embedded we used loop analysis to disentangle the complexity associated with policy formulation as well as planning and management in this ses loop analysis helps in this respect as it exploits the structure of the interactions to identify pathways responsible for the spreading of impacts and feedback that modulate their expression lambin and meyfroid 2010 huber et al 2013 dawson et al 2017 bodini et al 2018 bodini and clerici 2016 this allowed reconstructing causal linkages and predicting expected impacts of drivers of change qualitative analysis seems appropriate here because quantitative predictions require that the magnitude of pathways that spread impacts is known the lack of information concerning the form and intensity of most of the interactions precludes this possibility i e the intensity at which agricultural activity modulates the rate of human migration is unknown thus pathways could not be properly quantified so that predicting quantitatively their effect would be impossible we however overcame some of the problems of the pure qualitative approach by combining loop analysis with a numerical simulation technique which allowed us performing a semi quantitative analysis martone et al 2016 bodini et al 2018 we focus on colombia s capital bogota since similar to other urban areas in the andes it is surrounded by a large extent of peri urban forests and which are home to some of the highest levels of biodiversity and endemism in the world biodiversity hot spots van der hammen and cleef 1986 grau and aide 2008 moreno et al 2017 such ecosystems provide a large array of services to the growing andean population baldi and paruelo 2008 but they have been strongly impacted by socio political factors bogota and its surrounding suburban settlements for example have historically claimed agriculturally productive lands and large areas of natural forests and wetlands have been converted to productive areas baptista 2008 grau et al 2008 da gama torres 2011 sanchez cuervo and aide 2013a protecting the remnant forests has become a pillar for the sustainable development of the area baptiste et al 2017 clerici et al 2016 patterns of forest conversion and regrowth in the peri urban bogota and the neotropics have been said to depend on the interplay of multiple socio ecological factors and reflect the complexity of the processes occurring in such a highly transformed and densely populated region where the same factor can be a driver of both deforestation and recovery simultaneously bonilla moheno et al 2012 rubiano et al 2017 because of this complexity however cause and effect mechanisms responsible for these patterns are not fully understood further transformations are expected in this area because a future proliferation of economic and infrastructure development programs may follow the recent peace agreement between the colombian government and the guerrilla group fuerzas armadas revolucionarias de colombia farc has opened up understanding patterns of deforestation and anticipating the effects of development programs on the forest ecosystem can be possible if interdependencies between the components of this ses are explored and clarified the main objective of this paper is to show what useful insights loop analysis can provide to understand these interdependencies to this end we identified a parsimonious set of social and ecological variables to characterize the peri urban area of bogota as a ses then we mapped out their interactions and reconstructed a series of plausible network models for this ses finally we applied loop analysis to these simplified representations to i show how causal chains can be reconstructed by exploiting the structure of the interactions and identify pathways through which impacts spread in the ses ii predict the response of remnant forests and other components of this ses to selected across domain drivers of change and link the predicted impacts to their causal chains iii provide an explanation for the observed patterns of deforestation and forest regrowth and iv make an overall sustainability assessment by analyzing the effects of drivers of change on variables that can be used as proxies for indicators of environmental economic and social conditions 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study area is located around the colombian capital bogotá comprehending the vast sabana high elevation plain and neighboring mountain slopes fig 1 andean forests are characterized by different structures varying from young even aged shrub like forests dominated by pioneer tree species to more mature stands with a diverse species composition chazdon 2014 gonzález et al 2015 andean forests have undergone substantial land cover change in the region due to a complex interplay between deforestation land degradation and local forest regrowth rubiano et al 2017 most andean forests in this region were strongly exploited in the past century for wood production and substituted by cropping activities and cattle grazing etter et al 2008 steep slopes favor forest persistence more than 70 of the remnant forests are in fact located in areas with slopes over 25 mendoza and etter 2002 more accessible areas underwent transformation in which deforestation created patches of forests dispersed in a matrix of productive land etter and villa 2000 size reduction in forest patches is also the result of residential expansion road construction and industrial development that are connected to urban development fischer and lindenmayer 2007 botero garcia 2017 land conversion to productive or residential lands is still underway however loss of soil fertility and social drivers such as the colombian armed conflict have fueled land abandonment which has favored forest recovery acosta restrepo 2010 andrade núñez and aide 2018 shrubland locally known as rastrojo is an important component of the current landscape and it may correspond to vegetation which is gradually recovering from past disturbances or represents an arrested successional stage mesquita et al 2001 andean forests have the potential for being important biodiversity reservoirs and providing crucial ecosystem services armenteras et al 2007 girardin et al 2014 and their conservation has thus become matter of concern 2 2 loop analysis loop analysis is a qualitative technique that uses signed digraphs to represent networks of interacting variables levins 1975 puccia and levins 1985 the signed digraph depicts interactions between variables by only two types of connections arrows for positive effects and circle head links o for negative effects these links describe the effects of the variables on each other s rate of change loop analysis predicts the direction of change in the level e g biomass of a biological variable amount of a given production etc of system variables in response to parameter alteration targeted to one or more components i e press perturbations see bender et al 1984 bodini 2000 examples of press perturbations are the increased mortality or fecundity of a given species the increased rate of investment or the political actions of social activists in the local communities when a press perturbation increases the rate of change of the target variable this latter is said to undergo a positive input puccia and levins 1985 a negative input occurs when the press perturbation reduces the rate of change of the variable effects of an input may percolate to the other components that are connected to the target variable by the network their responses can be predicted using an algorithm whose main features are described in the supporting information appendix a these predictions give only the direction of change for the level of the variables increase decrease or no change 0 they are usually summarized in a table of predictions that accompanies any model examples of tables of predictions are presented in the figs 3 4 and 5 below each graph in models with few variables and or a limited number of connections expected changes for the variables can be tracked through the graph anatomy bodini 1998 2000 when variables and connections increase multiple pathways of interactions emerge and the probability that pathways have opposite effects increases i e some paths increase the variable others reduce its level consequently predictions may remain ambiguous to overcome this problem we used a numerical simulation based on a routine that converts in a matrix implementation the algorithm of loop analysis the routine assigns numerical values in the interval 0 1 to the coefficients of the community matrix i e the coefficients of the links in the signed digraph by randomly extracting them from a uniform distribution this procedure and the code for the r functions r core team 2014 are described in detail in the supporting information appendix a c 2 3 model development central to apply loop analysis is the possibility to diagram the structure of the interactions between the system s components first variables must be identified and the way they affect each other s rate of change must be translated in graphical terms according to the loop analysis symbolic language making these interconnections explicit implies translating an idea about the world into a signed digraph model because the multiplicity of the variables and their interactions in a ses would make this task overwhelming we simplified the analysis by focusing initially on a few key processes and a parsimonious set of variables and interactions according to the work of rubiano et al 2017 next we extended the list of the variables to include some of the potential drivers of change associated with likely developmental scenarios or that are currently under consideration literature analysis guided this effort etter and villa 2000 mendoza and etter 2002 armenteras et al 2007 armenteras et al 2011 rubiano et al 2017 we then evaluated these preliminary findings in a two day expert elicitation workshop with 10 invited experts in the areas of socio ecological systems urban planning landscape ecology forestry ecological modeling and geospatial analysis this participatory approach helped defining the study area the parsimonious set of variables to describe it as a ses their interactions and some of the most relevant factors and processes that acted as drivers for the observed change and some that likely will affect this ses this yielded an extended list of variables that were identified as being influential in the process of land cover change in the study area the models that we present in this work emphasize on realism and generality puccia and levins 1985 and necessarily leave out details in favor of a more general representation the characteristic approach that qualitative analysis privileges some of the approximations used in model representation will be elucidated while discussing the results 3 results and discussion 3 1 the study area core model variables interactions and graphs according to the literature acosta restrepo 2010 sanchez cuervo et al 2012 rubiano et al 2017 and references there in landscape transformations in the study area have been driven by the interplay of several processes forest conversion land reclamation for agricultural purposes urban expansion land abandonment human migration and forest recovery a minimal set of variables that could grasp the dynamics of the above listed processes were identified these core variables are described in table 1 the extension of forested land f c is the proxy for the forest cover urbanization and agricultural development were identified as main factors of forested land consumption anselm et al 2018 extension of the built up environment b l and of land converted to agricultural production a are their proxy variables water quality and availability w was selected because remnant forests play a key role in the water cycle and in the provisioning of this resource for human consumption ellison et al 2012 bonnesoeur et al 2019 the number of migrants m considers a relevant social factor migration which has been responsible for land transformation of this ses etter et al 2008 extension of shrubland s l completes the list because shrubland is the intermediate step through which abandoned agricultural land becomes forested land fig 2 depicts the interactions between the core variables according to the loop analysis symbolic language and describes their dynamic effects it must be pointed out that the relationships described in fig 2 in some cases can reproduce more general types of interaction but others are specific for the system under investigation such as for example interactions h and m in other contexts or systems in fact forest may reduce water availability through evapotranspiration and people can be forced to migration due to mechanization and substitution of labor for economic capital considering the latter phenomenon the specificity of the negative interaction between productive land and migration is due to the emphasis that in the workshop participants gave to the form of agricultural production that involve local communities and guarantee food security the possibility to have access to land would prevent people to migrate toward urban areas we assembled variables and interactions to form the networks to be analyzed qualitatively when knowledge about interactions is uncertain because the reports in the literature disagree information is unavailable or experts suggest different mechanisms of interaction then follow plausible alternatives here alternative graphs for the core model reflect different forms of land exploitation by the built up environment while there is no uncertainty about the urbanization of forested land it is not certain whether the built up environment grows also at the expenses of agricultural productive land and or shrubland thus we modeled four alternative configurations taking into account these possibilities these alternative graphs are illustrated in fig 3 in model 3a the built up land bl exploits only forested land fc in model 3b it grows at the expenses of forest cover and agricultural productive land a in model 3c exploitation is targeted to forest cover and shrubland sl and in model 3d the built up land exploits forested land shrubland and agricultural productive land we assumed all the variables as self regulated this depends on several factors which we summarize here in 1 mathematical convenience negative self loops tend to make the model qualitatively stable a necessary condition for the moving equilibrium approach to be applied puccia and levins 1985 2 realism the graphs unavoidably simplify a complex reality in which several factors affect the dynamics of the system but do not enter in the model as explicit variables to account for the connections with these external factors a self damping on the model variables can be added levins 1975 and puccia and levins 1985 detail the logic and the mathematics of this process because such connection exists for all the variables in the model it follows that self regulation can be extended to all of them thus adding a self damping term on all the variable can be realistic one example of these external factors is soil fertility which is also a prime cause of forest conversion to agricultural productive land because deforestation for agricultural purposes is targeted preferentially to more fertile soils aide and grau 2004 rubiano et al 2017 as this conversion proceeds more fertile areas become rarer in bogota s sabana high plain and this may slow down the process of land acquisition for agricultural production another crucial factor that controls deforestation is land morphology forest conversion to built up land and agricultural productive land occurs mainly in areas of lower altitude and less steep slopes rubiano et al 2017 mendoza and etter 2002 as the conversion of forested area proceeds less of the morphologically suitable land remains available for conversion this may slow down forested land conversion to agricultural productive land and built up land this mechanism thus can be thought of as a regulative factor for built up land and agricultural productive land dynamics it is considered in the self damping on a and b l 3 2 drivers of change soil fertility loss and migration factors considered to be drivers of land cover change were introduced in the models as press perturbations input on target variables forest regrowth has been taking over in the study area following land abandonment and the consequent migration toward urban areas aide and grau 2004 soil fertility loss and or agricultural intensification might have ignited this causal chain soil fertility has been indicated as favoring the rate of conversion of forested land into agricultural land aide and grau 2004 rubiano et al 2017 moran et al 2000 a reduced soil fertility thus acts as a negative press perturbation on a agricultural productive land for the sake of clarity in fig 4 we detail the predicted response of the system variables to this press perturbation using model 3c as reference rubiano et al 2017 observed in the sabana of bogotá an increasing trend in woody cover with a characteristic pattern in which forest regrowth is accompanied by land abandonment increased rural to urban migration and the occurrence of secondary succession on abandoned land a chain of causally ordered events was hypothesized to explain this pattern the loss of soil fertility might have ignited land abandonment thus fueling migration toward urban areas abandoned land may have undergone secondary succession that transformed fields no longer grazed or mowed in shrubland and then secondary forests similar dynamics have been documented in other areas of south america veldkamp et al 1992 rudel et al 2002 aide et al 2013 this chain of events implies i land abandonment ii increased number of migrants towards urban centers iii the augmentation of shrubland extension and forest cover and iv a reduction in the agricultural productive land the tables of prediction of model 3a and 3b reveal that such concomitant variations are possible following a negative press perturbation on variable a second row of the tables below the graphs inverted signs the number of migrant is predicted to augment m both shrubland s l and forest cover f c would increase and productive land is expected to decrease a as side effect the built up land is predicted to increase b l a plausible consequence of the augmented rural to urban migration indeed the sabana of bogotá has been experiencing soil degradation ministerio deambiente 2003 its population has been constantly increasing unisabana 2019 as well as the extension of built up land at the cost of productive land martínez herrera 2015 rodríguez et al 2013rodriguez et al 2013 projected land cover change in the colombian andes according to three different scenarios that they simulated using spatio temporal data on land use land cover change the one which was constructed by assuming an extension of cropland predicted a reduction of the forest cover in principle this scenario is simulated in our model assuming a positive input on a extension of crop land the models of fig 3 the only exception is model 3c yielded a response of forest cover and agricultural land that coincides with the outcomes of rodriguez et al simulations forest cover was predicted to diminish and agricultural land would increase the response of forest cover f c and shrubland s l to the negative input entering through a is different in the other models model 3c returns no expected change 0 in the table of predictions for both fc and sl model 3d predicts a tendency to increase for f c and no change for shrubland s l 0 the different articulation of the interactions in models 3c and 3d in respect to models 3a and 3b makes the number of pathways connecting a to f c and s l to increase in appendix b we single out the paths from a t o f c to help understanding this point positive paths responsible for the negative effect 1 1 it must be clarified here that according to the loop formula see appendix a because the sign of the path is multiplied by the sign of the press perturbation negative variation in the rate of change of a in this case positive paths carry a negative effect whereas negative paths produce positive effect increase in number contrasting the negative paths that carry a positive effect these positive paths counteract negative paths so that the positive predictions obtained in models 3a and 3b become null predictions this compensation depends on both the number of pathways and their magnitude this latter is obtained multiplying the intensity of the links that make the path see appendix a further insight can be obtained by focusing on the structure of the paths for example the negative input on a may yield a negative prediction for f c for particular combinations of link intensities 2 2 this possibility does not emerge from the numerical analysis because it mediates the outcomes of many simulation runs see appendix a and particular cases are obscured for the procedure takes averages three of the paths that carry positive effect and thus would decrease f c for a negative press on a are formed by the links that account for the exploitation of shrubland by the built up land s l b l b l o s l see appendix b if shrubland is intensively used to extend the built up land the null prediction may turn into a negative expectation for f c in model 3a and 3b in which b l does not exploit shrubland the loss of soil fertility negative press on a makes forest cover increasing with no uncertainty if the built up land expands on shrubland model 3c and 3d forest regrowth is less likely to occur because shrubland converted to urban area may not complete the succession to secondary forest in this framework the conspicuous forest regrowth documented in the area near bogota rubiano et al 2017 can be due to a moderate or null conversion of shrubland to built up land a hypothesis that we present with circumspection and that should be corroborated by further data analysis and observations according to these outcomes model 3a and model 3b seem to better represent the observed dynamics rubiano et al 2017 in colombia individuals internally displaced by conflicts produced strong migratory fluxes toward urban areas lozano garcia et al 2010 migration m has been selected as a core variable in the understanding that migratory flows have had a substantial impact on the territorial dynamics of the study area albuja and ceballos 2010 the incoming flow of individuals is described by assuming a constant positive parameter in the equation for the rate of change of m and this translates into a negative self loop link on variable m in the graph puccia and levins 1985puccia and levins 1985 and bodini 2000 explain why a positive constant flux in the dynamic equation for a variable becomes a negative self loop on its node in the graph the armed conflict augmented this migratory flow from outside the study area ibañez and vélez 2008 and a positive press perturbation can reasonably be assumed in the rate of change for m in fig 3 predictions about this positive press are listed along the rows labelled m the entry point of the perturbation forest cover shows a tendency to decrease across the models except for model 3b in which this component would be increasing f c a closer look to the pathways connecting the entry point of the perturbation variable m with the effect variables f c provides clues to understand model predictions see appendix b in model 3a three paths propagates to f c the effect of the migratory flow 1 m b l o f c s i g n 2 m b l o w a o f c s i g n 3 m b l o w a o s l f c s i g n effects of the paths can be causally interpreted by combining the nature sign of each link forming the path with the predicted variations of the variables along the path in path 1 migration flow increases the number of immigrants m this component exerts a positive effect on the rate of change of b l m b l and this latter is predicted to increase b l b l increases at the expenses of the forested land b l o f c which would be shrinking 3 3 this is not shown as a as a negative prediction on f c because the table of predictions shows the overall effect of the three paths f c on the contrary paths 2 and 3 have a positive effect on f c in 2 the augmented built up land increases water consumption rate b l o w and water availability diminishes w water shortage diminish the positive effect that this resource has on the rate of change of a w a and this latter variable is expected to decrease a as a possible consequence it can be abandoned and natural succession would take over to shrubland which in fact is predicted to increase s l the lower level for a reduces its negative effect on forested land a o f c with beneficial effect on this component path 3 includes also shrubland the lessening predicted for a diminish its negative action on the rate of change of sl so this latter would augment s l favoring forests s l f c the positive effects of paths 2 and 3 tend to mitigate the negative effect of the exploitation by the built up land which however remains preponderant the two positive pathways in fact are longer than the negative path and the magnitude of their effect attenuates along the path the overall effect can thus be a net loss of forested area model 3b predicts a tendency to increase for f c following the positive press on m increased migratory flow in building this graph we hypothesized that the built up environment b l would exploit also agricultural productive land corporación cactus 2014 el nuevo siglo 2020 due to this connection the number of paths linking m to f c increases by two positive paths in respect to model 3a they are m b l o a o f c and m b l o w a o f c overall there are 4 positive paths and one negative see appendix b and the numerical analysis shows that the former prevail making the level of f c increase in models 3c and 3d the different ways through which built up land exploits available land implies further paths but their overall effect remains negative and an increased migratory flow is predicted to negatively impact forest cover the causal interpretation of predictions based on the paths may help interpret the evidence that forest regrowth and deforestation that are opposing forces may act simultaneously rubiano et al 2017 suggesting in what circumstances one may prevail over the other so far two types of press perturbations have been considered reduced soil fertility and increased immigration rate in both cases we have shown that the existence of opposite paths may determine the occurrence of forest regrowth or deforestation by scrolling down the first column of each table in fig 3 one can make an overall assessment about the possibilities that same press perturbations may induce regrowth and deforestation the first column of each table in fig 3 shows expected changes in the level of forest cover for press perturbation entering through any of the system variables whenever a predictions is not certain 0 multiple paths with opposite effects exist that spread the impact of the press perturbation to f c this creates the conditions for deforestation or forest regrowth to occur following the same cause the press perturbation the occurrence of either effects depends on the strength of the paths and thus on the magnitude of the interaction links model 3d shows the highest number of uncertain predictions 4 out of 6 for press perturbation on a b l s l m in the other three models uncertain predictions are 2 out of 6 for each graph although not for the same input the highest number of uncertain predictions in model 3d depends on the complexity of its structure which accounts for the concomitant exploitation of forests shrubland and agricultural productive land for urban expansion also with more interactions the number of paths connecting any two variables may increase and the probability that these paths have different effect sign increases as well according to these results it can be hypothesized that the increment of forested land in the study area rubiano et al 2017 may not be as surprising as it may appear despite the many drivers that enhance deforestation through the analysis of the structure of the interactions that encompass a range of environmental and socioeconomic conditions factors that contribute to gains and losses of forest area may become explicit this suggests that also for other areas of colombia where forest regrowth was documented sanchez cuervo et al 2012 sanchez cuervo and aide 2013b elucidating the pathways that spread the effects of drivers might contribute to frame the observed changes in a causative perspective 3 3 the study area extended model variables interactions and graph the extended models for the study area are summarized in fig 5 they have been conceived to capture some of the complex transformations that have happened in this ses in the last decades meza 2008 armenteras et al 2007 acosta restrepo 2010 and references there in some of the main drivers of transformation were introduced as additional variables in the core models to allow a glimpse at the dilemmas that characterize potential developmental trajectories and their implications for forest conservation and sustainability in the study area a prominent feature of this territory is the development of industrial activities and services acosta restrepo 2010 they have been included as a unique variable called i s industry and services this component has been thought of as one that negatively affects the rate of change of variable a i s o a because medium industrial activity seeks for larger less congested less expensive locations to establish or resettle and it has progressively been leaving avoiding the city exploiting rural areas acosta restrepo 2010 if industry and services create job opportunities and attract migrants to the urban and suburban areas these opportunities are generally offered at low salary watkins 2001 gillin 2014 black 2015 cheap labor may have become a diffuse condition sustained by the consistent migration flows and it has been included in the models as a new variable named cl the models depict migration as if it favors the diffusion of cheap labor m c l which however may reduce the migratory flow c l o m because cheap labor may be perceived negatively by people cheap labor is depicted as having a positive effect on industry and services c l i s which in turn favor the rate of diffusion of cheap labor i s c l road networks shape the dynamics of this ses and affect the disperse occupation of the rural territory overall the transformation of rural areas into a developed urban continuum is sustained by a scattered and unplanned road expansion acosta restrepo 2010 to capture this uncoordinated development road network r n is thought of as responding only to the built up environment b l in a single connection with positive feedback r n is enhancing the rate of expansion of the built up land r n b l and the built up land returns a positive effect to r n b l r n because urban expansion requires access facilities the graphs of fig 5 5a 5b were obtained by superimposing these new connections onto models 3a and 3b the counterparts for models 3c and 3d did not add significant insights and are illustrated separately in the supplemental material appendix b p 10 13 forest conservation carries a value per se but in such a heavily modified environment like our study area it should be framed in an overall sustainability perspective in which environmental goals are combined with social and economic achievements the models in fig 5 help making this comprehensive sustainability assessment some of their variables in fact can be easily and intuitively associated to the three dimensions of sustainability forest cover f c enhances the conservation of ecological functions and the associated ecosystem services so that preserving it contributes to the environmental dimension of sustainability the same applies to water quality and availability w as it guarantees both human and wildlife survival as well as ecological functions i s industry and services designate the level of economic prosperity and can be considered a pillar of the economic dimension of sustainability finally the social dimension implies cohesion level of welfare and other attributes that could not be considered in full by the models presented here one variable that can be proxy for social conditions is c l cheap labor diffusion of cheap labor in fact implies low salaries for the workers with negative effect on family welfare less access to services education health care etc such conditions may disrupt social cohesion thus the diffusion of cheap labor reduces the quality of living and accordingly it may be considered as a cost proxy for social sustainability considering that fc and w are benefit proxies the higher their value the better it is an ideal scenario is one in which policies or management actions create conditions for the latter to increase and for the cost indicator to diminish on the other hand increasing fc and w and reducing cl match with some of the sustainable goals that the un defined to achieve a better and more sustainable future such as goal 1 no poverty goal 6 clean water and sanitation and goal 15 life on land among others griggs et al 2014 policies that increase the rate at which productive activities and services are created e g subsidizing incentives introduce a positive press perturbation in the system through variable i s expectations are that production and services would increase i s water quality and availability decrease w and a larger diffusion of underpaid work conditions is predicted c l and for model 5 b in this scenario forested land is expected to increase f c the analysis of the paths clarifies this result in model 5a as many as 11 paths connect i s to f c see appendix b 6 of them are positive and 5 negative the stronger and shorter are all positive i s o a o f c i s o a o s l f c i s o w a o f c i s o w b l o f c in these paths the positive effect on f c depends on the interference that i s produce along the path with variables that consume forested land mainly agricultural land and built up land in model 5b the overall number of paths that connect these two components increase to 17 of which 9 are negative still the shortest and stronger are positive and the overall effect on forested land is positive the predicted increase of forest cover combined with the positive prediction on shrubland s l indicates that model 5a and 5b replicate the model that rubiano et al 2017 proposed to explain the pattern of land cover change they observed in this area and that was characterized by a substantial regrowth of secondary forests they hypothesized that the development of productive activities and services could have made urban centers attractive to rural populations which moved to urban areas abandoned lands may have undergone succession passing through the state of shrubland to end in new secondary forests this mechanism has been underlined by calbi et al 2020 and matches with one of the two deforestation models conceived by rudel and roper 1997 according to which the deforestation rate should be reduced as the economy develops with beneficial effect on forest cover and their ecosystem services nevertheless the interpretation proposed by rubiano et al and the rudel and ruper s model imply a chain of events that includes land abandonment nonfarm jobs that might attract people to cities and consequent increased migration in this study model 5a predicts a null effect on the level of migration for a positive press on industry and services this discrepancy depends on the hypotheses we made that i cheap labor plays a crucial role in this ses and ii it may prevent people to migrate i s increases migration via the path i s o a o m but inhibits it through the other path i s c l o m so the two paths tend to compensate each other and this yields the null prediction however if cheap labor would not be a sufficient reason to prevent people to abandon then the outcomes of model 5a replicate in full the pattern of rudel and ruper s model overall if the economy connected with industry and services is expected to prosper following the press perturbation on i s it is not so for social welfare and ecosystem services water quality and availability tend to decrease although forest conservation seems to improve underpaid work is a threat for welfare the unions and or social activist act so as to curb the diffusion of this condition for example by increasing self consciousness of workers soliciting the governmental levels to enforce legislative working frameworks such as the minimum employment rights and increasing public opinion awareness watkins 2001 gillin 2014 black 2015 this activity enters the system as a negative press perturbation on cheap labor c l the models predicts that following this negative input reverse the signs in the last row of the tables of predictions in fig 5 cheap labor would decrease c l thus improving social sustainability the level of industrial production and services would be lower i s and a reduction in the extension of forested land f c would occur with negative consequences for economic and environmental sustainability water quality and availability is predicted not to change but still the multiplicity of paths that connect c l to w makes this prediction strongly dependent on paths strength if industrial production and service prosperity depended heavily on cheap labor for their prosperity then it is straightforward that i s would decrease following a reduction in the rate of diffusion of cheap labor this is a strong assumption of the models but it also reflects a reality of the developing colombia watkins 2001 gillin 2014 black 2015 an unexpected result is the predicted decrease of forest cover as due to initiatives against cheap labor browsing the paths that connect these two variables see appendix b sheds light on this outcome out of 13 paths connecting c l to f c as many as 8 are positive the shortest more intense paths are in this group accordingly positive paths prevail over negative ones and this prevalence is responsible for the negative effect to f c as explained about the core models positive paths reinforce the effect of the press perturbation if this latter is negative it reduces the rate of change of the affected variable c l in this case the effect is negative the causal chain at work here can be followed considering as an example the strongest path c l o m b l o f c combined with the concomitant variation predicted for the variables that make the path because c l is expected to decrease c l its negative action on m c l o m diminishes and this latter variable s rate of change would increase with a final beneficial effect on its level m the number of migrants positively affects the rate of urban expansion m b l and the extension of the built up land shows a tendency to increase b l finally because b l exploits forested land b l o f c this latter variable is predicted to decrease f c this discussion holds also for model 5b with a slightly higher level of uncertainty some predictions signal only tendencies to change as signs are accompanied by a question mark these results highlight that efforts toward social sustainability might have adverse effect on environmental sustainability to summarize for press perturbations on i s and c l trade offs between sustainability goals seem unavoidable because the response of the variables that can be associated to environmental social and economic sustainability is such that a win win situation that involves their concomitant improvement never occurs the intensification of road construction is a positive press perturbation on r n and the expected consequences slightly differ between models 5a and 5b the former predicts a tendency reduction of the forested land f c in agreement with acosta restrepo s 2010 statements model 5b leads to opposite conclusions f c this different behavior is clearly due to the exploitative dynamics of the built up land which concentrates on forested land in model 5a but it exploits also agricultural productive land in model 5b in particular there are 9 paths connecting r n to f c in model 5a of which only three are negative but they include the strongest paths the negative paths remain the same in model 5b but the number of positive paths increase and their overall effect prevails over that of the negative paths paths are listed in appendix b the tendency to increase shown by f c in model 5b is somehow counterintuitive and depends on the exploitation of agricultural land by the built up environment if b l grows more at the expenses of a than it consumes forested land the outcome may be a positive effect on forests here quantitative statements about the link strength would be necessary for exact predictions the response of the other components to the positive press perturbation on road network coincide in the two graphs cheap labor shows a tendency to increase c l in 5 a c l in 5 b water resources deteriorate both quantitatively and quantitatively c l in 5 a c l in 5 b w in 5 a w in 5 b industrial production and services are predicted to decrease in model 5a but they would increase in model 5b an unbalanced road network which simply tracks the urban expansion as it has been represented here does not seem at least according to our models predictions promoting environmental sustainability this is in agreement with acosta restrepo s 2010 and botero garcia s 2017 statements that this form of infrastructure production without integrating a rational environmentally sound road network has created a critical depletion of ecologically important corridors with negative effects on forests and has produced an overall degradation of the hydrological system road development has also revealed an explanatory variable in regression model aimed at explaining deforestation in this area rodríguez et al 2013rodriguez et al 2013 although in other regions it is not so armenteras et al 2013 protecting forests is a priority to preserve biodiversity and ecosystem services appropriate policies have been called for botero garcia 2017 and conservation efforts for example could focus on areas with low levels of protection and high rates of land transformation romero ruiz et al 2011 sanchez cuervo et al 2012 such as the study area remnant forests correspond to old growth forests harbor considerable levels of biodiversity and could therefore be used as core areas to implement a protected areas network that can integrate the increasing areas of regrowth forests to shield against the high conversion risks implementing protection can be done through a regulatory agency empowered to slow down urban expansion rate by controlling the release of permits for new constructions the action of such governmental agency is identified by variable p e p e protection effort in model 5c deforestation would activate the agency f c o p e which responds inhibiting urban expansion s rate p e o b l p e i s self damped because it can act only within its local mandate for enforcement and is bounded by state laws budget personnel bureaucratic lag time and is affected by lobbying pressure increasing the rate at which protection is made operational positive press perturbation on p e interestingly may have beneficial consequences on forested land f c water quality and availability w production and services i s and social welfare c l thus activating a mechanism of protection for forests seems to be under the hypotheses of this model exercise the sole action that can improve the overall sustainability and enhance ecosystem services identifying the direct and indirect drivers of deforestation and understanding the complexity of their interlinkages are often difficult studies that investigated causes of land cover change in colombia shared a common approach based on the analysis of land cover patterns from satellite images or aerial photographs combined with regression models that identified possible drivers of change among the explanatory variables that resulted significant rodríguez et al 2012rodriguez et al 2012 sanchez cuervo and aide 2013 rubiano et al 2017 these studies highlighted which variables could explain the observed patterns but did not inform about the mechanisms that produced such relationship in this we see the potential for integration of the statistical approach with the modeling approach discussed here for example qualitative models could be constructed using as variables the factors that resulted significant in explain the observed patters at the same time qualitative models developed through expert elicitation with their predictions can direct the selection of variables in the statistical analysis 4 conclusions contemporary environmental challenges call for research approaches in which the ecosystem is part of a larger unit of investigation that embeds socioeconomic dynamics in this study we have framed the dynamics of neotropical peri urban forests in and around the sabana de bogota in the context of its ses the results of this research confirm that integrating ecological and social variables in a unique interactive network can reveal unexpected causal linkages between across domain variables specifically the models presented here bring to light mechanisms that may explain the observed patterns of deforestation and forest regrowth in the study area any sess is challenging to model because their vast array of interactions confounds cause and effects that is why in the literature conceptual frameworks on the subject have flourished whereas less methodological and practical applications have seen the light bodin and tengö 2012 using a parsimonious set of variables we reduced the complexity of the system to become tractable and by exploiting its network structure we simulated the response of the core variables to impacts of natural events loss of soil fertility policies subsidizing industrial production and social events internal migration social activism our conclusions suggest hypothesis that need to be corroborated by further analysis the main hypotheses are that 1 remnant forests may be unexpectedly vulnerable to across domain drivers of change and also that unexpected beneficial effects may occur suggesting possible mechanisms through which the same drivers can be responsible for both deforestation and forest regrowth 2 trade offs between desirable ecological and social outcomes are the rule and that potential win win outcomes across the triple bottom line of the sustainable development paradigm are difficult to achieve the analysis of the causal paths may shed light on mechanisms responsible for overlapping and conflicts between desirable goals associated with nature conservation urban expansion and social life qualitative modeling may also help prioritize competing demands for forest protection ecosystem services economic and social benefits that said there are relevant variables that we did not include because their dynamics could not be clearly translated in the language of the loop models one such variable is land value formal and informal land market land price are powerful drivers but depend on a multiplicity of factors e g different income groups economic activities political pressures lobbying so that a clear pattern of interactions with the other variables was difficult to identify also certain variables have been considered with a simplified dynamic in forest cover for example patchiness was not taken into account despite its importance in forest dynamics simplification is both legitimate and necessary as long as we are cautious are willing to change the original underlying assumptions as necessary and build new models and carefully interpret the model s predictions in this work a rapid assessment of models predictions was conducted on the core models using evidences or hypotheses that emerged from the literature also extended models were developed to offer an example of the potential of the qualitative analysis applied to the study area s ses for a practical impact of qualitative models however predictions must be tested against field data to this end long term data set obtained under the effects of documented press perturbations are needed but in the case of this ses historical records of data pertaining the variables of interests are either not existent or not organized in a meaningful data set useful to assessing qualitative predictions bodini et al 2018 only through a validation by field data appropriate models can be developed accordingly this research has the merit to show the potential that loop analysis has in investigating complex sess loop analysis has the necessary adaptability and flexibility to be used in sess making predictions in that context will become more difficult because of the uncertainty associated with new unknown events changing dynamics and lack of quantitative data loop analysis allows including and discarding variables easily and above all they permit working with variables and links that are not readily measurable but their effects are crucial qualitative methods are also inexpensive therefore the process of qualitative modeling can be public reproducible and intelligible in a way that a large simulation project cannot be other methods of qualitative analysis are employed to explore the complexity of socio ecological systems causal loop diagrams sterman 2000 share a similar feedback approach to complex systems that loop analysis employs however although we recognize the validity and the aesthetics of the cld in our study especially because it included a participatory approach using loop analysis avoided misunderstandings about link definition polarity in the language of cld confusion between rates and stocks in variable selection in la variables are only stocks or levels and provided long term predictions a feature of la in the framework of moving equilibrium the conclusions derived from qualitative analysis do not allow for precise prediction or decisions about optimal courses of action but they do permit us to decide the particular directions to push on a system in order to move it in a desired e g sustainable direction often this is all we need initially for shaping trajectories for a development that is socially inclusive economically just and environmentally compatible however sustainability is certainly dynamic qualitative models outline that there may not be optimal

24714,the oceanographic conditions in the gulf of ulloa gu region make a distinctive faunal assemblage allowing the presence of species both ecologically and economically important constant interaction of emblematic species with the fishing activity has brought social and conservation problems due to the lack of ecological information and or management tools for the loggerhead turtle caretta caretta the gu is an important feeding area so the interaction with anglers is frequent in this sense some events of high loggerhead mortality have resulted in restrictive fishing measures nevertheless alternative hypotheses should be explored to explain this fact better with the purpose of not only knowing the ecosystem ecological attributes but also obtaining specific ecological facts of the loggerhead turtle as instantaneous total mortality this study proposes ecopath with ecosim ewe model by calculating allen s approximation of production to biomass ratio p b using the thermoregulation theory of ectotherms and this baseline model the scenarios were run in ecosim combining two forcing factors ff sea surface temperature sst and different fishing effort f values all ecosim scenarios were run over 30 simulated years taking the p b values of the loggerhead turtle according to the results in this study the model allowed us to obtain specific ecological attributes for c caretta particularly for the p b estimates in different simulation scenarios which showed that colder sea surface temperature increases loggerhead mortality all the information combined provided a better panorama to understand the role this turtle has within the biological action center of the gu system and its interaction with other activities developed on site such as fishing keywords c caretta mortality ecopath thermoregulation p b 1 introduction the gulf of ulloa gu at the western side of the baja california peninsula is one of the best known fishery areas of mexico fig 1 and a very productive transitional area within the california current system lluch belda et al 2003 because of the oceanographic conditions in the region a distinctive faunal assemblage inhabits the area allowing the presence of both ecologically and economically important species including marine mammals sea turtles seabirds large pelagic fish sharks tuna fish etc demersal fish halibut croakers rays hakes etc and pelagic sardines anchovies red crab etc wingfield et al 2011 worldwide constant interaction of emblematic megafauna species turtles dolphins sea lions etc with the fishing activity has brought social and conservation problems due to the lack of ecological information and or adequate tools for its management wallace et al 2013 in the gu the presence of turtle species is constantly reported such as chelonia mydas green turtle eretmochelys imbricata hawksbill lepichochelys olivacea olive ridley and c caretta loggerhead of which the last one has the largest number of bycatch records in fishing nets and longlines peckham et al 2007 ramírez rodríguez et al 2010 for loggerhead turtle the gu is an important feeding area so the interaction with the fishermen on the site and fishing gear has been maintained for years in 2012 stranded turtles increased by 210 600 with respect to the last decade esliman salgado and peckham 2013 seminoff et al 2014 this stranding brought federal fishing restrictive actions diario oficial de la federación 2015 diario oficial de la federación 2016 diario oficial de la federación 2018a because the high mortality was assumed to be an effect that derived from bycatch nevertheless alternative hypotheses could be considered about this fact therefore this study used a model type ecopath with ecosim ewe with the purpose of not only knowing some general aspects of the system but also obtaining some values of the loggerhead turtle population dynamics specifically the value of instantaneous total mortality considering the advantage of the model working with simultaneous balanced equations christensen and pauly 1992 2 methods and materials basic models for trophic interactions and energy flux were evaluated using ecopath with the ecosim model ewe polovina and ow 1983 polovina 1984 christensen and pauly 1992 the basic premise is that in a given time period the system will be in balance that is production is equal to consumption and is defined by the following equation 1 p i b i m 2 i p i 1 e e i e x i 0 where for an i group pi is production bi is biomass in tons wet weight m2i is mortality by predation ee is ecotrophic efficiency and exi is export ecotrophic efficiency is the proportion of organisms that die by predation and export including fishing extraction the first term represents production the second represents losses by predation the third represents losses that are not assigned to predation or export and the last term represents losses by export the equation is equal to 0 because it is at balance because material transfers among groups is through trophic relationships eq 1 is re expressed 2 b i p b i e e i j i n b j q b j d c j i b i p b i 1 e e e x i 0 where subscript j represents predators bj is their biomass in tons wet weight p b is production to biomass ratio which is equal to the instantaneous rate of total mortality z at equilibrium allen 1971 an annual base is used eei and exi are the same as in eq 1 q bj is consumption to biomass ratio of group j annual base and dcji is the fraction of prey i in the diet of predator j each group was represented by a similar equation a system of linear equations was established in which at least three of the four parameters b p b q b and ee of each group was known and the model if needed estimated only one in summary eq 2 describes the biomass flow balance between inputs and outputs for each group the majority of the species were included in functional groups fg sharing similar trophic roles only were those of particular interest kept as individual groups emblematic important species such as c caretta loggerhead turtle chelonya midas black turtle or ecological commercially important such as red crab pleuroncodes planipes shrimp penaeus californiensis or jumbo squid dosidicus gigas a large part of the input information particularly biomass came from fieldwork on the site or from published models around the site table 1 basic inputs to ecopath model came from different sources described in table 1 a predator prey matrix was developed from reports of stomach contents for the different functional groups using reports for similar species or groups when no data were available table 2 fishing fleets and catches of important species were included in the model impacting on the groups shown on table 3 data were obtained from fisheries of regional offices according to our own data cibnor 2016 a small sardine fleet three sardine boats and a large low scale fleet with 600 boats operated in the gu with approximately 1270 fishermen divided into 77 economic units these workers had 5500 gillnets and 37 longlines of which 95 met the established mexican official standards diario oficial de la federación 2018b this value was taken as a baseline for fishing effort data recorded by peckham et al 2007 was used to calculate turtle bycatch tbc the authors considered 19 3 turtles per thousand hooks and 0 85 turtles per kilometer of gill net however as they also mentioned these values exceeded an order of magnitude tbc values reported by other mexican and usa fleets were from 0 00 to 1 40 turtles per thousand hooks and 0 01 turtles per kilometer of gill nets additionally wallace et al 2013 argued that despite these bycatch rates for extremely high longlines and nets the amounts of effort on which these bycatch rates were based on were relatively very low compared to other bycatch records for this north pacific loggerhead region with the idea of avoiding an overestimation at the moment of performing the simulations we chose to average with the values of similar studies ecotrophic efficiency ee 1 was used as the primary criterion to balance the ecopath model the diet matrix was adjusted by modifying initial values and producing small changes this approach was selected because diet is the source of the greatest uncertainty and to avoid a large modification of the feeding patterns of functional groups once the model was balanced and consistent the residuals were minimized with the ecoranger routine pauly christensen 1996 which allowed the entry of a range of and mean mode values for all the basic parameters i e biomass consumption and production rates ecotrophic efficiencies and all elements of the diet composition random input variables are then drawn with specific frequency distributions selected by the user in this study normal distribution was used for all the parameters the resulting model was then evaluated with defined criteria and physiological and mass balance constraints the process was repeated in a monte carlo fashion included in the routine of the model runs that passed the selection criteria the best fitting one was chosen with a least square criterion ewe was used also to evaluate various flow indices such as total system ascendancy measure of ecosystem flow christensen 1994 1995 pérez españa and arreguín sánchez 2001 total system throughput sum of flows and measure of ecosystem size ulanowicz and norden 1990 transfer efficiencies omnivore index respiration and assimilation were computed christensen and pauly 1993 vega cendejas and arreguín sánchez 2001 ewe includes two main modules ecopath to obtain a snapshot of the system and ecosim for temporary simulations in ecosim the master eq 2 was re expressed as derivate expressing biomass change rates over time the importance of doing temporary simulations lies on being able to change some factors in this case those considered were forcing factors ff fishing effort f and sea surface temperature sst which combined created 12 simulation scenarios to adjust our model vulnerabilities were used small zooplankton biomass time series were selected from the mexican research program of the california current imecocal by its acronym in spanish http imecocal cicese mx from 1998 to 2008 to calibrate the ecosim module because it was the longest and most complete time series available in the area 3 results the main ecological characteristics of the balanced ecotrophic model used are shown in table 4 with 29 fg used for the ecopath model including the following five primary producer two zooplankton eight invertebrate 10 fish two marine turtle one marine mammal and detritus groups three discrete trophic levels tl were observed of which the mean tl was 2 36 for the detritus group a relatively low ee was obtained meaning that biomass accumulation was greater than consumption and the difference was accumulated or exported from the system ecosystem properties computed are shown in table 5 the total system throughout was 7893 86 t km2 year 1 total primary production to respiration ratio tpp r was 1 78 indicating that tpp was approximately 70 greater than respiration the total primary production to biomass ratio was 5 91 t km2 year 1 indicating that the tpp overpassed in almost six times the system biomass the mean trophic level of the catch was 2 11 finally according to the information theory ascendency and overhead were 27 5 and 72 5 respectively ulanowicz and norden 1990 ascendency is the property of the system that maintains the hierarchy of the trophic levels as well as the values and functions of the same overhead is the maximum energy reserve of the ecosystem for potential use against disturbances ulanowicz 1986 making a specific zoom into the ecological facts of the system c caretta was observed interacting with other 11 fg despite having a small biomass 0 1 t km2 year its tl was over 3 which meant that its ecological role within the system was closer to a predator than a prey however our special interest lay on the value of p b of 1 023 because according to allen 1971 the p b rate is proportional to the instantaneous mortality rate christensen et al 2005 using this baseline model ecopath the scenarios were run in ecosim combining the ff of the mean sst warm conditions and cold conditions with different f values firstly ecosim was calibrated using a known zooplankton time series imecocal 2019 which resulted in an adjustment computed from ewe of ss 0 979 and r2 0 4389 all ecosim scenarios were run over 30 simulated years steps and by using the average biomass outputs ecopath models were rebuilt from which the p b values of c caretta turtle were taken for each simulated scenario the results are shown in fig 2 although incidental mortality may increase as fishing effort increases the results of this study have demonstrated that p b is higher in cold scenarios than in warm ones 4 discussion according to ecopath results large biomass comes from phytoplankton fg 300t km2 year 1 which is consistent with the results from other approaches del monte luna 2004 in fact lluch belda 2000 described the zone as a biological action center bac because of its high and constant primary production which results in large biomass of primary consumers e g zooplankton sardines anchovies pelagic red crab etc important fishery activity at the zone as well as the aggregation of many several other species including emblematical such as marine mammals and turtles the ee is an indicator of the biomass used within the system whether in the form of consumption respiration or export lercari bernier 2006 generally high ee values are assumed to occur in species that do not die of old age they are either predated or exploited bayle sempere et al 2013 in this context the model behaved congruently since high ee values were observed in those fg that were known to be highly predated such as octopuses 0 95 and shrimp 0 95 while other fg such as marine mammals and sharks showed lower ee values 0 5 and were consistent with those reported by other authors in similar nearby systems del monte luna 2004 morales zárate 2011 cruz escalona et al 2013 table 5 although some values were considerably different particularly with those reported by del monte luna 2004 it is important to note that the systems are not static and may change due to multiple causes including basic input values information sources etc thus these values should be handled prudently and in any case considering the trend or behavior patterns under this premise what prevailed and was consistent was an immature and exceptionally productive modeled system since the value of the total primary production respiration was 1 787 where a value close to 1 corresponded to a mature system christensen et al 2005 on the other hand within the ecosystems a series of energy flows take place for self regulation and growth ulanowicz 1980 1997 called this tendency of the systems to develop complexity in biomass flows ascendency odum and barrett 2006 in other words ascendency refers to the ability of the system to maintain its thermodynamic functions ecopath relies on this postulate to know these system flows assuming that knowing a portion of these flows reduces the uncertainty about the amount of the rest of the energy in the system christensen et al 2005 on the other hand the overhead is a measure of the reserve potential of the system facing external disturbances that is according to ulanowicz 1986 the overhead indicates the limit to which ancestry can increase christensen et al 2005 the value of the system ascendency was 27 5 while the overhead was 72 5 so the modeled system could be stated to be far from its climax point odum and barrett 2006 but with a high tolerance capacity to external shocks in other words the overhead could be an indicator of resilience capacity with respect to the p b values from fg loggerhead turtle some points should be specified first mortality should be defined as the number of individuals that die within a population in a given time which may vary depending on population and environmental conditions odum and barrett 2006 in ecopath p b ratio was equivalent to the instantaneous rate of total mortality z allen 1971 even if the parameter is labeled production biomass in ewe what should be entered is actually total mortality rate in the order that production includes fishery yield in the loggerhead turtle case it refers to bycatch plus predation net migration biomass change and other mortalities thus if mortality by catch is removed the difference will be equal to an approximate value of natural mortality under this context with the simulation of scenarios in the ecosim module this study focused on obtaining instantaneous total mortality values of the loggerhead turtle thus the p b value obtained from the base ecopath model was 1 023 and used as the average value average sst environmental conditions and current fishing effort the results in this study suggest a pattern in the p b behavior finding in all simulated cases that as expected p b increases as f increases however the important thing to note is that in cold sst scenarios p b values are even higher than those observed in average or warm sst scenarios with the same f values fig 2 these results are very interesting and consistent considering that sea turtles are reptiles and as such ectothermic organisms thus environmental changes come to affect different parts of the turtles life cycle from eggs to determine the sex of the organism up to the selection of its habitat rees et al 2013 the values obtained in this study when f 0 p b cold phase 1 11 and p b warm phase 1 087 suggested that in cold temperature conditions of the organisms may be more lethargic and thus more susceptible to being preyed get sick or even caught by fishing nets on the contrary during warm conditions the organisms may be more active and less susceptible to predation diseases or being caught by fishing nets although theoretically the system under warm conditions could result in oligotrophic periods that might affect prey biomasses on which c caretta feeds in fact it is not necessarily so during the 1997 1998 enso event at punta eugenia also a bac region and geographically continuous towards the north of the gu a change in the zooplanktonic structure was observed while copepod biomass decreased but the salps biomass subphylum tunicata showed a proportional increase lavaniegos et al 1998 this effect might be similar in the bac of the gu and given that c caretta feeds largely from gelatinous organisms as salps its diet would not be impacted by the oligotrophic conditions but rather favored in addition having a favorable temperature that would make it more active the possibility of the turtle to be more effective as a predator and able to expand its variety of prey could also increase considering that for c caretta this area seems to be unbeatable in terms of its eating habits etnoyer et al 2006 the results obtained with f 0 5 and f 1 current fishing effort the same tendency follows by observing the lowest p b ratio under warm conditions just when f 2 was increased practically impossible to happen in reality p b under cold conditions reached the largest value 9 53 however in anomalous warm and sst average conditions p b value did not show differences according to the results of this study oceanographic and climatological factors may influence the behavior of c caretta thus together with the effect of bycatch it may result in higher p b values if climate conditions are adverse which has been more fully explained by salinas zavala et al 2020 it is important to consider that the gu is an area with very peculiar oceanographic properties its waters have been described as a transition zone that could have more tropical or more tempered characteristics depending on the phenomenon that appears such as the influence of el niño or la niña years lluch belda et al 2003 the values obtained may not be absolute and immovable but the tendency and behavioral patterns observed in the simulated scenarios should be considered good tools that provide information to address alternative hypotheses about the atypical high mortality rates of the loggerhead turtle observed at the study site which in an insufficiently justified manner have been assigned to fishing activity 5 conclusions the model ewe type made it possible to estimate system values that were consistent with those obtained in other models in similar systems it allowed us to obtain specific ecological attributes for c caretta particularly for the p b estimates in different simulation scenarios showing that sst had a greater influence on the loggerhead turtle than incidental fishing all the information provided jointly a better panorama to understand the role that this turtle has within the bac gu system and the interaction it has with other activities developed on the site such as fishing the food and agriculture organization of the united nations fao document on guidelines to reduce sea turtle mortality clearly states that water temperature has been shown to influence sea turtle bycatch rates fao 2011 the results in this study provide a preliminary understanding of the relationship between thermal characteristics of the ocean and loggerhead sea turtles in the western coast of the baja california peninsula sea surface temperatures could be used

24714,the oceanographic conditions in the gulf of ulloa gu region make a distinctive faunal assemblage allowing the presence of species both ecologically and economically important constant interaction of emblematic species with the fishing activity has brought social and conservation problems due to the lack of ecological information and or management tools for the loggerhead turtle caretta caretta the gu is an important feeding area so the interaction with anglers is frequent in this sense some events of high loggerhead mortality have resulted in restrictive fishing measures nevertheless alternative hypotheses should be explored to explain this fact better with the purpose of not only knowing the ecosystem ecological attributes but also obtaining specific ecological facts of the loggerhead turtle as instantaneous total mortality this study proposes ecopath with ecosim ewe model by calculating allen s approximation of production to biomass ratio p b using the thermoregulation theory of ectotherms and this baseline model the scenarios were run in ecosim combining two forcing factors ff sea surface temperature sst and different fishing effort f values all ecosim scenarios were run over 30 simulated years taking the p b values of the loggerhead turtle according to the results in this study the model allowed us to obtain specific ecological attributes for c caretta particularly for the p b estimates in different simulation scenarios which showed that colder sea surface temperature increases loggerhead mortality all the information combined provided a better panorama to understand the role this turtle has within the biological action center of the gu system and its interaction with other activities developed on site such as fishing keywords c caretta mortality ecopath thermoregulation p b 1 introduction the gulf of ulloa gu at the western side of the baja california peninsula is one of the best known fishery areas of mexico fig 1 and a very productive transitional area within the california current system lluch belda et al 2003 because of the oceanographic conditions in the region a distinctive faunal assemblage inhabits the area allowing the presence of both ecologically and economically important species including marine mammals sea turtles seabirds large pelagic fish sharks tuna fish etc demersal fish halibut croakers rays hakes etc and pelagic sardines anchovies red crab etc wingfield et al 2011 worldwide constant interaction of emblematic megafauna species turtles dolphins sea lions etc with the fishing activity has brought social and conservation problems due to the lack of ecological information and or adequate tools for its management wallace et al 2013 in the gu the presence of turtle species is constantly reported such as chelonia mydas green turtle eretmochelys imbricata hawksbill lepichochelys olivacea olive ridley and c caretta loggerhead of which the last one has the largest number of bycatch records in fishing nets and longlines peckham et al 2007 ramírez rodríguez et al 2010 for loggerhead turtle the gu is an important feeding area so the interaction with the fishermen on the site and fishing gear has been maintained for years in 2012 stranded turtles increased by 210 600 with respect to the last decade esliman salgado and peckham 2013 seminoff et al 2014 this stranding brought federal fishing restrictive actions diario oficial de la federación 2015 diario oficial de la federación 2016 diario oficial de la federación 2018a because the high mortality was assumed to be an effect that derived from bycatch nevertheless alternative hypotheses could be considered about this fact therefore this study used a model type ecopath with ecosim ewe with the purpose of not only knowing some general aspects of the system but also obtaining some values of the loggerhead turtle population dynamics specifically the value of instantaneous total mortality considering the advantage of the model working with simultaneous balanced equations christensen and pauly 1992 2 methods and materials basic models for trophic interactions and energy flux were evaluated using ecopath with the ecosim model ewe polovina and ow 1983 polovina 1984 christensen and pauly 1992 the basic premise is that in a given time period the system will be in balance that is production is equal to consumption and is defined by the following equation 1 p i b i m 2 i p i 1 e e i e x i 0 where for an i group pi is production bi is biomass in tons wet weight m2i is mortality by predation ee is ecotrophic efficiency and exi is export ecotrophic efficiency is the proportion of organisms that die by predation and export including fishing extraction the first term represents production the second represents losses by predation the third represents losses that are not assigned to predation or export and the last term represents losses by export the equation is equal to 0 because it is at balance because material transfers among groups is through trophic relationships eq 1 is re expressed 2 b i p b i e e i j i n b j q b j d c j i b i p b i 1 e e e x i 0 where subscript j represents predators bj is their biomass in tons wet weight p b is production to biomass ratio which is equal to the instantaneous rate of total mortality z at equilibrium allen 1971 an annual base is used eei and exi are the same as in eq 1 q bj is consumption to biomass ratio of group j annual base and dcji is the fraction of prey i in the diet of predator j each group was represented by a similar equation a system of linear equations was established in which at least three of the four parameters b p b q b and ee of each group was known and the model if needed estimated only one in summary eq 2 describes the biomass flow balance between inputs and outputs for each group the majority of the species were included in functional groups fg sharing similar trophic roles only were those of particular interest kept as individual groups emblematic important species such as c caretta loggerhead turtle chelonya midas black turtle or ecological commercially important such as red crab pleuroncodes planipes shrimp penaeus californiensis or jumbo squid dosidicus gigas a large part of the input information particularly biomass came from fieldwork on the site or from published models around the site table 1 basic inputs to ecopath model came from different sources described in table 1 a predator prey matrix was developed from reports of stomach contents for the different functional groups using reports for similar species or groups when no data were available table 2 fishing fleets and catches of important species were included in the model impacting on the groups shown on table 3 data were obtained from fisheries of regional offices according to our own data cibnor 2016 a small sardine fleet three sardine boats and a large low scale fleet with 600 boats operated in the gu with approximately 1270 fishermen divided into 77 economic units these workers had 5500 gillnets and 37 longlines of which 95 met the established mexican official standards diario oficial de la federación 2018b this value was taken as a baseline for fishing effort data recorded by peckham et al 2007 was used to calculate turtle bycatch tbc the authors considered 19 3 turtles per thousand hooks and 0 85 turtles per kilometer of gill net however as they also mentioned these values exceeded an order of magnitude tbc values reported by other mexican and usa fleets were from 0 00 to 1 40 turtles per thousand hooks and 0 01 turtles per kilometer of gill nets additionally wallace et al 2013 argued that despite these bycatch rates for extremely high longlines and nets the amounts of effort on which these bycatch rates were based on were relatively very low compared to other bycatch records for this north pacific loggerhead region with the idea of avoiding an overestimation at the moment of performing the simulations we chose to average with the values of similar studies ecotrophic efficiency ee 1 was used as the primary criterion to balance the ecopath model the diet matrix was adjusted by modifying initial values and producing small changes this approach was selected because diet is the source of the greatest uncertainty and to avoid a large modification of the feeding patterns of functional groups once the model was balanced and consistent the residuals were minimized with the ecoranger routine pauly christensen 1996 which allowed the entry of a range of and mean mode values for all the basic parameters i e biomass consumption and production rates ecotrophic efficiencies and all elements of the diet composition random input variables are then drawn with specific frequency distributions selected by the user in this study normal distribution was used for all the parameters the resulting model was then evaluated with defined criteria and physiological and mass balance constraints the process was repeated in a monte carlo fashion included in the routine of the model runs that passed the selection criteria the best fitting one was chosen with a least square criterion ewe was used also to evaluate various flow indices such as total system ascendancy measure of ecosystem flow christensen 1994 1995 pérez españa and arreguín sánchez 2001 total system throughput sum of flows and measure of ecosystem size ulanowicz and norden 1990 transfer efficiencies omnivore index respiration and assimilation were computed christensen and pauly 1993 vega cendejas and arreguín sánchez 2001 ewe includes two main modules ecopath to obtain a snapshot of the system and ecosim for temporary simulations in ecosim the master eq 2 was re expressed as derivate expressing biomass change rates over time the importance of doing temporary simulations lies on being able to change some factors in this case those considered were forcing factors ff fishing effort f and sea surface temperature sst which combined created 12 simulation scenarios to adjust our model vulnerabilities were used small zooplankton biomass time series were selected from the mexican research program of the california current imecocal by its acronym in spanish http imecocal cicese mx from 1998 to 2008 to calibrate the ecosim module because it was the longest and most complete time series available in the area 3 results the main ecological characteristics of the balanced ecotrophic model used are shown in table 4 with 29 fg used for the ecopath model including the following five primary producer two zooplankton eight invertebrate 10 fish two marine turtle one marine mammal and detritus groups three discrete trophic levels tl were observed of which the mean tl was 2 36 for the detritus group a relatively low ee was obtained meaning that biomass accumulation was greater than consumption and the difference was accumulated or exported from the system ecosystem properties computed are shown in table 5 the total system throughout was 7893 86 t km2 year 1 total primary production to respiration ratio tpp r was 1 78 indicating that tpp was approximately 70 greater than respiration the total primary production to biomass ratio was 5 91 t km2 year 1 indicating that the tpp overpassed in almost six times the system biomass the mean trophic level of the catch was 2 11 finally according to the information theory ascendency and overhead were 27 5 and 72 5 respectively ulanowicz and norden 1990 ascendency is the property of the system that maintains the hierarchy of the trophic levels as well as the values and functions of the same overhead is the maximum energy reserve of the ecosystem for potential use against disturbances ulanowicz 1986 making a specific zoom into the ecological facts of the system c caretta was observed interacting with other 11 fg despite having a small biomass 0 1 t km2 year its tl was over 3 which meant that its ecological role within the system was closer to a predator than a prey however our special interest lay on the value of p b of 1 023 because according to allen 1971 the p b rate is proportional to the instantaneous mortality rate christensen et al 2005 using this baseline model ecopath the scenarios were run in ecosim combining the ff of the mean sst warm conditions and cold conditions with different f values firstly ecosim was calibrated using a known zooplankton time series imecocal 2019 which resulted in an adjustment computed from ewe of ss 0 979 and r2 0 4389 all ecosim scenarios were run over 30 simulated years steps and by using the average biomass outputs ecopath models were rebuilt from which the p b values of c caretta turtle were taken for each simulated scenario the results are shown in fig 2 although incidental mortality may increase as fishing effort increases the results of this study have demonstrated that p b is higher in cold scenarios than in warm ones 4 discussion according to ecopath results large biomass comes from phytoplankton fg 300t km2 year 1 which is consistent with the results from other approaches del monte luna 2004 in fact lluch belda 2000 described the zone as a biological action center bac because of its high and constant primary production which results in large biomass of primary consumers e g zooplankton sardines anchovies pelagic red crab etc important fishery activity at the zone as well as the aggregation of many several other species including emblematical such as marine mammals and turtles the ee is an indicator of the biomass used within the system whether in the form of consumption respiration or export lercari bernier 2006 generally high ee values are assumed to occur in species that do not die of old age they are either predated or exploited bayle sempere et al 2013 in this context the model behaved congruently since high ee values were observed in those fg that were known to be highly predated such as octopuses 0 95 and shrimp 0 95 while other fg such as marine mammals and sharks showed lower ee values 0 5 and were consistent with those reported by other authors in similar nearby systems del monte luna 2004 morales zárate 2011 cruz escalona et al 2013 table 5 although some values were considerably different particularly with those reported by del monte luna 2004 it is important to note that the systems are not static and may change due to multiple causes including basic input values information sources etc thus these values should be handled prudently and in any case considering the trend or behavior patterns under this premise what prevailed and was consistent was an immature and exceptionally productive modeled system since the value of the total primary production respiration was 1 787 where a value close to 1 corresponded to a mature system christensen et al 2005 on the other hand within the ecosystems a series of energy flows take place for self regulation and growth ulanowicz 1980 1997 called this tendency of the systems to develop complexity in biomass flows ascendency odum and barrett 2006 in other words ascendency refers to the ability of the system to maintain its thermodynamic functions ecopath relies on this postulate to know these system flows assuming that knowing a portion of these flows reduces the uncertainty about the amount of the rest of the energy in the system christensen et al 2005 on the other hand the overhead is a measure of the reserve potential of the system facing external disturbances that is according to ulanowicz 1986 the overhead indicates the limit to which ancestry can increase christensen et al 2005 the value of the system ascendency was 27 5 while the overhead was 72 5 so the modeled system could be stated to be far from its climax point odum and barrett 2006 but with a high tolerance capacity to external shocks in other words the overhead could be an indicator of resilience capacity with respect to the p b values from fg loggerhead turtle some points should be specified first mortality should be defined as the number of individuals that die within a population in a given time which may vary depending on population and environmental conditions odum and barrett 2006 in ecopath p b ratio was equivalent to the instantaneous rate of total mortality z allen 1971 even if the parameter is labeled production biomass in ewe what should be entered is actually total mortality rate in the order that production includes fishery yield in the loggerhead turtle case it refers to bycatch plus predation net migration biomass change and other mortalities thus if mortality by catch is removed the difference will be equal to an approximate value of natural mortality under this context with the simulation of scenarios in the ecosim module this study focused on obtaining instantaneous total mortality values of the loggerhead turtle thus the p b value obtained from the base ecopath model was 1 023 and used as the average value average sst environmental conditions and current fishing effort the results in this study suggest a pattern in the p b behavior finding in all simulated cases that as expected p b increases as f increases however the important thing to note is that in cold sst scenarios p b values are even higher than those observed in average or warm sst scenarios with the same f values fig 2 these results are very interesting and consistent considering that sea turtles are reptiles and as such ectothermic organisms thus environmental changes come to affect different parts of the turtles life cycle from eggs to determine the sex of the organism up to the selection of its habitat rees et al 2013 the values obtained in this study when f 0 p b cold phase 1 11 and p b warm phase 1 087 suggested that in cold temperature conditions of the organisms may be more lethargic and thus more susceptible to being preyed get sick or even caught by fishing nets on the contrary during warm conditions the organisms may be more active and less susceptible to predation diseases or being caught by fishing nets although theoretically the system under warm conditions could result in oligotrophic periods that might affect prey biomasses on which c caretta feeds in fact it is not necessarily so during the 1997 1998 enso event at punta eugenia also a bac region and geographically continuous towards the north of the gu a change in the zooplanktonic structure was observed while copepod biomass decreased but the salps biomass subphylum tunicata showed a proportional increase lavaniegos et al 1998 this effect might be similar in the bac of the gu and given that c caretta feeds largely from gelatinous organisms as salps its diet would not be impacted by the oligotrophic conditions but rather favored in addition having a favorable temperature that would make it more active the possibility of the turtle to be more effective as a predator and able to expand its variety of prey could also increase considering that for c caretta this area seems to be unbeatable in terms of its eating habits etnoyer et al 2006 the results obtained with f 0 5 and f 1 current fishing effort the same tendency follows by observing the lowest p b ratio under warm conditions just when f 2 was increased practically impossible to happen in reality p b under cold conditions reached the largest value 9 53 however in anomalous warm and sst average conditions p b value did not show differences according to the results of this study oceanographic and climatological factors may influence the behavior of c caretta thus together with the effect of bycatch it may result in higher p b values if climate conditions are adverse which has been more fully explained by salinas zavala et al 2020 it is important to consider that the gu is an area with very peculiar oceanographic properties its waters have been described as a transition zone that could have more tropical or more tempered characteristics depending on the phenomenon that appears such as the influence of el niño or la niña years lluch belda et al 2003 the values obtained may not be absolute and immovable but the tendency
