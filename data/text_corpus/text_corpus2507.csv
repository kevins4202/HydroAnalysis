12535,in the petrochemical industry due to strong acids and toxic heavy metals chloroaluminate ionic liquid spent catalysts pose a potential environmental risk given the strong alkalinity and high pollution load the treatment step for liquefied petroleum gas lpg spent caustic requires adding acid resulting in significant acid consumption and the risk of secondary pollution according to the characteristics of these two types of solid waste the coupling process of lpg spent caustic and chloraluminate ionic liquid waste catalyst is proposed with the goal of resource and harmlessness the lpg spent caustic and the chloroaluminate ionic liquid spent catalyst are pretreated by precipitation flocculation and hydrolysis respectively after which they are neutralized the main factors in the pretreatment and neutralization process are systematically examined under optimum circumstances 98 of the sulfide from lpg spent caustic was removed 86 8 of the chemical oxygen requirement was removed and the oil content in the treated solution was 10 mg l the hydrolysis reaction was milder when the hydrolysis media was mixed with the chloroaluminate ionic liquid spent catalyst at a volume ratio of 40 1 by changing the hydrolysis medium it was confirmed that the neutralizing solution containing sodium chloride had an inhibitory effect on the reaction when reused in the hydrolysis reaction of the spent catalyst the treated lpg sc and the acidic hydrolysate were neutralized at a volume ratio of 14 8 100 the ph after the reaction was 7 and the recoveries of aluminum and copper ions were 99 99 and 93 36 respectively the precipitates were calcined at high temperatures and the characterization of the calcined products confirmed the formation of copper aluminate spinel by xrd ft ir and sem eds the cod sulfide and oil indicators in the neutralization solution meet the tertiary effluent discharge standards of china s national comprehensive effluent discharge standard gb 8978 1996 the process eliminates the risk of high sulfide and cod from the lpg sc and recovers the spent catalyst s metal resources in addition the whole process has no additional added acid or alkali a new approach to disposing of these two hazardous wastes lpg sc and chloroaluminate ionic liquid spent catalysts for the petrochemical industry is offered graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords lpg spent caustic chloroaluminate ionic liquid spent catalysts neutralization recover data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction in petrochemical factories the presence of impurities such as sulfides in the oil restricts any direct use of the oil and products for example in the liquefied petroleum gas lpg industry the merox process 1 effectively removes sulfidic and impurities from lpg and the process produces a waste sodium hydroxide solution called sulfidic spent caustic ssc 2 which accounts for 5 wt to 10 wt of the total refinery wastewater discharge because of its high contaminant level in sc 3 4 high alkalinity ph 12 high salt content 5 10 wt high sulfide content 2 8 wt and extremely high chemical oxygen demand cod it is regarded as a hazardous waste by petrochemicals all over the world due to its complex composition which inhibits biological treatment special treatment of waste lye is required before it can be sent to wastewater treatment plants 5 6 the production of high octane trimethylpentane which can be used as a gasoline additive to raise octane levels depends on the alkylation of isobutane and butene 7 composite ionic liquid catalysts cil 8 are cucl modified chloroaluminate ionic liquids which are considered an alternative to conventional alkylation catalysts 10 11 due to their improved selectivity 9 in the alkylation of isobutane low corrosiveness low toxicity 12 and environmental friendliness 13 for every 1 tonne of trimethylpentane produced 4 5 kg of chloroaluminate ionic liquid spent catalyst is generated the composition of these spent catalysts is essentially the same as that of fresh catalysts 16 except for a slight decrease in activity and the presence of acid soluble oil aso 15 chloroaluminate ionic liquid spent catalysts are hazardous waste in the petrochemical industry and require environmentally sound treatment due to their high activity metal concentration acidity and aso content in the traditional treatment process for these two types of solid waste the strongly alkaline lpg spent caustic lpg sc treatment process requires adding large amounts of sulfuric acid for neutralization 19 with a high metal concentration and acidity the extremely acidic chloroaluminate ionic liquid wasted catalysts require the addition of alkali to increase the ph to the effluent water quality level in order to separate the metals in the form of precipitation consequently significant acid and alkali consumption is an issue according to the comprehensive characteristics of these two types of solid waste with harmless and resourceful treatment as the goal a technical process can be proposed for the coupling treatment of lpg sc with chloroaluminate ionic liquid spent catalyst however if two hazardous wastes are coupled directly without treatment in that case the sulfides in the lpg sc will be converted to h2s 17 under acidic neutralizing exothermic conditions and released causing great harm to the environment 18 due to the active alcl3 component present chloroaluminate ionic liquid spend catalysts violently hydrolyze when in contact with water producing a lot of heat that causes the mixed system to heat up quickly and the aso to carbonize lowering the quality of the oil at the end of the reaction a mixed system containing three phases of oil water solid will be formed resulting in a complex system that is not conducive to the recovery of the solid phase therefore to achieve coupling of lpg sc with chloroaluminate ionic liquid spent catalysts effective technical methods must be used to reduce the sulfide and other contaminant loads in lpg sc before coupling while eliminating the active component in the chloroaluminate ionic liquid spent catalyst and separating the aso chemical precipitation has an advantage over chemical oxidation and air in that it does not need using an external field 20 or changing the ph of the solution 21 the various metal salts e g ferrous and ferric sulfate copper sulfate can react chemically with dissolved sulfides to form relatively insoluble metal sulfides 22 thus reducing the concentration of dissolved sulfides in the effluent by chemical precipitation ramon ganigue 23 controls the sulfide level in the sewers by adding iron salts to avoid the formation of h2s in the gas pipes altaş levent 24 used conventional coagulants fecl3 and feso4 with the help of coagulant adjuvants ca oh 2 and caco3 to treat sulfides in refinery wastewater and found that 99 removal of sulfides and 80 removal of cod was achieved under optimal conditions with fe2 as a flocculant and ca oh 2 as precipitation aid metal chlorides can also be used as desulfurizing agents to remove organic sulfides from diesel fuel by complexation precipitation 25 thiophene like sulfides can undergo π bonding coordination with copper ions and effectively remove sulfides from organic systems chloroaluminate ionic liquid spent catalysts are sensitive to water adding small amounts of water can produce hcl gas 26 which releases large amounts of heat and leads to aso carbonization 27 isolated aso in the laboratory by mixing a chloroaluminate ionic liquid spent catalyst with an equal weight of ice to control the mixture s temperature keeping the mixture s temperature below 40 c avoiding the violent heating of the mixture caused by the addition of water xuan zhang obtained aso by hydrolysis by placing the chloroaluminate ionic liquid spent catalyst in a flask at 5 c and adding 3wt sodium hydroxide solution 14 in summary metal ions effectively remove sulfides from solution and adding flocculants can further improve the removal of pollutants therefore the precipitation flocculation method was used to pretreat lpg sc and the effect of the type and amount of precipitant and the amount of flocculant on the contaminants in lpg sc was investigated the aso can be separated from the chloroaluminate ionic liquid waste catalyst by the addition of water the temperature of the mixture needs to be controlled when adding water to prevent the mixture from boiling due to violent hydrolysis as the neutralizing fluid is reused in the hydrolysis process of the spent catalyst the effect of the nacl content of the solution on the hydrolysis process needs to be considered therefore the effects of different reaction media and material ratios on the temperature rise and aso residual carbon values during the hydrolysis of chloroaluminate ionic liquid spent catalysts were investigated afterward the optimum process conditions for the neutralization of the acidic hydrolysate with treated lpg sc were determined by a single factor test this paper presents the first process for coupling lpg sc with a chloroaluminate ionic liquid waste catalyst the chloraluminate ionic liquid spent catalysts have 93 of the metal recovered the recovered precipitate can be calcined to create copper aluminate spinel with potential applications allowing for waste resource recovery additionally the wastewater produced by the coupled process can meet the tertiary effluent discharge parameters of the chinese national comprehensive effluent discharge standard in terms of sulfide cod and oil content gb 8978 1996 this co processing process resolves the issue of treating two types of hazardous waste in the petrochemical industry lpg sc and chloroaluminate ionic liquid spent catalyst while achieving the harmless treatment and resource utilization of hazardous waste 2 experimental section 2 1 materials the lpg sc and chloroaluminate ionic liquid spent catalysts studied in this paper were supplied by china petroleum chemical corporation wuhan branch the results of the water quality analysis of the lpg sc are shown in table 1 high pollution load in lpg sc cod and sulfide content of 24 500 and 2098 mg l respectively therefore these experiments were carried out as soon as possible within 12 h to minimize changes in water quality over time due to oxidation in addition copper sulfate pentahydrate ferrous sulfate heptahydrate ferric chloride etc are all analytically pure reagents with purity 99 0 produced by sinopharm chemical reagent co 2 2 experimental process the detailed flow chart used in this study is shown in fig 1 the experiments were carried out according to three main sections precipitation flocculation pretreatment of lpg sc hydrolysis of chloraluminate ionic liquid spent catalysts and neutralizing recycled metals 2 2 1 precipitation flocculation pretreatment the different precipitation reagents including cuso4 feso4 and fe2 so4 3 were configured as a 200 g l solution of precipitation reagent and the flocculant cpam was configured as a 0 2 wt solution of organic flocculant all the experiments for treating lpg sc by precipitation flocculation were carried out in 250 ml beakers with an initial solution of 20 ml different types and dosages of precipitant solutions were added dropwise to the beaker containing lpg sc and the reaction was carried out with a magnetic stirrer at 200 r min for 20 min determination of sulfide content in treated lpg sc at the end of the reaction then 0 2 wt organic flocculant solution was added dropwise to the reaction system the speed was adjusted to 60 r min the reaction time was 20 min and the solid liquid settling was 90 min the solid liquid separation gives the treated lpg sc and measures the cod and oil content in the liquid phase 2 2 2 hydrolysis of ionic liquid chloraluminate spent catalysts the chloroaluminate ionic liquid spent catalyst 20 ml was added to different reaction media at different volume ratios for hydrolysis reaction stirred slowly for 30 min and left for 12 h oil water separation to give acid hydrolysate and acid soluble oil the temperature of the mixture rising during the hydrolysis of the ionic liquid chloroaluminate spent catalyst was measured and the residual carbon value of the aso was measured the nacl solutions of different mass fractions 10 wt 15 wt 20 wt were prepared and the spent chloroaluminate ionic liquid catalyst was slowly added at the same volume ratio under the same reaction conditions the temperature changes of the mixture during hydrolysis were recorded during this period and the residual carbon value of the separated aso was determined 2 2 3 neutralizing recycled metals all neutralization and modulation experiments for recovering valuable metals were carried out in 250 ml beakers the acid hydrolysate 30 ml is placed into a beaker and heated to a certain temperature the solution is then stirred at a certain speed using a magnetic stirrer while the ph is measured with a ph meter the pretreated lpg sc is slowly added to the acid hydrolysate to raise the ph and recover the cu and al from the acid hydrolysate at the end of the reaction the solution was sampled using a syringe and immediately filtered through a 0 45 μm microporous filter membrane the cu and al concentrations in the filtrate were determined by inductively coupled plasma emission spectrometry icp oes the neutralizing slag is washed with water to remove excess nacl and other impurities the obtained solid sample is oven dried at

results and discussion 3 1 precipitation flocculation pretreatment 3 1 1 effect of precipitant type and dosage on sulfide removal fig 2 a demonstrates how the removal rate of sulfide finally stabilized at 70 and 57 with increasing dosage when feso4 and fe2 so4 3 were used as precipitating agents this is because fe3 will be reduced to fe2 by s2 under reducing conditions the fe2 precipitation reaction with s2 in the lpg sc will simultaneously produce fe oh 2 under strongly alkaline conditions with the following reaction equation 1 2fe 3 s 2 2fe 2 s 2 fe 2 s 2 fes 3 fe 2 2oh fe oh 2 the solubility product of fes ksp 6 25 10 17 is similar to that of fe oh 2 ksp 7 9 10 16 and fe2 tends to react more with hydroxide ions to form fe oh 2 under strongly alkaline conditions at ph 14 the solubility of fes increases rapidly with increasing ph after the solution ph 10 28 the removal rate of sulfide from lpg sc showed a trend of increasing and then leveling off as the cu2 s2 molar ratio increased with cuso4 as the precipitant the removal rate of sulfide from lpg sc reaches 98 when the cu2 s2 molar ratio reaches 2 0 mol mol 1 at which point the sulfide concentration in lpg sc is 40 mg l compared to ferrous and trivalent iron ions copper sulfate as a precipitant result in high removal of sulfides and significant odor removal the precipitated phase of the lpg sc treated by the precipitation method was analyzed by ft ir infrared spectroscopy as shown in fig 2 c the oh stretching vibration peak is located at 3434 34 cm 1 compared to cus the spent caustic precipitated phase has a vibrational peak at 1049 23 cm 1 caused by the stretching vibration of the cs bond 29 this indicates that the sulfur atoms in the organic sulfides in the lpg sc complex with copper ions based on the coordination bonding theory due to the relatively low electronegativity of the sulfur atom it is relatively easy to lose its lone electron pair the electronic configuration of the cu2 ion is 3s23p63d9 thus the sulfur atom can provide electron pairs to the hollow 4 s and 4p orbitals of the cu2 ion forming an s m σ bond thus complexation precipitation allows the cu2 ions to separate the organic sulfides from the lpg sc fig 2 d shows the chromatogram of the lpg sc both before and after the precipitation treatment the figure shows that the untreated lpg sc contains several organic contaminants such as major thioethers mercaptans and other sulfur containing organics therefore the lpg sc emits a large amount of irritating odor the comparison revealed a significant reduction in organic sulfides in the precipitation treated lpg sc this suggests that the organic pollution load in lpg sc can be effectively reduced by removing organic sulfides from lpg sc when copper ions are utilized as a precipitant cuso4 is a suitable desulfurization precipitant for lpg sc as a result excessive cuso4 dosing will increase the concentration of cu2 in the liquid phase and reduce the concentration of sodium hydroxide in the post desulfurization alkali residue which will be detrimental to the utilization of alkali resources thus the cuso4 dosage was chosen to be n cu2 n s2 2 1 3 1 2 effect of cpam dosing on cod and oil removal rates the treatment of lpg sc by precipitation under optimal conditions was significant for sulfide removal but the cod removal in lpg sc was only 72 92 therefore the flocculation of cpam is used further to improve the removal of cod from lpg sc from fig 2 b it can be found that the removal rate of cod and oil content showed a trend of increasing and then decreasing with the increase of cpam dosage at a cpam dosage of 15 mg l the cod removal rate reached a maximum of 86 8 and the oil content was 10 mg l an increase of 13 88 in cod removal and a decrease of 85 71 in oil content compared to the system without cpam addition as the dosage continued to increase the cod removal rate began to decline and the oil content began to increase at a dosage of 30 mg l the cod removal rate was only 74 62 and the oil concentration was 65 mg l this is due to oil in the aqueous phase is often negatively charged in contrast the hydrolysis products of cpam are cationic 35 and can electrically neutralize the oil in the water reducing their electrostatic repulsion and allowing them to adsorb on the floc in the system excessive doses of cpam might cause a change from unstable to stable colloidal particles 30 which lowers the effectiveness of treatment 3 1 3 physical and chemical characteristics of lpg sc after precipitation flocculation treatment the parameters of some pollutant loads in the treated spent caustic under optimal conditions n cu2 n s2 2 1 cpam dosing of 15 mg l are given in table 2 according to table 2 the treated lpg sc has a low concentration of copper ions meaning there are no extra copper ions in the solution although several pollution loads were greatly reduced due to the precipitation flocculation treatment for lpg sc the amounts of cod and sulfide were still over the requirements for effluent release considering that the subsequent neutralization process will further reduce the effluent pollution load this step does not involve excessive pretreatment of the lpg sc 3 2 hydrolysis of chloroaluminate ionic liquid spent catalysts 3 2 1 effect of the reaction medium on the hydrolysis of chloroaluminate ionic liquid spent catalysts after neutralization and conditioning the acidic hydrolysate with the treated lpg sc the neutralization fluid will be re entered into the hydrolysis step of the chloroaluminate ionic liquid spent catalyst the level of nacl in the hydrolysis reaction medium increases as the number of neutralizing fluid reuses increases therefore to investigate the feasibility of reusing the neutralized liquid the effect of nacl content on the hydrolysis process of ionic liquid spent catalysts was studied the results are shown in fig 3 a as shown in fig 3 a the residual carbon value of aso decreased from 0 63 wt to 0 18 wt with an increase in nacl content in the solution at the same material ratio and the temperature at which the mixture rises was lowered from 30 c to 25 c this suggests that the increased sodium chloride content in the reaction medium inhibits the carbonation of aso while slowing down the tendency for the temperature to rise during the hydrolysis of the spent catalyst the gentle hydrolysis of the chloroaluminate ionic liquid spent catalyst was promoted the reason for this is that aluminum ions are mainly present in the spent catalyst in the form of alcl4 and al2cl7 which hydrolyze rapidly on contact with water to produce hydrogen chloride as shown in reactions 4 to 5 31 in addition the exothermic hydrolysis reaction increases the hydrolysis reaction constant which further increases the hydrolysis reaction rate of the active component the momentary intense exotherm generates high temperatures locally leading to the carbonization of the aso the increased nacl content of the reaction medium can disperse the heat generated by the hydrolysis reaction thus interrupting the self accelerating mechanism of the hydrolysis reaction meanwhile the increase in nacl content in the medium increases the concentration of cl 1 ions in the hydrolysis reaction causing the hydrolysis reaction to proceed in the opposite direction which has a certain inhibitory effect on the hydrolysis reaction 4 al 2 cl 7 2h 2 o alcl 4 al oh 2 cl 2hcl 5 alcl 4 2h 2 o cl al oh 2 cl 2hcl 3 2 2 effect of material ratio on the hydrolysis of chloroaluminate ionic liquid spent catalysts material ratio experiments were carried out simultaneously with selected water and a 15 wt mass fraction of nacl solution as the medium the reaction phenomena were similar for the five groups with different material ratios when the tests were carried out with water as the medium the catalyst of waste ionic liquid sinks to the bottom after about 5 s the water film wrapped around the surface of the waste ionic liquid breaks down and the ionic liquid rapidly undergoes hydrolysis producing bubbles aso and a small amount of precipitated material the increased residence time of spent ionic liquid catalyst at the bottom of the solution and longer hydrolysis reaction time when 15 wt nacl by mass is used as the reaction medium compared to pure water fig 3 c shows that when the material ratio is below 10 1 the spent ionic liquid catalyst undergoes a violent hydrolysis reaction the bubbles carry the vaporized aso during the uplifting process forming pink oil particles on the cup walls and when the material ratio reached 40 1 as shown in fig 3 d the bubbles were more dissolved in water during the uplifting process and there was no phenomenon of aso vaporized particles sticking to the cup wall as can be seen in fig 3 b that when the material ratio was gradually increased from 20 1 to 50 1 the rising temperature of the mixture is gradually reduced by 10 c and the residual carbon value of aso was reduced from 0 56 wt to 0 35 wt indicating that the reaction rate was effectively controlled at the same material ratio the mixture rise temperature and the residual carbon value of aso are lower when 15 wt nacl solution is used as the medium than when water is used as the medium further demonstrating that the increase in nacl concentration inhibits the hydrolysis of the spent chloroaluminate catalyst to avoid a large reactor volume when the feed ratio of spent brine to catalyst is too large the material ratio of chloroaluminate ionic liquid spent catalyst to media is set at 1 40 the properties of the acidic hydrolysate obtained by hydrolyzing the ionic liquid spent catalyst at a material ratio of 40 1 with a mass fraction of 15 wt nacl solution as a medium are shown in table 3 the solution has high concentrations of al3 and cu2 ions and low concentrations of other metal ions as shown in the table the hydrolysate was acidic the presence of some degree of cod in the solution indicates that the oil and water are not completely separated and that a small amount of ionized aso is still present in the hydrolysate the ensuing neutralization and regulation study solely considers the recovery of copper and aluminum resources due to the high concentration and worth of copper and aluminum 3 3 neutralizing recycled copper and aluminum 3 3 1 effect of neutralization parameters on metal recovery the precipitation process using treated lpg sc as a single precipitant was investigated the effect of stirring speed reaction time and reaction temperature on the metal recovery of copper and aluminum was investigated in a set of precipitation experiments to recover copper and aluminum from the acid hydrolysate fig 4 as shown in fig 4 a the stirring speed did not significantly affect the recovery of the metals and the recovery of both copper and aluminum decreased when the stirring speed exceeded 150 r min this is due to the fact that the aluminum in the solution precipitates as flocs and if the stirring speed is too high it may prevent floc formation or even cause flocs to split therefore a stirring speed of 100 r min should be selected fig 4 b shows that the metal recovery tends to fluctuate slightly as the reaction time increases indicating that the hydroxide precipitation is completed within 10 min there is no significant increase in metal recovery with a longer time for industrial scale process operations consideration should be given to reducing the reaction time to reduce operating costs without affecting the recovery of the final product from fig 4 c it is found that the increase in reaction temperature has a definite effect on the metal recovery as the reaction temperature was increased from 20 c to 60 c the metal recovery of copper increased from 90 32 to 91 and then decreased to 81 5 while the metal recovery of aluminum did not change significantly the xrd patterns of the precipitation at different temperatures were monitored and the diffraction peaks were found to change with increasing reaction temperature as shown in fig 4 d at low temperatures the aluminum in the product is in the form of thin hydrous alumina and its diffraction peaks are broad and weak after increasing the reaction temperature the crystalline phase of aluminum in the product is transformed into alumina and the intensity of its diffraction peaks increases significantly indicating that increasing the temperature can increase the crystallinity of aluminum in the product the precipitates are non crystalline at low temperatures which have a large surface area and a large chance of contact with other metal ions in the solution and play a co precipitation role for the copper ions in the solution thus increasing the metal recovery rate of copper the increase in temperature alters the crystalline phase of aluminum in the product increasing crystallinity and reducing the co precipitation role of copper ions by aluminum hydroxide meanwhile increasing the temperature leads to a significant increase in the kinetic energy of the ions making it less likely that copper ions will be trapped in the non crystalline precipitate 34 therefore increasing the reaction temperature appropriately can enhance the crystallinity of the precipitate while excessive temperature will lead to a decrease in the recovery of copper ions so 40 c was chosen as the temperature for the neutralization reaction 3 3 2 effect of reaction ratio on metal recovery al ions and cu ions are dissolved in water as various forms of hydrolysis products as the ph changes with the formation of hydroxyl complexes equations the solubility of al and cu complexes as a function of ph is given in fig 5 a and b respectively as listed in eqs 6 17 32 43 6 al 3 aq h 2 o al oh 2 aq h k 1 10 5 01 7 al 3 aq 2h 2 o al oh 2 aq 2h k 2 10 9 30 8 al 3 aq 3oh al oh 3 k 0 1 3 10 33 9 al 3

a illustrates that aluminum ions are amphoteric and that at ph levels over 9 0 aluminum hydroxide dissolves and reacts with hydroxyl groups to create al oh 4 in contrast at ph levels below 5 0 aluminum ions are primarily found in solution as al oh 2 and al oh 2 the ph range of 5 0 to 9 0 is the range in which aluminum ions precipitate as solid al oh 3 making this range the aluminum ion precipitation interval and at ph 7 0 8 0 there exists a ph at which the solubility of al is minimal copper ions are also amphoteric as shown in fig 5 b the solubility of copper ions was lowest at ph values between 7 0 and 10 0 at other ph conditions copper ions will form other complexes with hydroxyl groups increasing the solubility of copper ions the effect of different reaction ratios v treated lpg sc v acidic hydrolysate on the ph of the solution and the recovery of metal ions was investigated at a speed of 100 r min a reaction time of 10 min and a reaction temperature of 40 c the results are shown in fig 6 as shown in fig 6 the recovery of aluminum ions increased from 82 9 to nearly 100 when the volume ratio of treated lpg sc to acidic hydrolysis solution increased from 9 100 to 14 100 and the solution ph increased from 4 to 6 as the reaction ratio continued to increase the recovery of aluminum ions remained constant when the ratio increased to 20 100 ph 10 aluminum hydroxide began to dissolve partially in the solution and the recovery of aluminum ions decreased to 90 85 similar to aluminum ions the recovery of copper ions reached a maximum of 93 36 when the ph was controlled at 7 0 however as treated lpg sc was added in greater amounts the copper ions formed complexes with the hydroxyl groups which led to the copper hydroxide starting to dissolve in the solution and reduced copper ion recovery therefore a treated lpg sc acid hydrolysis liquid volume ratio of 14 8 100 was chosen to enrich and recover aluminum and copper ions from the acid hydrolysate 3 4 characterization of calcination products the precipitation product obtained under optimal neutralization and conditioning conditions r 100 r min t 40 c t 10 min v treated lpg sc v acid hydrolysate 14 8 100 was analyzed by xrd ft ir and sem eds after washing and calcination and the results are shown in figs 7 and 8 as can be seen from fig 7 a all remarkable diffraction peaks are of the cubic phase structure of cual2o4 which agrees with the standard data of icsd card no 00 001 1153 indicating the formation of a copper aluminate spinel during calcination while copper aluminate spinel is used as a catalyst and semiconductor material 39 additional peaks are also present in the xrd pattern indicating the presence of al21 31o32 in the product as well as the presence of unwashed na2so4 impurities fig 7 b shows sem eds images of the calcined products indicating a good correlation between al cu and o ions fig 8 shows the ft ir spectrum of the calcined product the absorption peak analyzed near 3450 07 cm 1 is due to the oh longitudinal vibration of water the absorption peak at 1640 cm 1 belongs to the bending vibration of oh the m o stretching frequencies occur in the range 550 850 cm 1 and are associated with the vibrations of the cuo alo and cu o al bonds 36 37 this confirms the formation of spinel structures table 4 shows the composition of the calcined product the results showed that the main elements in the calcined product were aluminum and copper with a low content of other impurity ions indicating a high level of copper and aluminum in the product in summary the analysis shows that high purity alumina and copper aluminate spinel can be obtained from the lpg sc coupled chloroaluminate ionic liquid spent catalyst process which enables the resourceful use of metals from the spent catalyst 3 5 physical and chemical characteristics of neutralizing fluids fig 9 a c shows the color and state of lpg sc acidic hydrolysis solution and neutralizing fluid respectively acid hydrolysis solution appears green due to the complexation reaction between copper ions and chloride ions aqueous solution after neutralization the aluminum ions in the solution play a role in inorganic coagulation when settling 33 carrying the organic carbon in the solution into the precipitation further reducing the pollution load in the solution therefore the neutralized liquid shows a colorless and transparent state fig 9 d shows the gc ms chromatograms of the acidic hydrolysis solution and the neutralizing fluid which reveals the contamination components in the ionic liquid hydrolysis solution and the degree of contaminant removal after neutralization the organic compounds in the acidic hydrolysis solution are mainly olefins ketones and ester compounds which are ionized aso components comparing the peak areas for specific contaminants indicates that the neutralization process reduces the amount of organic content in the neutralized reaction system however a small organic fraction is still present this means that a certain level of cod is still present in the neutralizing fluid according to table 5 the oil content is 10 mg l the sulfide level is only 0 64 mg l and the neutralizing fluid s cod content is 430 mg l all three pollutants can meet the tertiary effluent discharge standard of the china national comprehensive effluent discharge standard gb 8978 1996 this demonstrates that the coupling process of lpg sc with chloroaluminate ionic liquid spent catalyst eliminates the risk of high sulfur content and cod in the lpg sc it also verifies that the reuse of the neutralization solution does not cause further contamination to the system and achieves a harmless treatment of the lpg sc 3 6 summarising the lpg sc coupled with chloroaluminate ionic liquid spent catalyst process the lpg sc coupled chloroaluminate ion spent catalyst significantly reduced the sulfide and cod levels in the lpg sc with effluent sulfide concentration of only 0 64 mg l and cod concentration of 430 mg l the sulfide and cod removal rates were 99 97 and 98 24 respectively as can be seen in table 6 this process is on the same level as other spent caustic treatment methods not only that but compared to other spent caustic treatment processes this process also recovers the metal ions from the ionic liquid chloroaluminate spent catalyst under optimal conditions the recovered neutralization product is calcined to obtain a high purity copper aluminate with alumina the process also recovers s ions from the lpg sc in the form of copper sulfide which can be used to prepare sulfuric acid 4 conclusion this paper achieves the first coupled treatment of lpg sc and chloroaluminate ionic liquid spent catalysts the harmless treatment of two types of hazardous waste and the recovery of metal resources were achieved simultaneously the main conclusions are as follows when treated with cuso4 as a precipitant and cpam as a flocculant sulfide and cod from lpg sc were removed with 98 and 86 8 of their original amounts respectively the ftir and gc ms analysis showed that copper ions would interact with organic sulfides the reaction medium was hydrolyzed with the chloroaluminate ionic liquid spent catalyst at a volume ratio of 40 1 and no acid soluble oil vaporization particles adhered to the cup walls during the reaction and the hydrolysis reaction was relatively mild in addition the tests showed that the reuse of the neutralizing fluid containing nacl inhibited the hydrolysis of the chloroaluminate ionic liquid spent

12535,in the petrochemical industry due to strong acids and toxic heavy metals chloroaluminate ionic liquid spent catalysts pose a potential environmental risk given the strong alkalinity and high pollution load the treatment step for liquefied petroleum gas lpg spent caustic requires adding acid resulting in significant acid consumption and the risk of secondary pollution according to the characteristics of these two types of solid waste the coupling process of lpg spent caustic and chloraluminate ionic liquid waste catalyst is proposed with the goal of resource and harmlessness the lpg spent caustic and the chloroaluminate ionic liquid spent catalyst are pretreated by precipitation flocculation and hydrolysis respectively after which they are neutralized the main factors in the pretreatment and neutralization process are systematically examined under optimum circumstances 98 of the sulfide from lpg spent caustic was removed 86 8 of the chemical oxygen requirement was removed and the oil content in the treated solution was 10 mg l the hydrolysis reaction was milder when the hydrolysis media was mixed with the chloroaluminate ionic liquid spent catalyst at a volume ratio of 40 1 by changing the hydrolysis medium it was confirmed that the neutralizing solution containing sodium chloride had an inhibitory effect on the reaction when reused in the hydrolysis reaction of the spent catalyst the treated lpg sc and the acidic hydrolysate were neutralized at a volume ratio of 14 8 100 the ph after the reaction was 7 and the recoveries of aluminum and copper ions were 99 99 and 93 36 respectively the precipitates were calcined at high temperatures and the characterization of the calcined products confirmed the formation of copper aluminate spinel by xrd ft ir and sem eds the cod sulfide and oil indicators in the neutralization solution meet the tertiary effluent discharge standards of china s national comprehensive effluent discharge standard gb 8978 1996 the process eliminates the risk of high sulfide and cod from the lpg sc and recovers the spent catalyst s metal resources in addition the whole process has no additional added acid or alkali a new approach to disposing of these two hazardous wastes lpg sc and chloroaluminate ionic liquid spent catalysts for the petrochemical industry is offered graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords lpg spent caustic chloroaluminate ionic liquid spent catalysts neutralization recover data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction in petrochemical factories the presence of impurities such as sulfides in the oil restricts any direct use of the oil and products for example in the liquefied petroleum gas lpg industry the merox process 1 effectively removes sulfidic and impurities from lpg and the process produces a waste sodium hydroxide solution called sulfidic spent caustic ssc 2 which accounts for 5 wt to 10 wt of the total refinery wastewater discharge because of its high contaminant level in sc 3 4 high alkalinity ph 12 high salt content 5 10 wt high sulfide content 2 8 wt and extremely high chemical oxygen demand cod it is regarded as a hazardous waste by petrochemicals all over the world due to its complex composition which inhibits biological treatment special treatment of waste lye is required before it can be sent to wastewater treatment plants 5 6 the production of high octane trimethylpentane which can be used as a gasoline additive to raise octane levels depends on the alkylation of isobutane and butene 7 composite ionic liquid catalysts cil 8 are cucl modified chloroaluminate ionic liquids which are considered an alternative to conventional alkylation catalysts 10 11 due to their improved selectivity 9 in the alkylation of isobutane low corrosiveness low toxicity 12 and environmental friendliness 13 for every 1 tonne of trimethylpentane produced 4 5 kg of chloroaluminate ionic liquid spent catalyst is generated the composition of these spent catalysts is essentially the same as that of fresh catalysts 16 except for a slight decrease in activity and the presence of acid soluble oil aso 15 chloroaluminate ionic liquid spent catalysts are hazardous waste in the petrochemical industry and require environmentally sound treatment due to their high activity metal concentration acidity and aso content in the traditional treatment process for these two types of solid waste the strongly alkaline lpg spent caustic lpg sc treatment process requires adding large amounts of sulfuric acid for neutralization 19 with a high metal concentration and acidity the extremely acidic chloroaluminate ionic liquid wasted catalysts require the addition of alkali to increase the ph to the effluent water quality level in order to separate the metals in the form of precipitation consequently significant acid and alkali consumption is an issue according to the comprehensive characteristics of these two types of solid waste with harmless and resourceful treatment as the goal a technical process can be proposed for the coupling treatment of lpg sc with chloroaluminate ionic liquid spent catalyst however if two hazardous wastes are coupled directly without treatment in that case the sulfides in the lpg sc will be converted to h2s 17 under acidic neutralizing exothermic conditions and released causing great harm to the environment 18 due to the active alcl3 component present chloroaluminate ionic liquid spend catalysts violently hydrolyze when in contact with water producing a lot of heat that causes the mixed system to heat up quickly and the aso to carbonize lowering the quality of the oil at the end of the reaction a mixed system containing three phases of oil water solid will be formed resulting in a complex system that is not conducive to the recovery of the solid phase therefore to achieve coupling of lpg sc with chloroaluminate ionic liquid spent catalysts effective technical methods must be used to reduce the sulfide and other contaminant loads in lpg sc before coupling while eliminating the active component in the chloroaluminate ionic liquid spent catalyst and separating the aso chemical precipitation has an advantage over chemical oxidation and air in that it does not need using an external field 20 or changing the ph of the solution 21 the various metal salts e g ferrous and ferric sulfate copper sulfate can react chemically with dissolved sulfides to form relatively insoluble metal sulfides 22 thus reducing the concentration of dissolved sulfides in the effluent by chemical precipitation ramon ganigue 23 controls the sulfide level in the sewers by adding iron salts to avoid the formation of h2s in the gas pipes altaş levent 24 used conventional coagulants fecl3 and feso4 with the help of coagulant adjuvants ca oh 2 and caco3 to treat sulfides in refinery wastewater and found that 99 removal of sulfides and 80 removal of cod was achieved under optimal conditions with fe2 as a flocculant and ca oh 2 as precipitation aid metal chlorides can also be used as desulfurizing agents to remove organic sulfides from diesel fuel by complexation precipitation 25 thiophene like sulfides can undergo π bonding coordination with copper ions and effectively remove sulfides from organic systems chloroaluminate ionic liquid spent catalysts are sensitive to water adding small amounts of water can produce hcl gas 26 which releases large amounts of heat and leads to aso carbonization 27 isolated aso in the laboratory by mixing a chloroaluminate ionic liquid spent catalyst with an equal weight of ice to control the mixture s temperature keeping the mixture s temperature below 40 c avoiding the violent heating of the mixture caused by the addition of water xuan zhang obtained aso by hydrolysis by placing the chloroaluminate ionic liquid spent catalyst in a flask at 5 c and adding 3wt sodium hydroxide solution 14 in summary metal ions effectively remove sulfides from solution and adding flocculants can further improve the removal of pollutants therefore the precipitation flocculation method was used to pretreat lpg sc and the effect of the type and amount of precipitant and the amount of flocculant on the contaminants in lpg sc was investigated the aso can be separated from the chloroaluminate ionic liquid waste catalyst by the addition of water the temperature of the mixture needs to be controlled when adding water to prevent the mixture from boiling due to violent hydrolysis as the neutralizing fluid is reused in the hydrolysis process of the spent catalyst the effect of the nacl content of the solution on the hydrolysis process needs to be considered therefore the effects of different reaction media and material ratios on the temperature rise and aso residual carbon values during the hydrolysis of chloroaluminate ionic liquid spent catalysts were investigated afterward the optimum process conditions for the neutralization of the acidic hydrolysate with treated lpg sc were determined by a single factor test this paper presents the first process for coupling lpg sc with a chloroaluminate ionic liquid waste catalyst the chloraluminate ionic liquid spent catalysts have 93 of the metal recovered the recovered precipitate can be calcined to create copper aluminate spinel with potential applications allowing for waste resource recovery additionally the wastewater produced by the coupled process can meet the tertiary effluent discharge parameters of the chinese national comprehensive effluent discharge standard in terms of sulfide cod and oil content gb 8978 1996 this co processing process resolves the issue of treating two types of hazardous waste in the petrochemical industry lpg sc and chloroaluminate ionic liquid spent catalyst while achieving the harmless treatment and resource utilization of hazardous waste 2 experimental section 2 1 materials the lpg sc and chloroaluminate ionic liquid spent catalysts studied in this paper were supplied by china petroleum chemical corporation wuhan branch the results of the water quality analysis of the lpg sc are shown in table 1 high pollution load in lpg sc cod and sulfide content of 24 500 and 2098 mg l respectively therefore these experiments were carried out as soon as possible within 12 h to minimize changes in water quality over time due to oxidation in addition copper sulfate pentahydrate ferrous sulfate heptahydrate ferric chloride etc are all analytically pure reagents with purity 99 0 produced by sinopharm chemical reagent co 2 2 experimental process the detailed flow chart used in this study is shown in fig 1 the experiments were carried out according to three main sections precipitation flocculation pretreatment of lpg sc hydrolysis of chloraluminate ionic liquid spent catalysts and neutralizing recycled metals 2 2 1 precipitation flocculation pretreatment the different precipitation reagents including cuso4 feso4 and fe2 so4 3 were configured as a 200 g l solution of precipitation reagent and the flocculant cpam was configured as a 0 2 wt solution of organic flocculant all the experiments for treating lpg sc by precipitation flocculation were carried out in 250 ml beakers with an initial solution of 20 ml different types and dosages of precipitant solutions were added dropwise to the beaker containing lpg sc and the reaction was carried out with a magnetic stirrer at 200 r min for 20 min determination of sulfide content in treated lpg sc at the end of the reaction then 0 2 wt organic flocculant solution was added dropwise to the reaction system the speed was adjusted to 60 r min the reaction time was 20 min and the solid liquid settling was 90 min the solid liquid separation gives the treated lpg sc and measures the cod and oil content in the liquid phase 2 2 2 hydrolysis of ionic liquid chloraluminate spent catalysts the chloroaluminate ionic liquid spent catalyst 20 ml was added to different reaction media at different volume ratios for hydrolysis reaction stirred slowly for 30 min and left for 12 h oil water separation to give acid hydrolysate and acid soluble oil the temperature of the mixture rising during the hydrolysis of the ionic liquid chloroaluminate spent catalyst was measured and the residual carbon value of the aso was measured the nacl solutions of different mass fractions 10 wt 15 wt 20 wt were prepared and the spent chloroaluminate ionic liquid catalyst was slowly added at the same volume ratio under the same reaction conditions the temperature changes of the mixture during hydrolysis were recorded during this period and the residual carbon value of the separated aso was determined 2 2 3 neutralizing recycled metals all neutralization and modulation experiments for recovering valuable metals were carried out in 250 ml beakers the acid hydrolysate 30 ml is placed into a beaker and heated to a certain temperature the solution is then stirred at a certain speed using a magnetic stirrer while the ph is measured with a ph meter the pretreated lpg sc is slowly added to the acid hydrolysate to raise the ph and recover the cu and al from the acid hydrolysate at the end of the reaction the solution was sampled using a syringe and immediately filtered through a 0 45 μm microporous filter membrane the cu and al concentrations in the filtrate were determined by inductively coupled plasma emission spectrometry icp oes the neutralizing slag is washed with water to remove excess nacl and other impurities the obtained solid sample is oven dried at

results and discussion 3 1 precipitation flocculation pretreatment 3 1 1 effect of precipitant type and dosage on sulfide removal fig 2 a demonstrates how the removal rate of sulfide finally stabilized at 70 and 57 with increasing dosage when feso4 and fe2 so4 3 were used as precipitating agents this is because fe3 will be reduced to fe2 by s2 under reducing conditions the fe2 precipitation reaction with s2 in the lpg sc will simultaneously produce fe oh 2 under strongly alkaline conditions with the following reaction equation 1 2fe 3 s 2 2fe 2 s 2 fe 2 s 2 fes 3 fe 2 2oh fe oh 2 the solubility product of fes ksp 6 25 10 17 is similar to that of fe oh 2 ksp 7 9 10 16 and fe2 tends to react more with hydroxide ions to form fe oh 2 under strongly alkaline conditions at ph 14 the solubility of fes increases rapidly with increasing ph after the solution ph 10 28 the removal rate of sulfide from lpg sc showed a trend of increasing and then leveling off as the cu2 s2 molar ratio increased with cuso4 as the precipitant the removal rate of sulfide from lpg sc reaches 98 when the cu2 s2 molar ratio reaches 2 0 mol mol 1 at which point the sulfide concentration in lpg sc is 40 mg l compared to ferrous and trivalent iron ions copper sulfate as a precipitant result in high removal of sulfides and significant odor removal the precipitated phase of the lpg sc treated by the precipitation method was analyzed by ft ir infrared spectroscopy as shown in fig 2 c the oh stretching vibration peak is located at 3434 34 cm 1 compared to cus the spent caustic precipitated phase has a vibrational peak at 1049 23 cm 1 caused by the stretching vibration of the cs bond 29 this indicates that the sulfur atoms in the organic sulfides in the lpg sc complex with copper ions based on the coordination bonding theory due to the relatively low electronegativity of the sulfur atom it is relatively easy to lose its lone electron pair the electronic configuration of the cu2 ion is 3s23p63d9 thus the sulfur atom can provide electron pairs to the hollow 4 s and 4p orbitals of the cu2 ion forming an s m σ bond thus complexation precipitation allows the cu2 ions to separate the organic sulfides from the lpg sc fig 2 d shows the chromatogram of the lpg sc both before and after the precipitation treatment the figure shows that the untreated lpg sc contains several organic contaminants such as major thioethers mercaptans and other sulfur containing organics therefore the lpg sc emits a large amount of irritating odor the comparison revealed a significant reduction in organic sulfides in the precipitation treated lpg sc this suggests that the organic pollution load in lpg sc can be effectively reduced by removing organic sulfides from lpg sc when copper ions are utilized as a precipitant cuso4 is a suitable desulfurization precipitant for lpg sc as a result excessive cuso4 dosing will increase the concentration of cu2 in the liquid phase and reduce the concentration of sodium hydroxide in the post desulfurization alkali residue which will be detrimental to the utilization of alkali resources thus the cuso4 dosage was chosen to be n cu2 n s2 2 1 3 1 2 effect of cpam dosing on cod and oil removal rates the treatment of lpg sc by precipitation under optimal conditions was significant for sulfide removal but the cod removal in lpg sc was only 72 92 therefore the flocculation of cpam is used further to improve the removal of cod from lpg sc from fig 2 b it can be found that the removal rate of cod and oil content showed a trend of increasing and then decreasing with the increase of cpam dosage at a cpam dosage of 15 mg l the cod removal rate reached a maximum of 86 8 and the oil content was 10 mg l an increase of 13 88 in cod removal and a decrease of 85 71 in oil content compared to the system without cpam addition as the dosage continued to increase the cod removal rate began to decline and the oil content began to increase at a dosage of 30 mg l the cod removal rate was only 74 62 and the oil concentration was 65 mg l this is due to oil in the aqueous phase is often negatively charged in contrast the hydrolysis products of cpam are cationic 35 and can electrically neutralize the oil in the water reducing their electrostatic repulsion and allowing them to adsorb on the floc in the system excessive doses of cpam might cause a change from unstable to stable colloidal particles 30 which lowers the effectiveness of treatment 3 1 3 physical and chemical characteristics of lpg sc after precipitation flocculation treatment the parameters of some pollutant loads in the treated spent caustic under optimal conditions n cu2 n s2 2 1 cpam dosing of 15 mg l are given in table 2 according to table 2 the treated lpg sc has a low concentration of copper ions meaning there are no extra copper ions in the solution although several pollution loads were greatly reduced due to the precipitation flocculation treatment for lpg sc the amounts of cod and sulfide were still over the requirements for effluent release considering that the subsequent neutralization process will further reduce the effluent pollution load this step does not involve excessive pretreatment of the lpg sc 3 2 hydrolysis of chloroaluminate ionic liquid spent catalysts 3 2 1 effect of the reaction medium on the hydrolysis of chloroaluminate ionic liquid spent catalysts after neutralization and conditioning the acidic hydrolysate with the treated lpg sc the neutralization fluid will be re entered into the hydrolysis step of the chloroaluminate ionic liquid spent catalyst the level of nacl in the hydrolysis reaction medium increases as the number of neutralizing fluid reuses increases therefore to investigate the feasibility of reusing the neutralized liquid the effect of nacl content on the hydrolysis process of ionic liquid spent catalysts was studied the results are shown in fig 3 a as shown in fig 3 a the residual carbon value of aso decreased from 0 63 wt to 0 18 wt with an increase in nacl content in the solution at the same material ratio and the temperature at which the mixture rises was lowered from 30 c to 25 c this suggests that the increased sodium chloride content in the reaction medium inhibits the carbonation of aso while slowing down the tendency for the temperature to rise during the hydrolysis of the spent catalyst the gentle hydrolysis of the chloroaluminate ionic liquid spent catalyst was promoted the reason for this is that aluminum ions are mainly present in the spent catalyst in the form of alcl4 and al2cl7 which hydrolyze rapidly on contact with water to produce hydrogen chloride as shown in reactions 4 to 5 31 in addition the exothermic hydrolysis reaction increases the hydrolysis reaction constant which further increases the hydrolysis reaction rate of the active component the momentary intense exotherm generates high temperatures locally leading to the carbonization of the aso the increased nacl content of the reaction medium can disperse the heat generated by the hydrolysis reaction thus interrupting the self accelerating mechanism of the hydrolysis reaction meanwhile the increase in nacl content in the medium increases the concentration of cl 1 ions in the hydrolysis reaction causing the hydrolysis reaction to proceed in the opposite direction which has a certain inhibitory effect on the hydrolysis reaction 4 al 2 cl 7 2h 2 o alcl 4 al oh 2 cl 2hcl 5 alcl 4 2h 2 o cl al oh 2 cl 2hcl 3 2 2 effect of material ratio on the hydrolysis of chloroaluminate ionic liquid spent catalysts material ratio experiments were carried out simultaneously with selected water and a 15 wt mass fraction of nacl solution as the medium the reaction phenomena were similar for the five groups with different material ratios when the tests were carried out with water as the medium the catalyst of waste ionic liquid sinks to the bottom after about 5 s the water film wrapped around the surface of the waste ionic liquid breaks down and the ionic liquid rapidly undergoes hydrolysis producing bubbles aso and a small amount of precipitated material the increased residence time of spent ionic liquid catalyst at the bottom of the solution and longer hydrolysis reaction time when 15 wt nacl by mass is used as the reaction medium compared to pure water fig 3 c shows that when the material ratio is below 10 1 the spent ionic liquid catalyst undergoes a violent hydrolysis reaction the bubbles carry the vaporized aso during the uplifting process forming pink oil particles on the cup walls and when the material ratio reached 40 1 as shown in fig 3 d the bubbles were more dissolved in water during the uplifting process and there was no phenomenon of aso vaporized particles sticking to the cup wall as can be seen in fig 3 b that when the material ratio was gradually increased from 20 1 to 50 1 the rising temperature of the mixture is gradually reduced by 10 c and the residual carbon value of aso was reduced from 0 56 wt to 0 35 wt indicating that the reaction rate was effectively controlled at the same material ratio the mixture rise temperature and the residual carbon value of aso are lower when 15 wt nacl solution is used as the medium than when water is used as the medium further demonstrating that the increase in nacl concentration inhibits the hydrolysis of the spent chloroaluminate catalyst to avoid a large reactor volume when the feed ratio of spent brine to catalyst is too large the material ratio of chloroaluminate ionic liquid spent catalyst to media is set at 1 40 the properties of the acidic hydrolysate obtained by hydrolyzing the ionic liquid spent catalyst at a material ratio of 40 1 with a mass fraction of 15 wt nacl solution as a medium are shown in table 3 the solution has high concentrations of al3 and cu2 ions and low concentrations of other metal ions as shown in the table the hydrolysate was acidic the presence of some degree of cod in the solution indicates that the oil and water are not completely separated and that a small amount of ionized aso is still present in the hydrolysate the ensuing neutralization and regulation study solely considers the recovery of copper and aluminum resources due to the high concentration and worth of copper and aluminum 3 3 neutralizing recycled copper and aluminum 3 3 1 effect of neutralization parameters on metal recovery the precipitation process using treated lpg sc as a single precipitant was investigated the effect of stirring speed reaction time and reaction temperature on the metal recovery of copper and aluminum was investigated in a set of precipitation experiments to recover copper and aluminum from the acid hydrolysate fig 4 as shown in fig 4 a the stirring speed did not significantly affect the recovery of the metals and the recovery of both copper and aluminum decreased when the stirring speed exceeded 150 r min this is due to the fact that the aluminum in the solution precipitates as flocs and if the stirring speed is too high it may prevent floc formation or even cause flocs to split therefore a stirring speed of 100 r min should be selected fig 4 b shows that the metal recovery tends to fluctuate slightly as the reaction time increases indicating that the hydroxide precipitation is completed within 10 min there is no significant increase in metal recovery with a longer time for industrial scale process operations consideration should be given to reducing the reaction time to reduce operating costs without affecting the recovery of the final product from fig 4 c it is found that the increase in reaction temperature has a definite effect on the metal recovery as the reaction temperature was increased from 20 c to 60 c the metal recovery of copper increased from 90 32 to 91 and then decreased to 81 5 while the metal recovery of aluminum did not change significantly the xrd patterns of the precipitation at different temperatures were monitored and the diffraction peaks were found to change with increasing reaction temperature as shown in fig 4 d at low temperatures the aluminum in the product is in the form of thin hydrous alumina and its diffraction peaks are broad and weak after increasing the reaction temperature the crystalline phase of aluminum in the product is transformed into alumina and the intensity of its diffraction peaks increases significantly indicating that increasing the temperature can increase the crystallinity of aluminum in the product the precipitates are non crystalline at low temperatures which have a large surface area and a large chance of contact with other metal ions in the solution and play a co precipitation role for the copper ions in the solution thus increasing the metal recovery rate of copper the increase in temperature alters the crystalline phase of aluminum in the product increasing crystallinity and reducing the co precipitation role of copper ions by aluminum hydroxide meanwhile increasing the temperature leads to a significant increase in the kinetic energy of the ions making it less likely that copper ions will be trapped in the non crystalline precipitate 34 therefore increasing the reaction temperature appropriately can enhance the crystallinity of the precipitate while excessive temperature will lead to a decrease in the recovery of copper ions so 40 c was chosen as the temperature for the neutralization reaction 3 3 2 effect of reaction ratio on metal recovery al ions and cu ions are dissolved in water as various forms of hydrolysis products as the ph changes with the formation of hydroxyl complexes equations the solubility of al and cu complexes as a function of ph is given in fig 5 a and b respectively as listed in eqs 6 17 32 43 6 al 3 aq h 2 o al oh 2 aq h k 1 10 5 01 7 al 3 aq 2h 2 o al oh 2 aq 2h k 2 10 9 30 8 al 3 aq 3oh al oh 3 k 0 1 3 10 33 9 al 3

a illustrates that aluminum ions are amphoteric and that at ph levels over 9 0 aluminum hydroxide dissolves and reacts with hydroxyl groups to create al oh 4 in contrast at ph levels below 5 0 aluminum ions are primarily found in solution as al oh 2 and al oh 2 the ph range of 5 0 to 9 0 is the range in which aluminum ions precipitate as solid al oh 3 making this range the aluminum ion precipitation interval and at ph 7 0 8 0 there exists a ph at which the solubility of al is minimal copper ions are also amphoteric as shown in fig 5 b the solubility of copper ions was lowest at ph values between 7 0 and 10 0 at other ph conditions copper ions will form other complexes with hydroxyl groups increasing the solubility of copper ions the effect of different reaction ratios v treated lpg sc v acidic hydrolysate on the ph of the solution and the recovery of metal ions was investigated at a speed of 100 r min a reaction time of 10 min and a reaction temperature of 40 c the results are shown in fig 6 as shown in fig 6 the recovery of aluminum ions increased from 82 9 to nearly 100 when the volume ratio of treated lpg sc to acidic hydrolysis solution increased from 9 100 to 14 100 and the solution ph increased from 4 to 6 as the reaction ratio continued to increase the recovery of aluminum ions remained constant when the ratio increased to 20 100 ph 10 aluminum hydroxide began to dissolve partially in the solution and the recovery of aluminum ions decreased to 90 85 similar to aluminum ions the recovery of copper ions reached a maximum of 93 36 when the ph was controlled at 7 0 however as treated lpg sc was added in greater amounts the copper ions formed complexes with the hydroxyl groups which led to the copper hydroxide starting to dissolve in the solution and reduced copper ion recovery therefore a treated lpg sc acid hydrolysis liquid volume ratio of 14 8 100 was chosen to enrich and recover aluminum and copper ions from the acid hydrolysate 3 4 characterization of calcination products the precipitation product obtained under optimal neutralization and conditioning conditions r 100 r min t 40 c t 10 min v treated lpg sc v acid hydrolysate 14 8 100 was analyzed by xrd ft ir and sem eds after washing and calcination and the results are shown in figs 7 and 8 as can be seen from fig 7 a all remarkable diffraction peaks are of the cubic phase structure of cual2o4 which agrees with the standard data of icsd card no 00 001 1153 indicating the formation of a copper aluminate spinel during calcination while copper aluminate spinel is used as a catalyst and semiconductor material 39 additional peaks are also present in the xrd pattern indicating the presence of al21 31o32 in the product as well as the presence of unwashed na2so4 impurities fig 7 b shows sem eds images of the calcined products indicating a good correlation between al cu and o ions fig 8 shows the ft ir spectrum of the calcined product the absorption peak analyzed near 3450 07 cm 1 is due to the oh longitudinal vibration of water the absorption peak at 1640 cm 1 belongs to the bending vibration of oh the m o stretching frequencies occur in the range 550 850 cm 1 and are associated with the vibrations of the cuo alo and cu o al bonds 36 37 this confirms the formation of spinel structures table 4 shows the composition of the calcined product the results showed that the main elements in the calcined product were aluminum and copper with a low content of other impurity ions indicating a high level of copper and aluminum in the product in summary the analysis shows that high purity alumina and copper aluminate spinel can be obtained from the lpg sc coupled chloroaluminate ionic liquid spent catalyst process which enables the resourceful use of metals from the spent catalyst 3 5 physical and chemical characteristics of neutralizing fluids fig 9 a c shows the color and state of lpg sc acidic hydrolysis solution and neutralizing fluid respectively acid hydrolysis solution appears green due to the complexation reaction between copper ions and chloride ions aqueous solution after neutralization the aluminum ions in the solution play a role in inorganic coagulation when settling 33 carrying the organic carbon in the solution into the precipitation further reducing the pollution load in the solution therefore the neutralized liquid shows a colorless and transparent state fig 9 d shows the gc ms chromatograms of the acidic hydrolysis solution and the neutralizing fluid which reveals the contamination components in the ionic liquid hydrolysis solution and the degree of contaminant removal after neutralization the organic compounds in the acidic hydrolysis solution are mainly olefins ketones and ester compounds which are ionized aso components comparing the peak areas for specific contaminants indicates that the neutralization process reduces the amount of organic content in the neutralized reaction system however a small organic fraction is still present this means that a certain level of cod is still present in the neutralizing fluid according to table 5 the oil content is 10 mg l the sulfide level is only 0 64 mg l and the neutralizing fluid s cod content is 430 mg l all three pollutants can meet the tertiary effluent discharge standard of the china national comprehensive effluent discharge standard gb 8978 1996 this demonstrates that the coupling process of lpg sc with chloroaluminate ionic liquid spent catalyst eliminates the risk of high sulfur content and cod in the lpg sc it also verifies that the reuse of the neutralization solution does not cause further contamination to the system and achieves a harmless treatment of the lpg sc 3 6 summarising the lpg sc coupled with chloroaluminate ionic liquid spent catalyst process the lpg sc coupled chloroaluminate ion spent catalyst significantly reduced the sulfide and cod levels in the lpg sc with effluent sulfide concentration of only 0 64 mg l and cod concentration of 430 mg l the sulfide and cod removal rates were 99 97 and 98 24 respectively as can be seen in table 6 this process is on the same level as other spent caustic treatment methods not only that but compared to other spent caustic treatment processes this process also recovers the metal ions from the ionic liquid chloroaluminate spent catalyst under optimal conditions the recovered neutralization product is calcined to obtain a high purity copper aluminate with alumina the process also recovers s ions from the lpg sc in the form of copper sulfide which can be used to prepare sulfuric acid 4 conclusion this paper achieves the first coupled treatment of lpg sc and chloroaluminate ionic liquid spent catalysts the harmless treatment

12536,a high antibiotic concentration promotes the horizontal gene transfer hgt of antibiotic resistance genes args in the wastewater while reducing the arg abundance due to the production of resistance however the two way effects of antibiotic concentration on the abundance of args with different antibiotics are still lacking herein the fate of args and the corresponding composition of the microbial community i e resistome and potential host bacteria for hgt were investigated by adding two typical antibiotics i e sulfadiazine sdz and tetracycline hydrochloride tc hcl under different concentrations results indicated that the initial antibiotic concentration for two antibiotics had different effects on the abundance of the corresponding args i e tet or sul however it was affected by the final antibiotic concentration and a higher final antibiotic concentration would have a higher arg abundance for both two antibiotic treatments a higher initial antibiotic concentration would decrease the abundance but improve the diversity of the microbial community resulting in the different biodegradation abilities of the corresponding antibiotic and subsequently affecting the resistome of microbial community resulting in altering the abundance of args i e tet or sul on the other hand a higher final antibiotic concentration had a higher abundance of potential host bacteria resulting in a higher abundance of args i e tet or sul this study provides new insights into the mechanisms underlying the alteration of arg abundance to the selection pressures of antibiotic concentration in

antibiotic resistance genes args in various water environments 4 5 which may harm human health due to antimicrobial resistance according to the un interagency coordination group antibiotic resistance diseases will kill over 10 million people annually by 2050 6 in addition to antibiotic induced generation args can also be propagated by horizontal gene transfer hgt under environmental selection

e g sul1 sul2 and sul3 genes were often found in wwtp effluent 9 10 additionally the abundance of args in wwtps effluent ranges from 103 to 106 copies ml which is over 100 times higher than that in the water environment args in the wwtps system exhibited significant to the spatial variation 11 12 thus the mechanism for the args distribution in the wwtps system needs to be further investigated the density of args in wwtps usually impacted by regional antibiotics consumption classes and concentration these regional fluctuations of antibiotics cause distinctive selective pressure for microbial population and args propagation 13 14 due to the interplay of antibiotics sources wwtps are a substantial sink of args unfortunately antibiotics cannot be eradicated effectively and therefore pose an ecotoxicological risk to the environment 15 16 among them sulfonamides and tetracycline were found to be the most common in the effluent and influent of wwtps because these antibiotics have stable structural properties 17 18 the high concentration of the two antibiotics tetracycline 3 0 mg l and sulfamethoxazole 40 mg l was examined in the influent of wwtps 19 antibiotics are mainly eliminated through biodegradation and physical chemical interaction i e adsorption by aerobic activated sludge in wwtps and the biodegradation process generally occurs through two main mechanisms metabolism and co metabolism which have proven to be the dominating pathways for the eradication of antibiotics through the nitrification process in aerobic sludge 20 sub

activated sludge can host and propagate args among bacteria via hgt 5 26 27 because args can be transmitted from one bacterial species to another the potential host bacteria for hgt would contribute to variation in the abundance of args 28 29 currently most of studies looking into the relationship between args and bacterial populations rely on network analysis which has provided new perspectives on the coexistence of args and their potential host bacteria 24 30 thus it is indispensable to compare and assess the changing aspects of the resistome and microbiome in response to different antibiotic classes and concentrations to better understand the relationship between antibiotic concentration and the dissemination of args two commonly detectable antibiotics in wwtps i e sulfadiazine sdz and tetracycline hydrochloride tc hcl with different initial and final concentrations were chosen for an association of their fates and the corresponding args abundance in aerobic activated sludge reactors the explicit purposes of this study were to 1 investigate the relationship between initial and final antibiotic concentrations and the abundance of args 2 examine the overall diversity of the microbial community under different antibiotic conditions 3 reveal the response of the microbial community to antibiotic biodegradation under different initial and final antibiotic concentrations and 4 evaluate the distribution of args and their potential host bacteria by adding two antibiotics 2 material and method 2 1 reactor setup and operation three equal sized laboratory scale reactors were named i e tc hcl sdz and control with an adequate volume of 2 l for aerobic bioreactors were operated at 25 c the 1 l of aerobic sludge collected from jiangning wwtp nanjing china had 55 of sv30 and 3549 mg l of mixed liquor suspended solids the pump bt1002j long precision pump company limited china was used to pump synthetic wastewater into the bioreactors after inoculation the ingredients for 1 l of synthetic wastewater were sodium acetate 500 mg ammonium chloride 150 mg magnesium sulfate 15 mg calcium chloride 20 mg sodium bicarbonate 100 mg potassium dihydrogen phosphate 2 66 mg dipotassium hydrogen phosphate 5 35 mg and 1 0 ml l of trace element solution 31 when bioreactors stabilized i e removal efficacy of carbon oxygen demand and ammonia stayed consistent at 82 two typical antibiotics i e tc hcl and sdz at different concentrations were added and one bioreactor operated as a control the sludge retention time srt of bioreactors was 12 h three bioreactors were operated for 120 days the antibiotic concentration for tc hcl i e 5 0 3 0 and 1 0 mg l and sdz i e 5 0 1 0 and 0 5 mg l was different in two bioreactors a diffuse aerator was used to aerate at a rate of 51 ml min and the dissolved oxygen concentration in the bioreactor was 5 5 1 5 mg l during batch operation 2 2 physiochemical analysis the effluent samples were collected every 6 h from the bioreactors i e tc hcl and sdz to determine the antibiotic concentration the high performance liquid chromatography hplc system agilent 1269 technologies usa was used to determine the concentrations of antibiotics in the supernatant and the protocol is given in text s1 2 3 extraction of dna 16s rrna genes sequencing and bioinformatics assay the samples from these bioreactors i e tc hcl sdz and control were collected at the end of each antibiotic concentration including seed sludge based on manufacturers protocols using the ezna soil dna kit omega bio tek norcros ga usa the polymerase chain reaction pcr products were extracted using a 2 0 agarose gel which were then purified with the axyprep dna gel extraction kit axygen biosciences california usa and quantified with quantifluor st promega corporation usa according to the manufacturer s protocol text s2 initially bacterial 16s rrna gene fragments were amplified using adapter tagged primer pairs designed to amplify v4 v5 regions by the thermocycler pcr system and forward and reverse primers shown in table s2 the pcr protocol is shown in text s2 refined amplicons were constructed at equimolar levels using standard methods from majorbio bio pharm technology corporation limited shanghai china and paired end sequences 2 300 were performed using an illumina miseq platform illumina san diego usa according to the manufacturer s specifications the fastq formatted sequences were processed and analyzed using qiime2 ver 2021 11 32 during the filtering process low quality and low abundant reads mismatched reads ambiguous lengths and bases beyond the prescribed range and chimeras were removed in a nutshell fastq formatted sequences with primers below quality scores of 25 and read lengths of 300 bp were eliminated representative sequence files and feature tables were merged and taxonomic classification with 97 sequence similarity was performed using the greengenes 13 8 reference database to minimize the effects of sequencing depth each sample was resampled to yield 9932 sequences the diversity metrics within sample α diversity chao1 shannon s index and simpson and between samples β diversity bray curtis matrix were calculated using the vegan package correlation coefficients with a statistical significance of p value 0 05 were calculated using the stats package in the r programming language version 4 1 0 a statistically significant correlation between args and the bacterial community was calculated at a 95 confidence interval p value 0 05 finally obtained results were uploaded in gephi software version 0 9 5 to do networking among args and the bacterial community 2 4 arg quantification the effluent samples were collected at the completion of each concentration of tc hcl i e 5 0 3 0 and 1 0 mg l and sdz i e 5 0 1 0 and 0 5 mg l and the corresponding effluent samples were purified with sterile a 0 22 μm filter ncm whatman uk and reduced into parts for dna extractions the dna isolation kit used for extracting genomic dna followed by manufacturer protocol mo bio carlsbad california usa sulfonamides and tetracyclines were commonly identified in wwtps effluents correspondingly args such as sulfonamide resistance i e sul1 sul2 sul3 genes and tetracycline resistance i e teta tetm tetq genes were frequently spotted into wwtp effluents 33 therefore quantitative polymerase chain reaction q pcr biorad hercules california usa was exploited to measure the 16s rrna gene sdz resistance sul1 sul2 and sul3 genes and tc hcl resistance genes teta tetm and tetq genes to assess the quantity of these resistance genes q pcr was done in triplicate wcgene biotechnology corporation shanghai china designed all the forward and reverse primers used for amplification shown in table s2 the copy numbers for target args wcgene biotechnology shanghai china were derived from standard curves r2 0 990 and then integrated with the plasmid 3 results and discussion 3 1 the relationship between antibiotic removal and arg distribution broad spectrum antibiotics such as tetracycline and sulfonamides are extensively used in humans and aquaculture species to treat bacterial infections 34 bacteria may acquire resistance to antibiotics primarily via efflux pump mechanisms or ribosome protection proteins 35 therefore efflux pump genes teta ribosomal protection protein genes tetq and tetm class 1 integrons sul1 36 a broad host range of plasmid sul2 37 and conjugative plasmid sul3 38 were determined to investigate whether exposure to tc hcl and sdz at mg l levels can enhance the development of genes thus the occurrence of args targeted for tc hcl i e teta tetm and tetq and sdz i e sul1 sul2 and sul3 treatments were shown in fig 1 the abundance of tet gene was less affected by the initial tc hcl concentration i e 20 8 31 6 total 16s rrna gene t tests with unequal variance at a one tailed two sample p 0 05 for all the following tests fig 1a there was a difference in the magnitude of the teta abundance for tc hcl treatment i e 31 63 5 65 total 16s rrna gene for 5 0 mg l 20 85 1 96 total 16s rrna gene for 3 0 mg l and 23 01 5 47 total 16s rrna gene for 1 0 mg l followed by the abundance of tetm i e 0 11 2 24 total 16s rrna gene and tetq i e 0 10 0 4 total 16s rrna gene p 0 05 this was consistent with the fact that the abundance of the efflux pump teta gene was generally highest among all tet genes in the biological system 39 the abundance of the sul gene increased from 55 3 2 0 total 16s rrna gene to 78 1 3 0 total 16s rrna gene with the initial sdz concentration increased from 0 5 mg l to 5 0 mg l p 0 05 fig 1b sul3 was the most prevalent gene for sdz treatments i e 56 0 6 8 total 16s rrna gene for 5 0 mg l 16 0 1 1 total 16s rrna gene for 1 0 mg l and 29 0 4 2 total 16s rrna gene for 0 5 mg l followed by sul1 i e 8 0 0 33 total 16s rrna gene 5 0 mg l 42 0 0 3 total 16s rrna gene for 1 0 mg l and 15 8 0 4 total 16s rrna gene for 0 5 mg l and sul2 i e 13 9 1 9 total 16s rrna gene for 5 0 mg l 9 5 0 1 total 16s rrna gene for 1 0 mg l and 10 2 1 3 total 16s rrna gene for 0 5 mg l p 0 05 fig 1b this was different from previously published reports showing that the sul3 gene was more prevalent 40 likely due to the difference in the number of dimer formation sites 41 additionally this difference could also be explained by the different dissemination abilities and microbial communities 42 in general args have different performances for two antibiotic treatments when increasing the concentration antibiotic concentration in the effluent was tested to investigate the relationship between antibiotic removal and arg distribution fig 2 as illustrated in fig 2a the concentration of tc hcl progressively decreased during the 6 h operation and stayed persistent during the respecting 6 h operation for the initial tc hcl i e 5 0 mg l concentration as an instance the tc hcl concentration reduced from 5 2 0 2 mg l to 0 9 0 0 mg l after a 6 h operation and stayed consistent at 0 9 0 0 mg l with an additional 12 h expansion of the operation after 12 h operation the tc hcl concentration in the effluent was affected by the initial tc hcl concentration and the final concentration i e 0 9 0 0 mg l for the initial tc hcl concentration of 5 0 mg l was slightly higher than the other two i e 0 6 0 0 mg l in contrast to tc hcl the initial sdz concentration did not reduce during the 12 h operation as shown in fig 2b after 12 h of operation the sdz concentration in the effluent was also affected by the initial sdz concentration and the final concentration for the initial sdz i e 5 0 mg l concentration had the highest value of 6 7 0 2 mg l followed by 3 0 0 7 mg l for the initial sdz i e 3 0 mg l concentration and 0 2 0 0 mg l for the initial sdz i e 0 5 mg l concentration as sdz is an aggressive inhibitor of the bacterial enzyme dihydropteroate synthetase higher concentration of sdz had significantly stronger toxicity effects on microbial activities and thus few microbes executed self defense instead of adsorption and biodegradation 43 44 however tc hcl might not be as toxic as sdz thus myriad of microbes was insignificantly inhibited and had capability to protect themselves and played eminent role for removal via adsorption and biodegradation furthermore the results of arg distribution and antibiotic removal have two implications first the abundance of args was less related with the initial antibiotic concentration second the abundance of args may be affected by the final antibiotic concentration after 12 h of operation for both tc hcl and sdz and a higher final antibiotic concentration would have a higher arg abundance 3 2 diversity of microbial community 3 2 1 diversity metrics of bacterial community the diversity of bacterial community has considerable stimulus on the abundance of args in sewage sludge 45 thus diversity metrics similarity and differences among bacterial communities were investigated under different antibiotic conditions i e concentration and category table 1 shows diversity metrics within sample α diversity chao1 shannon and simpson based on the illumina miseq platform illumina san diego usa the good s estimator of coverage values for all samples 0 996 signifying comprehensive coverage of the microbial community the seed sludge had the highest diversity metrics compared to two typical antibiotics and control treatments while diversity metrics drastically changed at different concentrations of antibiotics and at control stages among tc hcl treatments the initial concentration i e 5 0 mg l had the lowest shannon and simpson indexes on the other hand among sdz treatments the initial concentration i e 5 0 mg l had the highest shannon and simpson indexes however the significant decrease in diversity metrics observed with increasing tc hcl concentration in the bioreactors indicating microbial diversity decreased under tc hcl selective pressure and superior degradation may make the sensitive bacteria survive 46 additionally sdz diversity metrics exhibited dissimilar trends which might be caused by different classes of antibiotics those findings were consistent with previous findings which revealed that ciprofloxacin treated microcosms had higher levels of phospholipid fatty acids 47 a pearson s correlation showed that tc hcl concentration and its args in the effluent had a significantly negative correlation with diversity metrics table s1 suggesting that a higher tc hcl concentration can reduce bacterial diversity metrics and bacteria having antibiotic resistance can survive in the system on the other hand bacterial diversity metrics were less affected by sdz concentration thus bacterial community diversity had a strong influence on arg fate and decreased diversity matrixes may reduce the likelihood of args dispersing into the environment via hgt 48 3 2 2 similarity analysis and bacterial β diversity the similarity and differences in the bacterial communities of all treatments were analyzed based on operational taxonomic units otus through the venn diagram fig 3a the number of shared otus was 378 accounting for 34 of the total observed otus i e 1113 the shared otus indicated that microorganisms existed in all treatments in addition unique otus numbers from seed sludge tc hcl sdz and control treatments were 115 49 42 and 59 respectively the seed sludge had an even more unique microorganism than others which could explain the mixed wastewater type whereas the antibiotic treatments had fewer distinct microorganisms most likely due to antibiotic toxicity the dissimilarity of microbial communities among seed sludge tc hcl sdz and control treatments was revealed by non metric multidimensional scaling nmds based on the bray curtis distance as shown in fig 3b the results showed that seed sludge control treatments and low antibiotic concentrations i e tc hcl concentration of 1 0 mg l and sdz concentration of 0 5 mg l respectively had similar microbial structures however antibiotic treatments were separated according to their concentration level results demonstrated that the samples with a high concentration i e tc hcl or sdz concentration i e 5 0 mg l were separated from those with a lower concentration indicating that microbial communities and structural succession were different between low and high concentrations 3 3 composition of bacterial community 3 3 1 bacterial community responding to antibiotic removal the above results have proven that the diversity of the microbial community was strongly influenced by antibiotic conditions i e concentration and category subsequently affecting the abundance of args however aerobic bacteria had two way effects on the abundance of args including resistome and hgt thus compositions of microbial communities at the phylum level and a heatmap of compositions of the top 50 microbial communities at the family level under two antibiotics with different concentrations were shown in fig 4 it s worth noting that this section focused on the compositions related to antibiotic removal and the potential host bacteria were discussed in the following section a total of twenty eight bacterial phyla were found in all the samples the twelve with a relative abundance 1 0 shown in fig 4a proteobacteria with an average relative abundance of 44 6 were the most abundant phylum in all the treatments followed by bacteroidota i e relative abundance of 15 8 planctomycetota i e relative abundance of 15 1 chloroflexi i e relative abundance of 9 1 and actinobacteriota i e relative abundance of 3 4 both lab scale wastewater treatment bioreactors and full scale wwtps showed that proteobacteria was the dominant phylum microorganisms were influenced up to some extent by the addition of antibiotics the relative abundance of bacteroidota and planctomycetota for tc hcl treatment increased with increasing antibiotic concentration indicating strong tolerance for tc hcl at a relatively high concentration whereas proteobacteria decreased indicating that they are probably tolerant at low concentration in contrast the relative abundance of proteobacteria for sdz treatment increased as antibiotic exposure increased i e the initial concentration of 5 0 1 0 and 0 5 mg l suggesting that proteobacteria had sdz resistance a previously published article 49 stated that a total of 48 species of bacteria with sdz degrading ability had been isolated of which 81 0 belong to proteobacteria which proved that proteobacteria played a vital role in antibiotic removal bacteroidota increased substantially at high concentrations of sdz and tc hcl suggesting that bacteroidota encodes resistance to both antibiotics bacteroides fragilis group bfg bacteria and bfg specific genes belong to the bacterial group encoding resistance to antibiotics 50 many microbial communities might not be able to grow under sdz selective pressure 51 further analysis at the family level reveals that the microbial community altered with exposure to different concentrations of tc hcl i e 5 0 3 0 and 1 0 mg l sdz i e 5 0 1 0 and 0 5 mg l and control treatments as shown in fig 4b the microbial community abundance decreased significantly as the tc hcl concentration increased remarkably at higher concentrations i e 5 0 mg l for instance as the tc hcl concentration increased the relative abundance of rhodocyclaceae from 28 9 to 6 6 fimbriimonadaceae from 15 5 to 8 5 and microscillaceae from 13 0 to 1 3 decreased in contrast the abundance of these microbial communities increased with control treatments rhodocyclaceae produced an excessive amount of extracellular polymeric substances 52 while fimbriimonadaceae and microscillaceae were potential denitrifiers 53 these bacteria were strongly affected by antibiotic concentration however a relative abundance of saprospiraceae increased i e from 1 1 to 30 3 as the tc hcl concentration increased from 1 0 mg l to 5 0 mg l and became the predominant family at the initial tc hcl i e 5 0 mg l concentration similarly the microbial community abundance decreased significantly as the initial sdz concentration increased from 0 5 to 5 0 mg l such as the decreased trend for pirellulaceae i e relative abundance decreased from 29 1 to 7 6 rhodocyclaceae i e relative abundance decreased from 21 2 to 6 0 and hyphomicrobiaceae i e relative abundance decreased from 2 7 to 1 0 however as the initial sdz concentration increased from 0 5 to 5 0 mg l the relative abundance of saprospiraceae from 0 7 to 16 6 diplorickettsiaceae from 0 2 to 9 4 and paracaedibacteraceae from 0 0 to 9 2 increased these bacteria survive in wastewater treatment systems when exposed to high concentrations of antibiotics which suggests that these may cause antibiotic resistance these results had two implications first the two antibiotics had totally different microbial communities for antibiotic biodegradation and second a higher initial antibiotic concentration would decrease the abundance but improve the diversity of the microbial community leading to the different biodegradation abilities of the corresponding antibiotic and subsequently affect the relative abundance of args 3 3 2 potential host bacteria a previous study revealed that the shifting diversity and abundance of args carrying bacterial genes probably impacted the fate of args into the wwtps 54 thus network analysis between args relative abundance and their potential host bacteria at the family level with two antibiotics i e tc hcl and sdz at the same initial concentration i e 5 0 mg l was shown in fig 5 each node represented args and the potential host bacteria an args potential host bacteria correlation illustrated the positive correlation in green and the negative correlation in red the presence of 50 bacterial taxa at the family level were affected by the detected args under two antibiotic i e tc hcl and sdz conditions p 0 05 the positive correlation was identified amid tetracycline args i e teta tetm and tetq and bacteroidaceae caulobacteraceae and comamonadaceae the tetm and tetq had a positive correlation with competibacteraceae fimbriimonadaceae chitinophagaceae bryobacteraceae and defluviicoccaceae in addition rhodobacteraceae caldilineaceae ns9 marine group jg30 kf cm45 spirosomaceae and microtrichaceae negatively correlated with tetracycline args i e teta tetm and tetq a positive correlation was detected between sulfanilamide args i e sul2 and sul3 and saprospiraceae diplorickettsiaceae paracaedibacteraceae rhodobacteraceae comamonadaceae and nitrospiraceae however these families were negatively correlated with sul1 in addition sul1 also had a positive correlation with schlesneriaceae gemmataceae rhizobiaceae and hyphomicrobiaceae and these families negatively correlated with sul2 and sul3 thus the correlation between sulfanilamide args and bacterial existed positively and negatively on the one hand high concentration of antibiotics positively contributed to enhancement of some specific dominant bacteria 56 the args propagation could be an associated with hgt by the potentials host bacteria on the other hand deactivation of specific potential host bacteria reduced the args propagation into the environment 57 however these results indicated that microorganism proliferation played a dominant role in the propagation of args in the activated sludge and that different antibiotics had different potential host bacteria for args based on the network analysis and compositions of microbial communities a higher final antibiotic concentration had a higher abundance of host bacteria resulting in a higher abundance of resistance genes figs 4 and 5 as an example for the resistance gene tet the total abundance of the host bacteria e g rhodobacteraceae ns9 marine group and rhodanobacteraceae with the initial tc hcl concentration of 1 0 mg l i e 27 1 was higher than that of 3 0 mg l i e 3 1 thus the abundance of the resistance gene tet at a higher final tc hcl antibiotic concentration was higher than that at a lower concentration 4 conclusion the addition of two common antibiotics revealed that the abundance of args only depended on the final antibiotic concentration the resistome of the microbial community was applied to explain the mechanism that the abundance of args was not initial concentration dependent due to the different biodegradation abilities of two antibiotics under different initial concentrations resulting in altering the abundance of args on the other hand the abundance of potential host bacteria was investigated to reveal the mechanism on which the abundance of args depended on final concentration in further study a model for predicting the abundance of args under different antibiotic conditions should be established to assess the effects of antibiotics these results have substantial significance for the mechanism of the varying abundance of args in the selection pressures of antibiotic concentration in aerobic activated sludge reactors uncited reference 55 declaration

microbial community under different antibiotic conditions 3 reveal the response of the microbial community to antibiotic biodegradation under different initial and final antibiotic concentrations and

named i e tc hcl sdz and control with an adequate volume of 2 l for aerobic bioreactors were operated at 25 c the 1 l of aerobic sludge collected from jiangning wwtp nanjing china had 55 of sv30 and 3549 mg l of mixed liquor suspended solids the pump bt1002j long precision pump company limited china was used to pump synthetic wastewater into the bioreactors after inoculation the ingredients for 1 l of synthetic wastewater were sodium acetate 500 mg ammonium chloride 150 mg magnesium sulfate 15 mg calcium chloride 20 mg sodium bicarbonate 100 mg potassium dihydrogen phosphate 2 66 mg dipotassium hydrogen phosphate 5 35 mg and 1 0 ml l of trace element solution 31 when bioreactors stabilized i e removal efficacy of carbon oxygen demand and ammonia stayed consistent at 82 two typical antibiotics i e tc hcl and sdz at different concentrations were added and one bioreactor operated as a control the sludge retention time srt of bioreactors was 12 h three bioreactors were operated for 120 days the antibiotic concentration for tc hcl i e 5 0 3 0 and 1 0 mg l and sdz i e 5 0 1 0 and 0 5 mg l was different in two bioreactors a diffuse aerator was used to aerate at a rate of 51 ml min and the dissolved oxygen concentration in the bioreactor was 5 5 1 5 mg l during batch operation 2 2 physiochemical analysis the effluent samples were collected every 6 h from the bioreactors i e tc hcl and sdz to determine the antibiotic concentration the high performance liquid chromatography hplc system agilent 1269 technologies usa was used to determine the concentrations of antibiotics in the supernatant and the protocol is given in text s1 2 3 extraction of dna 16s rrna genes sequencing and bioinformatics assay the samples from these bioreactors i e tc hcl sdz and control were collected at the end of each antibiotic concentration including seed sludge based on manufacturers protocols using the ezna soil dna kit omega bio tek norcros ga usa the polymerase chain reaction pcr products were extracted using a 2 0 agarose gel which were then purified with the axyprep dna gel extraction kit axygen biosciences california usa and quantified with quantifluor st promega corporation usa according to the manufacturer s protocol text s2 initially bacterial 16s rrna gene fragments were amplified using adapter tagged primer pairs designed to amplify v4 v5 regions by the thermocycler pcr system and forward and reverse primers shown in table s2 the pcr protocol is shown in text s2 refined amplicons were constructed at equimolar levels using standard methods from majorbio bio pharm technology corporation limited shanghai china and paired end sequences 2 300 were performed using an illumina miseq platform illumina san diego usa according to the manufacturer s specifications the fastq formatted sequences were processed and analyzed using qiime2 ver 2021 11 32 during the filtering process low quality and low abundant reads mismatched reads ambiguous lengths and bases beyond the prescribed range and chimeras were removed in a nutshell fastq formatted sequences with primers below quality scores of 25 and read lengths of 300 bp were eliminated representative sequence files and feature tables were merged and taxonomic classification with 97 sequence similarity was performed using the greengenes 13 8 reference database to minimize the effects of sequencing depth each sample was resampled to yield 9932 sequences the diversity metrics within sample α diversity chao1 shannon s index and simpson and between samples β diversity bray curtis matrix were calculated using the vegan package correlation coefficients with a statistical significance of p value 0 05 were calculated using the stats package in the r programming language version 4 1 0 a statistically significant correlation between args and the bacterial community was calculated at a 95 confidence interval p value 0 05 finally obtained results were uploaded in gephi software version 0 9 5 to do networking among args and the bacterial community 2 4 arg quantification the effluent samples were collected at the completion of each concentration of tc hcl i e 5 0 3 0 and 1 0 mg l and sdz i e 5 0 1 0 and 0 5 mg l and the corresponding effluent samples were purified with sterile a 0 22 μm filter ncm whatman uk and reduced into parts for dna extractions the dna isolation kit used for extracting genomic dna followed by manufacturer protocol mo bio carlsbad california usa sulfonamides and tetracyclines were commonly identified in wwtps effluents correspondingly args such as sulfonamide resistance i e sul1 sul2 sul3 genes and tetracycline resistance i e teta tetm tetq genes were frequently spotted into wwtp effluents 33 therefore quantitative polymerase chain reaction q pcr biorad hercules california usa was exploited to measure the 16s rrna gene sdz resistance sul1 sul2 and sul3 genes and tc hcl resistance genes teta tetm and tetq genes to assess the quantity of these resistance genes q pcr was done in triplicate wcgene biotechnology corporation shanghai china designed all the forward and reverse primers used for amplification shown in table s2 the copy numbers for target args wcgene biotechnology shanghai china were derived from standard curves r2 0 990 and then integrated with the plasmid 3 results and discussion 3 1 the relationship between antibiotic removal and arg distribution broad spectrum antibiotics such as tetracycline and sulfonamides are extensively used in humans and aquaculture species to treat bacterial infections 34 bacteria may acquire resistance to antibiotics primarily via efflux pump mechanisms or ribosome protection proteins 35 therefore efflux pump genes teta ribosomal protection protein genes tetq and tetm class 1 integrons sul1 36 a broad host range of plasmid sul2 37 and conjugative plasmid sul3 38 were determined to investigate whether exposure to tc hcl and sdz at mg l levels can enhance the development of genes thus the occurrence of args targeted for tc hcl i e teta tetm and tetq and sdz i e sul1 sul2 and sul3 treatments were shown in fig 1 the abundance of tet gene was less affected by the initial tc hcl concentration i e 20 8 31 6 total 16s rrna gene t tests with unequal variance at a one tailed two sample p 0 05 for all the following tests fig 1a there was a difference in the magnitude of the teta abundance for tc hcl treatment i e 31 63 5 65 total 16s rrna gene for 5 0 mg l 20 85 1 96 total 16s rrna gene for 3 0 mg l and 23 01 5 47 total 16s rrna gene for 1 0 mg l followed by the abundance of tetm i e 0 11 2 24 total 16s rrna gene and tetq i e 0 10 0 4 total 16s rrna gene p 0 05 this was consistent with the fact that the abundance of the efflux pump teta gene was generally highest among all tet genes in the biological system 39 the abundance of the sul gene increased from 55 3 2 0 total 16s rrna gene to 78 1 3 0 total 16s rrna gene with the initial sdz concentration increased from 0 5 mg l to 5 0 mg l p 0 05 fig 1b sul3 was the most prevalent gene for sdz treatments i e 56 0 6 8 total 16s rrna gene for 5 0 mg l 16 0 1 1 total 16s rrna gene for 1 0 mg l and 29 0 4 2 total 16s rrna gene for 0 5 mg l followed by sul1 i e 8 0 0 33 total 16s rrna gene 5 0 mg l 42 0 0 3 total 16s rrna gene for 1 0 mg l and 15 8 0 4 total 16s rrna gene for 0 5 mg l and sul2 i e 13 9 1 9 total 16s rrna gene for 5 0 mg l 9 5 0 1 total 16s rrna gene for 1 0 mg l and 10 2 1 3 total 16s rrna gene for 0 5 mg l p 0 05 fig 1b this was different from previously published reports showing that the sul3 gene was more prevalent 40 likely due to the difference in the number of dimer formation sites 41 additionally this difference could also be explained by the different dissemination abilities and microbial communities 42 in general args have different performances for two antibiotic treatments when increasing the concentration antibiotic concentration in the effluent was tested to investigate the relationship between antibiotic removal and arg distribution fig 2 as illustrated in fig 2a the concentration of tc hcl progressively decreased during the 6 h operation and stayed persistent during the respecting 6 h operation for the initial tc hcl i e 5 0 mg l concentration as an instance the tc hcl concentration reduced from 5 2 0 2 mg l to 0 9 0 0 mg l after a 6 h operation and stayed consistent at 0 9 0 0 mg l with an additional 12 h expansion of the operation after 12 h operation the tc hcl concentration in the effluent was affected by the initial tc hcl concentration and the final concentration i e 0 9 0 0 mg l for the initial tc hcl concentration of 5 0 mg l was slightly higher than the other two i e 0 6 0 0 mg l in contrast to tc hcl the initial sdz concentration did not reduce during the 12 h operation as shown in fig 2b after 12 h of operation the sdz concentration in the effluent was also affected by the initial sdz concentration and the final concentration for the initial sdz i e 5 0 mg l concentration had the highest value of 6 7 0 2 mg l followed by 3 0 0 7 mg l for the initial sdz i e 3 0 mg l concentration and 0 2 0 0 mg l for the initial sdz i e 0 5 mg l concentration as sdz is an aggressive inhibitor of the bacterial enzyme dihydropteroate synthetase higher concentration of sdz had significantly stronger toxicity effects on microbial activities and thus few microbes executed self defense instead of adsorption and biodegradation 43 44 however tc hcl might not be as toxic as sdz thus myriad of microbes was insignificantly inhibited and had capability to protect themselves and played eminent role for removal via adsorption and biodegradation furthermore the results of arg distribution and antibiotic removal have two implications first the abundance of args was less related with the initial antibiotic concentration second the abundance of args may be affected by the final antibiotic concentration after 12 h of operation for both tc hcl and sdz and a higher final antibiotic concentration would have a higher arg abundance 3 2 diversity of microbial community 3 2 1 diversity metrics of bacterial community the diversity of bacterial community has considerable stimulus on the abundance of args in sewage sludge 45 thus diversity metrics similarity and differences among bacterial communities were investigated under different antibiotic conditions i e concentration and category table 1 shows diversity metrics within sample α diversity chao1 shannon and simpson based on the illumina miseq platform illumina san diego usa the good s estimator of coverage values for all samples 0 996 signifying comprehensive coverage of the microbial community the seed sludge had the highest diversity metrics compared to two typical antibiotics and control treatments while diversity metrics drastically changed at different concentrations of antibiotics and at control stages among tc hcl treatments the initial concentration i e 5 0 mg l had the lowest shannon and simpson indexes on the other hand among sdz treatments the initial concentration i e 5 0 mg l had the highest shannon and simpson indexes however the significant decrease in diversity metrics observed with increasing tc hcl concentration in the bioreactors indicating microbial diversity decreased under tc hcl selective pressure and superior degradation may make the sensitive bacteria survive 46 additionally sdz diversity metrics exhibited dissimilar trends which might be caused by different classes of antibiotics those findings were consistent with previous findings which revealed that ciprofloxacin treated microcosms had higher levels of phospholipid fatty acids 47 a pearson s correlation showed that tc hcl concentration and its args in the effluent had a significantly negative correlation with diversity metrics table s1 suggesting that a higher tc hcl concentration can reduce bacterial diversity metrics and bacteria having antibiotic resistance can survive in the system on the other hand bacterial diversity metrics were less affected by sdz concentration thus bacterial community diversity had a strong influence on arg fate and decreased diversity matrixes may reduce the likelihood of args dispersing into the environment via hgt 48 3 2 2 similarity analysis and bacterial β diversity the similarity and differences in the bacterial communities of all treatments were analyzed based on operational taxonomic units otus through the venn diagram fig 3a the number of shared otus was 378 accounting for 34 of the total observed otus i e 1113 the shared otus indicated that microorganisms existed in all treatments in addition unique otus numbers from seed sludge tc hcl sdz and control treatments were 115 49 42 and 59 respectively the seed sludge had an even more unique microorganism than others which could explain the mixed wastewater type whereas the antibiotic treatments had fewer distinct microorganisms most likely due to antibiotic toxicity the dissimilarity of microbial communities among seed sludge tc hcl sdz and control treatments was revealed by non metric multidimensional scaling nmds based on the bray curtis distance as shown in fig 3b the results showed that seed sludge control treatments and low antibiotic concentrations i e tc hcl concentration of 1 0 mg l and sdz concentration of 0 5 mg l respectively had similar microbial structures however antibiotic treatments were separated according to their concentration level results demonstrated that the samples with a high concentration i e tc hcl or sdz concentration i e 5 0 mg l were separated from those with a lower concentration indicating that microbial communities and structural succession were different between low and high concentrations 3 3 composition of bacterial community 3 3 1 bacterial community responding to antibiotic removal the above results have proven that the diversity of the microbial community was strongly influenced by antibiotic conditions i e concentration and category subsequently affecting the abundance of args however aerobic bacteria had two way effects on the abundance of args including resistome and hgt thus compositions of microbial communities at the phylum level and a heatmap of compositions of the top 50 microbial communities at the family level under two antibiotics with different concentrations were shown in fig 4 it s worth noting that this section focused on the compositions related to antibiotic removal and the potential host bacteria were discussed in the following section a total of twenty eight bacterial phyla were found in all the samples the twelve with a relative abundance 1 0 shown in fig 4a proteobacteria with an average relative abundance of 44 6 were the most abundant phylum in all the treatments followed by bacteroidota i e relative abundance of 15 8 planctomycetota i e relative abundance of 15 1 chloroflexi i e relative abundance of 9 1 and actinobacteriota i e relative abundance of 3 4 both lab scale wastewater treatment bioreactors and full scale wwtps showed that proteobacteria was the dominant phylum microorganisms were influenced up to some extent by the addition of antibiotics the relative abundance of bacteroidota and planctomycetota for tc hcl treatment increased with increasing antibiotic concentration indicating strong tolerance for tc hcl at a relatively high concentration whereas proteobacteria decreased indicating that they are probably tolerant at low concentration in contrast the relative abundance of proteobacteria for sdz treatment increased as antibiotic exposure increased i e the initial concentration of 5 0 1 0 and 0 5 mg l suggesting that proteobacteria had sdz resistance a previously published article 49 stated that a total of 48 species of bacteria with sdz degrading ability had been isolated of which 81 0 belong to proteobacteria which proved that proteobacteria played a vital role in antibiotic removal bacteroidota increased substantially at high concentrations of sdz and tc hcl suggesting that bacteroidota encodes resistance to both antibiotics bacteroides fragilis group bfg bacteria and bfg specific genes belong to the bacterial group encoding resistance to antibiotics 50 many microbial communities might not be able to grow under sdz selective pressure 51 further analysis at the family level reveals that the microbial community altered with exposure to different concentrations of tc hcl i e 5 0 3 0 and 1 0 mg l sdz i e 5 0 1 0 and 0 5 mg l and control treatments as shown in fig 4b the microbial community abundance decreased significantly as the tc hcl concentration increased remarkably at higher concentrations i e 5 0 mg l for instance as the tc hcl concentration increased the relative abundance of rhodocyclaceae from 28 9 to 6 6 fimbriimonadaceae from 15 5 to 8 5 and microscillaceae from 13 0 to 1 3 decreased in contrast the abundance of these microbial communities increased with control treatments rhodocyclaceae produced an excessive amount of extracellular polymeric substances 52 while fimbriimonadaceae and microscillaceae were potential denitrifiers 53 these bacteria were strongly affected by antibiotic concentration however a relative abundance of saprospiraceae increased i e from 1 1 to 30 3 as the tc hcl concentration increased from 1 0 mg l to 5 0 mg l and became the predominant family at the initial tc hcl i e 5 0 mg l concentration similarly the microbial community abundance decreased significantly as the initial sdz concentration increased from 0 5 to 5 0 mg l such as the decreased trend for pirellulaceae i e relative abundance decreased from 29 1 to 7 6 rhodocyclaceae i e relative abundance decreased from 21 2 to 6 0 and hyphomicrobiaceae i e relative abundance decreased from 2 7 to 1 0 however as the initial sdz concentration increased from 0 5 to 5 0 mg l the relative abundance of saprospiraceae from 0 7 to 16 6 diplorickettsiaceae from 0 2 to 9 4 and paracaedibacteraceae from 0 0 to 9 2 increased these bacteria survive in wastewater treatment systems when exposed to high concentrations of antibiotics which suggests that these may cause antibiotic resistance these results had two implications first the two antibiotics had totally different microbial communities for antibiotic biodegradation and second a higher initial antibiotic concentration would decrease the abundance but improve the diversity of the microbial community leading to the different biodegradation abilities of the corresponding antibiotic and subsequently affect the relative abundance of args 3 3 2 potential host bacteria a previous study revealed that the shifting diversity and abundance of args carrying bacterial genes probably impacted the fate of args into the wwtps 54 thus network analysis between args relative abundance and their potential host bacteria at the family level with two antibiotics i e tc hcl and sdz at the same initial concentration i e 5 0 mg l was shown in fig 5 each node represented args and the potential host bacteria an args potential host bacteria correlation illustrated the positive correlation in green and the negative correlation in red the presence of 50 bacterial taxa at the family level were affected by the detected args under two antibiotic i e tc hcl and sdz conditions p 0 05 the positive correlation was identified amid tetracycline args i e teta tetm and tetq and bacteroidaceae caulobacteraceae and comamonadaceae the tetm and tetq had a positive correlation with competibacteraceae fimbriimonadaceae chitinophagaceae bryobacteraceae and defluviicoccaceae in addition rhodobacteraceae caldilineaceae ns9 marine group jg30 kf cm45 spirosomaceae and microtrichaceae negatively correlated with tetracycline args i e teta tetm and tetq a positive correlation was detected between sulfanilamide args i e sul2 and sul3 and saprospiraceae diplorickettsiaceae paracaedibacteraceae rhodobacteraceae comamonadaceae and nitrospiraceae however these families were negatively correlated with sul1 in addition sul1 also had a positive correlation with schlesneriaceae gemmataceae rhizobiaceae and hyphomicrobiaceae and these families negatively correlated with sul2 and sul3 thus the correlation between sulfanilamide args and bacterial existed positively and negatively on the one hand high concentration of antibiotics positively contributed to enhancement of some specific dominant bacteria 56 the args propagation could be an associated with hgt by the potentials host bacteria on the other hand deactivation of specific potential host bacteria reduced the args propagation into the environment 57 however these results indicated that microorganism proliferation played a dominant role in the propagation of args in the activated sludge and that different antibiotics had different potential host bacteria for args based on the network analysis and compositions of microbial communities a higher final antibiotic concentration had a higher abundance of host bacteria resulting in a higher abundance of resistance genes figs 4 and 5 as an example for the resistance gene tet the total abundance of the host bacteria e g rhodobacteraceae ns9 marine group and rhodanobacteraceae with the initial tc hcl concentration of 1 0 mg l i e 27 1 was higher than that of 3 0 mg l i e 3 1 thus the abundance of the resistance gene tet at a higher final tc hcl antibiotic concentration was higher than that at a lower concentration 4 conclusion the addition of two common antibiotics revealed that the abundance of args only depended on the final antibiotic concentration the resistome of the microbial community was applied to explain the mechanism that the abundance of args was not initial concentration dependent due to the different biodegradation abilities of two antibiotics under different initial concentrations resulting in altering the abundance of args on the other hand the abundance of potential host bacteria was investigated to reveal the mechanism on which the abundance of args depended on final concentration in further study a model for predicting the abundance of args under different antibiotic conditions should be established to assess the effects of antibiotics these results have substantial significance for the mechanism of the varying abundance of args in the selection pressures of antibiotic concentration in aerobic activated sludge reactors uncited reference 55 declaration

12537,most polymeric membranes including polyethersulfone pes are limited in their application due to their low water flux and high fouling characteristic in this study carboxylated nanocrystalline cellulose c ncc embedded pes membrane was fabricated using the non solvent induced phase inversion nips method to enhance the water permeability and anti fouling properties of the pes membrane herein we synthesized our c ncc from oil palm fronds opfs using a simple and time efficient one pot mixed acid hydrolysis method the as prepared c nccopf exhibited a rod like structure with dimensions of 121 03 65 30 nm and 15 64 5 42 nm in length and width respectively the degree of oxidation value of 0 21 was obtained comparable to those c ncc synthesized using the classical tempo or aps oxidation procedures by incorporating c nccopf nanorods into the pes matrix the hydrophilicity pore structure mean pore size porosity and pure water flux of the modified membrane were significantly enhanced the hermia model and bolton s combined fouling model were applied to investigate the anti fouling properties of the fabricated membrane during the ha filtration at 1 bar operating pressure the results demonstrated that the pristine pes membrane was susceptible to fouling which is likely related to the hydrophobic nature of the pes polymer in contrast it was discovered that incorporating the c nccopf into the pes membrane could significantly reduce fouling and enhance membrane performance graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords green additives carboxylated nanocrystalline cellulose

the data used in the study are shown and described in the article 1 introduction polymeric membranes are widely used for treatment of water because of their high flexibility simple pore forming mechanism smaller installation footprints and lower costs relative to their inorganic counterparts 1 polyethersulfone pes is an excellent candidate among other polymers for preparing inexpensive chemically resistant and thermally stable membranes 2 however its widespread use is hindered by the membrane s low water flux and high fouling tendency leading to increased hydraulic resistance high operating and maintenance costs a decline in productivity and frequent membrane regeneration issues 3 in ultrafiltration processes organic fouling is caused by natural organic matter nom that is typically contained in wastewater one of the main fouling causing nom compounds is humic acid ha ha are polymeric based and can form chelates with metal ions in the water creating a gel like chelate layer on the membrane surface 4 it is commonly accepted that hydrophilic membranes have a lower potential for ha fouling than hydrophobic membranes 5 therefore modification of pes membrane properties towards hydrophilicity was viewed as a crucial strategy for enhancing water permeation and anti fouling capability multiple methods such as plasma treatment 6 blending 5 7 dip coating 8 and ozone treatment 9 have been developed to increase the hydrophilic properties of membranes however incorporating hydrophilic nano fillers into the polymer matrix such as metal oxides 10 11 sio2 12 and nanodiamonds 13 is an efficient way to enhance the membrane s anti fouling properties among nanoparticles nanocrystalline celluloses nccs have gotten much attention in the field of membrane technology due to their inherent hydrophilicity excellent mechanical properties e g 110 220 gpa of elastic modulus of axial direction and 7500 7700 mpa of tensile strength large specific area low density e g 1 6 g cm 3 renewable nature biocompatibility low cost adaptable surface chemistry and intriguing optical properties 14 16 the incorporation of nanoparticles such as nccs into polymeric membranes has been the subject of investigation in a number of studies bai et al reported enhanced anti fouling properties of pes membrane towards humic acid and bovine serum albumin when coating with nccs 8 xu et al fabricated polylactic acid composite films using an acetylated nccs to improve their mechanical and thermal properties 17 nccs are typically extracted from cellulose based substances like cotton pulp 18 acacia mangium 19 cassava bagasse 20 ramie fibers 14 and sugar palm fibers 21 in malaysia the growth of the oil palm industry has led to a dramatic increase in oil palm plantations consequently the proliferation of oil palm waste has become a severe problem without proper utilization in the field this waste has a detrimental effect towards the environment as a part of the biomass oil palm fronds opfs account for a large proportion of oil palm biomass waste approximately 2 3 million tonnes or roughly 70 w w of all oil palm biomass waste 22 23 since lignocellulosic biomass has many positive qualities including low cost low environmental impact and ready availability researchers are devoting more time and energy to finding ways to put it to use opfs are a promising source for obtaining a highly crystalline ncc as discovered by nordin et al 24 moreover it could be utilized as a reinforcing agent of the bio based nanocomposite where it shows great promise 23 isolation of nccs from cellulose based materials generally includes acid hydrolysis 25 28 mechanical treatment 29 30 or enzymatic hydrolysis 18 31 throughout these procedures the amorphous part of the cellulose is disintegrated while the crystalline part is retained it is widely acknowledged that acid hydrolysis particularly with sulfuric acid h2so4 is the most common method to isolate nccs from different types of raw cellulose 26 28 throughout the process a trace amount of negatively charged sulfate ester groups so4 2 are added to the surface of nccs improving their dispersibility due to electrostatic repulsion 32 however at high temperatures the so4 2 groups could stimulate the decomposition of the cellulose chains thereby limiting the stability and performance of the composite materials at a high operating temperature 33 extraction of nccs without introducing so4 2 has also been extensively studied using other mild acids including hydrochloric acid hcl 34 however these non modified nccs are easily accumulated in polymers or organic solvents because of the strong intermolecular and intramolecular hydrogen bonding interactions between the abundance surface hydroxyl group oh within the nccs 17 as a result the reinforcing efficiency of nccs with low dispersibility is severely hampered and their application in nanocomposites is severely limited interestingly the reactive surface of oh groups makes it possible to modify the properties of nccs by chemically modifying their surfaces surface carboxylation on the nccs has recently received much attention due to its potential to improve their compatibility and dispersion in solvents moreover the absence of the labile so4 2 groups may enhance the thermal stability of nccs for the synthesis of carboxylated nccs c nccs the oxidation procedure using a 2 2 6 6 tetramethyl 1 piperidinyloxy tempo radical received the most attention 35 37 with this method the c6 primary alcohols of nccs are selectively converted to carboxyl groups cooh unfortunately this method still has numerous drawbacks such as a complex control system and lengthy treatment times e g the ph during the oxidation process needs to be maintained at 10 for 4 h 38 on top of that the tempo reagents are toxic and may be causing environmental concerns alternatively a low cost material such as ammonium persulfate aps is extensively utilized to isolate c nccs via a one step method due to its low long term toxicity and high water solubility 39 41 however it is still hampered by the lengthy treatment procedure which has drastically reduced its production efficiency for industrial applications lately a one step procedure for preparing c nccs using mixed reaction systems has been applied 42 koshani et al utilized a hydrogen peroxide oxidation catalyzed using copper sulfate pentahydrate to synthesize c ncc from softwood pulp at 60 c for 72 h 43 zhou et al synthesized c nccs from cotton pulp using a combination of potassium permanganate oxidizing agent and oxalic acid reducing agent in an h2so4 medium at the temperature of 50 c for 8 h 44 however acquiring c nccs via any of these methods is a time consuming process recently a mixed acid system has been utilized to extract c nccs 45 48 and the synergistic effect between the different acids has improved the degradation rate of the nanocomposites xie et al isolated c nccs from the bleached eucalyptus kraft pulp using a mixed h2so4 oxalic acid within 2 to 5 h of hydrolysis 49 the resulting c nccs showed a much higher thermal stability than the nccs extracted from h2so4 hydrolysis as fewer so4 2 groups occupied the oh groups of the c nccs due to the existence of the competitive cooh groups cheng et al reported a one step h2so4 nitric acid hno3 mixed acid hydrolysis to extract c nccs from commercial microcrystalline celluloses at various hydrolysis temperatures for 0 5 h 50 at the optimal temperature of 80 c c nccs with the maximum degree of oxidation of 0 11 was produced comparable to those c ncc synthesized using the classical tempo or aps oxidation procedures to our knowledge no report has specifically addressed the extraction of c ncc from opfs via mixed acid hydrolysis followed by their incorporation into membranes for the water treatment process in this study we designed a simple and time efficient one pot technique for producing c nccs from opfs using an h2so4 hno3 mixed acid system the oh groups on cellulose molecular chains were anticipated to be changed into cooh groups when oxidizing hno3 was introduced to the h2so4 medium subsequently pristine and c nccopf embedded pes membranes were fabricated using the non solvent induced phase separation nips process a set of analyses such as sem fesem tem ftir mean pore size porosity and water contact angle wca were carried out to characterize both the synthesized c nccopf and the membranes in addition membrane performance was evaluated in term of water permeability i e pure water flux pwf and humic acid ha separation using a cross flow filtration process finally the fouling behavior of the fabricated membranes towards the ha was investigated using hermia single fouling models and bolton s combined fouling models cfms 2 experimental 2 1 materials oil palm fronds opfs were obtained from engineering campus universiti sains malaysia nibong tebal malaysia as a starting material the opfs were detached from the oil palm tree and were made to powder via the grounding process before undergoing the grounding process the opfs were cut into pieces and dried under the sun next the

purification 2 2 preparation of carboxylated nanocrystalline cellulose from oil palm fronds c nccopf 2 2 1 pulp bleaching and mercerization both pulp bleaching and mercerization were performed corresponding to the procedure proposed by azani et al 23 first the bleaching method was used to extract holocellulose from the opfs in detail a mixture was prepared by mixing 4 5 g of opfs powder and 375 ml distilled water dw in a three neck round bottom flask the mixture was left to stir and the temperature was set to 70 c using a heating mantle once the mixture temperature reached 70 c 3 g of naclo2 followed by 3 ml of ch3cooh were added to the mixture the mixture was left to stir for 2 h at the designated temperature the holocellulose was filtered out from the resulting suspension via suction filtration and the filter cake was repeatedly washed using excess dw next the holocellulose acquired from the bleaching process was dried overnight in an oven at 50 c based on the result obtained the holocellulose content in the opfs sample was calculated using eq 1 1 holocellulose holocellulose mass g initial opfs mass g 100 consequently α cellulose was extracted from the holocellulose via the mercerization process in a volumetric flask a dry 5 g holocellulose was reacted with 100 ml naoh at 10 w v concentration the mixture was stirred for 30 min at room temperature then 100 ml of distilled water was added to the mixture to reduce the naoh concentration to 5 w v and the mixture was stirred for another 30 min the α cellulose produced was isolated from the resulting suspension via vacuum filtration and the filter cake was washed using 1 v v of ch3cooh followed by excess dw the α cellulose acquired from the mercerization process was dried overnight in an oven at 50 c based on the result obtained the α cellulose and hemicellulose content in the opfs sample were calculated using eqs 2 and 3 2 α cellulose α cellulose mass g initial opfs mass g 100 3 hemicellulose holocellulose α cellulose 2 2 2 one pot mixed acid hydrolysis the extraction of green carboxylated nanocrystalline cellulose from oil palm fronds c nccopf was carried out using a simple and time efficient one pot mixed acid hydrolysis technique suggested by cheng et al 50 with a slight alteration in detail 2 g of α celluloses were hydrolyzed using 60 ml of an approximately 12 m mixed acid solution containing 10 m h2so4 34 ml from 96 wt h2so4 and 2 m hno3 10 ml from 65 wt hno3 the mixture was continuously stirred for 1 h at room temperature after 1 h 300 ml of cold deionized water was used to terminate the hydrolysis reaction the resulting suspension was repeatedly centrifuged and re diluted to remove the acids followed by a dialysis process to neutralize the ph of the suspension then the c nccopf were obtained by freeze drying the resulting suspension for 48 h 2 3 fabrication of carboxylated nanocrystalline cellulose blended polyethersulfone c nccopf pes membrane the non solvent induced phase inversion nips approach was used in the membrane fabrication the dope solution formulation is tabulated in table 1 prior to dope solution preparation pes flakes and c nccopf powders were left to dry for 24 h at 70 c using a vacuum oven c nccopf pes composite membrane was fabricated using the following procedure first the dmac was weighed and poured into a glass bottle then dried c nccopf was weighed accordingly to table 1 and added slowly into the dmac solvent the nanoparticles were properly dispersed in the dmac by sonicating the mixture for 1 h subsequently the mixture was stirred for 2 h at 60 c after that the dried pes flakes were added slowly to the mixture the mixture was then stirred vigorously at 60 c for 24 h to obtain a homogeneous dope solution prior to membrane casting the dope solution undergoes a degas process for 1 h to remove air bubbles using an ultrasonic bath on the other hand the dope solution preparation of the pristine membrane follows the same procedure without the addition of c nccopf into the dope solution subsequently both membranes were fabricated by casting the dope solution on a clean glass plate at room temperature using a film applicator the speed and the gap thickness of the casting knife were set to 2 mm s 1 and 200 μm respectively after casting the membranes the thin films were left in contact with open air for 45 s then the membranes were immersed in a dw bath for 24 h the solidified membranes were then washed with running water finally the membranes were kept in dw upon usage 2 4 ha solution preparation in order to prepare a 50 ppm ha solution 0 05 g ha powder was initially dissolved in 200 ml dw then the solution was slowly introduced with droplets of 1 m naoh while undergoing sonication for 1 h next dw was poured into the sonicated ha solution until it reached 1 l at the very least the ha solution was stirred overnight to ensure homogeneity additional naoh droplets were added if needed to keep the ph of the solution to around 7 7 for optimum ha dissolution 2 5 characterization 2 5 1 fourier transform infrared analysis ftir fourier transform infrared ftir analysis was used to analyze the surface chemistry of the synthesized c nccopf and membranes the spectra were analyzed in the wavenumber range of 650 cm 1 to 4000 cm 1 specifically for the c nccopf the intensity of the carbonyl peak which is located at about 1720 cm 1 was compared to the strongest band located at about 1060 cm 1 which belongs to the cellulose backbone the ratio of both bands was used to determine the degree of oxidation do of the synthesized c nccopf the formula employed in this case was based on literature 46 51 and is as shown by eq 4 4 do 0 01 0 7 i 1720 cm 1 i 1060 cm 1 2 5 2 c nccopf morphology the morphology and surface characteristic of c nccopf was studied using a field emission scanning electron microscope fesem and transmission electron microscopy tem analyses before fesem analysis the synthesized c nccopf powders were dispersed on a sample holder using carbon tape and coated with a thin layer of gold using a sputter coater for tem analysis 500 ppm of c nccopf solution was made by adding 5 mg c nccopf into 10 ml of cold dw then the c nccopf was dispersed in the solution by sonicating the solution for 10 min consequently a droplet from the prepared c nccopf sample was placed on the tem sample stage i e copper grid then one drop of stain specimen i e 2 uranyl acetate was placed on top of the sample the c nccopf sample was then characterized using a tem spectrometer the length and width of the synthesized c nccopf were analyzed based on the acquired tem images using imagej software version 1 43u java platform se binary 2 5 3 membrane morphology a scanning electron microscope sem was used to investigate the morphology of the fabricated membranes before the sem analysis all the samples were coated with a thin layer of gold using a sputter coater to obtain a cross sectional image of a membrane the membrane was fractured using a liquid nitrogen attached to a sample holder using carbon tape and then sputter coated with a thin layer of gold before being analyzed with sem 2 5 4 membrane porosity the gravimetric method was employed to determine the porosity of the fabricated membranes first five samples with the dimension of 1 cm 1 cm were cut from each membrane tested then all five samples were immersed in dw for 24 h at room temperature the samples were taken out from the dw and the excess dw on the surface of the samples was mopped using filter paper subsequently the mass of the samples was weighed and denoted as the wet sample mass mw the wet samples were then dried in the oven at 70 c for another 24 h later the dried samples were weighed and denoted as the dry sample mass md finally membrane porosity was calculated using eq 5 and the average porosity was measured for each membrane tested 52 5 porosity ε m w m d ρ l m w m d ρ l w d ρ p 100 where ww is the mass of the wet sample g wd is the mass of the dried sample g ρl is the density of distilled water i e 1 g cm 3 and ρp is the density of pes i e 1 37 g cm 3 2 5 5 membrane mean pore size the mean pore size of the fabricated membranes was calculated based on the filtration velocity method and the guerout elford ferry equation 52 6 mean

effective area of the membrane m2 and p is the transmembrane pressure pa 2 5 6 membrane water contact angle wca the wettability of a membrane surface was determined using a water contact angle wca approach a rame hart goniometer was used to measure the wca of the fabricated membranes using the sessile drop method a microsyringe was used to drop a 6 μl water droplet onto the membrane surface wca was measured at five distinct locations on each sample at room temperature to minimize error and the average value was reported 2 6 membrane performance studies 2 6 1 water permeability and ha separation fig 1 illustrates a cross flow filtration cell used for the water permeation and solute separation process throughout the experiment membranes with an effective area of 44 4 cm2 were used the filtrations were conducted at room temperature and a stirred solution at 500 rpm was used as feed unless otherwise specified the feed solution volumetric flow rate was kept constant throughout the experiment at 400 ml min 1 prior to any of the measurements the filtration was stabilized by compressing each membrane to 1 5 bar for 30 min then the transmembrane pressure was reduced and maintained at 1 bar and the filtration was allowed to run for 10 min to attain a stable flux after that the filtration experiment to determine the permeation of water was conducted for 1 h and the pure water flux pwf was determined using eq 7 7 j pwf q a t where jpwf q a and t denote the permeation flux of distilled water l m 2 h 1 permeation volume l effective membrane area m2 and filtration time h respectively for the solute separation experiment ha was used as a model after measuring the pwf the feedstock solution was replaced with a 50 ppm ha solution that had been previously prepared the ha separation test was carried out for 3 h at a pressure of 1 bar uv vis spectrophotometer readings at 254 nm were used to determine the ha concentration in both the permeate and the feed solution the separation capability of the membrane was computed using eq 8 8 rejection 1 c p mg l 1 c f mg l 1 100 where cp is the ha concentration in the permeate solution mg l 1 and cf is the ha concentration in the feed solution mg l 1 2 6 2 membrane anti fouling property 50 ppm of ha solution was used to test the anti fouling properties of the fabricated membranes during solute filtration after measuring the pwf of the membranes for 60 min jpwf 1 filtration flux for ha was measured at 1 bar for 3 h jha after the ha filtration the membranes were washed with distilled water at a volumetric flow rate of 600 ml min 1 for 15 min with no pressure applied using the same operating conditions as the initial pwf the pwf of the cleaned membranes jpwf 2 was measured to determine the fouling resistance of membranes the flux recovery ratio frr was calculated using the following expression 9 frr j pwf 2 j pwf 1 100 several ratios were defined to describe the anti fouling properties of the fabricated membranes in order to evaluate the fouling process in detail first the degree of total flux loss caused by total fouling rt was defined using the eq 10 10 r t 1 j ha j pwf 1 100 next rr and rir were defined as the degrees of flux loss resulting from reversible and irreversible fouling respectively rr and rir were determined using eqs 11 and 12 respectively 11 r r j pwf 2 j ha j pwf 1 100 12 r ir j pwf 1 j pwf 2 j pwf 1 100 2 6 3 fouling mechanisms analyses hermia proposed fouling models to describe the fouling mechanisms responsible for the flux decline under constant filtration pressure 53 four mechanisms including cake filtration intermediate blocking standard blocking and complete blocking are highlighted in the models the cake filtration model describes fouling due to the formation of a foulant layer on the membrane surface the intermediate blocking model describes a situation where a pore is blocked by a portion of particles approaching the membrane surface while the remaining particles settle on each other the standard blocking or pore constricting model is associated with the decrease in membrane pore radius caused by foulants adsorbing on the wall of inner pores finally the complete blocking model describes a scenario in which every particle that settles on the membrane surface blocks a pore the common mathematical form of these models is as shown in eq 13 13 d 2 t d v 2 k dt dv m where v is the cumulative volume of filtrate t is the operation time k is the resistance coefficient and m is the constant that characterizes the type of mechanism for the fouling models i e cake filtration m 0 intermediate blockage m 1 pore construction or standard blockage m 1 5 and complete blocking m 2 using the flux expression shown in eq 14 the general flux expression can be expressed by eq 15 14 j 1 a dv dt 15 dj dt kj aj 2 m where j is the filtrate flux and a is the effective area of the filtration surface the flux expression for each fouling mechanism was obtained for each m value 0 1 1 5 or 2 as shown in table 2 in order to determine the fouling mechanisms of the fabricated membranes first all four fouling models need to have their flux equations linearized then using the least square method the parameter k value for each model was determined by substituting the experimental data into those linearized flux equations the obtained k values were plugged into the hermia models to predict the most plausible fouling mechanism for the flux drop in addition to the individual fouling mechanisms some combined models have been developed to precisely investigate the fouling behavior based on darcy s law bolton et al developed combined models describing fouling mechanisms with two fitted parameters 55 as shown in table 3 the combined fouling models cfms were used to generate a graph of predicted permeate volume against time then each predicted graph was fitted against the graph obtained by the experimental data during the fitting process the sum of squared errors sse had to be minimized to obtain the best fit the difference between the predicted and experimental data points was used as the residual for calculating sse 3 results and discussion 3 1 surface functional groups the identification of the main functional groups of the c nccopf is shown in fig 2 the spectrum revealed a similarity of chemical composition between the nanocellulose samples with the pure cellulose 56 57 the absorption peak at 3322 cm 1 is resulted from the hydroxyl oh groups stretching vibration it represents the hydrophilicity of the nanocellulose as well as the hydrogen bond degradation with the cellulose chain during the hydrolysis treatment 23 the following absorption peak at 2900 cm 1 was identified as the ch symmetric vibration frequency correlated with ch2 groups a strong connection between water molecules and cellulose via hydrophilic interaction led to the adsorption of water molecules onto the cellulose surface the bending mode of the adsorbed water molecules is represented by the sharp absorption peak at 1639 cm 1 58 next the vibration of the symmetric ch2 bending corresponds to the intermolecular hydrogen in the cellulose s aromatic ring at the carbon 6 c6 position this vibration band also known as the crystallinity band describes the crystallinity degree of the cellulose and is represented by the absorption peak at 1412 cm 1 59 the peak at 1161 cm 1 represents the c o c stretching pyranose ring ether while the peak at 893 cm 1 represents the glucosidic ring vibration specific for β glucosides 60 a new peak at 1720 cm 1 was observed which corresponds to the presence of carboxyl cooh groups the result confirmed that the surface carboxylation of nccs was successfully accomplished with the introduction of hno3 the presence of this new peak is aligned with what is being reported by cheng et al 50 during the mixed acid procedure some of the oh groups were converted into cooh groups due to the presence of oxidizing hno3 in the h2so4 medium additionally the ftir spectrum was used to calculate the degree of oxidation do of the synthesized c nccopf table 4 shows the do obtained in this study and several others literature the result indicates that the c nccopf synthesized in this study shows a do of 0 21 which is aligned with other mixed acid hydrolysis procedures furthermore the do obtained is higher than that obtained by those conventional long time oxidation treatments using tempo mediated and aps as the oxidation reagent next ftir analyses were performed to identify the membrane s surface functional groups on both pristine pes and composite c nccopf pes membranes the results are depicted in fig 3 similar chemical compositions to those reported in the literature may be seen in the ftir spectrum for the unmodified pes membrane 7 first the peaks detected at the wavenumber of 1580 cm 1 and 1480 cm 1 correspond to the vibration of c c stretching in the benzene rings also another sharp peak can be seen at 1240 cm 1 which is mainly attributed to the ether group located in between the two phenyl groups additionally the pes s sulfone group is represented by the absorption peaks at the wavenumber of 1150 cm 1 and 1100 cm 1 the spectrum of the c nccopf pes composite membrane resembled those of the pristine pes membrane s spectrum particularly between 500 cm 1 and 1500 cm 1 the resemblance suggests that the modified membrane still preserves the pes properties despite the incorporation of c nccopf nonetheless considerable modifications were found at the peak regions of 1639 cm 1 1720 cm 1 2900 cm 1 and 3405 cm 1 representing the water absorbed c o stretch from carboxyl groups ch2 groups and oh functional groups respectively as illustrated in fig 3 these peaks are comparable to those observed for c nccopf powder demonstrating that c nccopf was successfully embedded into the pes matrix the cooh groups of the c nccopf play a crucial role in integrating the c nccopf into the pes matrix despite the cellulosic materials strong intra and intermolecular hydrogen bonding due to an abundance of oh groups the presence of cooh groups within the c nccopf facilitates dispersion of the c nccopf within the dmac solvent via electro repulsive forces between the molecules this inadvertently shattered the intermolecular and intramolecular hydrogen bonds inside the ncc structure 61 the well dispersed oh groups of the c nccopf were afterward capable of forming new hydrogen bonds with the pes both the c nccopf and pes are physically coupled via hydrogen bonds giving the c nccopf pes composite membrane the properties of c nccopf while retaining the pes properties thus the hydrophilicity of the membrane surface was improved 3 2 surface morphology and structure 3 2 1 c nccopf fig 4 portrayed a fesem micrograph and a tem image of the synthesized c nccopf the morphology of the cellulosic sample was analyzed and it was discovered that the c nccopf had the characteristic of a small strand in a rod shape corresponding to subair et al the acid hydrolysis process tends to remove the amorphous phase from the α cellulose resulting in a considerable reduction in c nccopf size 62 these c nccopf strands are also aggregated resulting from the sublimation of water during the drying of c nccopf as depicted in the figure during the freeze drying process the nanofibers would cluster close to the surface of the ice crystals which results in the formation of massive hydrogen bonds between the nearby c nccopf surfaces 63 the fesem study alone is insufficient to elucidate the c nccopf s precise structure consequently tem analysis was conducted to certify the accurate size of the synthesized nanorods consequently using the tem image imagej software was used to measure each c nccopf strand the average dimension of c nccopf obtained here and several other works is tabulated in table 4 the tem image further validates the c nccopf s identity as an individualized nanorod shaped substance the nanorods had an average length of 121 03 nm an average width of 15 64 nm and an aspect ratio of 7 74 according to the published literature the typical dimensions of a cnc are 112 395 nm in length 4 7 nm in width and an aspect ratio of 12 42 15 64 although the synthesized c nccopf has a width double that of the standard cnc it has an aspect ratio substantially lower than what has been documented in the literature this work proved the synthesized c nccopf as a nano scale cellulose composite with a good dimension range 3 2 2 membranes morphology the surface and cross section morphology of the fabricated membranes are presented in figs 5 and 6 respectively noticeably the modified flat sheet membrane visualized a noticeable change in its top surface first the presence of c nccopf embedded on the c nccopf pes composite membrane was visible as illustrated by the yellow circles in fig 5 this directly supports the ftir finding that the c nccopf was successfully embedded into the pes matrix next the surface of the modified membrane exhibited a more porous structure than that of pes pristine membrane the observed surface variation caused by the incorporation of c nccopf was attributed to the properties of the dope solution generally the porous or dense structure of the membranes were influenced by the interchange rate of the solvent and non solvent during the phase inversion process 69 in this case the presence of hydrophilic c nccopf may increase the water penetration rate into the membrane because of the stronger affinity for water imparted to the composite membrane surface by the c nccopf in the dope solution as a result a more porous membrane was produced as the rate of water non solvent entering the casted film is faster than the dmac solvent exits fig 6 illustrates the cross sectional image for the fabricated membranes in general the cross section images revealed that both membranes acquire an asymmetric pore structure i e a thin and dense top layer that supported by the middle region finger like pores and the macrovoids at the bottom the pes membrane possesses finger like pores diameter up to 8 79 μm and average macrovoid size of 12 99 μm with the incorporation of c nccopf the c nccopf pes composite membrane shows a significant increment in the cross sectional pores size the macropores and finger like pores diameter of the composite membrane increased up to 185 from 12 99 μm to 37 08 μm and 79 from 8 79 μm to 15 72 μm respectively the pore size increment was induced by the mixing demixing process upon the addition of c nccopf in the dope solution the hydrophilicity of the membrane is further enhanced this can increase the phase inversion rate and accelerates the water diffusion into the dope solution thus a wide and more open pore structure was produced 70 despite the increased in size the middle finger like pores were pushed back up and become shorter due to the significant increment in the macrovoid region gao et al also observed the formation of shorter finger like cavities in hydrophilic sulfobetaine polyimides pis polysulfone psf membranes as a result of the subtle interactions between the pis psf solvent initiated by the incorporation of pis into the dope solution 71 furthermore the finger like pores especially at the top end of the composite membrane are seemed to increase in number which provide more channels for water molecule to pass through the membrane same behavior has been reported by bai et al where the number of finger like cavities of their membranes increased with the presence of ncc 72 3 3 contact angle porosity and mean pore size of fabricated membranes hydrophilicity is an indicative characteristic of membrane permeation and anti fouling behavior a membrane with a higher hydrophilic surface possesses a greater anti fouling resistance in addition to the enhanced permeate flux 52 here membrane hydrophilicity is determined by the measurement of the water contact angle wca of the fabricated membranes as depicted in fig 7 the wca value of the pristine pes membrane was 72 91 whereas the wca value of the c nccopf pes composite membrane was 63 35 based on fig 7 incorporating c nccopf into the pes matrix has enhanced the hydrophilicity of the resulting composite membrane by 15 09 compared to the pristine pes membrane this could be caused by the enhanced pore structure and the existence of the hydrophilic functional groups i e oh and cooh contributed by the hydrophilic c nccopf on the surface of the composite membrane the presence of these hydrophilic functional groups promote membrane wetting because of their high affinity for water which causes air gaps on the surface to be filled with water the porosity of the pristine pes and the modified c nccopf pes composite membranes are tabulated in table 5 the pristine membrane recorded a low porosity of 66 46 however introducing the hydrophilic c nccopf nanoadditive in the dope solution produced a modified membrane with a greater porosity of 80 19 increased up to 14 the hydrophilic property of the c nccopf led to thermodynamic instability during phase inversion which attracted more water into the membrane region and filled up more spaces within the composite membrane the increased number of water filled spaces within the composite membrane led to the formation of more pores during the drying process hence the increased porosity 56 based on the results above we believe that c nccopf also acts as a porogen during membrane fabrication following the enhanced trend of the modified membrane in terms of both hydrophilicity and porosity the c nccopf pes composite membrane revealed an increased mean pore size of 40 18 nm compared to the pristine pes membrane which recorded a significantly smaller mean pore size of 5 21 nm the results as tabulated in table 5 revealed that the pore size of both fabricated membranes is within the ultrafiltration range 1 nm to 100 nm 73 the significant increase in pore size up to sevenfold may be due to the enhanced hydrophilicity character of the c nccopf pes composite membrane the hydrophilic property of c nccopf in the dope solution increases the demixing rate between the dmac and water during the phase inversion process as a result both the size and density of the membrane pores are increased these findings agreed with those presented in the topographic images from the sem and the porosity measurements 3 4 membranes performance studies 3 4 1 water permeability and ha separation performance the crossflow filtration method was applied for the membrane performance study to examine the water permeability and the capabilities of humic acid ha separation of both fabricated membranes fig 8 represents the outcomes for the pure water flux pwf and ha separation during the 1 h and 3 h period of filtration for each test respectively based on the result the pristine pes membrane recorded a pwf of 2 63 l m 2 h 1 lmh during the filtration process at 1 bar the low pwf is mainly attributed to the small pore size of the membrane fig 5 and table 5 and the poor surface hydrophilicity fig 7 which mostly negates water molecules from penetrating the membrane pores on the other hand a significant increase in pwf was recorded by the c nccopf pes composite membrane by incorporating the c nccopf into the pes matrix the pwf increased tremendously from 2 63 lmh to 218 73 lmh which is about an 8216 73 increment 83 times higher from the pristine pes the significant changes in pwf are related to the synergistic effect between the enhanced surface hydrophilicity fig 7 the increased surface pore size fig 5 and table 5 and the improved cross sectional pore structure of the composite membrane fig 6 in terms of hydrophilicity the presence of the hydrophilic c nccopf on the surface of the modified membrane could help boosting the transfer rate of water molecules by attracting the water molecules onto the membrane s surface with their abundant oh groups in the meantime the larger surface pore size and better cross sectional pore structure let more water molecules pass through the membrane resulting in increased pwf next the solute filtration process was done using a synthetic feed solution containing 50 mg l 1 ha fig 8 depicted a ha rejection of 90 03 for the pristine pes membrane as mentioned by chu et al size exclusion and hydrophobic adsorption are the primary removal mechanism for the pristine pes membranes 74 similarly in this case the small surface pores of the pristine pes membrane are what contribute to the high ha rejection of the membrane ha can be divided into different classes including small nanoparticles 100 nm submicroparticles 300 600 μm and large macroparticles 1 μm 75 as depicted in fig 5 and table 5 the mean pore size of the pristine membrane falls far below the sizes of the small nanoparticle because of this the amount of ha that could pass through the membrane is restricted particularly in the case of the macroparticle sizes additionally the hydrophobicity of the membrane s surface draws ha molecules towards it causing more molecules to adsorb on the membrane s surface and fewer molecules to pass through it the adsorbed ha molecules will eventually cause the membrane to foul as will be covered in the following section even though ha rejection is substantial the significantly low pwf of the membrane renders the pristine pes membrane unsuitable for ha filtration on the other hand a slightly lower i e 89 43 ha rejection has been recorded for the c nccopf pes composite membrane the significantly small 0 67 decrease in ha rejection is due to the physicochemical properties of the composite membrane kim et al reported that ha molecules could be as small as under 1 kda 76 the larger membrane pore size of the modified membrane table 5 increased the likelihood of the ha molecules passing through the membrane supposed the enhanced hydrophilicity of the composite membrane may improve ha rejection during filtration by inducing a dense and stable layer of water on the surface of the membrane 5 however the tremendous filtration flux overcame the effect of the water hydration layer allowing more ha to pass through the membrane given the significant improvement in pwf relative to the minuscule decrease in ha rejection the c nccopf pes composite membrane is superior to the pristine pes membrane for treating ha in surface water 3 4 2 fouling analysis fouling analysis was done to investigate the anti fouling capability and the fouling mechanisms of the fabricated membranes flux recovery ratio frr and fouling resistance parameters including total fouling rt reversible fouling rr and irreversible fouling rir were both used to assess the anti fouling capability of the membranes and the results are shown in fig 9 frr was used to evaluate the membrane recycling property after fouling by ha solution the frr of the pristine pes membrane was only 49 indicating its poor anti fouling capability modification of the pes membrane with the c nccopf significantly increased the frr to 89 up to a 40 increment the increased frr indicates that the ha can be easily washed away from the composite membrane compared to the pristine membrane it was observed that the frr values increased with the increase in membrane hydrophilicity fig 7 it was reported in the literature that improved hydrophilicity has a positive impact on the anti fouling capability of membranes 77 79 by increasing the hydrophilicity of the membrane not only can it enhance the water permeation flux but it can also form a protective water layer to avoid foulant adsorption on the membrane surface 77 next fouling resistance parameters were used to determine the anti fouling property of the fabricated membranes there are two categories of membrane fouling namely reversible and irreversible fouling the parameter rr represents reversible fouling or the portion of fouling that could be eliminated by hydraulic cleaning rir represents the irreversible fouling or the portion of fouling that cannot be removed with hydraulic cleaning alone finally rt is the sum of rr and rir and represents the degree of total flux loss the lower rt and higher frr values indicate the superior membrane anti fouling property as depicted in fig 9 the incorporation of c nccopf into the pes matrix reduced the rt value from 66 to 51 up to a 15 decrement in addition it also lowered the rir of the fabricated membrane from 51 to 11 up to a 40 decrement while increasing the rr from 15 to 40 up to a 25 increment the finding suggested that the incorporation of c nccopf into the pes matrix reduced the total membrane fouling particularly irreversible membrane fouling this could be attributed to the highly hydrophilic properties of c nccopf which preserved a large number of water molecules on the membrane surfaces the water layer played a crucial role in maintaining the native conformation of the adsorbed ha and inhibiting contact between the ha and membrane surface 79 these outcomes demonstrated that the addition of c nccopf enhances the anti fouling properties of the pes membrane several crucial fouling related parameters were derived from the ha filtration experiments to investigate the fouling mechanisms of the fabricated membranes the experimental fouling data were first plugged into the linearized hermia model equations yielding k values as the gradient of the line the theoretical hermia models were then plotted using the k values to determine which model best described membrane fouling the model with the highest r2 value obtained using the linear regression technique was chosen as the most accurate representation of the membrane fouling mechanism the obtained parameter k values and the correlation coefficient r2 are shown in table 6 for both the pristine pes membrane and the c nccopf pes composite membrane additionally in fig 10 the predicted and experimental data for flux drop during ha filtration are shown according to the data in table 6 and as depicted in fig 10 complete blockage cb was the dominant mechanism for the pristine pes membrane in contrast the data for the c nccopf pes composite membrane were best fitted by the cake filtration cf mechanism this finding is consistent with the high reversible fouling rr value of the composite membrane the improved hydrophilicity led to the formation of a water layer that prevents ha from adhering to the membrane surface instead the ha molecules formed a cake layer of fouling on the membrane surface by adsorbing to one another because membrane fouling is a highly complex physicochemical phenomenon studies have demonstrated that individual classic models are incapable of explaining the flux drop during filtration processes 54 to adequately describe the experimental data it seems that more than one type of fouling mechanism is considered necessary the combined fouling models cfms developed by bolton and his colleagues were used to investigate the fouling behavior of membranes precisely 55 table 7 provides a summary of the fitted parameter values the sum of squared errors sse and the correlation coefficient r2 for each cfms of the tested membranes in addition fig 11 displays the experimental and cfms data for both pristine pes and c nccopf pes composite membranes in the case of the pristine pes membrane all three types of cfms including cf cb cf ib and cf sb were observed to have occurred this implies that pes membrane has a high propensity for ha fouling which because of its hydrophobic nature 1 since pes and ha share similar hydrophobic properties they were able to form a hydrophobic interaction upon coming into contact with one another resulting in the adsorption of ha onto the pes membrane subsequently ha molecules may interact with one another in the same way leading to clustering on the surface and within the pores of the membrane on the other hand the cf ib and cf sb mechanisms provide the best data fit for the c nccopf embedded membrane using the magnitudes of the fitted parameter the contributions of the component models to the combined models were determined 80 for pristine pes membrane the ratios of kcj0 2 kb kcj0 ki and kcj0 ks were 9 0e 09 3 96e 10 and 1 57e 03 respectively indicating that caking i e kc was not a major component of any of the combined models as for the c nccopf pes composite membrane the ratios of kcj0 2 kb kcj0 ki and kcj0 ks were 1 13e 06 7 02 and 2 23 respectively indicating that caking was a major component for the well fitted cf ib and cf sb models the findings from the cfms mechanisms verified the beneficial effect that c nccopf nanoparticles have on the membrane s resistance to fouling 3 4 3 comparison with other studies in this work we took an innovative to utilize opfs biomass to synthesize c nccopf via a simple and time efficient one pot mixed acid hydrolysis and then incorporate them into the pes membrane to improve the hydrophilicity based on the results obtained in this study the c nccopf were successfully obtained and incorporated into the pes polymer matrix the composite membrane exhibited enhanced hydrophilicity which improved membrane performance and anti fouling properties table 8 compares this work and the literature in terms of membrane performance and anti fouling capability overall the presence of hydrophilic additives enhances membrane performance in terms of water permeability solute rejection and anti fouling properties our work recorded a result of 218 73 l m 2 h 1 bar 1 lmhb which is 83 times greater than the pristine membrane the result is significantly greater than those reported by chai et al 81 jafarzadeh et al 54 chu et al 74 and teow et al 11 meanwhile wardani et al 79 reported a water permeation of 260 64 lmhb and 70 ha rejection when using a polydopamine pda embedded polypropylene membrane an additional hydrophilic pore former i e polyvinylpyrrolidone was used with the pda resulting in a synergistic effect between the hydrophilic particles and further increasing the water permeability of the membrane although their membrane had a higher water permeability than ours its ha rejection was significantly lower regarding solute rejection the literature recorded a high ha rejection ranging from 70 to 96 our study showed an equivalent result as we rejected high ha from the treated water up to 89 43 nonetheless our study demonstrated a minimal trade off effect between water permeability and ha rejection as the water flux increased 83 fold while retaining a high ha rejection compared to the pristine pes membrane flux recovery ratios frr and fouling resistance parameters such as total fouling rt reversible fouling rr and irreversible fouling rir were utilized to evaluate the anti fouling capability of membranes table 8 demonstrates that the incorporation of hydrophilic additives into the polymer matrix enhanced the anti fouling capability of all the optimized membranes including ours in general a membrane with a high frr and a low rt has a good anti fouling capability additionally an rt with a high rr and a low rir is desirable our membrane demonstrated an excellent anti fouling capability with a high frr of 88 67 which is greater than what has been reported by teow et al 11 jafarzadeh et al 54 taghaddosi et al 1 akbari et al 82 wardani et al 79 chu et al 74 and chai et al 81 in addition the rt of our membrane which was 50 92 was significantly lower than most of the research presented in table 8 furthermore all membranes including this work exhibited an rr value greater than the rir indicating that the membranes can be easily cleaned using only a hydraulic approach 4 conclusion a simple and time efficient one pot hydrolysis method has been utilized to synthesize carboxylated nccs by treating opfs with the h2so4 and hno3 mixed acid solution the characterization results revealed that the conversion of the cellulose primary hydroxyl groups oh to carboxyl groups cooh could be achieved within 1 h the degree of oxidation of c nccopf was estimated from ftir data and a value of 0 21 was obtained comparable to those c ncc synthesized using the classical time consuming tempo or aps oxidation procedures tem analysis illustrated that the acquired c nccopf is a nanorod with dimensions of 121 03 65 30 nm and 15 64 5 42 nm in length and width respectively subsequently the c nccopf embedded pes composite membrane was fabricated via the non solvent induced phase inversion nips method using the synthesized c nccopf as an additive ftir analysis demonstrates that nccopf was successfully embedded into the pes matrix suggesting that both materials have good compatibility to form hydrogen bonds sem analysis revealed that incorporating the hydrophilic c nccopf led to the enlargement of surface pores finger like pores and macropores of the composite membrane also c nccopf incorporation enhanced the composite membrane mean pore size and porosity furthermore the wca obtained for the c nccopf pes composite membrane shows that the hydrophilicity of the pes membrane was improved by 15 09 due to the enhanced pore structure and the availability of hydrophilic oh and cooh functional groups on the surface of the modified membrane in terms of pwf and solute separation incorporating c nccopf nanoparticles into the pes matrix could increase the pwf of the composite membrane by up to 83 folds from 2 63 lmh to 218 73 lmh while retaining the high separation of ha the anti fouling performance of the membrane was verified to be improved in the presence of c nccopf nanoparticles through the assessment of the frr fouling resistance parameters and fouling mechanisms by hermia single fouling models and bolton s combined fouling

12537,most polymeric membranes including polyethersulfone pes are limited in their application due to their low water flux and high fouling characteristic in this study carboxylated nanocrystalline cellulose c ncc embedded pes membrane was fabricated using the non solvent induced phase inversion nips method to enhance the water permeability and anti fouling properties of the pes membrane herein we synthesized our c ncc from oil palm fronds opfs using a simple and time efficient one pot mixed acid hydrolysis method the as prepared c nccopf exhibited a rod like structure with dimensions of 121 03 65 30 nm and 15 64 5 42 nm in length and width respectively the degree of oxidation value of 0 21 was obtained comparable to those c ncc synthesized using the classical tempo or aps oxidation procedures by incorporating c nccopf nanorods into the pes matrix the hydrophilicity pore structure mean pore size porosity and pure water flux of the modified membrane were significantly enhanced the hermia model and bolton s combined fouling model were applied to investigate the anti fouling properties of the fabricated membrane during the ha filtration at 1 bar operating pressure the results demonstrated that the pristine pes membrane was susceptible to fouling which is likely related to the hydrophobic nature of the pes polymer in contrast it was discovered that incorporating the c nccopf into the pes membrane could significantly reduce fouling and enhance membrane performance graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords green additives carboxylated nanocrystalline cellulose

the data used in the study are shown and described in the article 1 introduction polymeric membranes are widely used for treatment of water because of their high flexibility simple pore forming mechanism smaller installation footprints and lower costs relative to their inorganic counterparts 1 polyethersulfone pes is an excellent candidate among other polymers for preparing inexpensive chemically resistant and thermally stable membranes 2 however its widespread use is hindered by the membrane s low water flux and high fouling tendency leading to increased hydraulic resistance high operating and maintenance costs a decline in productivity and frequent membrane regeneration issues 3 in ultrafiltration processes organic fouling is caused by natural organic matter nom that is typically contained in wastewater one of the main fouling causing nom compounds is humic acid ha ha are polymeric based and can form chelates with metal ions in the water creating a gel like chelate layer on the membrane surface 4 it is commonly accepted that hydrophilic membranes have a lower potential for ha fouling than hydrophobic membranes 5 therefore modification of pes membrane properties towards hydrophilicity was viewed as a crucial strategy for enhancing water permeation and anti fouling capability multiple methods such as plasma treatment 6 blending 5 7 dip coating 8 and ozone treatment 9 have been developed to increase the hydrophilic properties of membranes however incorporating hydrophilic nano fillers into the polymer matrix such as metal oxides 10 11 sio2 12 and nanodiamonds 13 is an efficient way to enhance the membrane s anti fouling properties among nanoparticles nanocrystalline celluloses nccs have gotten much attention in the field of membrane technology due to their inherent hydrophilicity excellent mechanical properties e g 110 220 gpa of elastic modulus of axial direction and 7500 7700 mpa of tensile strength large specific area low density e g 1 6 g cm 3 renewable nature biocompatibility low cost adaptable surface chemistry and intriguing optical properties 14 16 the incorporation of nanoparticles such as nccs into polymeric membranes has been the subject of investigation in a number of studies bai et al reported enhanced anti fouling properties of pes membrane towards humic acid and bovine serum albumin when coating with nccs 8 xu et al fabricated polylactic acid composite films using an acetylated nccs to improve their mechanical and thermal properties 17 nccs are typically extracted from cellulose based substances like cotton pulp 18 acacia mangium 19 cassava bagasse 20 ramie fibers 14 and sugar palm fibers 21 in malaysia the growth of the oil palm industry has led to a dramatic increase in oil palm plantations consequently the proliferation of oil palm waste has become a severe problem without proper utilization in the field this waste has a detrimental effect towards the environment as a part of the biomass oil palm fronds opfs account for a large proportion of oil palm biomass waste approximately 2 3 million tonnes or roughly 70 w w of all oil palm biomass waste 22 23 since lignocellulosic biomass has many positive qualities including low cost low environmental impact and ready availability researchers are devoting more time and energy to finding ways to put it to use opfs are a promising source for obtaining a highly crystalline ncc as discovered by nordin et al 24 moreover it could be utilized as a reinforcing agent of the bio based nanocomposite where it shows great promise 23 isolation of nccs from cellulose based materials generally includes acid hydrolysis 25 28 mechanical treatment 29 30 or enzymatic hydrolysis 18 31 throughout these procedures the amorphous part of the cellulose is disintegrated while the crystalline part is retained it is widely acknowledged that acid hydrolysis particularly with sulfuric acid h2so4 is the most common method to isolate nccs from different types of raw cellulose 26 28 throughout the process a trace amount of negatively charged sulfate ester groups so4 2 are added to the surface of nccs improving their dispersibility due to electrostatic repulsion 32 however at high temperatures the so4 2 groups could stimulate the decomposition of the cellulose chains thereby limiting the stability and performance of the composite materials at a high operating temperature 33 extraction of nccs without introducing so4 2 has also been extensively studied using other mild acids including hydrochloric acid hcl 34 however these non modified nccs are easily accumulated in polymers or organic solvents because of the strong intermolecular and intramolecular hydrogen bonding interactions between the abundance surface hydroxyl group oh within the nccs 17 as a result the reinforcing efficiency of nccs with low dispersibility is severely hampered and their application in nanocomposites is severely limited interestingly the reactive surface of oh groups makes it possible to modify the properties of nccs by chemically modifying their surfaces surface carboxylation on the nccs has recently received much attention due to its potential to improve their compatibility and dispersion in solvents moreover the absence of the labile so4 2 groups may enhance the thermal stability of nccs for the synthesis of carboxylated nccs c nccs the oxidation procedure using a 2 2 6 6 tetramethyl 1 piperidinyloxy tempo radical received the most attention 35 37 with this method the c6 primary alcohols of nccs are selectively converted to carboxyl groups cooh unfortunately this method still has numerous drawbacks such as a complex control system and lengthy treatment times e g the ph during the oxidation process needs to be maintained at 10 for 4 h 38 on top of that the tempo reagents are toxic and may be causing environmental concerns alternatively a low cost material such as ammonium persulfate aps is extensively utilized to isolate c nccs via a one step method due to its low long term toxicity and high water solubility 39 41 however it is still hampered by the lengthy treatment procedure which has drastically reduced its production efficiency for industrial applications lately a one step procedure for preparing c nccs using mixed reaction systems has been applied 42 koshani et al utilized a hydrogen peroxide oxidation catalyzed using copper sulfate pentahydrate to synthesize c ncc from softwood pulp at 60 c for 72 h 43 zhou et al synthesized c nccs from cotton pulp using a combination of potassium permanganate oxidizing agent and oxalic acid reducing agent in an h2so4 medium at the temperature of 50 c for 8 h 44 however acquiring c nccs via any of these methods is a time consuming process recently a mixed acid system has been utilized to extract c nccs 45 48 and the synergistic effect between the different acids has improved the degradation rate of the nanocomposites xie et al isolated c nccs from the bleached eucalyptus kraft pulp using a mixed h2so4 oxalic acid within 2 to 5 h of hydrolysis 49 the resulting c nccs showed a much higher thermal stability than the nccs extracted from h2so4 hydrolysis as fewer so4 2 groups occupied the oh groups of the c nccs due to the existence of the competitive cooh groups cheng et al reported a one step h2so4 nitric acid hno3 mixed acid hydrolysis to extract c nccs from commercial microcrystalline celluloses at various hydrolysis temperatures for 0 5 h 50 at the optimal temperature of 80 c c nccs with the maximum degree of oxidation of 0 11 was produced comparable to those c ncc synthesized using the classical tempo or aps oxidation procedures to our knowledge no report has specifically addressed the extraction of c ncc from opfs via mixed acid hydrolysis followed by their incorporation into membranes for the water treatment process in this study we designed a simple and time efficient one pot technique for producing c nccs from opfs using an h2so4 hno3 mixed acid system the oh groups on cellulose molecular chains were anticipated to be changed into cooh groups when oxidizing hno3 was introduced to the h2so4 medium subsequently pristine and c nccopf embedded pes membranes were fabricated using the non solvent induced phase separation nips process a set of analyses such as sem fesem tem ftir mean pore size porosity and water contact angle wca were carried out to characterize both the synthesized c nccopf and the membranes in addition membrane performance was evaluated in term of water permeability i e pure water flux pwf and humic acid ha separation using a cross flow filtration process finally the fouling behavior of the fabricated membranes towards the ha was investigated using hermia single fouling models and bolton s combined fouling models cfms 2 experimental 2 1 materials oil palm fronds opfs were obtained from engineering campus universiti sains malaysia nibong tebal malaysia as a starting material the opfs were detached from the oil palm tree and were made to powder via the grounding process before undergoing the grounding process the opfs were cut into pieces and dried under the sun next the

purification 2 2 preparation of carboxylated nanocrystalline cellulose from oil palm fronds c nccopf 2 2 1 pulp bleaching and mercerization both pulp bleaching and mercerization were performed corresponding to the procedure proposed by azani et al 23 first the bleaching method was used to extract holocellulose from the opfs in detail a mixture was prepared by mixing 4 5 g of opfs powder and 375 ml distilled water dw in a three neck round bottom flask the mixture was left to stir and the temperature was set to 70 c using a heating mantle once the mixture temperature reached 70 c 3 g of naclo2 followed by 3 ml of ch3cooh were added to the mixture the mixture was left to stir for 2 h at the designated temperature the holocellulose was filtered out from the resulting suspension via suction filtration and the filter cake was repeatedly washed using excess dw next the holocellulose acquired from the bleaching process was dried overnight in an oven at 50 c based on the result obtained the holocellulose content in the opfs sample was calculated using eq 1 1 holocellulose holocellulose mass g initial opfs mass g 100 consequently α cellulose was extracted from the holocellulose via the mercerization process in a volumetric flask a dry 5 g holocellulose was reacted with 100 ml naoh at 10 w v concentration the mixture was stirred for 30 min at room temperature then 100 ml of distilled water was added to the mixture to reduce the naoh concentration to 5 w v and the mixture was stirred for another 30 min the α cellulose produced was isolated from the resulting suspension via vacuum filtration and the filter cake was washed using 1 v v of ch3cooh followed by excess dw the α cellulose acquired from the mercerization process was dried overnight in an oven at 50 c based on the result obtained the α cellulose and hemicellulose content in the opfs sample were calculated using eqs 2 and 3 2 α cellulose α cellulose mass g initial opfs mass g 100 3 hemicellulose holocellulose α cellulose 2 2 2 one pot mixed acid hydrolysis the extraction of green carboxylated nanocrystalline cellulose from oil palm fronds c nccopf was carried out using a simple and time efficient one pot mixed acid hydrolysis technique suggested by cheng et al 50 with a slight alteration in detail 2 g of α celluloses were hydrolyzed using 60 ml of an approximately 12 m mixed acid solution containing 10 m h2so4 34 ml from 96 wt h2so4 and 2 m hno3 10 ml from 65 wt hno3 the mixture was continuously stirred for 1 h at room temperature after 1 h 300 ml of cold deionized water was used to terminate the hydrolysis reaction the resulting suspension was repeatedly centrifuged and re diluted to remove the acids followed by a dialysis process to neutralize the ph of the suspension then the c nccopf were obtained by freeze drying the resulting suspension for 48 h 2 3 fabrication of carboxylated nanocrystalline cellulose blended polyethersulfone c nccopf pes membrane the non solvent induced phase inversion nips approach was used in the membrane fabrication the dope solution formulation is tabulated in table 1 prior to dope solution preparation pes flakes and c nccopf powders were left to dry for 24 h at 70 c using a vacuum oven c nccopf pes composite membrane was fabricated using the following procedure first the dmac was weighed and poured into a glass bottle then dried c nccopf was weighed accordingly to table 1 and added slowly into the dmac solvent the nanoparticles were properly dispersed in the dmac by sonicating the mixture for 1 h subsequently the mixture was stirred for 2 h at 60 c after that the dried pes flakes were added slowly to the mixture the mixture was then stirred vigorously at 60 c for 24 h to obtain a homogeneous dope solution prior to membrane casting the dope solution undergoes a degas process for 1 h to remove air bubbles using an ultrasonic bath on the other hand the dope solution preparation of the pristine membrane follows the same procedure without the addition of c nccopf into the dope solution subsequently both membranes were fabricated by casting the dope solution on a clean glass plate at room temperature using a film applicator the speed and the gap thickness of the casting knife were set to 2 mm s 1 and 200 μm respectively after casting the membranes the thin films were left in contact with open air for 45 s then the membranes were immersed in a dw bath for 24 h the solidified membranes were then washed with running water finally the membranes were kept in dw upon usage 2 4 ha solution preparation in order to prepare a 50 ppm ha solution 0 05 g ha powder was initially dissolved in 200 ml dw then the solution was slowly introduced with droplets of 1 m naoh while undergoing sonication for 1 h next dw was poured into the sonicated ha solution until it reached 1 l at the very least the ha solution was stirred overnight to ensure homogeneity additional naoh droplets were added if needed to keep the ph of the solution to around 7 7 for optimum ha dissolution 2 5 characterization 2 5 1 fourier transform infrared analysis ftir fourier transform infrared ftir analysis was used to analyze the surface chemistry of the synthesized c nccopf and membranes the spectra were analyzed in the wavenumber range of 650 cm 1 to 4000 cm 1 specifically for the c nccopf the intensity of the carbonyl peak which is located at about 1720 cm 1 was compared to the strongest band located at about 1060 cm 1 which belongs to the cellulose backbone the ratio of both bands was used to determine the degree of oxidation do of the synthesized c nccopf the formula employed in this case was based on literature 46 51 and is as shown by eq 4 4 do 0 01 0 7 i 1720 cm 1 i 1060 cm 1 2 5 2 c nccopf morphology the morphology and surface characteristic of c nccopf was studied using a field emission scanning electron microscope fesem and transmission electron microscopy tem analyses before fesem analysis the synthesized c nccopf powders were dispersed on a sample holder using carbon tape and coated with a thin layer of gold using a sputter coater for tem analysis 500 ppm of c nccopf solution was made by adding 5 mg c nccopf into 10 ml of cold dw then the c nccopf was dispersed in the solution by sonicating the solution for 10 min consequently a droplet from the prepared c nccopf sample was placed on the tem sample stage i e copper grid then one drop of stain specimen i e 2 uranyl acetate was placed on top of the sample the c nccopf sample was then characterized using a tem spectrometer the length and width of the synthesized c nccopf were analyzed based on the acquired tem images using imagej software version 1 43u java platform se binary 2 5 3 membrane morphology a scanning electron microscope sem was used to investigate the morphology of the fabricated membranes before the sem analysis all the samples were coated with a thin layer of gold using a sputter coater to obtain a cross sectional image of a membrane the membrane was fractured using a liquid nitrogen attached to a sample holder using carbon tape and then sputter coated with a thin layer of gold before being analyzed with sem 2 5 4 membrane porosity the gravimetric method was employed to determine the porosity of the fabricated membranes first five samples with the dimension of 1 cm 1 cm were cut from each membrane tested then all five samples were immersed in dw for 24 h at room temperature the samples were taken out from the dw and the excess dw on the surface of the samples was mopped using filter paper subsequently the mass of the samples was weighed and denoted as the wet sample mass mw the wet samples were then dried in the oven at 70 c for another 24 h later the dried samples were weighed and denoted as the dry sample mass md finally membrane porosity was calculated using eq 5 and the average porosity was measured for each membrane tested 52 5 porosity ε m w m d ρ l m w m d ρ l w d ρ p 100 where ww is the mass of the wet sample g wd is the mass of the dried sample g ρl is the density of distilled water i e 1 g cm 3 and ρp is the density of

approach a rame hart goniometer was used to measure the wca of the fabricated membranes using the sessile drop method a microsyringe was used to drop a 6 μl water droplet onto the membrane surface wca was measured at five distinct locations on each sample at room temperature to minimize error and the average value was reported 2 6 membrane performance studies 2 6 1 water permeability and ha separation fig 1 illustrates a cross flow filtration cell used for the water permeation and solute separation process throughout the experiment membranes with an effective area of 44 4 cm2 were used the filtrations were conducted at room temperature and a stirred solution at 500 rpm was used as feed unless otherwise specified the feed solution volumetric flow rate was kept constant throughout the experiment at 400 ml min 1 prior to any of the measurements the filtration was stabilized by compressing each membrane to 1 5 bar for 30 min then the transmembrane pressure was reduced and maintained at 1 bar and the filtration was allowed to run for 10 min to attain a stable flux after that the filtration experiment to determine the permeation of water was conducted for 1 h and the pure water flux pwf was determined using eq 7 7 j pwf q a t where jpwf q a and t denote the permeation flux of distilled water l m 2 h 1 permeation volume l effective membrane area m2 and filtration time h respectively for the solute separation experiment ha was used as a model after measuring the pwf the feedstock solution was replaced with a 50 ppm ha solution that had been previously prepared the ha separation test was carried out for 3 h at a pressure of 1 bar uv vis spectrophotometer readings at 254 nm were used to determine the ha concentration in both the permeate and the feed solution the separation capability of the membrane was computed using eq 8 8 rejection 1 c p mg l 1 c f mg l 1 100 where cp is the ha concentration in the permeate solution mg l 1 and cf is the ha concentration in the feed solution mg l 1 2 6 2 membrane anti fouling property 50 ppm of ha solution was used to test the anti fouling properties of the fabricated membranes during solute filtration after measuring the pwf of the membranes for 60 min jpwf 1 filtration flux for ha was measured at 1 bar for 3 h jha after the ha filtration the membranes were washed with distilled water at a volumetric flow rate of 600 ml min 1 for 15 min with no pressure applied using the same operating conditions as the initial pwf the pwf of the cleaned membranes jpwf 2 was measured to determine the fouling resistance of membranes the flux recovery ratio frr was calculated using the following expression 9 frr j pwf 2 j pwf 1 100 several ratios were defined to describe the anti fouling properties of the fabricated membranes in order to evaluate the fouling process in detail first the degree of total flux loss caused by total fouling rt was defined using the eq 10 10 r t 1 j ha j pwf 1 100 next rr and rir were defined as the degrees of flux loss resulting from reversible and irreversible fouling respectively rr and rir were determined using eqs 11 and 12 respectively 11 r r j pwf 2 j ha j pwf 1 100 12 r ir j pwf 1 j pwf 2 j pwf 1 100 2 6 3 fouling mechanisms analyses hermia proposed fouling models to describe the fouling mechanisms responsible for the flux decline under constant filtration pressure 53 four mechanisms including cake filtration intermediate blocking standard blocking and complete blocking are highlighted in the models the cake filtration model describes fouling due to the formation of a foulant layer on the membrane surface the intermediate blocking model describes a situation where a pore is blocked by a portion of particles approaching the membrane surface while the remaining particles settle on each other the standard blocking or pore constricting model is associated with the decrease in membrane pore radius caused by foulants adsorbing on the wall of inner pores finally the complete blocking model describes a scenario in which every particle that settles on the membrane surface blocks a pore the common mathematical form of these models is as shown in eq 13 13 d 2 t d v 2 k dt dv m where v is the cumulative volume of filtrate t is the operation time k is the resistance coefficient and m is the constant that characterizes the type of mechanism for the fouling models i e cake filtration m 0 intermediate blockage m 1 pore construction or standard blockage m 1 5 and complete blocking m 2 using the flux expression shown in eq 14 the general flux expression can be expressed by eq 15 14 j 1 a dv dt 15 dj dt kj aj 2 m where j is the filtrate flux and a is the effective area of the filtration surface the flux expression for each fouling mechanism was obtained for each m value 0 1 1 5 or 2 as shown in table 2 in order to determine the fouling mechanisms of the fabricated membranes first all four fouling models need to have their flux equations linearized then using the least square method the parameter k value for each model was determined by substituting the experimental data into those linearized flux equations the obtained k values were plugged into the hermia models to predict the most plausible fouling mechanism for the flux drop in addition to the individual fouling mechanisms some combined models have been developed to precisely investigate the fouling behavior based on darcy s law bolton et al developed combined models describing fouling mechanisms with two fitted parameters 55 as shown in table 3 the combined fouling models cfms were used to generate a graph of predicted permeate volume against time then each predicted graph was fitted against the graph obtained by the experimental data during the fitting process the sum of squared errors sse had to be minimized to obtain the best fit the difference between the predicted and experimental data points was used as the residual for calculating sse 3 results and discussion 3 1 surface functional groups the identification of the main functional groups of the c nccopf is shown in fig 2 the spectrum revealed a similarity of chemical composition between the nanocellulose samples with the pure cellulose 56 57 the absorption peak at 3322 cm 1 is resulted from the hydroxyl oh groups stretching vibration it represents the hydrophilicity of the nanocellulose as well as the hydrogen bond degradation with the cellulose chain during the hydrolysis treatment 23 the following absorption peak at 2900 cm 1 was identified as the ch symmetric vibration frequency correlated with ch2 groups a strong connection between water molecules and cellulose via hydrophilic interaction led to the adsorption of water molecules onto the cellulose surface the bending mode of the adsorbed water molecules is represented by the sharp absorption peak at 1639 cm 1 58 next the vibration of the symmetric ch2 bending corresponds to the intermolecular hydrogen in the cellulose s aromatic ring at the carbon 6 c6 position this vibration band also known as the crystallinity band describes the crystallinity degree of the cellulose and is represented by the absorption peak at 1412 cm 1 59 the peak at 1161 cm 1 represents the c o c stretching pyranose ring ether while the peak at 893 cm 1 represents the glucosidic ring vibration specific for β glucosides 60 a new peak at 1720 cm 1 was observed which corresponds to the presence of carboxyl cooh groups the result confirmed that the surface carboxylation of nccs was successfully accomplished with the introduction of hno3 the presence of this new peak is aligned with what is being reported by cheng et al 50 during the mixed acid procedure some of the oh groups were converted into cooh groups due to the presence of oxidizing hno3 in the h2so4 medium additionally the ftir spectrum was used to calculate the degree of oxidation do of the synthesized c nccopf table 4 shows the do obtained in this study and several others literature the result indicates that the c nccopf synthesized in this study shows a do of 0 21 which is aligned with other mixed acid hydrolysis procedures furthermore the do obtained is higher than that obtained by those conventional long time oxidation treatments using tempo mediated and aps as the oxidation reagent next ftir analyses were performed to identify the membrane s surface functional groups on both pristine pes and composite c nccopf pes membranes the results are depicted in fig 3 similar chemical compositions to those reported in the literature may be seen in the ftir spectrum for the unmodified pes membrane 7 first the peaks detected at the wavenumber of 1580 cm 1 and 1480 cm 1 correspond to the vibration of c c stretching in the benzene rings also another sharp peak can be seen at 1240 cm 1 which is mainly attributed to the ether group located in between the two phenyl groups additionally the pes s sulfone group is represented by the absorption peaks at the wavenumber of 1150 cm 1 and 1100 cm 1 the spectrum of the c nccopf pes composite membrane resembled those of the pristine pes membrane s spectrum particularly between 500 cm 1 and 1500 cm 1 the resemblance suggests that the modified membrane still preserves the pes properties despite the incorporation of c nccopf nonetheless considerable modifications were found at the peak regions of 1639 cm 1 1720 cm 1 2900 cm 1 and 3405 cm 1 representing the water absorbed c o stretch from carboxyl groups ch2 groups and oh functional groups respectively as illustrated in fig 3 these peaks are comparable to those observed for c nccopf powder demonstrating that c nccopf was successfully embedded into the pes matrix the cooh groups of the c nccopf play a crucial role in integrating the c nccopf into the pes matrix despite the cellulosic materials strong intra and intermolecular hydrogen bonding due to an abundance of oh groups the presence of cooh groups within the c nccopf facilitates dispersion of the c nccopf within the dmac solvent via electro repulsive forces between the molecules this inadvertently shattered the intermolecular and intramolecular hydrogen bonds inside the ncc structure 61 the well dispersed oh groups of the c nccopf were afterward capable of forming new hydrogen bonds with the pes both the c nccopf and pes are physically coupled via hydrogen bonds giving the c nccopf pes composite membrane the properties of c nccopf while retaining the pes properties thus the hydrophilicity of the membrane surface was improved 3 2 surface morphology and structure 3 2 1 c nccopf fig 4 portrayed a fesem micrograph and a tem image of the synthesized c nccopf the morphology of the cellulosic sample was analyzed and it was discovered that the c nccopf had the characteristic of a small strand in a rod shape corresponding to subair et al the acid hydrolysis process tends to remove the amorphous phase from the α cellulose resulting in a considerable reduction in c nccopf size 62 these c nccopf strands are also aggregated resulting from the sublimation of water during the drying of c nccopf as depicted in the figure during the freeze drying process the nanofibers would cluster close to the surface of the ice crystals which results in the formation of massive hydrogen bonds between the nearby c nccopf surfaces 63 the fesem study alone is insufficient to elucidate the c nccopf s precise structure consequently tem analysis was conducted to certify the accurate size of the synthesized nanorods consequently using the tem image imagej software was used to measure each c nccopf strand the average dimension of c nccopf obtained here and several other works is tabulated in table 4 the tem image further validates the c nccopf s identity as an individualized nanorod shaped substance the nanorods had an average length of 121 03 nm an average width of 15 64 nm and an aspect ratio of 7 74 according to the published literature the typical dimensions of a cnc are 112 395 nm in length 4 7 nm in width and an aspect ratio of 12 42 15 64 although the synthesized c nccopf has a width double that of the standard cnc it has an aspect ratio substantially lower than what has been documented in the literature this work proved the synthesized c nccopf as a nano scale cellulose composite with a good dimension range 3 2 2 membranes morphology the surface and cross section morphology of the fabricated membranes are presented in figs 5 and 6 respectively noticeably the modified flat sheet membrane visualized a noticeable change in its top surface first the presence of c nccopf embedded on the c nccopf pes composite membrane was visible as illustrated by the yellow circles in fig 5 this directly supports the ftir finding that the c nccopf was successfully embedded into the pes matrix next the surface of the modified membrane exhibited a more porous structure than that of pes pristine membrane the observed surface variation caused by the incorporation of c nccopf was attributed to the properties of the dope solution generally the porous or dense structure of the membranes were influenced by the interchange rate of the solvent and non solvent during the phase inversion process 69 in this case the presence of hydrophilic c nccopf may increase the water penetration rate into the membrane because of the stronger affinity for water imparted to the composite membrane surface by the c nccopf in the dope solution as a result a more porous membrane was produced as the rate of water non solvent entering the casted film is faster than the dmac solvent exits fig 6 illustrates the cross sectional image for the fabricated membranes in general the cross section images revealed that both membranes acquire an asymmetric pore structure i e a thin and dense top layer that supported by the middle region finger like pores and the macrovoids at the bottom the pes membrane possesses finger like pores diameter up to 8 79 μm and average macrovoid size of 12 99 μm with the incorporation of c nccopf the c nccopf pes composite membrane shows a significant increment in the cross sectional pores size the macropores and finger like pores diameter of the composite membrane increased up to 185 from 12 99 μm to 37 08 μm and 79 from 8 79 μm to 15 72 μm respectively the pore size increment was induced by the mixing demixing process upon the addition of c nccopf in the dope solution the hydrophilicity of the membrane is further enhanced this can increase the phase inversion rate and accelerates the water diffusion into the dope solution thus a wide and more open pore structure was produced 70 despite the increased in size the middle finger like pores were pushed back up and become shorter due to the significant increment in the macrovoid region gao et al also observed the formation of shorter finger like cavities in hydrophilic sulfobetaine polyimides pis polysulfone psf membranes as a result of the subtle interactions between the pis psf solvent initiated by the incorporation of pis into the dope solution 71 furthermore the finger like pores especially at the top end of the composite membrane are seemed to increase in number which provide more channels for water molecule to pass through the membrane same behavior has been reported by bai et al where the number of finger like cavities of their membranes increased with the presence of ncc 72 3 3 contact angle porosity and mean pore size of fabricated membranes hydrophilicity is an indicative characteristic of membrane permeation and anti fouling behavior a membrane with a higher hydrophilic surface possesses a greater anti fouling resistance in addition to the enhanced permeate flux 52 here membrane hydrophilicity is determined by the measurement of the water contact angle wca of the fabricated membranes as depicted in fig 7 the wca value of the pristine pes membrane was 72 91 whereas the wca value of the c nccopf pes composite membrane was 63 35 based on fig 7 incorporating c nccopf into the pes matrix has enhanced the hydrophilicity of the resulting composite membrane by 15 09 compared to the pristine pes membrane this could be caused by the enhanced pore structure and the existence of the hydrophilic functional groups i e oh and cooh contributed by the hydrophilic c nccopf on the surface of the composite membrane the presence of these hydrophilic functional groups promote membrane wetting because of their high affinity for water which causes air gaps on the surface to be filled with water the porosity of the pristine pes and the modified c nccopf pes composite membranes are tabulated in table 5 the pristine membrane recorded a low porosity of 66 46 however introducing the hydrophilic c nccopf nanoadditive in the dope solution produced a modified membrane with a greater porosity of 80 19 increased up to 14 the hydrophilic property of the c nccopf led to thermodynamic instability during phase inversion which attracted more water into the membrane region and filled up more spaces within the composite membrane the increased number of water filled spaces within the composite membrane led to the formation of more pores during the drying process hence the increased porosity 56 based on the results above we believe that c nccopf also acts as a porogen during membrane fabrication following the enhanced trend of the modified membrane in terms of both hydrophilicity and porosity the c nccopf pes composite membrane revealed an increased mean pore size of 40 18 nm compared to the pristine pes membrane which recorded a significantly smaller mean pore size of 5 21 nm the results as tabulated in table 5 revealed that the pore size of both fabricated membranes is within the ultrafiltration range 1 nm to 100 nm 73 the significant increase in pore size up to sevenfold may be due to the enhanced hydrophilicity character of the c nccopf pes composite membrane the hydrophilic property of c nccopf in the dope solution increases the demixing rate between the dmac and water during the phase inversion process as a result both the size and density of the membrane pores are increased these findings agreed with those presented in the topographic images from the sem and the porosity measurements 3 4 membranes performance studies 3 4 1 water permeability and ha separation performance the crossflow filtration method was applied for the membrane performance study to examine the water permeability and the capabilities of humic acid ha separation of both fabricated membranes fig 8 represents the outcomes for the pure water flux pwf and ha separation during the 1 h and 3 h period of filtration for each test respectively based on the result the pristine pes membrane recorded a pwf of 2 63 l m 2 h 1 lmh during the filtration process at 1 bar the low pwf is mainly attributed to the small pore size of the membrane fig 5 and table 5 and the poor surface hydrophilicity fig 7 which mostly negates water molecules from penetrating the membrane pores on the other hand a significant increase in pwf was recorded by the c nccopf pes composite membrane by incorporating the c nccopf into the pes matrix the pwf increased tremendously from 2 63 lmh to 218 73 lmh which is about an 8216 73 increment 83 times higher from the pristine pes the significant changes in pwf are related to the synergistic effect between the enhanced surface hydrophilicity fig 7 the increased surface pore size fig 5 and table 5 and the improved cross sectional pore structure of the composite membrane fig 6 in terms of hydrophilicity the presence of the hydrophilic c nccopf on the surface of the modified membrane could help boosting the transfer rate of water molecules by attracting the water molecules onto the membrane s surface with their abundant oh groups in the meantime the larger surface pore size and better cross sectional pore structure let more water molecules pass through the membrane resulting in increased pwf next the solute filtration process was done using a synthetic feed solution containing 50 mg l 1 ha fig 8 depicted a ha rejection of 90 03 for the pristine pes membrane as mentioned by chu et al size exclusion and hydrophobic adsorption are the primary removal mechanism for the pristine pes membranes 74 similarly in this case the small surface pores of the pristine pes membrane are what contribute to the high ha rejection of the membrane ha can be divided into different classes including small nanoparticles 100 nm submicroparticles 300 600 μm and large macroparticles 1 μm 75 as depicted in fig 5 and table 5 the mean pore size of the pristine membrane falls far below the sizes of the small nanoparticle because of this the amount of ha that could pass through the membrane is restricted particularly in the case of the macroparticle sizes additionally the hydrophobicity of the membrane s surface draws ha molecules towards it causing more molecules to adsorb on the membrane s surface and fewer molecules to pass through it the adsorbed ha molecules will eventually cause the membrane to foul as will be covered in the following section even though ha rejection is substantial the significantly low pwf of the membrane renders the pristine pes membrane unsuitable for ha filtration on the other hand a slightly lower i e 89 43 ha rejection has been recorded for the c nccopf pes composite membrane the significantly small 0 67 decrease in ha rejection is due to the physicochemical properties of the composite membrane kim et al reported that ha molecules could be as small as under 1 kda 76 the larger membrane pore size of the modified membrane table 5 increased the likelihood of the ha molecules passing through the membrane supposed the enhanced hydrophilicity of the composite membrane may improve ha rejection during filtration by inducing a dense and stable layer of water on the surface of the membrane 5 however the tremendous filtration flux overcame the effect of the water hydration layer allowing more ha to pass through the membrane given the significant improvement in pwf relative to the minuscule decrease in ha rejection the c nccopf pes composite membrane is superior to the pristine pes membrane for treating ha in surface water 3 4 2 fouling analysis fouling analysis was done to investigate the anti fouling capability and the fouling mechanisms of the fabricated membranes flux recovery ratio frr and fouling resistance parameters including total fouling rt reversible fouling rr and irreversible fouling rir were both used to assess the anti fouling capability of the membranes and the results are shown in fig 9 frr was used to evaluate the membrane recycling property after fouling by ha solution the frr of the pristine pes membrane was only 49 indicating its poor anti fouling capability modification of the pes membrane with the c nccopf significantly increased the frr to 89 up to a 40 increment the increased frr indicates that the ha can be easily washed away from the composite membrane compared to the pristine membrane it was observed that the frr values increased with the increase in membrane hydrophilicity fig 7 it was reported in the literature that improved hydrophilicity has a positive impact on the anti fouling capability of membranes 77 79 by increasing the hydrophilicity of the membrane not only can it enhance the water permeation flux but it can also form a protective water layer to avoid foulant adsorption on the membrane surface 77 next fouling resistance parameters were used to determine the anti fouling property of the fabricated membranes there are two categories of membrane fouling namely reversible and irreversible fouling the parameter rr represents reversible fouling or the portion of fouling that could be eliminated by hydraulic cleaning rir represents the irreversible fouling or the portion of fouling that cannot be removed with hydraulic cleaning alone finally rt is the sum of rr and rir and represents the degree of total flux loss the lower rt and higher frr values indicate the superior membrane anti fouling property as depicted in fig 9 the incorporation of c nccopf into the pes matrix reduced the rt value from 66 to 51 up to a 15 decrement in addition it also lowered the rir of the fabricated membrane from 51 to 11 up to a 40 decrement while increasing the rr from 15 to 40 up to a 25 increment the finding suggested that the incorporation of c nccopf into the pes matrix reduced the total membrane fouling particularly irreversible membrane fouling this could be attributed to the highly hydrophilic properties of c nccopf which preserved a large number of water molecules on the membrane surfaces the water layer played a crucial role in maintaining the native conformation of the adsorbed ha and inhibiting contact between the ha and membrane surface 79 these outcomes demonstrated that the addition of c nccopf enhances the anti fouling properties of the pes membrane several crucial fouling related parameters were derived from the ha filtration experiments to investigate the fouling mechanisms of the fabricated membranes the experimental fouling data were first plugged into the linearized hermia model equations yielding k values as the gradient of the line the theoretical hermia models were then plotted using the k values to determine which model best described membrane fouling the model with the highest r2 value obtained using the linear regression technique was chosen as the most accurate representation of the membrane fouling mechanism the obtained parameter k values and the correlation coefficient r2 are shown in table 6 for both the pristine pes membrane and the c nccopf pes composite membrane additionally in fig 10 the predicted and experimental data for flux drop during ha filtration are shown according to the data in table 6 and as depicted in fig 10 complete blockage cb was the dominant mechanism for the pristine pes membrane in contrast the data for the c nccopf pes composite membrane were best fitted by the cake filtration cf mechanism this finding is consistent with the high reversible fouling rr value of the composite membrane the improved hydrophilicity led to the formation of a water layer that prevents ha from adhering to the membrane surface instead the ha molecules formed a cake layer of fouling on the membrane surface by adsorbing to one another because membrane fouling is a highly complex physicochemical phenomenon studies have demonstrated that individual classic models are incapable of explaining the flux drop during filtration processes 54 to adequately describe the experimental data it seems that more than one type of fouling mechanism is considered necessary the combined fouling models cfms developed by bolton and his colleagues were used to investigate the fouling behavior of membranes precisely 55 table 7 provides a summary of the fitted parameter values the sum of squared errors sse and the correlation coefficient r2 for each cfms of the tested membranes in addition fig 11 displays the experimental and cfms data for both pristine pes and c nccopf pes composite membranes in the case of the pristine pes membrane all three types of cfms including cf cb cf ib and cf sb were observed to have occurred this implies that pes membrane has a high propensity for ha fouling which because of its hydrophobic nature 1 since pes and ha share similar hydrophobic properties they were able to form a hydrophobic interaction upon coming into contact with one another resulting in the adsorption of ha onto the pes membrane subsequently ha molecules may interact with one another in the same way leading to clustering on the surface and within the pores of the membrane on the other hand the cf ib and cf sb mechanisms provide the best data fit for the c nccopf embedded membrane using the magnitudes of the fitted parameter the contributions of the component models to the combined models were determined 80 for pristine pes membrane the ratios of kcj0 2 kb kcj0 ki and kcj0 ks were 9 0e 09 3 96e 10 and 1 57e 03 respectively indicating that caking i e kc was not a major component of any of the combined models as for the c nccopf pes composite membrane the ratios of kcj0 2 kb kcj0 ki and kcj0 ks were 1 13e 06 7 02 and 2 23 respectively indicating that caking was a major component for the well fitted cf ib and cf sb models the findings from the cfms mechanisms verified the beneficial effect that c nccopf nanoparticles have on the membrane s resistance to fouling 3 4 3 comparison with other studies in this work we took an innovative to utilize opfs biomass to synthesize c nccopf via a simple and time efficient one pot mixed acid hydrolysis and then incorporate them into the pes membrane to improve the hydrophilicity based on the results obtained in this study the c nccopf were successfully obtained and incorporated into the pes polymer matrix the composite membrane exhibited enhanced hydrophilicity which improved membrane performance and anti fouling properties table 8 compares this work and the literature in terms of membrane performance and anti fouling capability overall the presence of hydrophilic additives enhances membrane performance in terms of water permeability solute rejection and anti fouling properties our work recorded a result of 218 73 l m 2 h 1 bar 1 lmhb which is 83 times greater than the pristine membrane the result is significantly greater than those reported by chai et al 81 jafarzadeh et al 54 chu et al 74 and teow et al 11 meanwhile wardani et al 79 reported a water permeation of 260 64 lmhb and 70 ha rejection when using a polydopamine pda embedded polypropylene membrane an additional hydrophilic pore former i e polyvinylpyrrolidone was used with the pda resulting in a synergistic effect between the hydrophilic particles and further increasing the water permeability of the membrane although their membrane had a higher water permeability than ours its ha rejection was significantly lower regarding solute rejection the literature recorded a high ha rejection ranging from 70 to 96 our study showed an equivalent result as we rejected high ha from the treated water up to 89 43 nonetheless our study demonstrated a minimal trade off effect between water permeability and ha rejection as the water flux increased 83 fold while retaining a high ha rejection compared to the pristine pes membrane flux recovery ratios frr and fouling resistance parameters such as total fouling rt reversible fouling rr and irreversible fouling rir were utilized to evaluate the anti fouling capability of membranes table 8 demonstrates that the incorporation of hydrophilic additives into the polymer matrix enhanced the anti fouling capability of all the optimized membranes including ours in general a membrane with a high frr and a low rt has a good anti fouling capability additionally an rt with a high rr and a low rir is desirable our membrane demonstrated an excellent anti fouling capability with a high frr of 88 67 which is greater than what has been reported by teow et al 11 jafarzadeh et al 54 taghaddosi et al 1 akbari et al 82 wardani et al 79 chu et al 74 and chai et al 81 in addition the rt of our membrane which was 50 92 was significantly lower than most of the research presented in table 8 furthermore all membranes including this work exhibited an rr value greater than the rir indicating that the membranes can be easily cleaned using only a hydraulic approach 4 conclusion a simple and time efficient one pot hydrolysis method has been utilized to synthesize carboxylated nccs by treating opfs with the h2so4 and hno3 mixed acid solution the characterization results revealed that the conversion of the cellulose primary hydroxyl groups oh to carboxyl groups cooh could be achieved within 1 h the degree of oxidation of c nccopf was estimated from ftir data and a value of 0 21 was obtained comparable to those c ncc synthesized using the classical time consuming tempo or aps oxidation procedures tem analysis illustrated that the acquired c nccopf is a nanorod with dimensions of 121 03 65 30 nm and 15 64 5 42 nm in length and width respectively subsequently the c nccopf embedded pes composite membrane was fabricated via the non solvent induced phase inversion nips method using the synthesized c nccopf as an additive ftir analysis demonstrates that nccopf was successfully embedded into the pes matrix suggesting that both materials have good compatibility to form hydrogen bonds sem analysis revealed that incorporating the hydrophilic c nccopf led to the enlargement of surface pores finger like pores and macropores of the composite membrane also c nccopf incorporation enhanced the composite membrane mean pore size and porosity furthermore the wca obtained for the c nccopf pes composite membrane shows that the hydrophilicity of the pes membrane was improved by 15 09 due to the enhanced pore structure and the availability of hydrophilic oh and cooh functional groups on the surface of the modified membrane in terms of pwf and solute separation incorporating c nccopf nanoparticles into the pes matrix could increase the pwf of the composite membrane by up to 83 folds from 2 63 lmh to 218 73 lmh while retaining the high separation of ha the anti fouling performance of the membrane was verified to be improved in the presence of c nccopf nanoparticles through the assessment of the frr fouling resistance parameters and fouling mechanisms by hermia single fouling models and bolton s combined fouling

12538,fenton aops in microreactors offer many significant advantages over the use of conventional reactors for water purification because they enable the more efficient generation of hydroxyl radicals however it is still challenging to apply the fenton aops in microreactors for real applications due to their low water throughput and complex device design for h2o2 dosing here we reported a porous aqueous thin membrane fenton reactor supported by the fe2o3 modified non woven h2o2 was generated by the contact electrification between water and non woven and further enhanced by the introduction of light irradiation and heat the source water flowed through the non woven and thus removed the contained pollutants continuously at the water solid interface additionally the overall size of the device and its tilt angle were also discussed to optimize the membrane reactor purification ability ensuring a significant treatment flux in the flow reactor while maximizing the pollutant degradation efficiency 76 of degradation efficiency and 4050 l m3 h of throughput were achieved based on our porous aqueous membrane fenton reactor our work may offer valuable insight for the future development of high throughput aqueous membrane reactors for environmental purposes keywords photo fenton reaction spontaneously generated h2o2 flowing microreactor water solid interface contaminants degradation data availability the data that has been used is confidential 1 introduction water pollution has been considered to increase with the growing population and industrial development 1 2 in countries lacking universal wastewater treatment and access to clean water the contaminated water becomes a primary risk to ecological environments and human health 3 5 according to world health organization who statistics 6 80 of the rural population still does not have access to basic safe water hundreds of children worldwide die from diarrhea every day due to unsafe drinking water under these circumstances advanced oxidation processes aops have been developed and extensively studied to remove contaminants from water 7 among them fenton related aops are considered as one of the most effective and rapid methods for water purification because they produce hydroxyl radicals oh and have the advantage of simplicity and low cost 8 importantly the generated oh can indiscriminately convert contaminants including novel pesticides 9 parasites 10 and antibiotics 11 into benign substances although various fenton related methods offer advances in batch reactors for water purification the application of these technologies are still under limit due to their requirement of h2o2 dosage long mixing time uneven light distribution in photo fenton reactions and water ph value restrictions 12 in the past decade the use of microreactors for fenton related processes was developed to reduce the required mixing times and the consumption of reagents 13 several reported works showed that the introduction of the microreactor such as the continuous flow fenton aop accelerates the generation of oh and thus increases the pollutant degradation rate compared to that in a conventional batch reactor 14 more recent works have designed the flowing microreactors to realize continuous dosing during water purification to minimize fe3 precipitation shorten the light path and be amenable to a wide range of water ph values 15 16 however much of the microfluidic fenton aops remain react in a microscale chamber which cannot meet the requirement of high throughput fenton aops for the practical water treatment sector additionally in order to realize the continuous addition of h2o2 dosage and the corresponding fenton reactions in the microfluidic chamber more complex microfluidic channel design and microfabrication technology are required which undoubtedly increases the cost of microfluidic aops indeed a critical aspect of the research in the field of microfluidic aops is to develop a high throughput microfluidic reactor with combinations of low cost and easy fabricated to achieve this goal we can divide the above problem into two issues including simplifying the process of hydrogen peroxide addition in the microreactor during the aops and design of high throughput microreactors most recently our previous work has demonstrated that the contact occurring between water and glass substrate in a typical strength microfluidic channel can cause the spontaneous generation of h2o2 17 additionally the production of h2o2 in the microfluidic channel is not from oxidation by atmospheric or dissolved oxygen this finding raises hopes for simplifying the production of h2o2 in the flowing microreactor on the other hand turning a two dimensional microfluidic channel into a three dimensional microfluidic structure is one of the most effective ways to improve the throughput of the microreactors notably porous aqueous membrane supported by microstructures is a kind of fluidics that have a larger reactive volume and the properties of microfluidics 18 in what follows the demonstration is presented that a flowing reactor based on a porous aqueous membrane supported by non woven may drive a photo fenton process for the high throughput pollutant degradation without the dosage of h2o2 herein we designed and fabricated the porous aqueous membrane fenton reactor which is supported by an iron trioxide modified non woven the source water with pollutants continuously flowed through the non woven due to the siphoning effect and its gravity the bulk source water was converted into a three dimensional microfluidic aqueous membrane that acted as the fenton microreactor notably the contact electrification effect between the water and non woven can be attributed to the generation of hydroxyl radicals additionally light irradiation and heat were introduced in our system to further enhance the production of hydroxyl radicals at the water non woven interface which could fulfill the demands of the fenton reaction taking degradation of nicotines 1500 μg l acetamiprid thiacloprid thiamethoxam and imidacloprid as the model a 76 of degradation efficiency was obtained based on the microfluidic fenton aop process in our system additionally we further optimized the degradation efficiency and water treatment throughput by adjusting the angle between the device and the ground a 4050 l m3 h of throughput was achieved which is comparable with previously reported raceway pond water treatment technology this device may offer a promising way to setup a scale up high throughput membrane fenton microreactor without the addition of h2o2 dosage for an eco friendly and sustainable solution to wastewater treatment 2 experimental section 2 1 preparation of α fe2o3 with 3d branched porous structure on non woven fabrics first the non woven fabrics nws aawipes china were ultrasonically cleaned three times with ethanol and deionized water in sequence and then dried in a vacuum at 80 c overnight as we reported earlier the activated nws were first self assemble the seed layer β feooh through a chemical bath method 19 the activated nws were immersed in a 0 1 m fecl3 sigma aldrich aqueous solution at 70 c for 5 h and the reacted products were rinsed with deionized water several times and finally annealed at 150 c in an air atmosphere for 8 h at this time the β feooh has been completely transformed into α fe2o3 the final products were labeled as fe2o3 nw 2 2 characterization sem images were recorded on a hitachi s4800 feg electron microscope xrd

and 50 μm polydimethylsiloxane pdms was used as the encapsulation layer after plasma treatment two pdms films encapsulated fe2o3 nw in the middle fe2o3 nw was used to support the porous aqueous membrane and the sample flow through the reaction layer by gravity and the capillary effect of fe2o3 nw during which the tilt angle of the device was controllable the schematic illustration of the device assembly and experiment was shown in fig s1 the whole device was accompanied by standard am 1 5 g solar irradiations then the quality of the whole device was obtained over time the solar simulator was calibrated by newport 91150 v ir images were recorded by a flir c2 camera to observe the temperature under irradiations 2 4 radical detection deionized water flowing through the fe2o3 nw

hydroxyl radical changes di water was added with 100 μm of 5 5 dimethyl 1 pyrroline n oxide dmpo sigma aldrich as a hydroxyl radical trapping agent which was transferred to a quartz plate cell immediately after flowing through the membrane reactor the production of oh was demonstrated by electron paramagnetic resonance epr measurements esr was performed using a bruker elexsys e500 bruker biospin gmbh karlsruhe germany at room temperature 2 5 fluorescence imaging all the fluorescence images in the paper were performed with leica s upright fluorescence microscope lecia dm4b the aqueous solution containing 0 1 μm 10 acetyl 3 7 dihydroxyphenoxazine adhp keygen biotech was excited by a 571 nm laser and the emission was collected at 585 nm the bulk adhp solution wetted fe2o3 nw and wetted non woven fabrics fully wetted by adhp solution were observed under a microscope and recorded real time fluorescence images then the device was continuously irradiated with an external infrared lamp and temperature of the device gradually raised until the temperature stabilized the dynamic changes of fluorescence during this process were recorded by the microscope in real time the fluorescence images at different time points were processed by image j to obtain the real time average fluorescence absorption intensity 2 6 quantification of h2o2 production the concentration of h2o2 on the fe2o3 nw was determined by the chromogenic reaction of potassium titanium oxalate pto a 0 3 m pto k2tio c2o4 2 h2o 99 0 sigma aldrich aqueous solution was prepared for the chromogenic reaction to draw a standard curve 200 μl of h2o2 standard solutions with a concentration of 0 mg l 1 to 5 mg l 1 were fully reacted with 200 μl of pto solution and 300 μl of the mixed solutions were used to obtain the absorbance of the sample from 250 nm to 600 nm using a uv visible spectrometer shimadzu uv 2550 the absorbances of all samples at 400 nm were fitted to a standard curve of h2o2 the liquids on fe2o3 nws under different tilt angles were taken out and added with an equal volume of pto solution after the full reaction the absorbances at 400 nm were measured and brought into the standard curve of h2o2 and the concentration at this time was calculated 2 7 nicotines degradation measurements the initial concentration of the four nicotines imidacloprid acetamiprid thiamethoxam and nitenpyram were 1500 μg l and the volume were 100 ml the flow reactor was placed at a certain inclination angle and the sample flew through the reactor by gravity and was collected at the outlet degradation experiments were also carried out under light irradiation and dark condition respectively all results were repeated three times the pesticide concentrations were determined using an agilent technologies usa high performance liquid chromatography hplc series and an agilent 6410b triple quadrupole mass spectrometer equipped with electrospray ionization esi eclipse plus c18 column the mobile phase was methanol h2o hcooh 0 1 at a flow rate of 0 2 ml min 1 after monitoring of the selected ions a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer was used in the mrm the lc ms ms mrm data acquisition parameters of the tested nicotinic pesticides were shown in table 1 at the same time x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps of fe2o3 nws before and after the reaction were performed on a multifunctional imaging electron spectrometer thermo escalab 250xi using monochromated al ka radiation 1486 6 ev 3 results and discussion to demonstrate this approach we used a pall patch as a heat source to control the temperature of the porous aqueous membrane reactor which was sealed with a 50 μm pdms film to avoid evaporation to test whether h2o2 can be spontaneously generated in the aqueous membrane supported by non woven a water soluble h2o2 sensitive fluorescent probe 10 acetyl 3 7 dihydroxyphenoxazine adhp was used to respond selectively to h2o2 to liberate fluorescein 20 21 as shown in fig 1a adhp was added to the bulk water then the fluorescence intensity of h2o2 in the porous aqueous membrane reactor was observed and analyzed in real time with an ortho fluorescence microscope along with the overall temperature change of the reactor fig s2 displays the typical morphology of as prepared fe2o3 nanoparticles on non woven fe2o3 nw the fibers of the non woven were disordered and fe2o3 nanoparticles were uniformly grown on the fibers surface the existence of fe2o3 nanoparticles were confirmed by xrd and corresponding tem measurement as shown in figs s3 s4 as shown in fig 1b the surface fluorescence of fe2o3 nw progressively increased with the rise of temperature and the fluorescence intensity showed a logarithmic growth relationship with temperature then gradually saturated fig 1c the fluorescence intensity would reflect the concentration change of h2o2 which indicated that the spontaneous generation of h2o2 was an endothermic reaction in addition this process of h2o2 spontaneous generation was continuous and stable as shown in fig 1d and the fluorescence intensity on the interface under different temperature conditions hardly changed significantly in 3 h the production of h2o2 was further confirmed by assaying the cleavage of 4 carboxyphenylboronic acid by h2o2 based on a mass spectrometer measurement according to the previous literature 20 it can be observed that the peak at 165 03 and 137 02 m z from the spectrum correspond to the presence of 4 carboxyphenylboronic acid and 4 hydroxybenzoic acid shown in fig 1e these results revealed the fact that h2o2 was spontaneously generated in a porous aqueous membrane supported by the fe2o3 nw for quantitative analysis of h2o2 production in non woven uv vis measurements were carried out to test the adsorption spectra of potassium titanium oxalate pto k2tio c2o4 2 h2o with various concentrations of h2o2 from 1 mg l 1 to 5 mg l 1 as well as with h2o2 in porous water membrane shown in fig 1f according to the fitting curve displayed in fig 1g the concentration of h2o2 in the porous water membrane supported by fe2o3 nw was about 1 5 mg l 1 at 25 c h2o2 was rapidly decomposed to hydroxyl radicals under uv irradiation while this process would be inhibited in a dark state environment to further investigate the correlation between solar irradiation and hydroxyl radicals in the flow reactor we added a small amount of hydroxyl radical chromogenic agent 3 3 5 5 tetramethylbenzidine to the source water to observe the changes in the concentration of hydroxyl radicals in the porous water membrane reactor under solar irradiation 22 3 3 5 5 tetramethylbenzidine was colorless in the normal state and would turn blue rapidly upon contact with hydroxyl radicals making it a fast and accurate indicator of hydroxyl radicals fig 2a as shown in fig 2b the source water showed blue color i e a clear absorption peak at 650 nm when flowing through both the non woven and fe2o3 nw the darker color of the liquid flowing through fe2o3 nw may be related to the larger specific surface area and more abundant surface hydroxyl groups of fe2o3 nw after light irradiation was induced the color was deepened and the concentration of hydroxyl radicals was increased which was also related to the easy decomposition of h2o2 into hydroxyl radicals under light irradiation besides electron spin resonance spectroscopy epr was employed to detect the hydroxyl radicals in the porous water membrane reactor as shown in fig 2c the presence of hydroxyl radicals was detected in the wetted samples and the intensity of each of the four peaks associated with the dmpo oh adduct were significantly enhanced after solar irradiation which was also consistent with the results characterized by the hydroxyl radical indicator four common nicotinic pesticides were used to verify the degradation ability of this porous water membrane reactor for wastewater as shown in fig 3a the fe2o3 nw was sealed by a pdms film to prevent water evaporation and the overall length of the device was 10 cm it is worth noting that fe2o3 nw was superhydrophilic while the pdms used for encapsulation was superhydrophobic fig s5 the treatment throughput of the device was adjusted by changing the angle of the device to the ground the larger the angle the higher the component motion of the source water and the faster the flow rate when the overall length of the device was constant fig 3b showed the average treatment throughput of the porous water membrane reactor at different clamping angles not linear relationship which may be related to the diffusion and siphoning motion of water in the reactor in addition only solar irradiation vertical incidence was considered during the test therefore the change in the interface temperature of the flow reactor could also reflect its absorption of irradiation as shown in fig 3c which is accompanied by an increase in angle and a consequent decrease in interface temperature the temperature could affect both the production of hydrogen peroxide and the activity of the fenton reaction which was one of the most important indicators of the water purification efficiency of the flow membrane reactor fig 3d showed the concentration changes of the four nicotines aqueous solutions under light irradiation after passing through the nw according to different inclination angles it should be noted that the slower the flow rate the greater the decrease in nicotine concentration 30 in the earlier literature it was reported that the spontaneous production of hydrogen peroxide was related to the flow rate the faster the liquid flow the lower the concentration of hydrogen peroxide produced which also corroborated with the tested results after the introduction of fe3 the hydroxyl radicals participate in the in situ fenton reaction at the same time as they are generated to achieve efficient degradation of organic pollutants after the introduction of fe3 the degradation efficiency of nicotines was greatly improved reaching a degradation efficiency of 76 fig 3e as shown in fig s6 the degradation efficiency of 1500 μg l nicotinic aqueous solution was 98 after twice flowing reactor treatment in short increasing the reaction time of the effluent such as adjusting the tilt angle of the device increasing the number of flow reactors or increasing the number of reactions can achieve more efficient water purification in addition to verify that the reduction in nicotines concentration was due to fenton action rather than the adsorption of the non woven a 10 cm fe2o3 nw was employed as a validation model with a 30 angle of the device to the ground fig 4a after the reaction the fe2o3 nw was divided into 10 sections and each section of fe2o3 nw was desorbed by sonication in deionized water to detect the adsorbed nicotines in each section of fe2o3 nw as shown in fig 4b there was no significant change in the content of nicotines in the 10 sections of fe2o3 nw no concentration gradient which proved that the decrease in nicotine concentration was not due to the adsorption of the non woven but to the degradation effect of the fenton reaction fig 3 had explored that the pollutant degradation efficiency was correlated with the reaction time and increasing the number of reactions as well as increasing the number of reactors could lengthen the reaction time corresponding to a higher degradation efficiency to further optimize the purification efficiency of the reactor we investigated the effect of fe2o3 nw length on the degradation of pollutants as mentioned in the previous section the source water flew through the membrane reactor by gravitational potential energy and the siphoning effect of the nw and the length affected the water diffusion rate during the siphoning process as shown in fig 4c the diffusion rate decreased exponentially with the length of the non woven and the longer the non woven the smaller the average treatment flux of the reactor there were two main parameters for evaluating the reactor one was the water purification efficiency and the other was the water purification throughput the degradation efficiency of the four nicotines under light also differed significantly for different device lengths when the device length reached 20 cm the degradation efficiency increased by 33 2 compared to the 10 cm device fig 4d while the corresponding throughput decreased by 104 and the degradation effect of pollutants is far inferior to the effect of the source water passing through the 10 cm reactor twice in short it was necessary to improve the degradation efficiency while also ensuring the treatment throughput of the reactor the x ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis xps of fe2o3 nw before and after the photo fenton reaction was shown in fig 5a and b the peaks at 711 2 ev 813 7 ev and 724 3 ev can be attributed to the presence of fe3 with an associated satellite signal at 719 5 ev the peaks at 709 3 ev and 724 1 ev can identify the signal of fe2 which was in good agreement with the results in previous literature 23 26 the results indicated that fe2o3 maintained its crystal structure during the in situ photo fenton reactions during solar evaporation the o 1 s signals were captured to reveal the variations of the functional group on the fe2o3 surface during the photo fenton reaction it can be found that the degradation process increased the percentage of the o 1 s signal at 532 0 ev which was according to the presence of the oh component this result suggested that the hydroxyl groups on the surface of fe2o3 nw might work as the active sites for oxidation decomposition and hydroxyl radicals and thus enhance the activity of the photo fenton reaction based on the above characterization and test results we proposed a possible mechanism for the fe2o3 nw membrane reactor fig 5c the acidic hydroxyl group r oh a on the surface of fe2o3 nw would dehydrate hydrogen ions in contact with water to form hydrated hydrogen ions leaving the residual oxygen negative ions r o 26 during this process water molecules would come into contact with the fe2o3 surface and electrons may transfer from the water molecules to the solid surface and one possible product would be formed as h2o subsequently the r o group would react with h2o to produce hydroxyl radicals and the re formation of the r oh group finally the hydroxyl radicals naturally undergo a fenton reaction with fe2o3 on the solid surface under the light to investigate the pollutant degradation ability of fe2o3 nw based photo fenton microreactors in more realistic conditions we selected water sources in different natural environments and replaced different pollutants for experiments the source water consisted of nicotines and water collected from east lake in wuhan location longitude 114 395992 latitude 30 575202 and sanjiao lake in wuhan location longitude 114 160696 latitude 30 511629 as shown in fig 6a after the source water was treated twice in the membrane reactor under light the degradation rate of nicotine in it could reach 97 which also means that the reactor is suitable for the treatment of natural water in order to verify the circulation stability of the flow reactor two sets of reactors were operated simultaneously the source water first passed through reactor 1 and then passed through reactor 2 to ensure the best degradation effect with 8 h of light and 16 h of standing every day the degradation efficiency of imidacloprid was maintained above 98 during the 10 day cycle fig 6b in addition to verify the generalizability of the degradation ability of this flowing porous aqueous membrane reactor common contaminants in water antibiotics and dyes were selected as new experimental subjects and tetracycline and methylene blue were used as demonstrations to assess the contaminant degradation ability of the device as shown in fig 6c both tetracycline and methylene blue were able to achieve degradation rates above 95 4 conclusions in summary a fenton aqueous membrane reactor was fabricated based on the porous aqueous thin membrane supported by a fe2o3 modified non woven the device can generate hydroxyl radicals to boost the fenton process by the contact electrification between water and non woven without any catalysts by introducing light irradiation and heat a high degradation efficiency up to 76 was achieved importantly the porous aqueous water membrane acts as three dimensional microfluidics to enhance the throughput of the device we optimize the flow rate of the water in our system to find a balance between contaminant reaction times and water treatment throughput a 4050 l m3 h of throughput was

12538,fenton aops in microreactors offer many significant advantages over the use of conventional reactors for water purification because they enable the more efficient generation of hydroxyl radicals however it is still challenging to apply the fenton aops in microreactors for real applications due to their low water throughput and complex device design for h2o2 dosing here we reported a porous aqueous thin membrane fenton reactor supported by the fe2o3 modified non woven h2o2 was generated by the contact electrification between water and non woven and further enhanced by the introduction of light irradiation and heat the source water flowed through the non woven and thus removed the contained pollutants continuously at the water solid interface additionally the overall size of the device and its tilt angle were also discussed to optimize the membrane reactor purification ability ensuring a significant treatment flux in the flow reactor while maximizing the pollutant degradation efficiency 76 of degradation efficiency and 4050 l m3 h of throughput were achieved based on our porous aqueous membrane fenton reactor our work may offer valuable insight for the future development of high throughput aqueous membrane reactors for environmental purposes keywords photo fenton reaction spontaneously generated h2o2 flowing microreactor water solid interface contaminants degradation data availability the data that has been used is confidential 1 introduction water pollution has been considered to increase with the growing population and industrial development 1 2 in countries lacking universal wastewater treatment and access to clean water the contaminated water becomes a primary risk to ecological environments and human health 3 5 according to world health organization who statistics 6 80 of the rural population still does not have access to basic safe water hundreds of children worldwide die from diarrhea every day due to unsafe drinking water under these circumstances advanced oxidation processes aops have been developed and extensively studied to remove contaminants from water 7 among them fenton related aops are considered as one of the most effective and rapid methods for water purification because they produce hydroxyl radicals oh and have the advantage of simplicity and low cost 8 importantly the generated oh can indiscriminately convert contaminants including novel pesticides 9 parasites 10 and antibiotics 11 into benign substances although various fenton related methods offer advances in batch reactors for water purification the application of these technologies are still under limit due to their requirement of h2o2 dosage long mixing time uneven light distribution in photo fenton reactions and water ph value restrictions 12 in the past decade the use of microreactors for fenton related processes was developed to reduce the required mixing times and the consumption of reagents 13 several reported works showed that the introduction of the microreactor such as the continuous flow fenton aop accelerates the generation of oh and thus increases the pollutant degradation rate compared to that in a conventional batch reactor 14 more recent works have designed the flowing microreactors to realize continuous dosing during water purification to minimize fe3 precipitation shorten the light path and be amenable to a wide range of water ph values 15 16 however much of the microfluidic fenton aops remain react in a microscale chamber which cannot meet the requirement of high throughput fenton aops for the practical water treatment sector additionally in order to realize the continuous addition of h2o2 dosage and the corresponding fenton reactions in the microfluidic chamber more complex microfluidic channel design and microfabrication technology are required which undoubtedly increases the cost of microfluidic aops indeed a critical aspect of the research in the field of microfluidic aops is to develop a high throughput microfluidic reactor with combinations of low cost and easy fabricated to achieve this goal we can divide the above problem into two issues including simplifying the process of hydrogen peroxide addition in the microreactor during the aops and design of high throughput microreactors most recently our previous work has demonstrated that the contact occurring between water and glass substrate in a typical strength microfluidic channel can cause the spontaneous generation of h2o2 17 additionally the production of h2o2 in the microfluidic channel is not from oxidation by atmospheric or dissolved oxygen this finding raises hopes for simplifying the production of h2o2 in the flowing microreactor on the other hand turning a two dimensional microfluidic channel into a three dimensional microfluidic structure is one of the most effective ways to improve the throughput of the microreactors notably porous aqueous membrane supported by microstructures is a kind of fluidics that have a larger reactive volume and the properties of microfluidics 18 in what follows the demonstration is presented that a flowing reactor based on a porous aqueous membrane supported by non woven may drive a photo fenton process for the high throughput pollutant degradation without the dosage of h2o2 herein we designed and fabricated the porous aqueous membrane fenton reactor which is supported by an iron trioxide modified non woven the source water with pollutants continuously flowed through the non woven due to the siphoning effect and its gravity the bulk source water was converted into a three dimensional microfluidic aqueous membrane that acted as the fenton microreactor notably the contact electrification effect between the water and non woven can be attributed to the generation of hydroxyl radicals additionally light irradiation and heat were introduced in our system to further enhance the production of hydroxyl radicals at the water non woven interface which could fulfill the demands of the fenton reaction taking degradation of nicotines 1500 μg l acetamiprid thiacloprid thiamethoxam and imidacloprid as the model a 76 of degradation efficiency was obtained based on the microfluidic fenton aop process in our system additionally we further optimized the degradation efficiency and water treatment throughput by adjusting the angle between the device and the ground a 4050 l m3 h of throughput was achieved which is comparable with previously reported raceway pond water treatment technology this device may offer a promising way to setup a scale up high throughput membrane fenton microreactor without the addition of h2o2 dosage for an eco friendly and sustainable solution to wastewater treatment 2 experimental section 2 1 preparation of

wetted non woven fabrics fully wetted by adhp solution were observed under a microscope and recorded real time fluorescence images then the device was continuously irradiated with an external infrared lamp and temperature of the device gradually raised until the temperature stabilized the dynamic changes of fluorescence during this process were recorded by the microscope in real time the fluorescence images at different time points were processed by image j to obtain the real time average fluorescence absorption intensity 2 6 quantification of h2o2 production the concentration of h2o2 on the fe2o3 nw was determined by the chromogenic reaction of potassium titanium oxalate pto a 0 3 m pto k2tio c2o4 2 h2o 99 0 sigma aldrich aqueous solution was prepared for the chromogenic reaction to draw a standard curve 200 μl of h2o2 standard solutions with a concentration of 0 mg l 1 to 5 mg l 1 were fully reacted with 200 μl of pto solution and 300 μl of the mixed solutions were used to obtain the absorbance of the sample from 250 nm to 600 nm using a uv visible spectrometer shimadzu uv 2550 the absorbances of all samples at 400 nm were fitted to a standard curve of h2o2 the liquids on fe2o3 nws under different tilt angles were taken out and added with an equal volume of pto solution after the full reaction the absorbances at 400 nm were measured and brought into the standard curve of h2o2 and the concentration at this time was calculated 2 7 nicotines degradation measurements the initial concentration of the four nicotines imidacloprid acetamiprid thiamethoxam and nitenpyram were 1500 μg l and the volume were 100 ml the flow reactor was placed at a certain inclination angle and the sample flew through the reactor by gravity and was collected at the outlet degradation experiments were also carried out under light irradiation and dark condition respectively all results were repeated three times the pesticide concentrations were determined using an

multifunctional imaging electron spectrometer thermo escalab 250xi using monochromated al ka radiation 1486 6 ev 3 results and discussion to demonstrate this approach we used a pall patch as a heat source to control the temperature of the porous aqueous membrane reactor which was sealed with a 50 μm pdms film to avoid evaporation to test whether h2o2 can be spontaneously generated in the aqueous membrane supported by non woven a water soluble h2o2 sensitive fluorescent probe 10 acetyl 3 7 dihydroxyphenoxazine adhp was used to respond selectively to h2o2 to liberate fluorescein 20 21 as shown in fig 1a adhp was added to the bulk water then the fluorescence intensity of h2o2 in the porous aqueous membrane reactor was observed and analyzed in real time with an ortho fluorescence microscope along with the overall temperature change of the reactor fig s2 displays the typical morphology of as prepared fe2o3 nanoparticles on non woven fe2o3 nw the fibers of the non woven were disordered and fe2o3 nanoparticles were uniformly grown on the fibers surface the existence of fe2o3 nanoparticles were confirmed by xrd and corresponding tem measurement as shown in figs s3 s4 as shown in fig 1b the surface fluorescence of fe2o3 nw progressively increased with the rise of temperature and the fluorescence intensity showed a logarithmic growth relationship with temperature then gradually saturated fig 1c the fluorescence intensity would reflect the concentration change of h2o2 which indicated that the spontaneous generation of h2o2 was an endothermic reaction in addition this process of h2o2 spontaneous generation was continuous and stable as shown in fig 1d and the fluorescence intensity on the interface under different temperature conditions hardly changed significantly in 3 h the production of h2o2 was further confirmed by assaying the cleavage of 4 carboxyphenylboronic acid by h2o2 based on a mass spectrometer measurement according to the previous literature 20 it can be observed that the peak at 165 03 and 137 02 m z from the spectrum correspond to the presence of 4 carboxyphenylboronic acid and 4 hydroxybenzoic acid shown in fig 1e these results revealed the fact

12539,a continuous flow mode fixed bed reactor fbr was built for the efficient degradation of triazine herbicides ths in wastewater in which mos2 sio2 composites were used as a co catalyst for the fe2 activated persulfate ps oxidation the degradation activity of this mos2 sio2 ps fe2 fbr was evaluated by choosing atrazine atz as a model pollutant and operation conditions were systematically optimized including the amount of oxidant fe2 concentration initial ph flow rate and coexisting interferences the degradation results showed that mos2 sio2 could greatly improve the degradation efficiency and over 97 1 of atz could be degraded under the optimized conditions hydraulic residence time of 24 s in this reaction system sulfate radicals and hydroxyl radicals played the major roles over 80 in the degradation process continuous treatment of 1400 ml wastewater could be achieved with 1 0 g mos2 sio2 composite with a degradation efficiency maintained above 80 four tested ths of atz simazine ametryn and prometryn could be efficiently degraded furthermore the removal rate of atz in pond water reached 77 6 and the mineralization rate was about 51 indicating this mos2 sio2 ps fe2

introduction triazine herbicides ths are widely used for the control of broadleaf and grassy weeds in agricultural fields 1 2 and are often detected in natural waters due to their frequent usage high persistence and low biodegradability 3 5 the pollution of natural water bodies by ths and their metabolites have been worldwide reported 6 some of which may cause cancer and endocrine disruption at trace levels e g atrazine atz a typical th 7 8 moreover as ths can band to soil matrix they are stable in the natural environment for years after application 9 although ths have been banned in the united states and europe 10 they are still produced and used in china 11 to limit the release of ths from various sources it is essential to establish effective methods for the degradation of ths in wastewater for the degradation of organic pollutants advanced oxidation processes aops showed great potential for their high mineralization efficiency of active species such as oh and so4 12 generally so4 is more selective over oh against the organic substances in the electron transfer process and also has a longer half life 13 14 moreover so4 also has a higher redox potential and wider reaction ph range than oh 15 therefore aops based on so4 are considered more promising for the degradation of persistent organic matters typically persulfates can be activated by heat 16 17 ultrasound 18 transition metals 19 22 ultraviolet light 23 24 and bases 25 26 to produce the active so4 among these technologies fe2 activated persulfate is one of the most used aops technologies due to its simplicity low toxicity and cost effectiveness however in the primary stage fe2 is easily oxidized to fe3 leading to a decreased activation efficiency so it is essential to investigate effective methods to promote the conversion of fe3 to fe2 27 transition metal sulfides have been found to have better electrical conductivity and richer redox sites than typical transition metal oxides and they can also enhance the conversion efficiency of fe3 to fe2 by exposing the active sites of the metal through unsaturated sulfur atoms on the surface 28 meanwhile most transition metal sulfate based catalysts show high stability and reproducibility in aops 28 it was observed that molybdenum based materials were less toxic than other transition metals and showed a relatively lower impact on the environment if metal dissolution occurred during reactions 29 lately a lot of attention were paid to mos2 for its excellent performance in the field of advanced oxidation in environmental remediation for instance mos2 and fe2 were used to co activate peroxymonosulfate pms which could significantly improve the finasteride degradation efficiency over conventional fe2 pms system as mos2 could promote the fe2 fe3 circulation 30 further studies also confirmed that ps could be activated by mos2 fe2 to produce so4 for efficient degradation of carbamazepine 31 moreover mos2 carrier composites such as biochar mos2 contained a much larger number of catalytic active sites over pure mos2 and could remarkably improve the removal efficiency of tetracycline 32 to improve the degradation efficiency and also recycle the catalyst mos2 was loaded onto carrier materials e g sponge and the reaction could be performed in continuous mode 33 with which degradation efficiency could be improved and the mos2 carrier composites could be reused for the carrier material sio2 showed high stability and low cost and the nano sized mos2 could be tightly deposited on the surface of sio2 through the hydrothermal reaction 34 which was important for the continuous flow in our previous work mos2 sio2 was prepared via a simple one pot approach and packed for a fixed bed reactor fbr which could efficiently degrade sulfonamides in fe2 h2o2 system 34 in fbr the difficulty in material recycling and secondary contamination could be overcome and high degradation efficiency could be achieved due to the high solid to liquid ratio and mass transfer efficiency 35 as so4 could provide higher degradation capability than oh we hypothesized that higher degradation capability could be achieved in mos2 fe2 ps system therefore mos2 sio2 fbr was applied in fe2 ps oxidation system for the degradation of ths after systematic investigation of the reaction conditions efficient degradation of ths was achieved

our previous work 34 in detail sodium molybdate tetrahydrate 0 535 g and thioacetamide 0 385 g were added to 60 ml water after stirring for 30 min 3 g sio2 was added and stirred for another 10 min and then the mixture was transferred to a ptfe liner and heated to 200 c for 12 h in an autoclave after cooling down to room temperature the material named as mos2 sio2 was collected and washed with

3 1 adsorption properties of mos2 sio2 composites the adsorption effect is important in the removal of pollutants and increasing the degradation efficiency from fig 1 pristine sio2 0 6 g exhibited very limited adsorption capacity as the breakthrough of atz was observed at the very beginning after loading with mos2 on sio2 the adsorption capacity increased dramatically and the breakthrough volume reached about 70 ml 0 6 g mos2 sio2 and nearly 200 ml sample was required to reach an adsorption desorption equilibrium with the increase of mos2 sio2 amount 1 0 g both the breakthrough and equilibration volume increased to about 120 ml and 330 ml respectively from the breakthrough curve the adsorption capacity of the mos2 sio2 against atz was calculated as 2 5 mg g 3 2 catalytic properties of mos2 sio2 composites in fbr firstly the degradation performances against atz in mos2 sio2 h2o2 fe2 and mos2 sio2 ps fe2 fbrs were compared as shown in fig 2 under the same conditions the degradation efficiency of atz in mos2 sio2 h2o2 fe2 fbr only reached 24 4 and 45 0 at the h2o2 concentration of 5 mm and 10 mm respectively while a degradation efficiency of 92 0 was achieved in mos2 sio2 ps fe2 fbr at a ps concentration of 5 mm confirming that the mos2 sio2 ps fe2 fbr was more efficient in the degradation of atz 36 furthermore in sio2 ps fe2 and mos2 sio2 ps fbrs the degradation rate of only 28 and 33 were observed for atz respectively fig 3 in contrast the degradation rate in the mos2 sio2 ps fe2 fbr was significantly increased to 92 0 which fully demonstrated the critical contribution of mos2 sio2 as a co catalyst in the degradation process kinetic analysis showed that the degradation of the atz in fbr was consistent with a quasi secondary kinetic model with the fitting correlation coefficients of 0 925 0 994 table 1 the reaction constant rate in mos2 sio2 ps fe2 system was over one order higher than sio2 ps fe2 and mos2 sio2 ps systems in the reaction fe2 firstly activated s2o8 2 to produce so4 while itself was oxidized to fe3 eq 1 k 30 m 1 s 1 37 for the regeneration of fe2 it was speculated that the unsaturated s atoms on the surface of mos2 could trap protons to form h2s while exposing mo4 and thus accelerate the fe3 fe2 cycle eqs 2 and 3 30 nevertheless since mo6 could not be easily reduced to mo4 31 mos2 alone was not sufficient to activate ps to produce enough reactive radicals to sustain the degradation process importantly the degradation rate of atz could be remarkably enhanced in the mos2 sio2 ps fe2 fbr with the co catalyze of mos2 sio2 composites 1 fe 2 s 2 o 8 2 fe 3 so 4 so 4 2 2 mos 2 4 h mo 4 2 h 2 s 3 mo 4 2 fe 3 mo 6 2 fe 2 for the mos2 sio2 composites with different mos2 loading content mass percentage higher mos2 content could accelerate the reaction rate table 1 fig s2 the degradation efficiency was also increased accordingly from 86 2 to 92 0 with mos2 content ascending from 5 8 to 11 0 in which the number of reactive sites for the regeneration of fe3 from fe2 was increased however when further increasing the mos2 loading to 27 0 the degradation efficiency was only 81 5 which might be owing to the depletion of the so4 by excess mo4 in the system 38 3 3 effect of reaction conditions on atz degradation to improve the degradation efficiency important parameters were investigated including the concentrations of ps fe2 and atz ph mos2 content in mos2 sio2 flow rate and bed height h all the experimental details could be found in supporting information ps was the source of active radicals as shown in fig 4a with the increase of ps from 2 mm to 10 mm the reaction rate increased from 0 002 m 1 min 1 to 0 013 m 1 min 1 table s1 and the degradation rate increased from 71 1 to 96 0 however further increasing of ps to 20 mm though the reaction rate increased to 0 049 m 1 min 1 table s1 the degradation rate only increased by 0 4 indicating that higher ps concentration showed limited improvement as shown in eq 4 excessive ps could react with so4 to generate less reactive s2o8 which decreased the utilization rate of so4 in the degradation process 39 4 s 2 o 8 2 so 4 s 2 o 8 so 4 2 fe2 concentration was responsible for the activation of ps to generate radicals as the concentration of fe2 increased from 18 μm to 180 μm the reaction rate of the system increased from 0 002 m 1 min 1 to 0 006 m 1 min 1 table s2 and the degradation efficiency also increased remarkably from 72 7 to 92 4 fig 4b demonstrating that the ascending of fe2 in the system could accelerate the reaction rate however the degradation efficiency could not be improved by much higher fe2 concentration e g 180 and 360 μm as excess fe2 also depleted the active radicals and inhibited the degradation of the pollutants 40 as fe3 could be regenerated from fe2 with the presence of mos2 compared with conventional fenton like reaction systems a much lower concentration of fe2 was sufficient in mos2 sio2 ps fe2 fbr for example in a fe2 o2 dtn system to reach a complete degradation of 1 μm atz within 5 min 200 μm fe2 was required 41 in a fes2 ps system fes of 4 2 mm was used for the degradation of 20 mg l atz within 45 min 42 the initial ph was investigated from 3 to 7 3 4 5 6 and 7 as shown in fig 4c when the initial ph increased from 3 to 6 the reaction rate and the atz degradation rate were kept at similar levels table s3 and fig s3 a drop in the degradation rate was observed at ph 2 probably due to the quenching of so4 and ho from h under strongly acidic conditions 43 though a slight decrease in reaction rate 0 002 m 1 min 1 was observed at ph 7 table s3 a degradation efficiency of 83 4 was achieved indicating that the mos2 sio2 ps fe2 fbr could be operated over a wide ph range ph 3 7 however little degradation of atz at ph 8 was observed fig s4 which was owing to the strong binding of s in mos2 under basic conditions preventing the formation of mo4 and thus preventing the fe2 fe3 cycle 31 furthermore mos2 contained a negative charge at high ph which made it exclusive to the oxidant thus hindering the production of active species 27 the degradation efficiency was affected by initial atz concentrations as atz increased from 10 mg l to 50 mg l the reaction rate decreased from 0 010 m 1 min 1 to 0 002 m 1 min 1 table s4 and the degradation efficiency decreased from 89 1 to 77 7 fig 4d therefore when a high concentration of targets was presented in water the degradation rate should be closely monitored in the fbr the degradation efficiency strongly relied on the hrt which was dependent on the flow rate and the bed height the solid to liquid ratio in the fbr was about 1 5 0 6 g 0 4 ml and the residence time of the liquid was about 24 s at a flow rate of 1 0 ml min in fig 4e the degradation efficiency increased from 77 4 to 92 0 when the flow rate was lowered from 2 0 to 1 0 ml min and further increased to 96 5 at 0 5 ml min the reaction rate of atz at a flow rate of 0 5 ml min 0 021 m 1 min 1 was approximately 20 times higher than that at 2 0 ml min 0 002 m 1 min 1 table s5 a lower flow rate increased the hrt which provided higher possibilities for the active radicals to contact the pollutants and increase the degradation efficiency besides as shown in fig 4f the increase of h from 2 0 cm to 7 0 cm was accompanied by an increase in hrt by approximately 60 s so the reaction rate increased about 2 folds from 0 006 m 1 min 1 to 0 013 m 1 min 1 and the degradation efficiency increased to 97 7 the above results suggest that by changing either the flow rate or the h a desirable degradation efficiency could be achieved which could be very effective in dealing with pollutants at high concentrations in terms of both degradation efficiency and operation cost h of 3 5 cm ps of 5 mm fe2 of 72 μm initial ph of 4 and flow rate of 1 ml min were chosen for further experiment 3 4 identification of active species to identify the active species responsible for the degradation in this mos2 sio2 ps fe2 fbr quenchers of tert butyl alcohol tba methanol meoh l histidine and p benzoquinone bq were added to the system 44 46 the experimental process of quenching was calculated to fit the pseudo second order models and its reaction rate constants were listed in table s7 since the reaction rate constant of tba with oh 3 8 to 7 6 108 m 1 s 1 was much higher than that with so4 4 to 9 4 105 m 1 s 1 tba was used as the quencher of oh as shown in fig s4 and table s8 with the presence of tba 500 mm in the system the reaction rate dropped from 6 05 10 3 to 2 25 10 3 m 1 min 1 and the degradation efficiency decreased from 92 0 without quencher to 40 5 indicating the existence of oh as meoh was a quencher for both so4 and oh meoh was used to identify the existence of so4 with the addition of meoh 500 mm the reaction rate constant was reduced to 1 17 10 3 m 1 min 1 and degradation efficiency decreased by 73 5 indicating so4 also existed in the system as 18 5 of atz was degraded with the presence of meoh there should be some other active spices in the system probably singlet oxygen 1o2 and superoxide radicals o2 the results of quenching experimental using bq 10 mm a quencher for so4 oh and o2 showed that there was little inhibition effect on the degradation efficiency indicating the generation of o2 was negligible in the system meanwhile l histidine 10 mm a quencher for so4 oh and 1o2 provided higher inhibition on the degradation of atz reaction rate dropped to 1 25 10 3 m 1 min 1 indicating the existence 1o2 in the system these results demonstrated that both so4 and oh played the major roles in the degradation of atz in which so4 contributed more than oh while 1o2 played a minor role 3 5 effects of interferences on the degradation of atz coexisting substances such as cl h2po4 no3 hco3 co3 2 and humic acids ha exist widely in real wastewater which might interfere the degradation process of the pollutants as shown in fig 5a it was found that there was an inhibitory effect of cl on the degradation process which was due to the reaction of cl with so4 and oh producing less reactive species of cl cloh and cl2 eqs 5 8 45 47 49 h2po4 also inhibited the degradation of atz as it could deplete the oh eq 9 fig 5b 45 47 it was reported that no3 could deplete so4 eq 10 45 but in this mos2 sio2 ps fe2 fbr the inhibitory effect was very limited and the degradation efficiency of atz was around 85 at both 1 mm and 10 mm of no3 fig 5c therefore the concentration of cl h2po4 should be monitored when dealing with real wastewater using this reaction system in addition it was reported that hco3 co3 2 and humic acid ha also react with free radicals e g so4 45 49 so the effects of hco3 co3 2 and ha on degradation efficiency were also evaluated the results showed that the degradation efficiencies were decreased to about 30 and 20 by hco3 1 mm and co3 2 1 mm respectively indicating both hco3 and co3 2 could stifle the degradation process for ha 1 mm the degradation efficiency decreased to about 74 indicating there was moderate inhibition from natural macromolecules on the degradation process 5 cl so 4 cl so 4 2 6 oh cl cloh 7 cloh oh cl 8 cl cl cl 2 9 h 2 po 4 oh h 2 po 4 oh 10 no 3 so 4 no 3 so 4 2 3 6 degradation of multiple ths besides atz three more commonly used ths of simazine ametryn and prometryn were tested in fbr as shown in fig 6 all these 4 targets were completely degraded which proved the excellent degradation capacity against ths considering the coexistence of multiple classes of pollutants in real wastewater typical pollutants from antibiotics resin precursors preservatives and dyes were selected as targets as shown in fig s5 complete degradation 100 of sulfisoxazole six and rhodamine b rhb and moderate degradation of 2 4 dichlorophenol 2 4 dcp 53 8 and benzoic acid ba 37 8 were achieved these results indicated the mos2 sio2 ps fe2 fbr could be applied in the treatment of various organic pollutants in wastewater 3 7 durability of the mos2 sio2 fbr to assess the durability of the material continuous atz degradation was carried out using the mos2 sio2 ps fe2 fbrs as shown in fig 7 the durability of the fbrs relied on the mos2 loading amount in mos2 sio2 composites for mos2 sio2 composites 600 mg with 5 8 mos2 only 580 ml water could be treated with a degradation efficiency of 80 for mos2 sio2 composites with 11 0 and 27 0 mos2 1400 ml and 1560 ml could be treated with a degradation efficiency of over 80 respectively the increase of mos2 loading delayed the depletion of mo in the system thus improving the durability of the material the mos2 sio2 ps fe2 fbr was also tested for a longer period at a flow rate of 0 5 ml min and h of 14 cm the system could be operated continuously for 7 5 d with 100 removal of atz and then the degradation efficiency started to decrease to 91 at 8 5 d and to 73 at 9 d the decreased degradation efficiency was mainly owing to the depletion of mos2 which was unable to sustain the regeneration of fe2 from fe3 therefore the mos2 sio2 ps fe2 fbr could continuously treat 6120 ml of wastewater with a degradation efficiency above 90 these results confirmed the high durability of this mos2 sio2 ps fe2 fbr in the continuous treatment of organic wastewater 3 8 application of mos2 sio2 fbr in real water treatment the degradation of atz in pond water after filtration toc 35 3 mg l was carried out using the mos2 sio2 ps fe2 fbr without adsorption saturation to assess the effect of the real water matrix on degradation performance both the atz concentration and the total organic carbon toc in the treated water were determined to verify the degree of mineralization of the pollutants as shown in fig 8 compare to the atz solution a lower removal rate of 78 6 was observed for pond water which was probably due to the existence of cl in water the salinity is 0 6 0 7 as the campus is closed to the sea the toc removal rate of 51 4 was reached at the same time indicating that mos2 sio2 ps fe2 fbr could be applied in a complex water matrix and over half of the organic pollutants could be mineralized into harmless co2 and h2o it should be noted that a higher removal efficiency of atz toc could be achieved by simply decreasing the flow rate 4 conclusion effective degradation of ths in water was achieved by mos2 sio2 ps fe2 fbr in continuous mode in which mos2 sio2 could greatly enhance the generation of active species of so4 and oh without materials recycling the degradation process in the fbr fitted well with the quasi secondary kinetic model a degradation of over 97 could be achieved for the test 4 ths atz simazine ametryn and prometryn and could be operated at a wide ph range of ph 3 7 for the co existing substances no3 showed little impact on the degradation efficiency but cl h2po4 hco3 and co3 2 would inhibit the degradation about 1400 ml of water could be continuously treated by 1 0 g mos2 sio2 composite over 27 h without any clogging moreover long term continuous operation 8 5 days with high degradation efficiency over 91 proved the high stability and durability of this fbr the effectiveness in the treatment of real water and degradation of multi class pollutants demonstrated the wide potential application prospects of this mos2

3 1 adsorption properties of mos2 sio2 composites the adsorption effect is important in the removal of pollutants and increasing the degradation efficiency from fig 1 pristine sio2 0 6 g exhibited very limited adsorption capacity as the breakthrough of atz was observed at the very beginning after loading with mos2 on sio2 the adsorption capacity increased dramatically and the breakthrough volume reached about 70 ml 0 6 g mos2 sio2 and nearly 200 ml sample was required to reach an adsorption desorption equilibrium with the increase of mos2 sio2 amount 1 0 g both the breakthrough and equilibration volume increased to about 120 ml and 330 ml respectively from the breakthrough curve the adsorption capacity of the mos2 sio2 against atz was calculated as 2 5 mg g 3 2 catalytic properties of mos2 sio2 composites in fbr firstly the degradation performances against atz in mos2 sio2 h2o2 fe2 and mos2 sio2 ps fe2 fbrs were compared as shown in fig 2 under the same conditions the degradation efficiency of atz in mos2 sio2 h2o2 fe2 fbr only reached 24 4 and 45 0 at the h2o2 concentration of 5 mm and 10 mm respectively while a degradation efficiency of 92 0 was achieved in mos2 sio2 ps fe2 fbr at a ps concentration of 5 mm confirming that the mos2 sio2 ps fe2 fbr was more efficient in the degradation of atz 36 furthermore in sio2 ps fe2 and mos2 sio2 ps fbrs the degradation rate of only 28 and 33 were observed for atz respectively fig 3 in contrast the degradation rate in the mos2 sio2 ps fe2 fbr was significantly increased to 92 0 which fully demonstrated the critical contribution of mos2 sio2 as a co catalyst in the degradation process kinetic analysis showed that the degradation of the atz in fbr was consistent with a quasi secondary kinetic model with the fitting correlation coefficients of 0 925 0 994 table 1 the reaction constant rate in mos2 sio2 ps fe2 system was over one order higher than sio2 ps fe2 and mos2 sio2 ps systems in the reaction fe2 firstly activated s2o8 2 to produce so4 while itself was oxidized to fe3 eq 1 k 30 m 1 s 1 37 for the regeneration of fe2 it was speculated that the unsaturated s atoms on the surface of mos2 could trap protons to form h2s while exposing mo4 and thus accelerate the fe3 fe2 cycle eqs 2 and 3 30 nevertheless since mo6 could not be easily reduced to mo4 31 mos2 alone was not sufficient to activate ps to produce enough reactive radicals to sustain the degradation process importantly the degradation rate of atz could be remarkably enhanced in the mos2 sio2 ps fe2 fbr with the co catalyze of mos2 sio2 composites 1 fe 2 s 2 o 8 2 fe 3 so 4 so 4 2 2 mos 2 4 h mo 4 2 h 2 s 3 mo 4 2 fe 3 mo 6 2 fe 2 for the mos2 sio2 composites with different mos2 loading content mass percentage higher mos2 content could accelerate the reaction rate table 1 fig s2 the degradation efficiency was also increased accordingly from 86 2 to 92 0 with mos2 content ascending from 5 8 to 11 0 in which the number of reactive sites for the regeneration of fe3 from fe2 was increased however when further increasing the mos2 loading to 27 0 the degradation efficiency was only 81 5 which might be owing to the depletion of the so4 by excess mo4 in the system 38 3 3 effect of reaction conditions on atz degradation to improve the degradation efficiency important parameters were investigated including the concentrations of ps fe2 and atz ph mos2 content in mos2 sio2 flow rate and bed height h all the experimental details could be found in supporting information ps was the source of active radicals as shown in fig 4a with the increase of ps from 2 mm to 10 mm the reaction rate increased from 0 002 m 1 min 1 to 0 013 m 1 min 1 table s1 and the degradation rate increased from 71 1 to 96 0 however further increasing of ps to 20 mm though the reaction rate increased to 0 049 m 1 min 1 table s1 the degradation rate only increased by 0 4 indicating that higher ps concentration showed limited improvement as shown in eq 4 excessive ps could react with so4 to generate less reactive s2o8 which decreased the utilization rate of so4 in the degradation process 39 4 s 2 o 8 2 so 4 s 2 o 8 so 4 2 fe2 concentration was responsible for the activation of ps to generate radicals as the concentration of fe2 increased from 18 μm to 180 μm the reaction rate of the system increased from 0 002 m 1 min 1 to 0 006 m 1 min 1 table s2 and the degradation efficiency also increased remarkably from 72 7 to 92 4 fig 4b demonstrating that the ascending of fe2 in the system could accelerate the reaction rate however the degradation efficiency could not be improved by much higher fe2 concentration e g 180 and 360 μm as excess fe2 also depleted the active radicals and inhibited the degradation of the pollutants 40 as fe3 could be regenerated from fe2 with the presence of mos2 compared with conventional fenton like reaction systems a much lower concentration of fe2 was sufficient in mos2 sio2 ps fe2 fbr for example in a fe2 o2 dtn system to reach a complete degradation of 1 μm atz within 5 min 200 μm fe2 was required 41 in a fes2 ps system fes of 4 2 mm was used for the degradation of 20 mg l atz within 45 min 42 the initial ph was investigated from 3 to 7 3 4 5 6 and 7 as shown in fig 4c when the initial ph increased from 3 to 6 the reaction rate and the atz degradation rate were kept at similar levels table s3 and fig s3 a drop in the degradation rate was observed at ph 2 probably due to the quenching of so4 and ho from h under strongly acidic conditions 43 though a slight decrease in reaction rate 0 002 m 1 min 1 was observed at ph 7 table s3 a degradation efficiency of 83 4 was achieved indicating that the mos2 sio2 ps fe2 fbr could be operated over a wide ph range ph 3 7 however little degradation of atz at ph 8 was observed fig s4 which was owing to the strong binding of s in mos2 under basic conditions preventing the formation of mo4 and thus preventing the fe2 fe3 cycle 31 furthermore mos2 contained a negative charge at high ph which made it exclusive to the oxidant thus hindering the production of active species 27 the degradation efficiency was affected by initial atz concentrations as atz increased from 10 mg l to 50 mg l the reaction rate decreased from 0 010 m 1 min 1 to 0 002 m 1 min 1 table s4 and the degradation efficiency decreased from 89 1 to 77 7 fig 4d therefore when a high concentration of targets was presented in water the degradation rate should be closely monitored in the fbr the degradation efficiency strongly relied on the hrt which was dependent on the flow rate and the bed height the solid to liquid ratio in the fbr was about 1 5 0 6 g 0 4 ml and the residence time of the liquid was about 24 s at a flow rate of 1 0 ml min in fig 4e the degradation efficiency increased from 77 4 to 92 0 when the flow rate was lowered from 2 0 to 1 0 ml min and further increased to 96 5 at 0 5 ml min the reaction rate of atz at a flow rate of 0 5 ml min 0 021 m 1 min 1 was approximately 20 times higher than that at 2 0 ml min 0 002 m 1 min 1 table s5 a lower flow rate increased the hrt which provided higher possibilities for the active radicals to contact the pollutants and increase the degradation efficiency besides as shown in fig 4f the increase of h from 2 0 cm to 7 0 cm was accompanied by an increase in hrt by approximately 60 s so the reaction rate increased about 2 folds from 0 006 m 1 min 1 to 0 013 m 1 min 1 and the degradation efficiency increased to 97 7 the above results suggest that by changing either the flow rate or the h a desirable degradation efficiency could be achieved which could be very effective in dealing with pollutants at high concentrations in terms of both degradation efficiency and operation cost h of 3 5 cm ps of 5 mm fe2 of 72 μm initial ph of 4 and flow rate of 1 ml min were chosen for further experiment 3 4 identification of active species to identify the active species responsible for the degradation in this mos2 sio2 ps fe2 fbr quenchers of tert butyl alcohol tba methanol meoh l histidine and p benzoquinone bq were added to the system 44 46 the experimental process of quenching was calculated to fit the pseudo second order models and its reaction rate constants were listed in table s7 since the reaction rate constant of tba with oh 3 8 to 7 6 108 m 1 s 1 was much higher than that with so4 4 to 9 4 105 m 1 s 1 tba was used as the quencher of oh as shown in fig s4 and table s8 with the presence of tba 500 mm in the system the reaction rate dropped from 6 05 10 3 to 2 25 10 3 m 1 min 1 and the degradation efficiency decreased from 92 0 without quencher to 40 5 indicating the existence of oh as meoh was a quencher for both so4 and oh meoh was used to identify the existence of so4 with the addition of meoh 500 mm the reaction rate constant was reduced to 1 17 10 3 m 1 min 1 and degradation efficiency decreased by 73 5 indicating so4 also existed in the system as 18 5 of atz was degraded with the presence of meoh there should be some other active spices in the system probably singlet oxygen 1o2 and superoxide radicals o2 the results of quenching experimental using bq 10 mm a quencher for so4 oh and o2 showed that there was little inhibition effect on the degradation efficiency indicating the generation of o2 was negligible in the system meanwhile l histidine 10 mm a quencher for so4 oh and 1o2 provided higher inhibition on the degradation of atz reaction rate dropped to 1 25 10 3 m 1 min 1 indicating the existence 1o2 in the system these results demonstrated that both so4 and oh played the major roles in the degradation of atz in which so4 contributed more than oh while 1o2 played a minor role 3 5 effects of interferences on the degradation of atz coexisting substances such as cl h2po4 no3 hco3 co3 2 and humic acids ha exist widely in real wastewater which might interfere the degradation process of the pollutants as shown in fig 5a it was found that there was an inhibitory effect of cl on the degradation process which was due to the reaction of cl with so4 and oh producing less reactive species of cl cloh and cl2 eqs 5 8 45 47 49 h2po4 also inhibited the degradation of atz as it could deplete the oh eq 9 fig 5b 45 47 it was reported that no3 could deplete so4 eq 10 45 but in this mos2 sio2 ps fe2 fbr the inhibitory effect was very limited and the degradation efficiency of atz was around 85 at both 1 mm and 10 mm of no3 fig 5c therefore the concentration of cl h2po4 should be monitored when dealing with real wastewater using this reaction system in addition it was reported that hco3 co3 2 and humic acid ha also react with free radicals e g so4 45 49 so the effects of hco3 co3 2 and ha on degradation efficiency were also evaluated the results showed that the degradation efficiencies were decreased to about 30 and 20 by hco3 1 mm and co3 2 1 mm respectively indicating both hco3 and co3 2 could stifle the degradation process for ha 1 mm the degradation efficiency decreased to about 74 indicating there was moderate inhibition from natural macromolecules on the degradation process 5 cl so 4 cl so 4 2 6 oh cl cloh 7 cloh oh cl 8 cl cl cl 2 9 h 2 po 4 oh h 2 po 4 oh 10 no 3 so 4 no 3 so 4 2 3 6 degradation of multiple ths besides atz three more commonly used ths of simazine ametryn and prometryn were tested in fbr as shown in fig 6 all these 4 targets were completely degraded which proved the excellent degradation capacity against ths considering the coexistence of multiple classes of pollutants in real wastewater typical pollutants from antibiotics resin precursors preservatives and dyes were selected as targets as shown in fig s5 complete degradation 100 of sulfisoxazole six and rhodamine b rhb and moderate degradation of 2 4 dichlorophenol 2 4 dcp 53 8 and benzoic acid ba 37 8 were achieved these results indicated the mos2 sio2 ps fe2 fbr could be applied in the treatment of various organic pollutants in wastewater 3 7 durability of the mos2 sio2 fbr to assess the durability of the material continuous atz degradation was carried out using the mos2 sio2 ps fe2 fbrs as shown in fig 7 the durability of the fbrs relied on the mos2 loading amount in mos2 sio2 composites for mos2 sio2 composites 600 mg with 5 8 mos2 only 580 ml water could be treated with a degradation efficiency of 80 for mos2 sio2 composites with 11 0 and 27 0 mos2 1400 ml and 1560 ml could be treated with a degradation efficiency of over 80 respectively the increase of mos2 loading delayed the depletion of mo in the system thus improving the durability of the material the mos2 sio2 ps fe2 fbr was also tested for a longer period at a flow rate of 0 5 ml min and h of 14 cm the system could be operated continuously for 7 5 d with 100 removal of atz and then the degradation efficiency started to decrease to 91 at 8 5 d and to 73 at 9 d the decreased degradation efficiency was mainly owing to the depletion of mos2 which was unable to sustain the regeneration of fe2 from fe3 therefore the mos2 sio2 ps fe2 fbr could continuously treat 6120 ml of wastewater with a degradation efficiency above 90 these results confirmed the high durability of this mos2 sio2 ps fe2 fbr in the continuous treatment of organic wastewater 3 8 application of mos2 sio2 fbr in real water treatment the degradation of atz in pond water after filtration toc 35 3 mg l was carried out using the mos2 sio2 ps fe2 fbr without adsorption saturation to assess the effect of the real water matrix on degradation performance both the atz concentration and the total organic carbon toc in the treated water were determined to verify the degree of mineralization of the pollutants as shown in fig 8 compare to the atz solution a lower removal rate of 78 6 was observed for pond water which was probably due to the existence of cl in water the salinity is 0 6 0 7 as the campus is closed to the sea the toc removal rate of 51 4 was reached at the same time indicating that mos2 sio2 ps fe2 fbr could be applied in a complex water matrix and over half of the organic pollutants could be mineralized into harmless co2 and h2o it should be noted that a higher removal efficiency of atz toc could be achieved by simply decreasing the flow rate 4 conclusion effective degradation of ths in water was achieved by mos2 sio2 ps fe2 fbr in continuous mode in which mos2 sio2 could greatly enhance the generation of active species of so4 and oh without materials recycling the degradation process in the fbr fitted well with the quasi secondary kinetic model a degradation of over 97 could be achieved for the test 4 ths atz simazine ametryn and prometryn and could be operated at a wide ph range of ph 3 7 for the co existing substances no3 showed little impact on the degradation efficiency but cl h2po4 hco3 and co3 2 would inhibit the degradation about 1400 ml of water could be continuously treated by 1 0 g mos2 sio2 composite over 27 h without any clogging moreover long term continuous operation 8 5 days with high degradation efficiency over 91 proved the high stability and durability of this fbr the effectiveness in the treatment of real water and degradation of multi class pollutants demonstrated the wide potential application prospects of this mos2 sio2 ps fe2 fbr in the field of wastewater treatment declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no conflict of interest acknowledgments financial supports from the national
