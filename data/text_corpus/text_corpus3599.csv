engineering systems aubry et al 2013 bhatnagar and sillanpää 2017 guo and ma 2006 matilainen et al 2010 sillanpää 2014 as a very important class of nom humic substance e g humic acid is ubiquitous in soil and aquatic ecosystems in the form of heterogeneous and macromolecular mixture benedetti et al 1996 kögel knabner 2002 humic substance is typically comprised of aliphatic and aromatic moieties with multiple functional groups e g oh cooh which enables the adsorption of humic substance onto solids such as soil minerals nanoparticles and membranes via different interaction mechanisms thereby altering the interfacial characteristics and functionalities of these solid materials deonarine et al 2011 naidu et al 2015 sutton and sposito 2005 for example due to the complex interactions with clay minerals humic substance can reside in the soil for long time and further influence the environmental geochemistry including carbon cycling nutrient uptake and transport and contaminant fate and transport sutton and sposito 2005 in addition the adsorption of humic substance on colloidal nanoparticles has a critical influence on the aggregation deposition and transformation processes of natural and engineered nanoparticles deonarine et al 2011 kumpulainen et al 2008 loosli et al 2013 in terms of membrane separation humic substance could easily adhere to membrane surfaces which results in the membrane fouling and severely affects the separation performance naidu et al 2015 wang and chung 2015 xie et al 2013 therefore it is of both fundamental and practical significance to understand the interaction mechanism of humic substance with other components which governs the adsorption behavior of humic substance more importantly systemically unraveling the intermolecular interactions of humic substance with solids of different surface chemistry would promise an efficient strategy to design the tailored chemical additives for humic substance removal during the water treatment over the past few decades considerable efforts have been devoted to investigating the adsorption mechanism of humic substance on a variety of solid surfaces most of which were performed using analytical techniques such as batch adsorption sheng et al 2014 zhang and bai 2003 zhao et al 2011 fourier transform infrared ftir spectroscopy davis et al 1999 martin neto et al 1994 schmeide et al 2003 and quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation monitoring qcm d armanious et al 2014 eita 2011 li et al 2018 despite different adsorption mechanisms involved a systematic understanding on the interaction mechanism of humic substance with environmentally relevant surfaces particularly at the molecular level and nanoscale has been rarely reported atomic force microscope afm has been extensively employed to image the surface morphology and measure the surface interaction mechanisms of various materials at the nanoscale aubry et al 2013 guo and ma 2006 liu et al 2019b xie et al 2017a 2019a 2019b 2020 the afm based chemical force microscopy cfm technique enables the direct measurements of interaction forces of self assembled monolayers sams terminated with well defined chemical groups e g ch3 oh cooh for biological and engineering applications frisbie et al 1994 gao et al 2018 xie et al 2017b on the basis of the cfm technique we have mapped the nanoscopic distribution of wettability on mineral surfaces using the afm tip functionalized with ch3 sams which is attributed to the hydrophobic attraction between ch3 sams and hydrophobic domains of mineral surfaces xie et al 2017b very recently we have functionalized the afm tip with the sams of model oleic acid sh ch2 15cooh and hydroxamic acid ch3 2nc s sch2c o nhoh molecules aiming to quantitatively

intermolecular forces of humic substance interacting with solids of different surface chemistries and the essence to the adsorption and removal of humic substance could be quantitatively measured at the nanoscale using the cfm technique by functionalizing the afm tip with different sams in this work afm tips functionalized with oh sams ch3 sams cooh sams and nh2 sams represented the solids with different surface chemistries e g soil minerals like silica mica and kaolinite natural and engineered nanoparticles membrane surfaces which were used to probe the interactions with humic acid ha due to the complex structure of ha different interaction mechanisms e g hydrogen bonding hydrophobic interaction electrostatic interaction could contribute together to the ha adsorption herein the hydrophilic oh sams and hydrophobic ch3 sams could provide useful information on the hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interaction respectively meanwhile the negatively charged cooh sams and positively charged nh2 sams could exhibit the electrostatic repulsion or electrostatic attraction with the negatively charged ha it is noted that it is difficult to isolate one type of interaction and one of these interactions is always convoluted with other type of interactions with the exploit of afm tip functionalized with different sams the interaction forces and adhesion energies between solids of different surface chemistries and ha coated substrates were quantitatively measured under various aqueous environments at the nanoscale contact angle measurements and afm topographic imaging were also performed to investigate the characteristics of different sams before and after ha adsorption based on the unraveled intermolecular interaction mechanisms magnetic nanoparticles functionalized with 3 aminopropyl tiethoxysilane aptes were synthesized and demonstrated as a promising strategy to remove ha due to abundant nh2 functional groups which can be further recycled and reused after releasing ha in the alkaline environment this work provides useful insights into the fundamental interaction mechanism of ha with the solids of different surface chemistries at the nanoscale which improves the understanding of the molecular interaction mechanism underlying the adsorption of ha in soil and aquatic environments our results also shed light on developing effective chemical additives to remove ha in water treatment and many other engineering processes 2 material and methods 2 1 material sodium chloride nacl acs reagent grade calcium chloride cacl2 acs reagent grade hydrochloric acid hcl acs

infrared spectroscopy ftir data can be found in our previous reports maan et al 2018 yuan et al 2018 all the chemicals were used as received without further purification and all aqueous solutions were prepared using milli q water millipore deionized 18 2 mω cm resistivity the solution at ph 5 8 was used throughout this work unless the effect of ph was investigated 2 2 preparation of sample surfaces ha solution was prepared by dissolving a desired amount of ha in milli q water under stirring overnight to ensure complete ha hydration and 100 ppm ha solution was used after the filtration with 0 2 μm ptfe membrane the silicon wafers were cleaned by uv ozone treatment for 30 min and then coated with aptes via a vapor deposition process for 4 h lu et al 2011 it is known that uv can clean the organic matter jing et al 2015 which enables the cleaning of silicon substrate prior to other processes the obtained aptes silicon surfaces were immersed in 100 ppm ha solution overnight and then washed with milli q water and dried by high purity nitrogen to provide ha aptes silicon surfaces to investigate the characteristics of different sams before and after ha adsorption the oh sams ch3 sams cooh sams and nh2 sams surfaces were prepared by cleaning the gold coated silicon wafers by uv ozone treatment for 30 min and then immersed in 10 mm 11 mercapto 1 undecanol 1 undecanethiol 11 mercaptoundecanoic acid and 11 amino 1 undecanethiol hydrochloride in ethanol overnight the obtained oh sams ch3 sams cooh sams and nh2 sams coated substrates were washed with ethanol and milli q water dried by high purity nitrogen and further immersed in 100 ppm ha solution overnight for ha adsorption 2 3 surface characterization the prepared silicon aptes silicon and ha aptes silicon surfaces as well as oh sams ch3 sams cooh sams and nh2 sams surfaces before and after ha adsorption were subjected to the water contact angle measurements and afm topographic imaging with the detailed procedures shown below the water contact angle on selected sample surfaces was measured using the sessile drop method with a contact angle goniometer ramé hart instrument co nj usa typically at least two independently prepared surfaces and two different locations on each surface were tested for the same type of sample based on which the average water contact angle was reported the topographic image of sample surfaces was obtained using the peakforce tapping of a dimension icon afm bruker santa barbara ca usa prior to the force measurements the prepared sample was immersed in aqueous media to monitor the possible release of humic acid after 1 h the maximum operation time of afm force measurements the water contact angle and morphology of the sample surface didn t show any evident difference and no ha absorbance peak could be detected for the aqueous media both of which ruled out the possible ha release 2 4 afm force measurements the interaction forces between the sams functionalized afm tips and ha coated substrates were measured under different aqueous conditions using a mfp 3d afm asylum research santa barbara ca usa prior to force measurements afm gold coated probes were cleaned by uv ozone treatment for 30 min and then immersed in 10 mm 11 mercapto 1 undecanol 1 undecanethiol 11 mercaptoundecanoic acid and 11 amino 1 undecanethiol hydrochloride in ethanol overnight to respectively provide the oh sams ch3 sams cooh sams and nh2 sams on afm gold coated probes the prepared sams functionalized afm probes were washed with ethanol and milli q water dried by high purity nitrogen and used immediately for force measurements the obtained afm probes were positioned over ha coated substrates and then driven to approach the substrates and retract from the substrates at a fixed maximum deflection of the cantilever the cantilever deflection and the corresponding interaction forces were recorded as a function of time by afm software using the well known hutter and bechhoefer method hutter and bechhoefer 1993 the spring constant of the cantilever was determined to be 0 1 0 2 n m the schematic of typical experiment setup for measuring the interaction forces between the sams functionalized afm tip and ha surface is illustrated in fig 1 a 2 5 force curve analysis the afm force separation profiles measured during approach can be explained by the classical derjaguin landau verwey overbeek dlvo theory or the extended dlvo theory by incorporating non dlvo forces such as hydrophobic force in this work the afm tip used exhibited a pyramidal geometry which could be reasonably considered conical with a spherical cap on top of the apex as shown in fig 1b the van der waals vdw force between afm tip and flat substrate f vdw n can be described

followed a reported procedure mao et al 2019 the synthesized magnetic fe3o4 nanoparticles were characterized by transmission electron microscopy tem the obtained fe3o4 nanoparticles were further functionalized with aptes and the detailed procedure is shown below firstly 50 mg fe3o4 nanoparticles were dispersed in 10 ml ethanol water mixture 1 1 v v after stirring for 30 min 0 2 ml atpes was added into the mixture under nitrogen atmosphere and the reaction was stirred at 50 c overnight the final products were separated from the mixture by the magnet washed with ethanol and water for five times and then dried under vacuum the synthesized magnetic aptes fe3o4 nanoparticles were used to remove ha from aqueous solution specially 5 mg aptes fe3o4 nanoparticles were dispersed in 10 ml ha solution of different concentrations ranging from 10 ppm to 500 ppm after shaking overnight the solution was settled using the magnet and the supernatant was taken for the absorbance measurement using the ultraviolet visible uv vis spectroscopy based on the calibrated absorbance of ha solutions with known concentrations e g 0 1 ppm 0 3 ppm 0 5 ppm 0 7 ppm 1 ppm 5 ppm 10 ppm the concentration of ha in the supernatant was obtained for the 10 ppm case the settled solids were washed with 0 5 ml alkaline solution for three times to remove ha from nanoparticles while the concentrated ha in 1 5 ml alkaline solution was recycled water was applied for three times to remove the remained alkaline solution from nanoparticles the recycled aptes fe3o4 nanoparticles were then re dispersed in 10 ppm ha solution 10 ml for the second round of ha removal the same procedure was performed for ten times to test the recyclability of synthesized aptes fe3o4 nanoparticles 3 results and discussion 3 1 surface wettability fig 2 shows the water contact angle of different sams before and after ha adsorption without ha adsorption the oh sams surface is hydrophilic with the water contact of 23 2 while the ch3 sams surface is hydrophobic with the water contact angle of 107 8 after ha adsorption the water contact angle rises to 39 0 for oh sams and decreases to 67 5 for ch3 sams the ha adsorbed on the substrates leads to the hydrophilic surface less hydrophilic and the hydrophobic surface less hydrophobic for the cooh sams and nh2 sams surfaces without ha adsorption the water contact angles are measured to be 30 6 and 55 0 respectively after ha adsorption the water contact angle of cooh sams is raised to 38 2 while the water contact angle of nh2 sams is reduced to 45 5 it is noted that ha can spontaneously adsorb onto cooh sams and nh2 sams similarly to oh sams and ch3 sams thereby altering their surface wettability the alternation of water contact angle of cooh sams from 30 6 to 38 2 is smaller than that of oh sams from 23 2 to 39 0 it is noted that the change of water contact angle after ha adsorption provides qualitative information about the interaction between ha and the monolayers but it is difficult to quantitatively determine their affinity therefore quantitative force measurements were conducted between ha and monolayers using afm as discussed later 3 2 surface morphology fig 3 shows the topographic images of bare gold sams before ha adsorption and sams after ha adsorption the bare gold surface fig 3a exhibits the uniform grain like pattern and is very smooth with typical root mean square rms roughness of 0 3 0 4 nm the sams surfaces fig 3b display the morphology and rms roughness similar to the bare gold since the self assembly of small molecules could not change the characteristic morphology of gold substrates after ha adsorption the gold grain pattern is replaced by the polymer like morphology with few small aggregates and the rms roughness increases to 0 6 0 7 nm fig 3c f both of which indicate ha has adsorbed onto all the sams 3 3 characterization of ha coated substrates to unravel the interaction mechanism between ha and sams the afm tip functionalized with sams was used to measure the intermolecular forces with ha coated substrates the ha coated substrates were prepared by coating silicon wafers with aptes followed by ha adsorption and the bare silicon aptes silicon and ha aptes silicon substrates were characterized by contact angle measurements and afm topographic imaging as demonstrated in fig 4 the bare silicon aptes silicon and ha aptes silicon substrates show the water contact angle of 10 0 54 2 and 44 7 respectively revealing the successful coating of aptes on bare silicon and adsorption of ha on aptes silicon the surface morphology shows bare silicon and aptes silicon are both molecularly smooth with the rms roughness of 0 3 nm in contrast ha aptes silicon becomes rougher with the rms roughness increasing to 0 55 nm the variation of surface morphology further indicates the successful fabrication of uniform ha coating on the substrate 3 4 intermolecular forces of ha the intermolecular forces of ha in aqueous environments is critical to the adsorption and removal of ha in water based engineering and environmental systems the electrolyte concentration is varied regardless of soil or aquatic environment which affects the intermolecular forces of ha with other components thereby altering the adsorption and removal behavior of ha herein the surface interactions between ha and solids of different surface chemistries are quantitatively measured in nacl solutions of different concentrations i e 100 mm and 10 mm the interaction forces measured between the sams functionalized afm tips and ha coated substrate during approach in 100 mm nacl at ph 5 8 are shown in fig 5 the measured force separation profiles open symbols show the same attraction starting from a separation distance of 6 nm for oh sams cooh sams and nh2 sams while a much stronger and longer range attraction from 13 nm could be observed for ch3 sams at high salinity condition the edl force is screened and thus the interaction forces are dominated by vdw force and other possible interactions such as hydrophobic force the measured force results for oh sams cooh sams and nh2 sams can be well fitted by the classical dlvo theory with only vdw interaction red curve and the fitted hamaker constants of vdw interaction for these three cases lie in the same range 4 8 5 2 10 20 n m for ch3 sams it is obvious that the attraction measured is much stronger than that contributed by vdw interaction and thus the additional attraction should originate from the hydrophobic interaction between ch3 sams and the hydrophobic moieties of ha by fitting the measured force results using the extended dlvo theory with incorporated hydrophobic interaction red curve the decay length of hydrophobic force was determined to be d 0 0 7 0 1 nm it is noted that the discrepancy at separation d 2 nm is mainly attributed to the effects of surface roughness and hydration xie et al 2016 2017b it is known that ha is overall moderately hydrophobic in nature with the heterogeneous distribution of hydrophilic and hydrophobic moieties therefore the hydrophobic moieties of ha can strongly interact with ch3 sams via the hydrophobic attraction while the hydrophilic moieties can only exhibit the vdw attraction with ch3 sams as a result the overall hydrophobic interaction between ha and ch3 sams is not as strong as other interacting hydrophobic systems with d 0 1 0 nm fig 6 shows the measured forces open symbols and theoretical calculations red curve between the sams functionalized afm tips and ha coated substrate during approach in 10 mm nacl at ph 5 8 where the edl interaction cannot be neglected the measured force profiles display a long range repulsion from 11 nm for oh sams and 13 nm for cooh sams which are attributed to edl repulsion between the negatively charged ha and negatively charged oh sams or cooh sams on the other hand ha exhibits an attraction from 10 nm with nh2 sams and 6 nm with ch3 sams with the former contributed by edl attraction between the negatively charged ha and positively charged nh2 sams as well as the latter contributed by hydrophobic attraction that overcomes edl repulsion by fitting the measured force results with the theoretical calculations the surface potentials of ha oh sams cooh sams nh2 sams and ch3 sams are determined to be 25 mv 27 mv 35 mv 18 mv and 19 mv respectively which agree very well with the reported zeta potential values of ha oh sams pka 4 cooh sams pka 3 nh2 sams pka 7 3 7 7 and ch3 sams pka 3 at ph 5 8 angelico et al 2014 lin et al 2009 shyue et al 2004 based on the interaction forces abovementioned in figs 5 and 6 it is evident that ha can attract the solids in concentrated electrolyte regardless of the chemical composition of solid surfaces particularly for hydrophobic surfaces e g ch3 sams with hydrophobic attraction in diluted electrolyte the edl repulsion leads to the appearance of an energy barrier to prevent the approach of ha toward negatively charged hydrophilic surfaces e g oh sams cooh sams while the edl attraction with positively charged surfaces e g nh2 sams facilitates the approach of ha the case of negatively charged hydrophobic surfaces e g ch3 sams is more complex which relies on the coupling effect of edl repulsion and hydrophobic attraction the intermolecular forces of ha interacting with solids of different surface chemistry during approach provide the quantitative information on the tendency of ha adsorption on a variety of materials which is different from the adhesion measured during retraction that is closely related to the ha removal see the discussion below 3 5 adhesion energy of ha the histograms of adhesion f adh r measured during separation and the fitted gaussian distributions solid curve between the sams functionalized afm tips and ha coated substrate in 100 mm nacl at ph 5 8 are shown in fig 7 the average adhesion follows the trend nh2 sams 19 54 0 22 mn m ch3 sams 12 77 0 13 mn m oh sams 8 64 0 15 mn m cooh sams 3 24 0 06 mn m given the derjaguin muller toporov dmt model w a d h f a d h 2 π r to correlate the measured adhesion f adh r to the adhesion energy per unit area w adh the average adhesion energy is calculated to be 3 11 mj m2 for nh2 sams 2 03 mj m2 for ch3 sams 1 38 mj m2 for oh sams and 0 52 mj m2 for cooh sams the adhesion energy could be contributed by a variety of surface interactions including hydrogen bonding hydrophobic force and electrostatic force cooh sams and oh sams can form hydrogen bonding with the functional groups of ha e g oh cooh and nh2 while oh sams exhibits stronger capability to form the hydrogen bonds thereby resulting in the difference in the adhesion energy based on the approach force curves the hydrophobic force was only detected for ch3 sams the adhesion energy arising from hydrophobic interaction of ch3 sams with ha almost doubles that of hydrogen bonding of oh sams with ha evidently nh2 sams interacting with ha displays the strongest adhesion energy which is attributed to the electrostatic interaction hydrogen bonding and possibly cation π interaction to further understand the influence of various environmental factors on the interaction mechanism of ha the adhesion energy of ha interacting with the sams was evaluated in terms of ionic strength fig 8 a ion type fig 8b and ph fig 8c as shown in fig 8a with nacl concentration decreasing from 100 mm to 10 mm the adhesion energy for nh2 sams rises from 3 11 mj m2 to 4 41 mj m2 while the reduced adhesion energy is observed for oh sams ch3 sams and cooh sams the salinity mediated adhesion is mainly because the electrostatic attraction for nh2 sams and electrostatic repulsion for oh sams ch3 sams and cooh sams are weakened at high salinity condition overall the trend of average adhesion energy nh2 sams ch3 sams oh sams cooh sams remains the same regardless of the salinity fig 8b shows the effect of ca2 on the adhesion energy of ha interacting with the charged cooh sams and non polar ch3 sams the role of ca2 in altering adhesion energy for ch3 sams is not evident 2 03 2 21 mj m2 while the adhesion energy for cooh sams dramatically increases from 0 52 mj m2 without ca2 to 2 01 mj m2 with 1 mm ca2 addition and 3 88 mj m2 with 10 mm ca2 addition in 100 mm nacl it is known that ca2 could strongly bind to cooh sams which could turn the surface charge to be more positive as well as induce the possible bridging effect with the cooh groups of ha we further compare the ph effect on the adhesion energy of ha interacting with the charged sams and non polar ch3 sams and the representative soil and aquatic ph range 4 8 is selected as shown in fig 8c the adhesion energy of cooh sams nh2 sams and ch3 sams decreases with increasing the ph from 4 to 8 since ha cooh sams and ch3 sams always carry negative charges in the ph range investigated it is reasonable that the enhanced electrostatic repulsion with the increase of ph weakens the adhesion energy on the other hand the pka of nh2 sams is 7 3 7 7 indicating the sams mainly exist as the nh3 sams at ph 7 3 and as the nh2 sams at ph 7 7 lin et al 2009 shyue et al 2004 hence the electrostatic attraction at ph 4 0 and 5 8 turns to the repulsion at ph 8 0 which results in the sudden drop of adhesion energy for the interaction at ph 8 0 3 6 ha removal using amino based magnetic aptes fe3o4 nanoparticles based on the aforementioned interaction forces the strong adhesion of ha molecules onto nh2 sams promises the robust adherence of ha molecules on amino based adsorbents the ha nh2 adhesion is significantly reduced when measured at ph 8 and it is reasonably assumed that the adhesion would be further suppressed at a higher ph value ph 13 14 due to the enhanced electrostatic repulsion the ph responsive ha nh2 adhesion mechanism enables the adsorption and release of ha from the amino based adsorbents herein we synthesized the magnetic fe3o4 nanoparticles with the tem image illustrated in fig 9 a the fe3o4 nanoparticles were further coated with aptes as the amino based materials for ha removal the photographs of 10 ppm ha solution before and after addition of aptes fe3o4 nanoparticles are compared in fig 9b the added nanoparticles could effectively adsorb ha which turned the brownish color of ha solution to the clear color indicating aptes fe3o4 nanoparticles are promising agents to remove ha in water the magnet was used to facilitate the settling and recycling of the magnetic aptes fe3o4 nanoparticles adsorbed with ha the adsorption isotherm of ha on aptes fe3o4 nanoparticles can be well fitted by the langmuir model fig 9c and the maximum adsorption is obtained to be 91 49 mg g the magnetic characteristic of aptes fe3o4 nanoparticles allows the facile settling cleaning and recycling process using the magnet after ha removal the settled solids were washed with the alkaline solution to release the adsorbed ha and clean aptes fe3o4 nanoparticles the cyclability of aptes fe3o4 nanoparticles used for treating 10 ppm ha solution is demonstrated in fig 9d and the ha concentration remained after treatment was found to be always below 1 ppm even after 10 cycles therefore the magnetic aptes fe3o4 nanoparticles with abundant amino groups have demonstrated the promising activity toward ha removal and cyclability for reuse 4 conclusions in this work the intermolecular forces of ha interacting with solids of varying surface chemistries i e oh sams ch3 sams nh2 sams and cooh sams were quantitatively measured in various aqueous environments at the nanoscale using the afm based cfm technique by fitting the interaction forces measured during approach with the extended dlvo theory a hydrophobic force with the decay length d 0 0 7 0 1 nm was found for the ch3 sams case at both the low and high salinity conditions in 10 mm nacl at ph 5 8 the edl interaction was attractive for the nh2 sams case but repulsive for the oh sams ch3 sams and cooh sams cases it was also found that the adhesion energy was dependent on nacl concentration ca2 addition and ph at ph 5 8 nh2 sams exhibited the largest adhesion energy due to the electrostatic attraction followed by ch3 sams arising from the hydrophobic interaction and oh sams arising from the hydrogen bonding when changing the solution ph from 5 8 to the alkaline condition the electrostatic attraction turned to repulsive for nh2 sams leading to the significant suppression of adhesion energy all these fundamental physical interaction principles revealed that the amino based materials would be a class of promising candidates for ha removal by adsorbing and releasing ha during water treatment based on the unraveled molecular mechanism the magnetic aptes fe3o4 nanoparticles were synthesized and demonstrated as efficient agents to remove ha with recyclable characteristic our study provides useful insights into the quantitative understanding of the molecular interaction mechanisms which contribute to the adsorption of ha on solid substrates of different surface chemistries at the nanoscale sheding light on developing effective chemical additives

natural and engineered nanoparticles deonarine et al 2011 kumpulainen et al 2008 loosli et al 2013 in terms of membrane separation humic substance could easily adhere to membrane surfaces which results in the membrane fouling and severely affects the separation performance naidu et al 2015 wang and chung 2015 xie et al 2013 therefore it is of both fundamental and practical significance to understand the interaction mechanism of humic substance with other components which governs the adsorption behavior of humic substance more importantly systemically unraveling the intermolecular interactions of humic substance with solids of different surface chemistry would promise an efficient strategy to design the tailored chemical additives for humic substance removal during the water treatment over the past few decades considerable efforts have been devoted to investigating the adsorption mechanism of humic substance on a variety of solid surfaces most of which were performed using analytical techniques such as batch adsorption sheng et al 2014 zhang and bai 2003 zhao et al 2011 fourier transform infrared ftir spectroscopy davis et al 1999 martin neto et al 1994 schmeide et al 2003 and quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation monitoring qcm d armanious et al 2014 eita 2011 li et al 2018 despite different adsorption mechanisms involved a systematic understanding on the interaction mechanism of humic substance with environmentally relevant surfaces particularly at the molecular level and nanoscale has been rarely reported atomic force microscope afm has been extensively employed to image the surface morphology and measure the surface interaction mechanisms of various materials at the nanoscale aubry et al 2013 guo and ma 2006 liu et al 2019b xie et al 2017a 2019a 2019b 2020 the afm based chemical force microscopy cfm technique enables the direct measurements of interaction forces of self assembled monolayers sams terminated with well defined chemical groups e g ch3 oh cooh for biological and engineering applications frisbie et al 1994 gao et al 2018 xie et al 2017b on the basis of the cfm technique we have mapped the nanoscopic distribution of wettability on mineral surfaces using the afm tip functionalized with ch3 sams which is attributed to the hydrophobic attraction between ch3 sams and hydrophobic domains of mineral surfaces xie et al 2017b very recently we have functionalized the afm tip with the sams of model oleic acid sh ch2 15cooh and hydroxamic acid ch3 2nc s sch2c o nhoh molecules aiming to quantitatively probe the intermolecular interactions underlying the adsorption of oleic acid and hydroxamic acid molecules on different mineral surfaces gao et al 2018 liu et al 2019a to our knowledge the intermolecular forces of humic substance interacting with solids of different surface chemistries and the essence to the adsorption and removal of humic substance could be quantitatively measured at the nanoscale using the cfm technique by functionalizing the afm tip with different sams in this work afm tips functionalized with oh sams ch3 sams cooh sams and nh2 sams represented the solids with different surface chemistries e g soil minerals like silica mica and kaolinite natural and engineered nanoparticles membrane surfaces which were used to probe the interactions with humic acid ha due to the complex structure of ha different interaction mechanisms e g hydrogen bonding hydrophobic interaction electrostatic interaction could contribute together to the ha adsorption herein the hydrophilic oh sams and hydrophobic ch3 sams could provide useful information on the hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interaction respectively meanwhile the negatively charged cooh sams and positively charged nh2 sams could exhibit the electrostatic repulsion or electrostatic attraction with the negatively charged ha it is noted that it is difficult to isolate one type of interaction and one of these interactions is always convoluted with other type of interactions with the exploit of afm tip functionalized with different sams the interaction forces and adhesion energies between solids of different surface chemistries and ha coated substrates were quantitatively measured under various aqueous environments at the nanoscale contact angle measurements and afm topographic imaging were also performed to investigate the characteristics of different sams before and after ha adsorption based on the unraveled intermolecular interaction mechanisms magnetic nanoparticles functionalized with 3 aminopropyl tiethoxysilane aptes were synthesized and demonstrated as a promising strategy to remove ha due to abundant nh2 functional groups which can be further recycled and reused after releasing ha in the alkaline environment this work provides useful insights into the fundamental interaction mechanism of ha with the solids of different surface chemistries at the nanoscale which improves the understanding of the molecular interaction mechanism underlying the adsorption of ha in soil and aquatic environments our results also shed light on developing effective chemical additives to remove ha in water treatment and many other engineering processes 2 material and methods 2 1 material sodium chloride nacl acs reagent grade calcium chloride cacl2 acs reagent grade hydrochloric acid hcl acs

infrared spectroscopy ftir data can be found in our previous reports maan et al 2018 yuan et al 2018 all the chemicals were used as received without further purification and all aqueous solutions were prepared using milli q water millipore deionized 18 2 mω cm resistivity the solution at ph 5 8 was used throughout this work unless the effect of ph was investigated 2 2 preparation of sample surfaces ha solution was prepared by dissolving a desired amount of ha in milli q water under stirring overnight to ensure complete ha hydration and 100 ppm ha solution was used after the filtration with 0 2 μm ptfe membrane the silicon wafers were cleaned by uv ozone treatment for 30 min and then coated with aptes via a vapor deposition process for 4 h lu et al 2011 it is known that uv can clean the organic matter jing et al 2015 which enables the cleaning of silicon substrate prior to other processes the obtained aptes silicon surfaces were immersed in 100 ppm ha solution overnight and then washed with milli q water and dried by high purity nitrogen to provide ha aptes silicon surfaces to investigate the characteristics of different sams before and after ha adsorption the oh sams ch3 sams cooh sams and nh2 sams surfaces were prepared by cleaning the gold coated silicon wafers by uv ozone treatment for 30 min and then immersed in 10 mm 11 mercapto 1 undecanol 1 undecanethiol 11 mercaptoundecanoic acid and 11 amino 1 undecanethiol hydrochloride in ethanol overnight the obtained oh sams ch3 sams cooh sams and nh2 sams coated substrates were washed with ethanol and milli q water dried by high purity nitrogen and further immersed in 100 ppm ha solution overnight for ha adsorption 2 3 surface characterization the prepared silicon aptes silicon and ha aptes silicon surfaces as well as oh sams ch3 sams cooh sams and nh2 sams surfaces before and after ha adsorption were subjected to the water contact angle measurements and afm topographic imaging with the detailed procedures shown below the water contact angle on selected sample surfaces was measured using the sessile drop method with a contact angle goniometer ramé hart instrument co nj usa typically at least two independently prepared surfaces and two different locations on each surface were tested for the same type of sample based on which the average water contact angle was reported the topographic image of sample surfaces was obtained using the peakforce tapping of a dimension icon afm bruker santa barbara ca usa prior to the force measurements the prepared sample was immersed in aqueous media to monitor the possible release of humic acid after 1 h the maximum operation time of afm force measurements the water contact angle and morphology of the sample surface didn t show any evident difference and no ha absorbance peak could be detected for the aqueous media both of which ruled out the possible ha release 2 4 afm force measurements the interaction forces between the sams functionalized afm tips and ha coated substrates were measured under different aqueous conditions using a mfp 3d afm asylum research santa barbara ca usa prior to force measurements afm gold coated probes were cleaned by uv ozone treatment for 30 min and then immersed in 10 mm 11 mercapto 1 undecanol 1 undecanethiol 11 mercaptoundecanoic acid and 11 amino 1 undecanethiol hydrochloride in ethanol overnight to respectively provide the oh sams ch3 sams cooh sams and nh2 sams on afm gold coated probes the prepared sams functionalized afm probes were washed with ethanol and milli q water dried by high purity nitrogen and used immediately for force measurements the obtained afm probes were positioned over ha coated substrates and then driven to approach the substrates and retract from the substrates at a fixed maximum deflection of the cantilever the cantilever deflection and the corresponding interaction forces were recorded as a function of time by afm software using the well known hutter and bechhoefer method hutter and bechhoefer 1993 the spring constant of the cantilever was determined to be 0 1 0 2 n m the schematic of typical experiment setup for measuring the interaction forces between the sams functionalized afm tip and ha surface is illustrated in fig 1 a 2 5 force curve analysis the afm force separation profiles measured during approach can be explained by the classical derjaguin landau verwey overbeek dlvo theory or the extended dlvo theory by incorporating non dlvo forces such as hydrophobic force in this work the afm tip used exhibited a pyramidal geometry which could be reasonably considered conical with a spherical cap on top of the apex as shown in fig 1b the van der waals vdw force between afm tip and flat substrate f vdw n can be described

followed a reported procedure mao et al 2019 the synthesized magnetic fe3o4 nanoparticles were characterized by transmission electron microscopy tem the obtained fe3o4 nanoparticles were further functionalized with aptes and the detailed procedure is shown below firstly 50 mg fe3o4 nanoparticles were dispersed in 10 ml ethanol water mixture 1 1 v v after stirring for 30 min 0 2 ml atpes was added into the mixture under nitrogen atmosphere and the reaction was stirred at 50 c overnight the final products were separated from the mixture by the magnet washed with ethanol and water for five times and then dried under vacuum the synthesized magnetic aptes fe3o4 nanoparticles were used to remove ha from aqueous solution specially 5 mg aptes fe3o4 nanoparticles were dispersed in 10 ml ha solution of different concentrations ranging from 10 ppm to 500 ppm after shaking overnight the solution was settled using the magnet and the supernatant was taken for the absorbance measurement using the ultraviolet visible uv vis spectroscopy based on the calibrated absorbance of ha solutions with known concentrations e g 0 1 ppm 0 3 ppm 0 5 ppm 0 7 ppm 1 ppm 5 ppm 10 ppm the concentration of ha in the supernatant was obtained for the 10 ppm case the settled solids were washed with 0 5 ml alkaline solution for three times to remove ha from nanoparticles while the concentrated ha in 1 5 ml alkaline solution was recycled water was applied for three times to remove the remained alkaline solution from nanoparticles the recycled aptes fe3o4 nanoparticles were then re dispersed in 10 ppm ha solution 10 ml for the second round of ha removal the same procedure was performed for ten times to test the recyclability of synthesized aptes fe3o4 nanoparticles 3 results and discussion 3 1 surface wettability fig 2 shows the water contact angle of different sams before and after ha adsorption without ha adsorption the oh sams surface is hydrophilic with the water contact of 23 2 while the ch3 sams surface is hydrophobic with the water contact angle of 107 8 after ha adsorption the water contact angle rises to 39 0 for oh sams and decreases to 67 5 for ch3 sams the ha adsorbed on the substrates leads to the hydrophilic surface less hydrophilic and the hydrophobic surface less hydrophobic for the cooh sams and nh2 sams surfaces without ha adsorption the water contact angles are measured to be 30 6 and 55 0 respectively after ha adsorption the water contact angle of cooh sams is raised to 38 2 while the water contact angle of nh2 sams is reduced to 45 5 it is noted that ha can spontaneously adsorb onto cooh sams and nh2 sams similarly to oh sams and ch3 sams thereby altering their surface wettability the alternation of water contact angle of cooh sams from 30 6 to 38 2 is smaller than that of oh sams from 23 2 to 39 0 it is noted that the change of water contact angle after ha adsorption provides qualitative information about the interaction between ha and the monolayers but it is difficult to quantitatively determine their affinity therefore quantitative force measurements were conducted between ha and monolayers using afm as discussed later 3 2 surface morphology fig 3 shows the topographic images of bare gold sams before ha adsorption and sams after ha adsorption the bare gold surface fig 3a exhibits the uniform grain like pattern and is very smooth with typical root mean square rms roughness of 0 3 0 4 nm the sams surfaces fig 3b display the morphology and rms roughness similar to the bare gold since the self assembly of small molecules could not change the characteristic morphology of gold substrates after ha adsorption the gold grain pattern is replaced by the polymer like morphology with few small aggregates and the rms roughness increases to 0 6 0 7 nm fig 3c f both of which indicate ha has adsorbed onto all the sams 3 3 characterization of ha coated substrates to unravel the interaction mechanism between ha and sams the afm tip functionalized with sams was used to measure the intermolecular forces with ha coated substrates the ha coated substrates were prepared by coating silicon wafers with aptes followed by ha adsorption and the bare silicon aptes silicon and ha aptes silicon substrates were characterized by contact angle measurements and afm topographic imaging as demonstrated in fig 4 the bare silicon aptes silicon and ha aptes silicon substrates show the water contact angle of 10 0 54 2 and 44 7 respectively revealing the successful coating of aptes on bare silicon and adsorption of ha on aptes silicon the surface morphology shows bare silicon and aptes silicon are both molecularly smooth with the rms roughness of 0 3 nm in contrast ha aptes silicon becomes rougher with the rms roughness increasing to 0 55 nm the variation of surface morphology further indicates the successful fabrication of uniform ha coating on the substrate 3 4 intermolecular forces of ha the intermolecular forces of ha in aqueous environments is critical to the adsorption and removal of ha in water based engineering and environmental systems the electrolyte concentration is varied regardless of soil or aquatic environment which affects the intermolecular forces of ha with other components thereby altering the adsorption and removal behavior of ha herein the surface interactions between ha and solids of different surface chemistries are quantitatively measured in nacl solutions of different concentrations i e 100 mm and 10 mm the interaction forces measured between the sams functionalized afm tips and ha coated substrate during approach in 100 mm nacl at ph 5 8 are shown in fig 5 the measured force separation profiles open symbols show the same attraction starting from a separation distance of 6 nm for oh sams cooh sams and nh2 sams while a much stronger and longer range attraction from 13 nm could be observed for ch3 sams at high salinity condition the edl force is screened and thus the interaction forces are dominated by vdw force and other possible interactions such as hydrophobic force the measured force results for oh sams cooh sams and nh2 sams can be well fitted by the classical dlvo theory with only vdw interaction red curve and the fitted hamaker constants of vdw interaction for these three cases lie in the same range 4 8 5 2 10 20 n m for ch3 sams it is obvious that the attraction measured is much stronger than that contributed by vdw interaction and thus the additional attraction should originate from the hydrophobic interaction between ch3 sams and the hydrophobic moieties of ha by fitting the measured force results using the extended dlvo theory with incorporated hydrophobic interaction red curve the decay length of hydrophobic force was determined to be d 0 0 7 0 1 nm it is noted that the discrepancy at separation d 2 nm is mainly attributed to the effects of surface roughness and hydration xie et al 2016 2017b it is known that ha is overall moderately hydrophobic in nature with the heterogeneous distribution of hydrophilic and hydrophobic moieties therefore the hydrophobic moieties of ha can strongly interact with ch3 sams via the hydrophobic attraction while the hydrophilic moieties can only exhibit the vdw attraction with ch3 sams as a result the overall hydrophobic interaction between ha and ch3 sams is not as strong as other interacting hydrophobic systems with d 0 1 0 nm fig 6 shows the measured forces open symbols and theoretical calculations red curve between the sams functionalized afm tips and ha coated substrate during approach in 10 mm nacl at ph 5 8 where the edl interaction cannot be neglected the measured force profiles display a long range repulsion from 11 nm for oh sams and 13 nm for cooh sams which are attributed to edl repulsion between the negatively charged ha and negatively charged oh sams or cooh sams on the other hand ha exhibits an attraction from 10 nm with nh2 sams and 6 nm with ch3 sams with the former contributed by edl attraction between the negatively charged ha and positively charged nh2 sams as well as the latter contributed by hydrophobic attraction that overcomes edl repulsion by fitting the measured force results with the theoretical calculations the surface potentials of ha oh sams cooh sams nh2 sams and ch3 sams are determined to be 25 mv 27 mv 35 mv 18 mv and 19 mv respectively which agree very well with the reported zeta potential values of ha oh sams pka 4 cooh sams pka 3 nh2 sams pka 7 3 7 7 and ch3 sams pka 3 at ph 5 8 angelico et al 2014 lin et al 2009 shyue et al 2004 based on the interaction forces abovementioned in figs 5 and 6 it is evident that ha can attract the solids in concentrated electrolyte regardless of the chemical composition of solid surfaces particularly for hydrophobic surfaces e g ch3 sams with hydrophobic attraction in diluted electrolyte the edl repulsion leads to the appearance of an energy barrier to prevent the approach of ha toward negatively charged hydrophilic surfaces e g oh sams cooh sams while the edl attraction with positively charged surfaces e g nh2 sams facilitates the approach of ha the case of negatively charged hydrophobic surfaces e g ch3 sams is more complex which relies on the coupling effect of edl repulsion and hydrophobic attraction the intermolecular forces of ha interacting with solids of different surface chemistry during approach provide the quantitative information on the tendency of ha adsorption on a variety of materials which is different from the adhesion measured during retraction that is closely related to the ha removal see the discussion below 3 5 adhesion energy of ha the histograms of adhesion f adh r measured during separation and the fitted gaussian distributions solid curve between the sams functionalized afm tips and ha coated substrate in 100 mm nacl at ph 5 8 are shown in fig 7 the average adhesion follows the trend nh2 sams 19 54 0 22 mn m ch3 sams 12 77 0 13 mn m oh sams 8 64 0 15 mn m cooh sams 3 24 0 06 mn m given the derjaguin muller toporov dmt model w a d h f a d h 2 π r to correlate the measured adhesion f adh r to the adhesion energy per unit area w adh the average adhesion energy is calculated to be 3 11 mj m2 for nh2 sams 2 03 mj m2 for ch3 sams 1 38 mj m2 for oh sams and 0 52 mj m2 for cooh sams the adhesion energy could be contributed by a variety of surface interactions including hydrogen bonding hydrophobic force and electrostatic force cooh sams and oh sams can form hydrogen bonding with the functional groups of ha e g oh cooh and nh2 while oh sams exhibits stronger capability to form the hydrogen bonds thereby resulting in the difference in the adhesion energy based on the approach force curves the hydrophobic force was only detected for ch3 sams the adhesion energy arising from hydrophobic interaction of ch3 sams with ha almost doubles that of hydrogen bonding of oh sams with ha evidently nh2 sams interacting with ha displays the strongest adhesion energy which is attributed to the electrostatic interaction hydrogen bonding and possibly cation π interaction to further understand the influence of various environmental factors on the interaction mechanism of ha the adhesion energy of ha interacting with the sams was evaluated in terms of ionic strength fig 8 a ion type fig 8b and ph fig 8c as shown in fig 8a with nacl concentration decreasing from 100 mm to 10 mm the adhesion energy for nh2 sams rises from 3 11 mj m2 to 4 41 mj m2 while the reduced adhesion energy is observed for oh sams ch3 sams and cooh sams the salinity mediated adhesion is mainly because the electrostatic attraction for nh2 sams and electrostatic repulsion for oh sams ch3 sams and cooh sams are weakened at high salinity condition overall the trend of average adhesion energy nh2 sams ch3 sams oh sams cooh sams remains the same regardless of the salinity fig 8b shows the effect of ca2 on the adhesion energy of ha interacting with the charged cooh sams and non polar ch3 sams the role of ca2 in altering adhesion energy for ch3 sams is not evident 2 03 2 21 mj m2 while the adhesion energy for cooh sams dramatically increases from 0 52 mj m2 without ca2 to 2 01 mj m2 with 1 mm ca2 addition and 3 88 mj m2 with 10 mm ca2 addition in 100 mm nacl it is known that ca2 could strongly bind to cooh sams which could turn the surface charge to be more positive as well as induce the possible bridging effect with the cooh groups of ha we further compare the ph effect on the adhesion energy of ha interacting with the charged sams and non polar ch3 sams and the representative soil and aquatic ph range 4 8 is selected as shown in fig 8c the adhesion energy of cooh sams nh2 sams and ch3 sams decreases with increasing the ph from 4 to 8 since ha cooh sams and ch3 sams always carry negative charges in the ph range investigated it is reasonable that the enhanced electrostatic repulsion with the increase of ph weakens the adhesion energy on the other hand the pka of nh2 sams is 7 3 7 7 indicating the sams mainly exist as the nh3 sams at ph 7 3 and as the nh2 sams at ph 7 7 lin et al 2009 shyue et al 2004 hence the electrostatic attraction at ph 4 0 and 5 8 turns to the repulsion at ph 8 0 which results in the sudden drop of adhesion energy for the interaction at ph 8 0 3 6 ha removal using amino based magnetic aptes fe3o4 nanoparticles based on the aforementioned interaction forces the strong adhesion of ha molecules onto nh2 sams promises the robust adherence of ha molecules on amino based adsorbents the ha nh2 adhesion is significantly reduced when measured at ph 8 and it is reasonably assumed that the adhesion would be further suppressed at a higher ph value ph 13 14 due to the enhanced electrostatic repulsion the ph responsive ha nh2 adhesion mechanism enables the adsorption and release of ha from the amino based adsorbents herein we synthesized the magnetic fe3o4 nanoparticles with the tem image illustrated in fig 9 a the fe3o4 nanoparticles were further coated with aptes as the amino based materials for ha removal the photographs of 10 ppm ha solution before and after addition of aptes fe3o4 nanoparticles are compared in fig 9b the added nanoparticles could effectively adsorb ha which turned the brownish color of ha solution to the clear color indicating aptes fe3o4 nanoparticles are promising agents to remove ha in water the magnet was used to facilitate the settling and recycling of the magnetic aptes fe3o4 nanoparticles adsorbed with ha the adsorption isotherm of ha on aptes fe3o4 nanoparticles can be well fitted by the langmuir model fig 9c and the maximum adsorption is obtained to be 91 49 mg g the magnetic characteristic of aptes fe3o4 nanoparticles allows the facile settling cleaning and recycling process using the magnet after ha removal the settled solids were washed with the alkaline solution to release the adsorbed ha and clean aptes fe3o4 nanoparticles the cyclability of aptes fe3o4 nanoparticles used for treating 10 ppm ha solution is demonstrated in fig 9d and the ha concentration remained after treatment was found to be always below 1 ppm even after 10 cycles therefore the magnetic aptes fe3o4 nanoparticles with abundant amino groups have demonstrated the promising activity toward ha removal and cyclability for reuse 4 conclusions in this work the intermolecular forces of ha interacting with solids of varying surface chemistries i e oh sams ch3 sams nh2 sams and cooh sams were quantitatively measured in various aqueous environments at the nanoscale using the afm based cfm technique by fitting the interaction forces measured during approach with the extended dlvo theory a hydrophobic force with the decay length d 0 0 7 0 1 nm was found for the ch3 sams case at both the low and high salinity conditions in 10 mm nacl at ph 5 8 the edl interaction was attractive for the nh2 sams case but repulsive for the oh sams ch3 sams and cooh sams cases it was also found that the adhesion energy was dependent on nacl concentration ca2 addition and ph at ph 5 8 nh2 sams exhibited the largest adhesion energy due to the electrostatic attraction followed by ch3 sams arising from the hydrophobic interaction and oh sams arising from the hydrogen bonding when changing the solution ph from 5 8 to the alkaline condition the electrostatic attraction turned to repulsive for nh2 sams leading to the significant suppression of adhesion energy all these fundamental physical interaction principles revealed that the amino based materials would be a class of promising candidates for ha removal by adsorbing and releasing ha during water treatment based on the unraveled molecular mechanism the magnetic aptes fe3o4 nanoparticles were synthesized and demonstrated as efficient agents to remove ha with recyclable characteristic our study provides useful insights into the quantitative understanding of the molecular interaction mechanisms which contribute to the adsorption of ha on solid substrates of different surface chemistries at the nanoscale sheding light on developing effective chemical additives

17996,recognition of human excreta as a resource rather than as waste has led to the emergence of a range of new and innovative nutrient recovery solutions nevertheless the management of human excreta remains largely rooted in current sanitation and wastewater management approaches which often makes nutrient recovery an add on to existing infrastructures in this paper we argue that framing human excreta management as a resource recovery challenge within waste management obscures important trade offs we explore the factors that would be brought to the fore by reframing human excreta management as part of food and farming systems we find that such a reframing would accentuate at least six aspects of critical importance that are currently largely overlooked recognizing that the proposed framing may also have its limitations we argue that it has the potential to better guide human excreta management towards long term global food soil and nutrient security while reducing the risk of compromising other priorities related to human and environmental health graphical abstract image 1 keywords human excreta management nutrient management nutrient recovery wastewater management sanitation resource recovery 1 introduction finding ways to feed a growing and increasingly urbanized population while reducing environmental and social impacts is a major global challenge foley et al 2011 willett et al 2019 one of the key prerequisites to achieving and maintaining global food security is improved nutrient management along the entire food chain which includes farming practices food processing consumer behavior and waste management mcconville et al 2015 better nutrient management also includes the recirculation of nutrients from human excreta to food production drangert et al 2018 trimmer and guest 2018 in most cultures human excreta has historically been used for fertilization and soil improvement ferguson 2014 however the introduction of the water closet and sewer networks that is waterborne sanitation has led to a decoupling from food production ferguson 2014 other contributing factors are increased urbanization and the industrialization of farming systems jones et al 2013 characterized by specialization and widespread use of mineral fertilizers and pesticides taken together these factors have profoundly altered nutrient flows at the local regional and global scales leading to a linearization and globalization of nutrient flows as illustrated and explained in fig 1 it has become increasingly evident over the past few decades that the patterns of nutrient flows associated with current approaches to farming and human excreta management are unsustainable steffen et al 2015 global estimates of current recirculation rates are highly variable but suggest that at most 15 percent of nitrogen and 55 percent of phosphorus in human excreta are recirculated to cropland trimmer et al 2017 also emissions of nutrients from human excreta to water bodies are projected to increase even further in the future due to increased population and urbanization van drecht et al 2009 as well as the widespread perception of waterborne sanitation as the gold standard del carmen morales et al 2014 concerns about nutrient pollution in freshwater and marine environments glibert et al 2014 combined with the anticipation of insecurities related to future phosphorus supplies cordell et al 2009 have fuelled the development of new and innovative human excreta management solutions that facilitate the recovery of nutrients and organic matter from human excreta for reuse in agriculture haddaway et al 2019 harder et al 2019 the development of nutrient recovery and reuse solutions reflects an ongoing shift from perceiving human excreta as waste towards recognizing its value as a resource and is part of a broader trend towards more comprehensive resource recovery in the sanitation and wastewater management sectors larsen and gujer 1997 otterpohl et al 1997 wilsenach et al 2003 larsen et al 2009 verstraete et al 2009 peccia and westerhoff 2015 several scholars have in fact highlighted that new and innovative sanitation and wastewater management solutions that embrace resource recovery have the potential to enhance multiple ecosystem services trimmer et al 2019a and contribute to the achievement of multiple sustainable development goals sdgs andersson et al 2016 andersson et al 2018 trimmer et al 2017 orner and mihelcic 2018 although human excreta is increasingly recognized as a resource its management is still largely rooted in current sanitation and wastewater management approaches simha and ganesapillai 2017 under these premises nutrient recovery often becomes an add on to existing infrastructures it is well documented that the way in which an issue is framed has a major impact on the perception of what the problem is and how it might be handled vliegenthart and van zoonen 2011 halffman 2019 we acknowledge that a reframing of human excreta management could take many forms and would like to highlight that any framing whether implicit or explicit will inevitably lead to certain aspects and perspectives being prioritized over others recognizing that this is also true for the proposed framing we argue that reframing human excreta management as part of food and farming systems has the potential to shift the perception of opportunities and challenges and can reveal central trade offs that are currently underrated since vocabulary guides our thinking schön 1993 we believe that a shift in thought patterns and framing also requires a shift in terminology much of the current vocabulary related to human excreta management is rooted in the perception of human excreta as waste and contributes to the technological institutional and mental lock in to conventional solutions for example the terms human waste and wastewater directly allude to the notion of waste similarly the term sewage requires sewers and wastewater implies the use of water as means of transportation therefore we have chosen to avoid these terms and consistently speak of human excreta streams that contain human excreta and human excreta management 2 underrated aspects of human excreta management that reframing brings to the fore there are natural linkages between agriculture food and human excreta management we find that reframing human excreta management as a part of food and farming systems would give prominence to at least six aspects that are currently largely overlooked as illustrated in fig 2 we propose that better consideration of these aspects has the potential to contribute to global food soil and nutrient security in the long term the six underrated aspects are elaborated upon below while presented separately they are connected and there are potential synergies among them 2 1 prioritizing nutrient recovery and reuse globally the potential contribution of nutrient recovery to meet fertilizer demand far surpasses the potential contribution of energy recovery to meet energy demand trimmer et al 2017 even so energy recovery from human excreta has long received more attention than nutrient recovery grant et al 2012 van loosdrecht and brdjanovic 2014 moreover recent research and development of novel energy recovery technologies that use streams containing human excreta as feedstock for the production of biocrude bioethanol biodiesel biohydrogen and syngas gomaa and abed 2017 puyol et al 2017 manyuchi et al 2018 has rarely indicated what fraction of nutrients if any is recovered in parallel and in what types of residual products from a longer term nutrient security perspective globally the role of human excreta derived nutrients in supplying nutrients to biomass production should not be understated and it would be important to weigh the contributions of energy versus nutrient recovery in relation to their respective demand we acknowledge that resource recovery in sanitation systems can provide multiple benefits in different local contexts including contributions to energy supply and building soil organic matter crews and rumsey 2017 2 2 broadening the scope of nutrient recovery plants need at least 17 essential elements to grow hänsch and mendel 2009 maathuis 2009 certain other elements even if they are not essential for plant growth can be essential for animal nutrition such as cobalt voortman 2012 or human health such as selenium jones et al 2017 insufficient and imbalanced fertilization has led to a systematic stripping of nutrients from soil at the global level jones et al 2013 for instance potassium limitation is common in terrestrial ecosystems globally sardans and peñuelas 2015 and it has been estimated that only about half of the potassium removed from soil as offtake is replenished through fertilizers and soil amendments sheldrick et al 2002 manning 2018 concerns have also been raised regarding micronutrient stripping voortman 2012 jones et al 2013 and micronutrient deficiencies notably regarding copper zinc and selenium udo de haes et al 2012 jones et al 2017 the depletion of high grade phosphate rock deposits has led to increasing attention being given to alternative phosphorus sources several jurisdictions have implemented legislation for comprehensive phosphorus recovery such as switzerland vvea 2015 germany abfklärv 2017 and austria bawp 2017 or are in the process of developing such legislation sweden for example however potassium and micronutrients are also currently mined from finite deposits some scholars have argued that potassium is not anticipated to be in limited supply nor is there a significant energy requirement for the production of potassium fertilizers dawson and hilton 2011 others have highlighted that high grade potassium ore is also limited and concentrated in a small number of countries and have advised the exploration and use of novel sources of potassium ciceri et al 2015 manning 2015 2018 likewise micronutrients might become increasingly scarce voortman 2012 in contrast nitrogen is not in short supply as it is abundant in the atmosphere key challenges are to minimize losses of reactive nitrogen to the environment and to develop less energy intensive ways of nitrogen fixation from the atmosphere razon 2018 there is little doubt that phosphorus recovery plays a critical role in slowing down the depletion of high grade phosphate rock deposits however a narrow focus on phosphorus recovery falls short of addressing the broader issues of soil nutrient stripping increased micronutrient deficiencies and long term food security many recovery technologies that have focused on phosphorus recovery have actually resulted in high losses of other nutrients such as nitrogen to the atmosphere and potassium to the effluent therefore there is a risk that an overly narrow focus on phosphorus may lead to sub optimal solutions from a longer term sustainability perspective there are reasons to include potassium and micronutrients and possibly nitrogen to reduce energy requirements and minimize the introduction of new reactive nitrogen into global nutrient cycles in efforts to increase recirculation of nutrients contained in human excreta and other organic residuals to biomass production as is already the case for some of the recovery and reuse technologies and approaches that are under development harder et al 2019 we recognize that recovery of multiple nutrients carries various challenges including trade offs such as energy requirements or the quality of the recovered product with respect to for example product homogeneity plant availability and environmental contamination 2 3 catering to diversity in agricultural production there is fierce debate on what the future of food should look like garnett 2014 fraser et al 2016 willett et al 2019 because it is highly unlikely that one single solution will work in all locations we assume that a combination of different types of production systems will be required cunningham et al 2013 the future food system will likely include soil based production systems where soil is the growth medium as well as soil less production systems where substances other than soil are the growth medium varying from low tech to high tech and located in rural as well as urban settings among the soil based production systems there will most likely be scope for a wide range of systems that are adapted to the local ecological conditions and resource base struik and kuyper 2017 among the soil less systems there are opportunities for hydroponics and aquaculture in various configurations including vertical farms muller et al 2017 as well as reactor based production of microbial protein pikaar et al 2017 linder 2019 the variety in production systems for food and other biomass will require a variety of nutrient inputs hydroponic production systems for instance require a carefully crafted combination of mineral salts to produce a nutrient solution possibly in combination with granular fertilizers such as struvite aquaculture systems require fertilizers or fish feed which could contain protein rendered by treatment of streams containing human excreta in principle soil based production systems can handle a wide variety of nutrient inputs ranging from nutrient rich liquids and organic matter to granular and powdery inorganic matter although different soil based production systems and different farmers have different preferences in other words there will most likely be a need for a wide array of nutrient rich products rendered by treatment of among other organic residuals streams containing human excreta henceforward referred to as nutrient rich products until very recently however most research on developing and assessing nutrient recovery and reuse solutions was not designed to meet the needs of specific production systems this is probably because nutrient recovery and reuse is seen primarily as a way to replace conventional mineral fertilizers and curb the demand for mined nutrients however different ways to produce biomass differ widely regarding environmental and social impacts hilborn et al 2018 poore and nemecek 2018 rasmussen et al 2018 if the overarching question is how human excreta management can best support future agricultural production as opposed to how to best replace conventional mineral fertilizers it becomes important to distinguish between different human excreta derived nutrient rich products and clarify their usefulness for different ways to produce biomass this includes aspects related to the characteristics of the recovered product for example nutrient composition solubility and availability and potential constraints for example soil characteristics fertilizer application practices nutrient use efficiency or farmer preferences viewing nutrient recirculation as an integral part of long term food and nutrient security therefore highlights that better understanding of the compatibility of different nutrient rich products and production systems is key to ensure that nutrient recirculation can cater to a diversity of farming systems 2 4 invigorating soil and ecosystem health the global degradation of arable soil is a major challenge to food security and agricultural sustainability montgomery 2007 amundson et al 2015 montanarella et al 2016 it has been proposed that the concept of soil security can better translate soil science into policy for sustainable development koch et al 2013 by actively promoting management practices that mitigate soil degradation notably erosion baumhardt et al 2015 lal 2015 and regenerate soil health sherwood and uphoff 2000 cardoso et al 2013 in this regard the role of soil biodiversity for sustaining or improving food supply and human health has been emphasized wall et al 2015 with several scholars calling for soil and land management practices that promote soil biodiversity wall et al 2015 bender et al 2016 ultimately to help protect the global soil resource nutrient rich products including those that contain human excreta derived nutrients and organic matter will need to be compatible with farming practices and production systems that maintain or improve soil and ecosystem health this goes beyond just replenishing inorganic plant nutrients and relates more broadly to farming practices and production systems agronomic evaluation of recycled fertilizers has long focused primarily on nutrient availability nutrient uptake and crop yield testing often takes place in pot experiments which means it does not allow for a differentiated evaluation of fertilizers in the broader context of soil and ecosystem health at the field and landscape scales therefore a better understanding of the compatibility of different nutrient rich products and biomass production systems is crucial to guide the development and assessment of recovery and reuse of human excreta derived nutrients towards invigorating soil and ecosystem health recent research into the effects of recycled fertilizers on microbial communities and soil biodiversity van der bom et al 2019 ibekwe et al 2018 staley et al 2018 and into the alignment of recycled fertilizer chemistry with local soil properties trimmer et al 2019b are important steps in this direction 2 5 further reducing contamination at the source contaminants that are found in human excreta or added from other sources to streams containing human excreta include pathogens as well as a variety of inorganic and organic substances such as industrial chemicals pharmaceuticals personal care products and other household products these substances represent a major challenge when it comes to recirculating human excreta derived recycled fertilizers to agricultural production since their presence restricts the use of these products mininni et al 2015 röös et al 2018 evaluating the risks involves many uncertainties and concerns have been raised that potential undesired effects are yet to be discovered the increasing concerns regarding substances that interact with the hormonal system endocrine disrupting chemicals edcs and their association with a diversity of adverse effects in wildlife and humans damstra et al 2002 bergman et al 2013 are of particular importance broadly contamination of human excreta derived nutrients can be reduced by preventing the use and emission of potential contaminants or by influencing their fate during collection and treatment of human excreta measures to control emissions for instance have led to a significant reduction of heavy metal concentrations in sewage sludge in sweden from the 1970s onwards kirchmann et al 2017 controlling emissions of other substances is more difficult since the number of such substances is orders of magnitude larger than that of metals separate collection of human excreta without mixing with domestic and industrial used water or stormwater has the potential to limit contamination to only the substances present in human excreta separate collection of human excreta may however not be feasible or preferable in all situations and places for instance with regard to existing infrastructures investment costs or user preferences while several treatment processes exist that can partially or fully remove or break down some of the organic compounds of concern high operation costs and the formation of by products remain a challenge luo et al 2014 moreover complete decomposition of organic compounds often results in loss of volatiles containing carbon nitrogen and sulfur nutrient recirculation would benefit from further efforts to reduce or avoid contamination of human excreta at the source and during collection as well as from widespread use of advanced treatment processes another promising strategy to reduce contamination would be the design and use of less recalcitrant organic chemicals such as pharmaceuticals and synthetic hormones that are readily bio degradable daughton and ruhoy 2011 leder et al 2015 2 6 nutrient reuse in non food biomass production may not lead to circular nutrient flows once recovered human excreta derived nutrients can be used in both food and non food biomass production recycling of human excreta derived nutrients to the production of non food biomass for example in forestry marron 2015 and biofuel production canter et al 2015 or on green roofs and sports fields represents a nutrient loss from food production at least at shorter time scales in other words in such a scenario there is a risk that nutrient recovery and reuse simply substitutes two linear pathways fertilizer to food production to nutrient dissipation and fertilizer to non food production to nutrient dissipation with one longer one fertilizer to food production to non food production to nutrient dissipation this means that human excreta derived nutrients may still become dispersed into the environment despite initial recovery and reuse in non food biomass production from a nutrient circularity perspective it is important that nutrients in food products can find their way back to food products in this regard reframing highlights the importance of considering whether nutrient recirculation from human excreta via the production of non food products to food production increases or reduces the contaminant load potentially entering food production when recirculating nutrient rich products 3 conclusions with the present paper we echo calls for major transdisciplinary efforts in research policy and practice to develop assess and implement alternative human excreta management practices this paper brings attention to the fact that the framing of an issue impacts how the problem is perceived as well as the weighting of inevitable trade offs we highlight that if human excreta management is framed as part of food and farming systems several aspects call for more attention if we are to guide human excreta management towards long term soil food and nutrient security ensuring extensive nutrient recovery a broader perspective on nutrient recirculation than the present focus on phosphorus and nitrogen acknowledgement of diverse farming systems that are potential recipients of nutrient rich products ensuring that recovered products are compatible with farming systems that are conducive to long term soil and ecosystem health development and use of less recalcitrant organic chemicals to benefit recirculation solutions that render products that retain organic matter differentiation of recovery and reuse solutions that re circulate nutrients to food production and those that do not the reframing of human excreta management as part of food and farming systems was chosen because of the double challenge of urbanization and providing food for a growing population there are of course other possible ways to frame human excreta management that we acknowledge and respect what is important is a well informed dialogue on how different frames of human excreta management in a global and various local contexts impact the outcome including considerations of social acceptance technology availability or economic conditions that were not touched upon in this paper a constructive dialogue on how human excreta management can best support future agricultural production would benefit from a consolidation of existing evidence on relevant aspects of human excreta management under different frames irrespective of the chosen frame food and agriculture are inevitably linked to human excreta management funding this work was supported by the swedish research council for environment agricultural sciences and spatial planning formas grant

17996,recognition of human excreta as a resource rather than as waste has led to the emergence of a range of new and innovative nutrient recovery solutions nevertheless the management of human excreta remains largely rooted in current sanitation and wastewater management approaches which often makes nutrient recovery an add on to existing infrastructures in this paper we argue that framing human excreta management as a resource recovery challenge within waste management obscures important trade offs we explore the factors that would be brought to the fore by reframing human excreta management as part of food and farming systems we find that such a reframing would accentuate at least six aspects of critical importance that are currently largely overlooked recognizing that the proposed framing may also have its limitations we argue that it has the potential to better guide human excreta management towards long term global food soil and nutrient security while reducing the risk of compromising other priorities related to human and environmental health graphical abstract image 1 keywords human excreta management nutrient management nutrient recovery wastewater management sanitation resource recovery 1 introduction finding ways to feed a growing and increasingly urbanized population while reducing environmental and social impacts is a major global challenge foley et al 2011 willett et al 2019 one of the key prerequisites to achieving and maintaining global food security is improved nutrient management along the entire food chain which includes farming practices food processing consumer behavior and waste management mcconville et al 2015 better nutrient management also includes the recirculation of nutrients from human excreta to food production drangert et al 2018 trimmer and guest 2018 in most cultures human excreta has historically been used for fertilization and soil improvement ferguson 2014 however the introduction of the water closet and sewer networks that is waterborne sanitation has led to a decoupling from food production ferguson 2014 other contributing factors are increased urbanization and the industrialization of farming systems jones et al 2013 characterized by specialization and widespread use of mineral fertilizers and pesticides taken together these factors have profoundly altered nutrient flows at the local regional and global scales leading to a linearization and globalization of nutrient flows as illustrated and explained in fig 1 it has become increasingly evident over the past few decades that the patterns of nutrient flows associated with current approaches to farming and human excreta management are unsustainable steffen et al 2015 global estimates of current recirculation rates are highly variable but suggest that at most 15 percent of nitrogen and 55 percent of phosphorus in human excreta are recirculated to cropland trimmer et al 2017 also emissions of nutrients from human excreta to water bodies are projected to increase even further in the future due to increased population and urbanization van drecht et al 2009 as well as the widespread perception of waterborne sanitation as the gold standard del carmen morales et al 2014 concerns about nutrient pollution in freshwater and marine environments glibert et al 2014 combined with the anticipation of insecurities related to future phosphorus supplies cordell et al 2009 have fuelled the development of new and innovative human excreta management solutions that facilitate the recovery of nutrients and organic matter from human excreta for reuse in agriculture haddaway et al 2019 harder et al 2019 the development of nutrient recovery and reuse solutions reflects an ongoing shift from perceiving human excreta as waste towards recognizing its value as a resource and is part of a broader trend towards more comprehensive resource recovery in the sanitation and wastewater management sectors larsen and gujer 1997 otterpohl et al 1997 wilsenach et al 2003 larsen et al 2009 verstraete et al 2009 peccia and westerhoff 2015 several scholars have in fact highlighted that new and innovative sanitation and wastewater management solutions that embrace resource recovery have the potential to enhance multiple ecosystem services trimmer et al 2019a and contribute to the achievement of multiple sustainable development goals sdgs andersson et al 2016 andersson et al 2018 trimmer et al 2017 orner and mihelcic 2018 although human excreta is increasingly recognized as a resource its management is still largely rooted in current sanitation and wastewater management approaches simha and ganesapillai 2017 under these premises nutrient recovery often becomes an add on to existing infrastructures it is well documented that the way in which an issue is framed has a major impact on the perception of what the problem is and how it might be handled vliegenthart and van zoonen 2011 halffman 2019 we acknowledge that a reframing of human excreta management could take many forms and would like to highlight that any framing whether implicit or explicit will inevitably lead to certain aspects and perspectives being prioritized over others recognizing that this is also true for the proposed framing we argue that reframing human excreta management as part of food and farming systems has the potential to shift the perception of opportunities and challenges and can reveal central trade offs that are currently underrated since vocabulary guides our thinking schön 1993 we believe that a shift in thought patterns and framing also requires a shift in terminology much of the current vocabulary related to human excreta management is rooted in the perception of human excreta as waste and contributes to the technological institutional and mental lock in to conventional solutions for example the terms human waste and wastewater directly allude to the notion of waste similarly the term sewage requires sewers and wastewater implies the use of water as means of transportation therefore we have chosen to avoid these terms and consistently speak of human excreta streams that contain human excreta and human excreta management 2 underrated aspects of human excreta management that reframing brings to the fore there are natural linkages between agriculture food and human excreta management we find that reframing human excreta management as a part of food and farming systems would give prominence to at least six aspects that are currently largely overlooked as illustrated in fig 2 we propose that better consideration of these aspects has the potential to contribute to global food soil and nutrient security in the long term the six underrated aspects are elaborated upon below while presented separately they are connected and there are potential synergies among them 2 1 prioritizing nutrient recovery and reuse globally the potential contribution of nutrient recovery to meet fertilizer

17997,due to the increase of emerging contaminants in water how to use new treatment technology to make up for the defects of traditional wastewater treatment method has become one of the research hotspots at present intimate coupling of photocatalysis and biodegradation icpb as a novel wastewater treatment method which combines the advantages of biological treatment and photocatalytic reactions has shown a great potential as a low cost environmental friendly and sustainable treatment technology the system mainly consists of photocatalytic materials porous carriers and biofilm the key principle of icpb is to transform bio recalcitrant pollutants into biodegradable products by photocatalysis on the surface of porous carriers the biodegradable products were mineralized simultaneously through the biofilm inside the carriers because of the protection of the carriers the microorganism can remain active even under the uv light the mechanical force of water flow or the attack of free radicals icpb breaks the traditional concept that photocatalytic reaction and biodegradation must be separated in different reactors improves the purification capacity of sewage and

abstract image 10454 keywords intimate coupling photocatalysis biodegradation wastewater treatment mechanisms 1 introduction with the increasing of the varied emerging contaminants in water the traditional sewage treatment technology represented by the activated sludge process is difficult to degrade the emerging recalcitrant contaminants with high concentrations and complex structures deng et al 2017b 2018b tang et al 2016b van loosdrecht and brdjanovic 2014 even though some organic pollutants are biodegradable their biodegradation tends to be slow and happens only at low concentration due to inhibition marsolek et al 2007 therefore how to preserve the advantages of biological treatment technology and to integrate it with new sewage treatment technologies to realize win win has become the current research hotspot microbial treatment technology has been coupled with membrane technology advanced oxidation processes aops electrochemical techniques and other emerging treatment technologies wang et al 2016b 2016c yan et al 2012 yang et al 2015a for aops most of the previous attempts to combine treatments have been done by carrying out aops and biological treatment separately or by sequential coupling method brosillon et al 2008 hong and zeng 2002 sirtori et al 2009 aops are fast acting but indiscriminate degradation relying on free radical reactions which can produce a series of excessive oxidation li et al 2011 marsolek et al 2008 photocatalytic oxidation technology began as early as 1972 zhang et al 2012a some semiconductor photocatalytic materials e g tio2 bi2wo6 can produce oh o2 and other reactive oxidative species ros under light excitation and the generated ros can attack the ring and chain so that the refractory organic matters can be transformed into the biodegradable intermediates deng et al 2016 2018a feng et al 2018 tang et al 2016a wang et al 2016a 2018 the traditional idea that photocatalytic reaction and biological treatment are difficult to be carried out in the same reactor is mainly due to the fact that the photocatalytic reaction is fast and indiscriminate so it is hard to control the products of photocatalytic reaction to the biodegradable category yan et al 2016 however if photocatalysis and biodegradation occur at the same time problems in sequential treatment can be optimized and reduced which is named intimate coupling li et al 2012b intimate coupling of photocatalysis and biodegradation icpb is one way to overcome the uncertainties of sequential processing such as the uncertainty of photocatalysis intermediates icpb not only removed the recalcitrant organic pollution but also increased mineralization efficiency and lowered operating costs marsolek et al 2008 have successfully proved the idea of icpb for the first time in a photocatalytic circulating bed biofilm reactor pcbbr that utilized macroporous cellulose carriers and tio2 to remove 2 4 5 trichlorophenol tcp depending on the type of light source icpb can be divided into two types uv light induced photocatalysis and biodegradation upcb and visible light induced photocatalysis and biodegradation vpcb zhou et al 2015 in icpb the photodegradation and biodegradation processes work together in one reactor so that the biodegradable intermediates produced by photodegradation can be biodegraded at once icpb offered potential for the photodegradation and biodegradation of a range of recalcitrant and toxic organic pollutants including tcp marsolek et al 2014 dinitrotoluene wen et al 2012 nitrobenzene yang et al 2015a dyes li et al 2012a and tetracycline hydrochloride tch xiong et al 2018 there are some works on icpb but the research on icpb is still in its infancy their characteristics are still difficult to understand and more potential are largely undiscovered the importance of this emerging field requires timely review of recent developments to promote progress in this area the aim of this review is to summarize the state of the art progresses of icpb system from the mechanisms possibly involved in icpb to the development of photocatalysis materials carriers biofilms and reactor configurations and finally the varied application in recent years conclusions and future prospects are also proposed this review will provide theoretical principles and novel insights for better future applications and innovative design of icpb in wastewater treatment 2 mechanisms of icpb 2 1 the synergistic effect of adsorption photocatalysis and biodegradation icpb as a novel wastewater treatment technology has shown great potential for enhancing the removal and mineralization of bio refractory pollutants the mechanisms possibly acting in icpb are proposed in fig 1 the porous carrier can adsorb bio refractory pollutants from the solution and enhance its mass transfer to the surface of the photocatalysts where various ros are generated thus promoting the photocatalytic degradation of the pollutants in the process of photocatalytic degradation photocatalyst absorbs photon energy photons energy hv bandgap energy eg of photocatalyst which causes electron e to transfer from the valence band vb to the conduction band cb and generates electron hole pairs at the same time organic contaminants are attacked and destroyed by ros such as oh o2 and h deng et al 2017a lin et al 2011 tang et al 2018 wang et al 2017 the products produced by photocatalysis are transferred into the carrier and biodegraded within the biofilms which is further completely mineralized into co2 and water the biodegradation process also involves that photoelectrons generated by photocatalyst can be transferred to biofilms through c type cytochromes the timely biodegradation of photocatalytic products avoids the damage of microbial metabolism and unfavorable oxidation undoubtedly adsorption photocatalysis and biodegradation in the icpb system occur simultaneously rather than completely independent in icpb the shear forces and the generated free radicals can cause the biofilm detaching from the carrier surface particularly the biofilm that are directly adhered to the photocatalyst material thus biodegradation gradually decreases with the continuous enhancement of photocatalysis rittmann 2018 when the photocatalytic effect increases to a certain degree to produce more biodegradable intermediates the organics in the solution could be conducive to the formation of biofilms in return biodegradation increases biofilms may begin to recover on the photocatalyst this process plays a balancing role in icpb this balance adjustment is called synergistic effect dong et al 2016 2 2 self regulation mechanism self regulation is of great significance for reaching a balance between photocatalysis and biodegradation to achieve icpb in an ideal icpb most microorganisms are located into the carriers and almost no biofilm attached to the outside of the carrier marsolek s work showed that biomass initially separated from the outer surfaces of carrier possibly owing to physical loss and exposure to uv light then the biomass regrew associated with acetate degradation which confirmed that bacteria were protected in the interior of the macroporous carrier marsolek et al 2008 bacteria may produce soluble microbial products smps and extracellular polymeric substances epss to protect themselves probably by scavenging free radicals the enhanced consumption of acetate and production of smps and epss supported that bacteria are active then bacteria close to where photocatalytic reactions occurred could remove biodegradable products that were initially produced leaving ros concentrated nearby the bio recalcitrant compounds live cells grow inside the carrier but most cells near the outer surface are dead due to the attack by the radicals and light irradiation even inside the carrier the biofilm layer shows a gradient from live to dead suggesting the self regulation mechanism of icpb when the photocatalytic reactants invaded the macropores dong et al 2016 2 3 co substrate and competition mechanism as reported by previous studies non chlorinated phenols can improve the biodegradation efficiency of 4 chlorophenol 4 cp by promoting microbial growth through the use of less toxic substrates zhang and tay 2015 and biological activity of the induced non specific enzymes monsalvo et al 2009 they can also be photodegraded thus competing with 4 cp for photo generated ros involved in the photodegradation one method for enhancing biodegradation is to offer an easily biodegradable substrate to stimulate an active biofilm community marsolek and rittmann 2016 an organic small molecule as a co substrate can supply electron donor with more biomass synthesis and promote photocatalytic reactions bai et al 2015 kim et al 2014 for example xiong et al used sodium acetate naac as the electron donor and carbon source for microbial growth the addition of acetate led to more active biomass which promoted faster biodegradation of non recalcitrant organics thus reducing competition for free radicals among the recalcitrant fraction xiong et al 2018 3 advances in photocatalytic materials carriers and biofilms for icpb 3 1 photocatalytic materials for icpb to date many photocatalytic materials have been developed to treat wastewater in icpb the most studied photocatalytic materials are tio2 based photocatalysts such as sio2 tio2 zhang et al 2016a ag tio2 xiong et al 2017 n tio2 zhou et al 2017 and er3 yalo3 tio2 zhou et al 2015 other photocatalysts have also been developed to enhance the degradation efficiency of refractory pollutants in these two years such as bi12o17cl2 ding et al 2018 and mn3o4 mno2 ag3po4 cai et al 2019 more detailed information in table 1 3 1 1 ultraviolet light photocatalysts tio2 has great photocatalytic activities due to its good chemical stability non toxicity cost effectiveness and high reactivity under ultraviolet light irradiation the easy separation of tio2 catalyst accommodated in pcbbr after wastewater treatment can help apply this catalyst in industrial practice pelaez et al 2012 schneider et al 2014 wu et al 2014 zhang et al 2014a marsolek et al directly coated tio2 on the surface of the carrier producing a hybrid photocatalytic biological carrier for the first time by using a sol gel technique marsolek et al 2008 however the practical application of tio2 is restricted by three major limitations i the low load ratio of tio2 on the carrier sun et al 2013 xiong and zhao 2013 yoo et al 2013 ii the low photon utilization rate luo et al 2013 zhang et al 2013 zhou et al 2013 iii the low recovery of tio2 chalasani and vasudevan 2013 tang et al 2013 in order to increase the load ratio of tio2 on the carrier in icpb li et al 2012b increased the loading amount of tio2 on the carrier by a modified method firstly titanium isopropanol nitric acid trimesic acid were mixed with the blank carrier and then the liquid was vaporized at 80 c then they changed the loading method by reducing the content of titanium in the mixture from 134 g l to 100 g l finally the carrier loaded with 0 40 g l tio2 was obtained by removing the additive trimesic acid and the coating efficiency reached 83 the optimization of new carrier coating method obtained a thinner and well distributed tio2 coating greatly enhancing the photocatalytic efficiency and adherence strength xing et al 2014 designed a novel porous crystalline anatase tio2 by frozen casting method based on camphene the ordered mesoporous tio2 with good thermal stability could enhance photon utilization ratio and the photocatalytic efficiency li et al 2013 shi et al 2013 besides mesoporous nano tio2 has been proved to be an excellent photocatalyst owing to its large surface area and ordered porous structure thus improving the surface reactive sites and contaminants adsorption jiang et al 2013 as is known to all good crystallinity of anatase type tio2 is one of the key factors to improve its photocatalytic performance er et al 2014 xing et al 2014 the heat treatment method is used to change mesoporous tio2 from amorphous to crystalline but it leads to unnecessary growth and complete destruction of ordered structure deng et al 2013 li et al 2014 wang et al 2014 zhang et al 2016a induced the good thermal stability ordered mesoporous sio2 tio2 compounds in order to improve the photocatalytic performance of tio2 the introduction of sio2 can restrain the anatase to rutile phase transformation and preserve the ordered mesoporous structure and high crystallinity of tio2 even after being calcined at 800 c the prepared ordered mesoporous mixed materials not only have good thermal stability but also improve the specific surface area and the recovery of photocatalysts 3 1 2 visible light photocatalysts the range of the photocatalysts induction to light and the penetration of light in water are two extremely important factors for icpb lim and kim 2004 the uv spectrum response for photocatalysts activation is often accompanied by high operating costs and can damage the biofilm outside the carrier in order to expand the range of photo response of tio2 for solar spectrum different methods have been designed such as noble metals incorporation ni et al 2007 non metals fujishima et al 2008 and transition metals doping litter 1999 firstly noble metals have a lower fermi level than tio2 photocatalyst is deposited on the surface of tio2 to enhance charge separation ni et al 2007 xiong et al prepared visible light driven ag doped tio2 in icpb xiong et al 2017 the photocatalyst coating process used a sol gel and evaporation induced self assembly eisa method ag doped on the crystal lattice or surface of tio2 could trap photo generated electrons or holes thus promoting electron hole separation in photocatalysis process xiong et al 2018 this new icpb method had a good ability to mineralize pollutants and protect the biofilm under visible light irradiation which was called vpcb dong et al 2016 zhou et al 2015 in addition to doping with noble metals non metal doping can also enhance the photocatalytic performance and practicability of tio2 catalysts fujishima et al 2008 among the various dopants nitrogen n is the most widely investigated and the most promising results have been obtained extending the absorption edge of tio2 to the visible region fujishima et al 2008 qiu and burda 2007 by using n doped tio2 n tio2 the icpb photo anode could respond to visible light teng et al 2013 wen et al 2012 zhou et al 2017 successfully fabricated an electrochemical cell with the carbon foam based on n tio2 icpb anode the unique properties of n tio2 made it have high reactivity and suitability the enhanced visible light activity of n tio2 was attributed to the bandgap reduction by n doping in tio2 structure or as an alternative to the oxygen lattice sites ananpattarachai et al 2009 it was found that self assembly technique was useful for preparing monodispersed tio2 layers with high loading amount at low temperatures a visible light responsive photocatalyst er3 yalo3 tio2 hybrid composite was prepared by sol gel technique and hydrothermal treatment in the range of 90 170 c dong et al 2015 2016 zhang et al 2017b zhou et al 2015 possible mechanism of the enhanced photocatalytic reactivity in er3 yalo3 tio2 was proposed in fig 2 dong et al 2015 er3 yalo3 tio2 was an effective up conversion system that converted visible light into ultraviolet light under the excitation light the er3 yalo3 tio2 as an up conversion agent firstly absorbed the visible light and then emitted uv thus the uv effectively excited the tio2 to start the photocatalytic process as described in fig 1 leading to the enhanced photocatalytic degradation of mo in the vpcb in a sum the conventional photocatalytic materials in icpb system are mainly tio2 based photocatalysts the trend is to develop more efficient and inexpensive visible light photocatalysts for which more researches need to be carried out ding et al used an inexpensive and highly efficient belt shaped one dimensional oxygen rich bi12o17cl2 as a visible light photocatalyst in icpb system ding et al 2018 the result showed a removal rate of oxytetracycline of 94 moreover many potential efficient photocatalysts are proposed here as substitutes for classical tio2 based photocatalysts including i g c3n4 based photocatalysts such as p doped g c3n4 deng et al 2017b and w18o49 g c3n4 deng et al 2018a ii bi based photocatalysts such as bi2wo6 wang et al 2018 and bivo4 chen et al 2017 iii agpo4 based photocatalysts such as mn3o4 mno2 ag3po4 cai et al 2019 and ag3po4 fe3o4 wang et al 2019 these photocatalytic materials not only extend the range of photo response to visible or even near infrared light but also promote the separation of photoinduced charges and holes which has great application potential in icpb system 3 2 carriers of icpb as one of the important components of the icpb system the carrier needs to have a wet density similar to that of water in order to be adequately stirred during aeration this can not only keep the carrier in contact with pollutants but also ensure the continuous exchange of degradation products besides large porosity and good biocompatibility are also required on the one hand it provides the loading matrix for the photocatalytic materials on the other hand it provides the sites for the adhesion of the biofilm at the same time the microbes growing in the pores can keep their own activity because they can avoid the impact of uv light free radicals and abrasion which can guarantee the icpb system to work well rittmann 2018 the following sections outline a few representative carriers that are suitable to be used in icpb system such as cellulose carrier marsolek et al 2008 ceramic carrier xing et al 2014 polyurethane sponge li et al 2011 and polyurethane foam puf zhang et al 2016a 3 2 1 the cellulose carrier when marsolek et al first put forward the concept of icpb in 2008 the carrier was porous cellulose with side length of 4 mm marsolek et al 2008 the surface of the material was positively charged and it had certain adsorption ability for the pollutants in water the density of this cellulose dressing of 1 04 g cm 3 was close to that of water and the average porosity was 0 93 the dressing had good biocompatibility and the microorganism could be loaded well on the whole carrier during the process of biofilm hanging in the cellulose carrier supported icpb the removal efficiency of acetate was 100 it also confirmed that the process of photocatalytic reaction and biodegradation could exist in the same reactor under reasonable experimental design the porous cellulose was also used in fluidized bed biodegradation of quinolone machado et al 2006 3 2 2 the ceramic carrier although the cellulose carrier have an ideal pore structure and can be used to accumulate and protect the bacteria the carrier will be oxidized and charred gradually under the attack of hydroxyl radical marsolek et al 2008 besides the low loading capacity of cellulose dressing carrier for photocatalytic materials can not maintain the photocatalytic property of icpb for a long time ceramic carrier with rough surface is resistant to radical attack and helpful to increase the loaded amount of photocatalytic material its wet density ranges from 1 03 to 1 05 g cm3 which can float on the surface of liquid under aeration condition so it is suitable for circulation in application it could strongly adsorb pollutants in the solution and protect microorganisms inside from uv irradiation and free radicals wen et al 2012 zhang et al 2012b xing et al 2014 reported that camphor as a three dimensional 3d connected network of frozen vehicles could sublimate in the ceramic body and leave macroporous channels the obtained ceramic had a layered mesoporous structure with average size of 8 8 2 mm3 and the average mass of one piece was 20 mg the prepared mesoporous tio2 ceramic carrier exhibited both great mechanical stability and good recyclability the obtained ceramics supported icpb had good adsorption and photocatalytic activity for the degradation of octane and rhodamine b rhb the total organic carbon toc removal rate after degradation for 3 h reached 98 8 and 98 6 respectively 3 2 3 the polyurethane sponge ideally the carrier should have a proportion similar to that of water in order to have a good circulation in pcbbr a suitable size of macroporous structure to accumulate biomass and protect them from the influence of uv free radical attack polyurethane sponge as a commercial product has both large porosity and good biocompatibility it has been used in biological packing air filter and cosmetics industry li et al 2012b li et al 2011 used the commercial polyurethane sponge fig 3 as the carrier of photocatalytic materials and microbes the size of this sponge type cube was 3 5 0 3 mm which was beneficial to shelter biofilm inside while enhancing photocatalysis outside the surface the carrier had a specific surface area of 4 8 m2 g and high porosity 88 the internal pore size was 50 500 μm and its wet density 1 01 1 02 g cm3 was close to the water these properties not only provided sufficient porosity to support the loading of photocatalytic materials and growth of microorganisms but also ensured the free flow of water in the polyurethane sponge at the same time wen et al compared the porous ceramic materials with the polyurethane sponge wen et al 2012 they found that the time for biofilm growth in polyurethane foam was about 10 d while porous ceramics needed about 30 d furthermore it was also found that smaller carriers may provide a larger surface area to volume ratio to enable more catalysts to be exposed on the surface of the carrier zhou et al reported a polyurethane cube with a side length of 2 mm as an ideal smaller porous sponge carrier for the icpb reaction finally removal efficiency of phenol by vpcb was promoted to 99 8 the wet density of the original and photocatalyst coated sponge was 0 89 and 1 04 g ml respectively with 100 300 μm in the pore size and 87 in porosity xiong et al 2018 zhou et al 2015 3 2 4 the polyurethane foam in addition to the aforementioned carriers zhang et al 2016a designed ordered mesoporous sio2 tio2 composite with high thermal stability and firstly coated it on the macroporous puf as a layered mesoporous biofilm carrier the puf carrier had a 3d macroporous network structure with an average length of 1 cm and an average pore size of 2 mm its density was 0 8 g cm3 and it was easy to fluidize puf in water under the normal aeration intensity the total organic carbon toc removal efficiency of 2 4 5 tcp was up to 97 5 in the macroporous puf supported icpb in general puf has been commercialized for icpb system with good economic viability moreover many potential alternatives to carriers in icpb system are proposed i three dimensional graphene gels such as hydrogels and aerogels have been widely used in various fields due to their high porosity low density and conductivity he et al 2018 ii mofs have attracted a lot of interests in adsorption catalysis optoelectronic devices gas storage and separation and drug delivery owing to the easy tunability of pore size and shape and large specific surface areas wu et al 2017 iii agar is widely used in the preparation of medium and polymer hybrid hydrogels and can also be used in the field of catalysis zhang et al 2016b iv melamine foam has been applied to the loading of photocatalysts due to its porous structure and superhydrophilicity geng et al 2019 these potential carriers are promising materials used in icpb system for the treatment of water pollutants 3 3 biofilms of icpb biofilms are the accumulation of microorganisms attached to a solid surface and exist ubiquitous in natural environment rittmann 2018 in icpb system biofilms biodegrade photocatalytic intermediates to realize further mineralization upcb have worse mineralization capability because of the release of smps caused by cell lysis smps are likely to be released into the effluent when radicals attacked the biofilm the poor mineralization of upcb is also due to the serious separation of the biofilms and the activity of microbe is reduced after attack by uv irradiation zhou et al compared upcb with vcpb for the degradation of phenol for the first time zhou et al 2015 it was found that the microbial communities in the carrier were well protected under visible light irradiation and the secretion of epss was also enhanced as we mentioned before bacteria may produce epss to protect themselves by scavenging free radicals in the icbp process biofilm has considerable substrate removal capability which is a major factor in the removal of chemical oxygen demand cod or dissolved organic carbon doc li et al 2011 marsolek et al 2008 zhang et al 2010 xiong et al 2017 cultured un acclimated activated sludge to form biofilm in the porous carriers a rich biofilm adhered on the core and outer surface of the carriers and it was bridged with a large number of epss the biofilm in vpcb was adapted to the utilization of photocatalytic intermediates which enhanced by 20 in cod removal fig 4 shows the changes to the genus level microbial community structure during vpcb before tetracycline hydrochloride was degraded the prevailing genus were massilia acinetobacter janthinobacterium and pseudomonas which were common genus in the treatment of biological wastewater zhang et al 2011a after the degradation of tch methylibium runella comamonas and pseudomonas were enriched in the biofilms in the vpcb carriers which were known for their biodegradation of aromatics and tch resistance it indicated that vpcb worked well during the tch degradation process icpb can overcome the bio refractory nature of organic contaminants by using active biofilms and photocatalysis 4 configurations of pcbbr according to the deployment of photocatalysts pcbbr for wastewater treatment can usually be divided into two major configurations 1 pcbbr with suspended photocatalysts and 2 pcbbr with immobilized photocatalysts the two major configurations differ in that the first needs further separation from water to recover the photocatalysts while the latter allows a continuous operation for the latter one there are two groups according to the types of the light source 1 uv light responsive photocatalytic circulating bed biofilm reactor upcbbr and 2 visible light responsive photocatalytic circulating bed biofilm reactor vpcbbr 4 1 pcbbr with suspended photocatalysts in pcbbr with suspended photocatalysts the photocatalysts are uniformly dispersed in the feed solution and carriers are independently applied to protect the biofilms an obvious advantage of this system is that the photocatalysts have sufficient contact with pollutants due to the large specific surface area while the pcbbr with immobilized photocatalysts is often hindered by the mass transfer limitation on the photocatalyst coated carriers in addition a large amount of photocatalyst is feasible to be applied in the suspension system but in the immobilized pcbbr system photocatalyst is much less due to the limited surface area of the carrier as shown in fig 5 a typical slurry typed pcbbr system was used for 2 4 5 tcp and acetate removal marsolek et al 2008 the biofilms in pcbbr accumulated in the macroporous carriers were well protected from uv light chemical toxicity ros and physical loss while oxidation reaction occurred on the slurry typed tio2 photocatalyst the volume of the liquid in the laboratory scale pcbbr was 122 ml liquid circulation was realized by aeration which also supplied dissolved oxygen do for photodegradation and biodegradation the influent entered the reactor by a micro pulse pump uv light illuminated at the lower half of a reactor increasing the reflection of high intensity light the results showed that the slurry typed pcbbr system almost completely removed tcp in which photocatalysts were responsible for the rapid removal of tcp and biofilms inside the carriers contributed to removing the cod photocatalysts can be separated through adding a sedimentation basin or a filtration system so that the slurry reactor can be continuously operated chong et al 2010 4 2 pcbbr with immobilized photocatalysts in pcbbr with immobilized photocatalysts the photocatalysts are fixed on the surface of carriers which are beneficial to the separation of the photocatalysts from the wastewater and avoids secondary pollution and photocatalysts loss the carriers can act as not only the support for photocatalysts but also the ideal place for biofilm accumulation we have summarized the different methods of coating carriers with a catalyst layer on the surface including sol gel low temperature sintering method eisa and ultrasonically dispersed and evaporation table 1 the following part describes typical configurations of different light position or different light source types fig 6 a shows a laboratory scale upcbbr made of quartz glass with a volume of 150 ml and suspended circulating carriers on the rising and falling sides li et al 2011 except for the 18 cm long side of the riser the upcbbr was covered with aluminum foil to reflect uv light water and carrier circulation was realized through aeration by an air lift pump which also supplied do at an aeration rate of 21 ml min and the feed water was provided at a rate of 0 4 ml min the upcbbr was illuminated by two uv lamps with an intensity of 3 0 mwatt cm2 and located on the exposed part of the reactor the total illumination volume was about 41 cm3 accounting for 27 of the total volume of the upcbbr fig 6b presents the schematic diagram and photo of upcbbr which used a 1 l quartz glass reactor zhang et al 2016a unlike the common pcbbr the quartz sleeve was placed in the middle of the reactor while the uv lamp was placed in the quartz sleeve liquid circulation was realized by aeration at the bottom of the reactor to increase the light utilization by reflecting light the outside of upcbbr was covered with aluminum foil the pcbbr was kept at a room temperature of 12 2 c the results showed that 100 mg l of phenol and 20 mg l of 2 4 5 tcp could be totally degraded by running the reactor for 3 h and 6 h respectively the two pcbbr systems described above were both operated under uv light irradiation zhou et al 2015 compared the effect of uv light and visible light on degrading phenol in pcbbr as a result the removal rate of phenol by the vpcbbr was 99 8 which was 32 6 higher than that of the upcbbr biofilm was severely shed due to uv irradiation resulting in poor removal efficiency of phenol in upcbbr as shown in fig 7 ma et al 2015 designed a vpcbbr the reactor was an internal loop air driven reactor with a volume of 540 ml filled with approximately 750 sponge carriers and operated at 20 2 c the vpcbbr draft tube is a plexiglass tube with a diameter of 40 mm a height of 130 mm and a bottom aerator of 40 mm the oxygen was provided by an aeration pump with an aeration rate of 480 g o2 g phenol h 1 and a flow rate of 10 6 mm s the vpcbbr was irradiated by visible light from two opposing led panels which were placed approximately 10 cm each side of the reactor the highest phenol removal efficiency 99 8 and mineralization 67 1 capability was observed within 16 h in vpcbbr both configurations of pcbbr with suspended or immobilized photocatalysts have their own characteristics and limitations table 2 briefly summarizes the main advantages and disadvantages of these two types of pcbbr 5 applications wastewater treatment can be more sustainable if it can recycle energy and other resources while removing recalcitrant organic pollutants li et al 2015 arb could conduct electrons to the cathode which makes it possible to generate electricity hydrogen gas or other valuable resources li et al 2015 sharma et al 2014 under the action of photocatalytic reaction and microorganism icpb system can achieve high efficiency and rapid treatment of refractory pollutants it has good practical application prospect in environmental purification icpb has been proven to be suitable for many bio recalcitrant organic pollutants including phenol dong et al 2016 zhang et al 2010 nitrobenzene yang et al 2015a quinolone yan et al 2013 dyes li et al 2012a and so on recent studies on the practical applications of icpb in the treatment of wastewater and energy production are summarized in table 3 5 1 degradation of nitrogenous compounds quinoline c9h7n is a typical nitrogenous heterocyclic compound that is recalcitrant to be biodegraded which is widely used in dye rubber pharmaceutical food and chemical industries felczak et al 2014 the sequentially and intimately coupling ability of photolysis and biodegradation were simultaneously investigated to improve the removal rate of quinoline and the kinetics of quinoline mineralization in the internal loop photo biodegradation reactor ilpbr the maximum quinoline removal efficiency rmax increased by 9 and the half maximum rate concentration ks decreased by 55 compared to sequentially coupling the results showed that the biodegradation rate of quinoline was about twice of that in the sequentially coupling system both intimate coupling and sequential coupling systems increased the degree of mineralization by 18 and 5 respectively therefore the simultaneous photocatalysis and biodegradation in ilpbr was superior to sequentially coupling yan et al 2013 2 4 dinitrotoluene 2 4 dnt an intermediate in the manufacture of polyurethanes and dyes is easy to disperse in soil and groundwater when not handled properly dontsova et al 2009 wen et al employed icpb system degrading 2 4 dnt wen et al 2012 although the final degradation efficiency of 2 4 dnt by icpb was similar to that in solo photocatalytic degradation the results showed that the conversion ratios of the organic nitrogen to nh4 n no2 n and no3 n in icpb were much higher than the latter therefore the intermediate products of photocatalysis and photodegradation were further destroyed by microorganism which promoted the degradation of 2 4 dnt 5 2 degradation of phenolic compounds phenolic compounds are typical examples of bio recalcitrant toxic contaminants exhibited in the wastewater from various industries such as the production of fungicides herbicides and textiles su et al 2012 wu et al 2012 yang et al 2015b zhou et al 2015 compared the effects of vpcb and upcb on the degradation of phenol fig 8 the photocatalyst was doped with both er3 and yalo3 into tio2 coated on the sponge carriers the removal efficiency of phenol in the vpcb reached 99 8 which was 32 6 higher than that in the upcb the photocatalytic and biodegradation reactions were tightly coupled in the vpcb leading to 63 9 removal of doc which further showed the synergistic action of photocatalysis and biodegradation theoretically the degradation of chlorophenol can be accelerated by a co substrate or be inhibited by the competition of ros zhang et al investigated the effect of phenol and pyrocatechol on the degradation of 4 cp zhang et al 2017a the removal rate of 4 cp was 51 increasing to 62 after phenol addition at the same time the dechlorination efficiency of 4 cp increased from 47 to 63 in contrast the addition of pyrocatechol reduced the removal rate of 4 cp to 32 the difference in the results was due to the additional electron donor offered by the photodegradation product of phenol to the bacteria which promoted the degradation of 4 cp while the pyrocatechol competed with 4 cp for ros to inhibit its degradation in the treatment of phenolic compounds by icbp competition for ros and co substrate performances should be considered 5 3 degradation of reactive dyes among various pollutants organic dyes are one of the most widely used chemicals mainly from textiles cosmetics paper leather and other industries he et al 2018 icpb could further mineralize many reactive dyes such as reactive dye black 5 rb5 li et al 2012a methyl orange mo dong et al 2016 and rhb xing et al 2014 the degradation and mineralization of rb5 by a novel bio recalcitrant coated biofilm carrier with icpb were studied in a pcbbr li et al 2012a compared with the low mineralization portion of rb5 in photocatalytic reaction the removal efficiency of dyes and cod by the system could reach 97 and 65 respectively not only was the highly efficient degradation of rb5 realized but also the intermediate products of photocatalytic reaction were further mineralized photocatalysis was the main cause of dye loss but biodegradation led to the most removal of cod it was also proved indirectly that the system could run stably under low ph conditions 5 4 degradation of antibiotics the prevalence of antibiotics in aquatic systems has become an environmental issue due to that it may result in antibiotic resistant pathogens zhang et al 2014a 2014b degradation of tetracycline hydrochloride tch xiong et al 2017 2018 oxytetracycline ding et al 2018 and sulfamethoxazole smx yan et al 2012 have been studied in icpb tch is one of the most widely used antibiotics with four aromatic rings and is difficult to biodegrade in traditional biological treatments gao et al 2012 wang et al 2016d zhang et al 2011b xiong et al 2017 used icpb to degrade tch with visible light compared with photocatalytic degradation alone the degradation efficiency of tch was increased by 11 in the first 2 h and the removal rate of cod was also increased by more than 20 xiong et al 2018 tried to further enhance metabolic activity through adding an easily biodegradable co substrate that could act as a carbon source and electron donor to promote bioconversion and mineralization of tch when acetate was added in icpb the tch removal rate increased by 5 and the mineralization increased by 20 and almost all of the photocatalytic imtermediates disappeared acetate addition could offer extra electron donors to enhance more biomass synthesis inhibit toxicity effects and improve photocatalytic oxidation bai et al 2015 kim et al 2014 muller et al 2013 therefore providing a co substrate that is easily biodegradable is an effective way to increase tch removal and mineralization in the icpb system 5 5 current generation the recovery of energy from organic wastewater could be achieved by the anode respiring bacteria arb which oxidize electron donors and transfer the electrons to the anode in icpb zhou et al prepared an anode intimately coupled arb with n tio2 on a porous carbon foam electrode and experiment tested in an electrochemical cell zhou et al 2017 2018 the configuration of a flat plate double chamber electrolytic cell made of plexiglass was shown in fig 9 a a 3 cm 3 cm icpb anode was fixed in the anode chamber arb was accumulated in the pores and the surface was coated with n tio2 as a working electrode fig 9b and c showed the features of the anode during irradiation and after around 7 days irradiation the corresponding mineralization rate of the icpb anode was the highest and the current generated was 50 higher than that of bio anode current the icpb anode significantly enhanced the biodegradation of 4 cp while recovering electrical current the large increase in current density in icpb was due to the fact that 4 cp photocatalysis produced partially oxidized products and were biodegraded zhou et al 2017 combination of the catalysis by photocatalyst and the biodegradation by biofilm should be able to degrade bio refractory contaminants and recover energy by using the icpb anode 6 conclusions and future prospects icpb technology has shown a huge potential advantage in the field of water treatment this review summarizes the mechanisms involved in icpb from the recent advances of photocatalytic materials carriers and biofilm and varied applications at present the study of icpb for wastewater treatment has just started and the mechanism of microscopic action of icbp is not well understood which limits its development of improving the degradation efficiency of pollutants and its practical application in view of the existing defects and deficiencies in the field further research fields on icpb are suggested there is a lack of detailed information on the degradation mechanisms impact of operational variables on pollutants removal and optimized parameters for reactor design to optimize the structure of the reaction system various factors e g aeration rate coating ratio of photocatalysts that may affect the reaction process need to be fully considered the operating parameters need to be regulated for a stable photocatalytic operation over a wider ph range the mechanism of electron transfer process between photocatalyst and biofilm remains to be further studied to enhance the photocatalytic reaction efficiency in icpb system novel photocatalytic materials responding to wider solar spectra and carriers with large loading amount of catalysts need to be developed such as g c3n4 bi2wo6 three dimensional graphene gels and mofs the future applications of carriers also rely on the development of high strength bio based porous repeatability and 3d carriers with easy to implement synthetic solutions and to improve the function of microbial communities the sources of microbial inoculation for emerging pollutants should be optimized for increasing the degradation efficiency of target pollutants new genetic engineering knowledge should be introduced to degrade pollutants with screening and amplification of the most effective microorganisms which can shorten the hydraulic residence time and save the capital cost of the designed reactor we note that the current research of icpb is still in infancy and there are still many problems in practical applications such as the light reflection and occlusion in actual wastewater the key to over this problem is that the carrier needs to have a wet density similar to that of water in order to contact pollutants in the water and absorb light simultaneously moreover the easy separation of photocatalyst coated on carrier after wastewater treatment can help apply icpb technology in industrial practice in view of the current research and trends there is no doubt that the icpb system will play a significant role in many other interesting applications including i removal of heavy metal ions xu et al 2012 ii practical soil remediation wang et al 2019 iii chemical resources production sakimoto et al 2016 and iv catalytic oxidation of volatile organic compounds vocs he et al 2019 these potential

17997,due to the increase of emerging contaminants in water how to use new treatment technology to make up for the defects of traditional wastewater treatment method has become one of the research hotspots at present intimate coupling of photocatalysis and biodegradation icpb as a novel wastewater treatment method which combines the advantages of biological treatment and photocatalytic reactions has shown a great potential as a low cost environmental friendly and sustainable treatment technology the system mainly consists of photocatalytic materials porous carriers and biofilm the key principle of icpb is to transform bio recalcitrant pollutants into biodegradable products by photocatalysis on the surface of porous carriers the biodegradable products were mineralized simultaneously through the biofilm inside the carriers because of the protection of the carriers the microorganism can remain active even under the uv light the mechanical force of water flow or the attack of free radicals icpb breaks the traditional concept that photocatalytic reaction and biodegradation must be separated in different reactors improves the purification capacity of sewage and saves the cost this review summarizes the recent advances of icpb photocatalysts carriers and biofilm being applied and focuses on the mechanisms and reactor configurations which is particularly novel furthermore the possible ongoing researches on icpb are also put forward this review will provide a valuable insight into the design and application of icpb in environment and energy field graphical abstract image 10454 keywords intimate coupling photocatalysis biodegradation wastewater treatment mechanisms 1 introduction with the increasing of the varied emerging contaminants in water the traditional sewage treatment technology represented by the activated sludge process is difficult to degrade the emerging recalcitrant contaminants with high concentrations and complex structures deng et al 2017b 2018b tang et al 2016b van loosdrecht and brdjanovic 2014 even though some organic pollutants are biodegradable their biodegradation tends to be slow and happens only at low concentration due to inhibition marsolek et al 2007 therefore how to preserve the advantages of biological treatment technology and to integrate it with new sewage treatment technologies to realize win win has become the current research hotspot microbial treatment technology has been coupled with membrane technology advanced oxidation processes aops electrochemical techniques and other emerging treatment technologies wang et al 2016b 2016c yan et al 2012 yang et al 2015a for aops most of the previous attempts to combine treatments have been done by carrying out aops and biological treatment separately or by sequential coupling method brosillon et al 2008 hong and zeng 2002 sirtori et al 2009 aops are fast acting but indiscriminate degradation relying on free radical reactions which can produce a series of excessive oxidation li et al 2011 marsolek et al 2008 photocatalytic oxidation technology began as early as 1972 zhang et al 2012a some semiconductor photocatalytic materials e g tio2 bi2wo6 can produce oh o2 and other reactive oxidative species ros under light excitation and the generated ros can attack the ring and chain so that the refractory organic matters can be transformed into the biodegradable intermediates deng et al 2016 2018a feng et al 2018 tang et al 2016a wang et al 2016a 2018 the traditional idea that photocatalytic reaction and biological treatment are difficult to be carried out in the same reactor is mainly due to the fact that the photocatalytic reaction is fast and indiscriminate so it is hard to control the products of photocatalytic reaction to the biodegradable category yan et al 2016 however if photocatalysis and biodegradation occur at the same time problems in sequential treatment can be optimized and reduced which is named intimate coupling li et al 2012b intimate coupling of photocatalysis and biodegradation icpb is one way to overcome the uncertainties of sequential processing such as the uncertainty of photocatalysis intermediates icpb not only removed the recalcitrant organic pollution but also increased mineralization efficiency and lowered operating costs marsolek et al 2008 have successfully proved the idea of icpb for the first time in a photocatalytic circulating bed biofilm reactor pcbbr that utilized macroporous cellulose carriers and tio2 to remove 2 4 5 trichlorophenol tcp depending on the type of light source icpb can be divided into two types uv light induced photocatalysis and biodegradation upcb and visible light induced photocatalysis and biodegradation vpcb zhou et al 2015 in icpb the photodegradation and biodegradation processes work together in one reactor so that the biodegradable intermediates produced by photodegradation can be biodegraded at once icpb offered potential for the photodegradation and biodegradation of a range of recalcitrant and toxic organic pollutants including tcp marsolek et al 2014 dinitrotoluene wen et al 2012 nitrobenzene yang et al 2015a dyes li et al 2012a and tetracycline hydrochloride tch xiong et al 2018 there are some works on icpb but the research on icpb is still in its infancy their characteristics are still difficult to understand and more potential are largely undiscovered the importance of this emerging field requires timely review of recent developments to promote progress in this area the aim of this review is to summarize the state of the art progresses of icpb system from the mechanisms possibly involved in icpb to the development of photocatalysis materials carriers biofilms and reactor configurations and finally the varied application in recent years conclusions and future prospects are also proposed this review will provide theoretical principles and novel insights for better future applications and innovative design of icpb in wastewater treatment 2 mechanisms of icpb 2 1 the synergistic effect of adsorption photocatalysis and biodegradation icpb as a novel wastewater treatment technology has shown great potential for enhancing the removal and mineralization of bio refractory pollutants the mechanisms possibly acting in icpb are proposed in fig 1 the porous carrier can adsorb bio refractory pollutants from the solution and enhance its mass transfer to the surface of the photocatalysts where various ros are generated thus promoting the photocatalytic degradation of the pollutants in the process of photocatalytic degradation photocatalyst absorbs photon energy photons energy hv bandgap energy eg of photocatalyst which causes electron e to transfer from the valence band vb to the conduction band cb and generates electron hole pairs at the same time organic contaminants are attacked and destroyed by ros such as oh o2 and h deng et al 2017a lin et al 2011 tang et al 2018 wang et al 2017 the products produced by photocatalysis are transferred into the carrier and biodegraded within the biofilms which is further completely mineralized into co2 and water the biodegradation process also involves that photoelectrons generated by photocatalyst can be transferred to biofilms through c type cytochromes the timely biodegradation of photocatalytic products avoids the damage of microbial metabolism and unfavorable oxidation undoubtedly adsorption photocatalysis and biodegradation in the icpb system occur simultaneously rather than completely independent in icpb the shear forces and the generated free radicals can cause the biofilm detaching from the carrier surface particularly the biofilm that are directly adhered to the photocatalyst material thus biodegradation gradually decreases with the continuous enhancement of photocatalysis rittmann 2018 when the photocatalytic effect increases to a certain degree to produce more biodegradable intermediates the organics in the solution could be conducive to the formation of biofilms in return biodegradation increases biofilms may begin to recover on the photocatalyst this process plays a balancing role in icpb this balance adjustment is called synergistic effect dong et al 2016 2 2 self regulation mechanism self regulation is of great significance for reaching a balance between photocatalysis and biodegradation to achieve icpb in an ideal icpb most microorganisms are located into the carriers and almost no biofilm attached to the outside of the carrier marsolek s work showed that biomass initially separated from the outer surfaces of carrier possibly owing to physical loss and exposure to uv light then the biomass regrew associated with acetate degradation which confirmed that bacteria were protected in the interior of the macroporous carrier marsolek et al 2008 bacteria may produce soluble microbial products smps and extracellular polymeric substances epss to protect themselves probably by scavenging free radicals the enhanced consumption of acetate and production of smps and epss supported that bacteria are active then bacteria close to where photocatalytic reactions occurred could remove biodegradable products that were initially produced leaving ros concentrated nearby the bio recalcitrant compounds live cells grow inside the carrier but most cells near the outer surface are dead due to the attack by the radicals and light irradiation even inside the carrier the biofilm layer shows a gradient from live to dead suggesting the self regulation mechanism of icpb when the photocatalytic reactants invaded the macropores dong et al 2016 2 3 co substrate and competition mechanism as reported by previous studies non chlorinated phenols can improve the biodegradation efficiency of 4 chlorophenol 4 cp by promoting microbial growth through the use of less toxic substrates zhang and tay 2015 and biological activity of the induced non specific enzymes monsalvo et al 2009 they can also be photodegraded thus competing with 4 cp for photo generated ros involved in the photodegradation one method for enhancing biodegradation is to offer an easily biodegradable substrate to stimulate an active biofilm community marsolek and rittmann 2016 an organic small molecule as a co substrate can supply electron donor with more biomass synthesis and promote photocatalytic reactions bai et al 2015 kim et al 2014 for example xiong et al used sodium acetate naac as the electron donor and carbon source for microbial growth the addition of acetate led to more active biomass which promoted faster biodegradation of non recalcitrant organics thus reducing competition for free radicals among the recalcitrant fraction xiong et al 2018 3 advances in photocatalytic materials carriers and biofilms for icpb 3 1 photocatalytic materials for icpb to date many photocatalytic materials have been developed to treat wastewater in icpb the most studied photocatalytic materials are tio2 based photocatalysts such as sio2 tio2 zhang et al 2016a ag tio2 xiong et al 2017 n tio2 zhou et al 2017 and er3 yalo3 tio2 zhou et al 2015 other photocatalysts have also been developed to enhance the degradation efficiency of refractory pollutants in these two years such as bi12o17cl2 ding et al 2018 and mn3o4 mno2 ag3po4 cai et al 2019 more detailed information in table 1 3 1 1 ultraviolet light photocatalysts tio2 has great photocatalytic activities due to its good chemical stability non toxicity cost effectiveness and high reactivity under ultraviolet light irradiation the easy separation of tio2 catalyst accommodated in pcbbr after wastewater treatment can help apply this catalyst in industrial practice pelaez et al 2012 schneider et al 2014 wu et al 2014 zhang et al 2014a marsolek et al directly coated tio2 on the surface of the carrier producing a hybrid photocatalytic biological carrier for the first time by using a sol gel technique marsolek et al 2008 however the practical application of tio2 is restricted by three major limitations i the low load ratio of tio2 on the carrier sun et al 2013 xiong and zhao 2013 yoo et al 2013 ii the low photon utilization rate luo et al 2013 zhang et al 2013 zhou et al 2013 iii the low recovery of tio2 chalasani and vasudevan 2013 tang et al 2013 in order to increase the load ratio of tio2 on the carrier in icpb li et al 2012b increased the loading amount of tio2 on the carrier by a modified method firstly titanium isopropanol nitric acid trimesic acid were mixed with the blank carrier and then the liquid was vaporized at 80 c then they changed the loading method by reducing the content of titanium in the mixture from 134 g l to 100 g l finally the carrier loaded with 0 40 g l tio2 was obtained by removing the additive trimesic acid and the coating efficiency reached 83 the optimization of new carrier coating method obtained a thinner and well distributed tio2 coating greatly enhancing the photocatalytic efficiency and adherence strength xing et al 2014 designed a novel porous crystalline anatase tio2 by frozen casting method based on camphene the ordered mesoporous tio2 with good thermal stability could enhance photon utilization ratio and the photocatalytic efficiency li et al 2013 shi et al 2013 besides mesoporous nano tio2 has been proved to be an excellent photocatalyst owing to its large surface area and ordered porous structure thus improving the surface reactive sites and contaminants adsorption jiang et al 2013 as is known to all good crystallinity of anatase type tio2 is one of the key factors to improve its photocatalytic performance er et al 2014 xing et al 2014 the heat treatment method is used to change mesoporous tio2 from amorphous to crystalline but it leads to unnecessary growth and complete destruction of ordered structure deng et al 2013 li et al 2014 wang et al 2014 zhang et al 2016a induced the good thermal stability ordered mesoporous sio2 tio2 compounds in order to improve the photocatalytic performance of tio2 the introduction of sio2 can restrain the anatase to rutile phase transformation and preserve the ordered mesoporous structure and high crystallinity of tio2 even after being calcined at 800 c the prepared ordered mesoporous mixed materials not only have good thermal stability but also improve the specific surface area and the recovery of photocatalysts 3 1 2 visible light photocatalysts the range of the photocatalysts induction to light and the penetration of light in water are two extremely important factors for icpb lim and kim 2004 the uv spectrum response for photocatalysts activation is often accompanied by high operating costs and can damage the biofilm outside the carrier in order to expand the range of photo response of tio2 for solar spectrum different methods have been designed such as noble metals incorporation ni et al 2007 non metals fujishima et al 2008 and transition metals doping litter 1999 firstly noble metals have a lower fermi level than tio2 photocatalyst is deposited on the surface of tio2 to enhance charge separation ni et al 2007 xiong et al prepared visible light driven ag doped tio2 in icpb xiong et al 2017 the photocatalyst coating process used a sol gel and evaporation induced self assembly eisa method ag doped on the crystal lattice or surface of tio2 could trap photo generated electrons or holes thus promoting electron hole separation in photocatalysis process xiong et al 2018 this new icpb method had a good ability to mineralize pollutants and protect the biofilm under visible light irradiation which was called vpcb dong et al 2016 zhou et al 2015 in addition to doping with noble metals non metal doping can also enhance the photocatalytic performance and practicability of tio2 catalysts fujishima et al 2008 among the various dopants nitrogen n is the most widely investigated and the most promising results have been obtained extending the absorption edge of tio2 to the visible region fujishima et al 2008 qiu and burda 2007 by using n doped tio2 n tio2 the icpb photo anode could respond to visible light teng et al 2013 wen et al 2012 zhou et al 2017 successfully fabricated an electrochemical cell with the carbon foam based on n tio2 icpb anode the unique properties of n tio2 made it have high reactivity and suitability the enhanced visible light activity of n tio2 was attributed to the bandgap reduction by n doping in tio2 structure or as an alternative to the oxygen lattice sites ananpattarachai et al 2009 it was found that self assembly technique was useful for preparing monodispersed tio2 layers with high loading amount at low temperatures a visible light responsive photocatalyst er3 yalo3 tio2 hybrid composite was prepared by sol gel technique and hydrothermal treatment in the range of 90 170 c dong et al 2015 2016 zhang et al 2017b zhou et al 2015 possible mechanism of the enhanced photocatalytic reactivity in er3 yalo3 tio2 was proposed in fig 2 dong et al 2015 er3 yalo3 tio2 was an effective up conversion system that converted visible light into ultraviolet light under the excitation light the er3 yalo3 tio2 as an up conversion agent firstly absorbed the visible light and then emitted uv thus the uv effectively excited the tio2 to start the photocatalytic process as described in fig 1 leading to the enhanced photocatalytic degradation of mo in the vpcb in a sum the conventional photocatalytic materials in icpb system are mainly tio2 based photocatalysts the trend is to develop more efficient and inexpensive visible light photocatalysts for which more researches need to be carried out ding et al used an inexpensive and highly efficient belt shaped one dimensional oxygen rich bi12o17cl2 as a visible light photocatalyst in icpb system ding et al 2018 the result showed a removal rate of oxytetracycline of 94 moreover many potential efficient photocatalysts are proposed here as substitutes for classical tio2 based photocatalysts including i g c3n4 based photocatalysts such as p doped g c3n4 deng et al 2017b and w18o49 g c3n4 deng et al 2018a ii bi based photocatalysts such as bi2wo6 wang et al 2018 and bivo4 chen et al 2017 iii agpo4 based photocatalysts such as mn3o4 mno2 ag3po4 cai et al 2019 and ag3po4 fe3o4 wang et al 2019 these photocatalytic materials not only extend the range of photo response to visible or even near infrared light but also promote the separation of photoinduced charges and holes which has great application potential in icpb system 3 2 carriers of icpb as one of the important components of the icpb system the carrier needs to have a wet density similar to that of water in order to be adequately stirred during aeration this can not only keep the carrier in contact with pollutants but also ensure the continuous exchange of degradation products besides large porosity and good biocompatibility are also required on the one hand it provides the loading matrix for the photocatalytic materials on the other hand it provides the sites for the adhesion of the biofilm at the same time the microbes growing in the pores can keep their own activity because they can avoid the impact of uv light free radicals and abrasion which can guarantee the icpb system to work well rittmann 2018 the following sections outline a few representative carriers that are suitable to be used in icpb system such as cellulose carrier marsolek et al 2008 ceramic carrier xing et al 2014 polyurethane sponge li et al 2011 and polyurethane foam puf zhang et al 2016a 3 2 1 the cellulose carrier when marsolek et al first put forward the concept of icpb in 2008 the carrier was porous cellulose with side length of 4 mm marsolek et al 2008 the surface of the material was positively charged and it had certain adsorption ability for the pollutants in water the density of this cellulose dressing of 1 04 g cm 3 was close to that of water and the average porosity was 0 93 the dressing had good biocompatibility and the microorganism could be loaded well on the whole carrier during the process of biofilm hanging in the cellulose carrier supported icpb the removal efficiency of acetate was 100 it also confirmed that the process of photocatalytic reaction and biodegradation could exist in the same reactor under reasonable experimental design the porous cellulose was also used in fluidized bed biodegradation of quinolone machado et al 2006 3 2 2 the ceramic carrier although the cellulose carrier have an ideal pore structure and can be used to accumulate and protect the bacteria the carrier will be oxidized and charred gradually under the attack of hydroxyl radical marsolek et al 2008 besides the low loading capacity of cellulose dressing carrier for photocatalytic materials can not maintain the photocatalytic property of icpb for a long time ceramic carrier with rough surface is resistant to radical attack and helpful to increase the loaded amount of photocatalytic material its wet density ranges from 1 03 to 1 05 g cm3 which can float on the surface of liquid under aeration condition so it is suitable for circulation in application it could strongly adsorb pollutants in the solution and protect microorganisms inside from uv irradiation and free radicals wen et al 2012 zhang et al 2012b xing et al 2014 reported that camphor as a three dimensional 3d connected network of frozen vehicles could sublimate in the ceramic body and leave macroporous channels the obtained ceramic had a layered mesoporous structure with average size of 8 8 2 mm3 and the average mass of one piece was 20 mg the prepared mesoporous tio2 ceramic carrier exhibited both great mechanical stability and good recyclability the obtained ceramics supported icpb had good adsorption and photocatalytic activity for the degradation of octane and rhodamine b rhb the total organic carbon toc removal rate after degradation for 3 h reached 98 8 and 98 6 respectively 3 2 3 the polyurethane sponge ideally the carrier should have a proportion similar to that of water in order to have a good circulation in pcbbr a suitable size of macroporous structure to accumulate biomass and protect them from the influence of uv free radical attack polyurethane sponge as a commercial product has both large porosity and good biocompatibility it has been used in biological packing air filter and cosmetics industry li et al 2012b li et al 2011 used the commercial polyurethane sponge fig 3 as the carrier of photocatalytic materials and microbes the size of this sponge type cube was 3 5 0 3 mm which was beneficial to shelter biofilm inside while enhancing photocatalysis outside the surface the carrier had a specific surface area of 4 8 m2 g and high porosity 88 the internal pore size was 50 500 μm and its wet density 1 01 1 02 g cm3 was close to the water these properties not only provided sufficient porosity to support the loading of photocatalytic materials and growth of microorganisms but also ensured the free flow of water in the polyurethane sponge at the same time wen et al compared the porous ceramic materials with the polyurethane sponge wen et al 2012 they found that the time for biofilm growth in polyurethane foam was about 10 d while porous ceramics needed about 30 d furthermore it was also found that smaller carriers may provide a larger surface area to volume ratio to enable more catalysts to be exposed on the surface of the carrier zhou et al reported a polyurethane cube with a side length of 2 mm as an ideal smaller porous sponge carrier for the icpb reaction finally removal efficiency of phenol by vpcb was promoted to 99 8 the wet density of the original and photocatalyst coated sponge was 0 89 and 1 04 g ml respectively with 100 300 μm in the pore size and 87 in porosity xiong et al 2018 zhou et al 2015 3 2 4 the polyurethane foam in addition to the aforementioned carriers zhang et al 2016a designed ordered mesoporous sio2 tio2 composite with high thermal stability and firstly coated it on the macroporous puf as a layered mesoporous biofilm carrier the puf carrier had a 3d macroporous network structure with an average length of 1 cm and an average pore size of 2 mm its density was 0 8 g cm3 and it was easy to fluidize puf in water under the normal aeration intensity the total organic carbon toc removal efficiency of 2 4 5 tcp was up to 97 5 in the macroporous puf supported icpb in general puf has been commercialized for icpb system with good economic viability moreover many potential alternatives to carriers in icpb system are proposed i three dimensional graphene gels such as hydrogels and aerogels have been widely used in various fields due to their high porosity low density and conductivity he et al 2018 ii mofs have attracted a lot of interests in adsorption catalysis optoelectronic devices gas storage and separation and drug delivery owing to the easy tunability of pore size and shape and large specific surface areas wu et al 2017 iii agar is widely used in the preparation of medium and polymer hybrid hydrogels and can also be used in the field of catalysis zhang et al 2016b iv melamine foam has been applied to the loading of photocatalysts due to its porous structure and superhydrophilicity geng et al 2019 these potential carriers are promising materials used in icpb system for the treatment of water pollutants 3 3 biofilms of icpb biofilms are the accumulation of microorganisms attached to a solid surface and exist ubiquitous in natural environment rittmann 2018 in icpb system biofilms biodegrade photocatalytic intermediates to realize further mineralization upcb have worse mineralization capability because of the release of smps caused by cell lysis smps are likely to be released into the effluent when radicals attacked the biofilm the poor mineralization of upcb is also due to the serious separation of the biofilms and the activity of microbe is reduced after attack by uv irradiation zhou et al compared upcb with vcpb for the degradation of phenol for the first time zhou et al 2015 it was found that the microbial communities in the carrier were well protected under visible light irradiation and the secretion of epss was also enhanced as we mentioned before bacteria may produce epss to protect themselves by scavenging free radicals in the icbp process biofilm has considerable substrate removal capability which is a major factor in the removal of chemical oxygen demand cod or dissolved organic carbon doc li et al 2011 marsolek et al 2008 zhang et al 2010 xiong et al 2017 cultured un acclimated activated sludge to form biofilm in the porous carriers a rich biofilm adhered on the core and outer surface of the carriers and it was bridged with a large number of epss the biofilm in vpcb was adapted to the utilization of photocatalytic intermediates which enhanced by 20 in cod removal fig 4 shows the changes to the genus level microbial community structure during vpcb before tetracycline hydrochloride was degraded the prevailing genus were massilia acinetobacter janthinobacterium and pseudomonas which were common genus in the treatment of biological wastewater zhang et al 2011a after the degradation of tch methylibium runella comamonas and pseudomonas were enriched in the biofilms in the vpcb carriers which were known for their biodegradation of aromatics and tch resistance it indicated that vpcb worked well during the tch degradation process icpb can overcome the bio refractory nature of organic contaminants by using active biofilms and photocatalysis 4 configurations of pcbbr according to the deployment of photocatalysts pcbbr for wastewater treatment can usually be divided into two major configurations 1 pcbbr with suspended photocatalysts and 2 pcbbr with immobilized photocatalysts the two major configurations differ in that the first needs further separation from water to recover the photocatalysts while the latter allows a continuous operation for the latter one there are two groups according to the types of the light source 1 uv light responsive photocatalytic circulating bed biofilm reactor upcbbr and 2 visible light responsive photocatalytic circulating bed biofilm reactor vpcbbr 4 1 pcbbr with suspended photocatalysts in pcbbr with suspended photocatalysts the photocatalysts are uniformly dispersed in the feed solution and carriers are independently applied to protect the biofilms an obvious advantage of this system is that the photocatalysts have sufficient contact with pollutants due to the large specific surface area while the pcbbr with immobilized photocatalysts is often hindered by the mass transfer limitation on the photocatalyst coated carriers in addition a large amount of photocatalyst is feasible to be applied in the suspension system but in the immobilized pcbbr system photocatalyst is much less due to the limited surface area of the carrier as shown in fig 5 a typical slurry typed pcbbr system was used for 2 4 5 tcp and acetate removal marsolek et al 2008 the biofilms in pcbbr accumulated in the macroporous carriers were well protected from uv light chemical toxicity ros and physical loss while oxidation reaction occurred on the slurry typed tio2 photocatalyst the volume of the liquid in the laboratory scale pcbbr was 122 ml liquid circulation was realized by aeration which also supplied dissolved oxygen do for photodegradation and biodegradation the influent entered the reactor by a micro pulse pump uv light illuminated at the lower half of a reactor increasing the reflection of high intensity light the results showed that the slurry typed pcbbr system almost completely removed tcp in which photocatalysts were responsible for the rapid removal of tcp and biofilms inside the carriers contributed to removing the cod photocatalysts can be separated through adding a sedimentation basin or a filtration system so that the slurry reactor can be continuously operated chong et al 2010 4 2 pcbbr with immobilized photocatalysts in pcbbr with immobilized photocatalysts the photocatalysts are fixed on the surface of carriers which are beneficial to the separation of the photocatalysts from the wastewater and avoids secondary pollution and photocatalysts loss the carriers can act as not only the support for photocatalysts but also the ideal place for biofilm accumulation we have summarized the different methods of coating carriers with a catalyst layer on the surface including sol gel low temperature sintering method eisa and ultrasonically dispersed and evaporation table 1 the following part describes typical configurations of different light position or different light source types fig 6 a shows a laboratory scale upcbbr made of quartz glass with a volume of 150 ml and suspended circulating carriers on the rising and falling sides li et al 2011 except for the 18 cm long side of the riser the upcbbr was covered with aluminum foil to reflect uv light water and carrier circulation was realized through aeration by an air lift pump which also supplied do at an aeration rate of 21 ml min and the feed water was provided at a rate of 0 4 ml min the upcbbr was illuminated by two uv lamps with an intensity of 3 0 mwatt cm2 and located on the exposed part of the reactor the total illumination volume was about 41 cm3 accounting for 27 of the total volume of the upcbbr fig 6b presents the schematic diagram and photo of upcbbr which used a 1 l quartz glass reactor zhang et al 2016a unlike the common pcbbr the quartz sleeve was placed in the middle of the reactor while the uv lamp was placed in the quartz sleeve liquid circulation was realized by aeration at the bottom of the reactor to increase the light utilization by reflecting light the outside of upcbbr was covered with aluminum foil the pcbbr was kept at a room temperature of 12 2 c the results showed that 100 mg l of phenol and 20 mg l of 2 4 5 tcp could be totally degraded by running the reactor for 3 h and 6 h respectively the two pcbbr systems described above were both operated under uv light irradiation zhou et al 2015 compared the effect of uv light and visible light on degrading phenol in pcbbr as a result the removal rate of phenol by the vpcbbr was 99 8 which was 32 6 higher than that of the upcbbr biofilm was severely shed due to uv irradiation resulting in poor removal efficiency of phenol in upcbbr as shown in fig 7 ma et al 2015 designed a vpcbbr the reactor was an internal loop air driven reactor with a volume of 540 ml filled with approximately 750 sponge carriers and operated at 20 2 c the vpcbbr draft tube is a plexiglass tube with a diameter of 40 mm a height of 130 mm and a bottom aerator of 40 mm the oxygen was provided by an aeration pump with an aeration rate of 480 g o2 g phenol h 1 and a flow rate of 10 6 mm s the vpcbbr was irradiated by visible light from two opposing led panels which were placed approximately 10 cm each side of the reactor the highest phenol removal efficiency 99 8 and mineralization 67 1 capability was observed within 16 h in vpcbbr both configurations of pcbbr with suspended or immobilized photocatalysts have their own characteristics and limitations table 2 briefly summarizes the main advantages and disadvantages of these two types of pcbbr 5 applications wastewater treatment can be more sustainable if it can recycle energy and other resources while removing recalcitrant organic pollutants li et al 2015 arb could conduct electrons to the cathode which makes it possible to generate electricity hydrogen gas or other valuable resources li et al 2015 sharma et al 2014 under the action of photocatalytic reaction and microorganism icpb system can achieve high efficiency and rapid treatment of refractory pollutants it has good practical application prospect in environmental purification icpb has been proven to be suitable for many bio recalcitrant organic pollutants including phenol dong et al 2016 zhang et al 2010 nitrobenzene yang et al 2015a quinolone yan et al 2013 dyes li et al 2012a and so on recent studies on the practical applications of icpb in the treatment of wastewater and energy production are summarized in table 3 5 1 degradation of nitrogenous compounds quinoline c9h7n is a typical nitrogenous heterocyclic compound that is recalcitrant to be biodegraded which is widely used in dye rubber pharmaceutical food and chemical industries felczak et al 2014 the sequentially and intimately coupling ability of photolysis and biodegradation were simultaneously investigated to improve the removal rate of quinoline and the kinetics of quinoline mineralization in the internal loop photo biodegradation reactor ilpbr the maximum quinoline removal efficiency rmax increased by 9 and the half maximum rate concentration ks decreased by 55 compared to sequentially coupling the results showed that the biodegradation rate of quinoline was about twice of that in the sequentially coupling system both intimate coupling and sequential coupling systems increased the degree of mineralization by 18 and 5 respectively therefore the simultaneous photocatalysis and biodegradation in ilpbr was superior to sequentially coupling yan et al 2013 2 4 dinitrotoluene 2 4 dnt an intermediate in the manufacture of polyurethanes and dyes is easy to disperse in soil and groundwater when not handled properly dontsova et al 2009 wen et al employed icpb system degrading 2 4 dnt wen et al 2012 although the final degradation efficiency of 2 4 dnt by icpb was similar to that in solo photocatalytic degradation the results showed that the conversion ratios of the organic nitrogen to nh4 n no2 n and no3 n in icpb were much higher than the latter therefore the intermediate products of photocatalysis and photodegradation were further destroyed by microorganism which promoted the degradation of 2 4 dnt 5 2 degradation of phenolic compounds phenolic compounds are typical examples of bio recalcitrant toxic contaminants exhibited in the wastewater from various industries such as the production of fungicides herbicides and textiles su et al 2012 wu et al 2012 yang et al 2015b zhou et al 2015 compared the effects of vpcb and upcb on the degradation of phenol fig 8 the photocatalyst was doped with both er3 and yalo3 into tio2 coated on the sponge carriers the removal efficiency of phenol in the vpcb reached 99 8 which was 32 6 higher than that in the upcb the photocatalytic and biodegradation reactions were tightly coupled in the vpcb leading to 63 9 removal of doc which further showed the synergistic action of photocatalysis and biodegradation theoretically the degradation of chlorophenol can be accelerated by a co substrate or be inhibited by the competition of ros zhang et al investigated the effect of phenol and pyrocatechol on the degradation of 4 cp zhang et al 2017a the removal rate of 4 cp was 51 increasing to 62 after phenol addition at the same time the dechlorination efficiency of 4 cp increased from 47 to 63 in contrast the addition of pyrocatechol reduced the removal rate of 4 cp to 32 the difference in the results was due to the additional electron donor offered by the photodegradation product of phenol to the bacteria which promoted the degradation of 4 cp while the pyrocatechol competed with 4 cp for ros to inhibit its degradation in the treatment of phenolic compounds by icbp competition for ros and co substrate performances should be considered 5 3 degradation of reactive dyes among various pollutants organic dyes are one of the most widely used chemicals mainly from textiles cosmetics paper leather and other industries he et al 2018 icpb could further mineralize many reactive dyes such as reactive dye black 5 rb5 li et al 2012a methyl orange mo dong et al 2016 and rhb xing et al 2014 the degradation and mineralization of rb5 by a novel bio recalcitrant coated biofilm carrier with icpb were studied in a pcbbr li et al 2012a compared with the low mineralization portion of rb5 in photocatalytic reaction the removal efficiency of dyes and cod by the system could reach 97 and 65 respectively not only was the highly efficient degradation of rb5 realized but also the intermediate products of photocatalytic reaction were further mineralized photocatalysis was the main cause of dye loss but biodegradation led to the most removal of cod it was also proved indirectly that the system could run stably under low ph conditions 5 4 degradation of antibiotics the prevalence of antibiotics in aquatic systems has become an environmental issue due to that it may result in antibiotic resistant pathogens zhang et al 2014a 2014b degradation of tetracycline hydrochloride tch xiong et al 2017 2018 oxytetracycline ding et al 2018 and sulfamethoxazole smx yan et al 2012 have been studied in icpb tch is one of the most widely used antibiotics with four aromatic rings and is difficult to biodegrade in traditional biological treatments gao et al 2012 wang et al 2016d zhang et al 2011b xiong et al 2017 used icpb to degrade tch with visible light compared with photocatalytic degradation alone the degradation efficiency of tch was increased by 11 in the first 2 h and the removal rate of cod was also increased by more than 20 xiong et al 2018 tried to further enhance metabolic activity through adding an easily biodegradable co substrate that could act as a carbon source and electron donor to promote bioconversion and mineralization of tch when acetate was added in icpb the tch removal rate increased by 5 and the mineralization increased by 20 and almost all of the photocatalytic imtermediates disappeared acetate addition could offer extra electron donors to enhance more biomass synthesis inhibit toxicity effects and improve photocatalytic oxidation bai et al 2015 kim et al 2014 muller et al 2013 therefore providing a co substrate that is easily biodegradable is an effective way to increase tch removal and mineralization in the icpb system 5 5 current generation the recovery of energy from organic wastewater could be achieved by the anode respiring bacteria arb which oxidize electron donors and transfer the electrons to the anode in icpb zhou et al prepared an anode intimately coupled arb with n tio2 on a porous carbon foam electrode and experiment tested in an electrochemical cell zhou et al 2017 2018 the configuration of a flat plate double chamber electrolytic cell made of plexiglass was shown in fig 9 a a 3 cm 3 cm icpb anode was fixed in the anode chamber arb was accumulated in the pores and the surface was coated with n tio2 as a working electrode fig 9b and c showed the features of the anode during irradiation and after around 7 days irradiation the corresponding mineralization rate of the icpb anode was the highest and the current generated was 50 higher than that of bio anode current the icpb anode significantly enhanced the biodegradation of 4 cp while recovering electrical current the large increase in current density in icpb was due to the fact that 4 cp photocatalysis produced partially oxidized products and were biodegraded zhou et al 2017 combination of the catalysis by photocatalyst and the biodegradation by biofilm should be able to degrade bio refractory contaminants and recover energy by using the icpb anode 6 conclusions and future prospects icpb technology has shown a huge potential advantage in the field of water treatment this review summarizes the mechanisms involved in icpb from the recent advances of photocatalytic materials carriers and biofilm and varied applications at present the study of icpb for wastewater treatment has just started and the mechanism of microscopic action of icbp is not well understood which limits its development of improving the degradation efficiency of pollutants and its practical application in view of the existing defects and deficiencies in the field further research fields on icpb are suggested there is a lack of detailed information on the degradation mechanisms impact of operational variables on pollutants removal and optimized parameters for reactor design to optimize the structure of the reaction system various factors e g aeration rate coating ratio of photocatalysts that may affect the reaction process need to be fully considered the operating parameters need to be regulated for a stable photocatalytic operation over a wider ph range the mechanism of electron transfer process between photocatalyst and biofilm remains to be further studied to enhance the photocatalytic reaction efficiency in icpb system novel photocatalytic materials responding to wider solar spectra and carriers with large loading amount of catalysts need to be developed such as g c3n4 bi2wo6 three dimensional graphene gels and mofs the future applications of carriers also rely on the development of high strength bio based porous repeatability and 3d carriers with easy to implement synthetic solutions and to improve the function of microbial communities the sources of microbial inoculation for emerging pollutants should be optimized for increasing the degradation efficiency of target pollutants new genetic engineering knowledge should be introduced to degrade pollutants with screening and amplification of the most effective microorganisms which can shorten the hydraulic residence time and save the capital cost of the designed reactor we note that the current research of icpb is still in infancy and there are still many problems in practical applications such as the light reflection and occlusion in actual wastewater the key to over this problem is that the carrier needs to have a wet density similar to that of water in order to contact pollutants in the water and absorb light simultaneously moreover the easy separation of photocatalyst coated on carrier after wastewater treatment can help apply icpb technology in industrial practice in view of the current research and trends there is no doubt that the icpb system will play a significant role in many other interesting applications including i removal of heavy metal ions xu et al 2012 ii practical soil remediation wang et al 2019 iii chemical resources production sakimoto et al 2016 and iv catalytic oxidation of volatile organic compounds vocs he et al 2019 these potential applications should be combined with icpb to create more widespread applications declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal

gunda et al 2011 morin et al 2016 geological storage of carbon dioxide co2 bourg et al 2015 zuo et al 2013 disposal of hazardous materials oh et al 2017 groundwater hydrology bedient et al 1994 and soil science ciceri and allanore 2015 stanley et al 2016 to accurately model geological processes on large scales an understanding of the fluid flows species transport and chemical reactions occurring at the nano and micro scale rock soil geometries is required culligan et al 2006 the deeply buried and opaque nature of geological formations precludes the direct visualization of these processes therefore visual models that simulate the pore geometries of rocks have been employed to simulate the microscale events recent advances in microfabrication material synthesis and visualization have boosted the development of various microscale visual models with distinct properties anbari et al 2018 karadimitriou and hassanizadeh 2012 lifton 2016 sinton 2014 we have reviewed the available models with the six categories of microscale packs hele shaw cells synthesized microchips also known as microfluidic chips or micromodels geomaterial dominated microchips and more recently three dimensional 3d microchips and nanofluidics micro bead packs and hele shaw cells were among the first visual models bowden et al 2010 hele shaw 1898 hornof and baig 1995 lv et al 2017 saffman and taylor 1958 zhu

coupling rock mineralogy in the fabrication of microchips and fabricating 3d and nanofluidic devices have generated enormous developments porter et al 2015 song and kovscek 2015 zhang et al 2018 wang et al 2017b the primary goal of this review is to aid researchers in geological formation research at different levels to be the person who has the answers before resolving questions when it comes to flow visualization in porous media this work for the first time reviews various types of visual models for studying subsurface science where the geological research background is specially integrated for each method the technical points practical applications and the advantages and disadvantages are examined in particular additional focus is placed on the technological advances in imitating the pore wall surfaces of porous geological media within the visual models this paper is organized as follows the roles and significance of the rock and soil pore wall surfaces in geological processes are briefly overviewed in section 2 sections 3 and 4 summarize the packed beds and hele shaw cells respectively in section 5 we review the use of microfluidics to study flow in porous media and introduce micromodels fabricated with synthesized materials and current strategies of modifying the surfaces of micromodels are discussed in section 6 the novel coupling of actual rock surface chemistries in geomaterial dominated microchips either by coating the inner walls of the microchannels with the geomaterials or directly employing the geomaterial as a fabrication material is addressed in section 7 the 3d micromodels and nanofluidic models are briefly discussed in sections 8 and 9 respectively the discussion ends with selection guidelines summarizing the features of the six categories of visual models and the outlooks highlighting the challenges and opportunities in using the visual models for research on transport in porous media 2 pore wall surface and geometric features in rocks and soils in geological formations pore wall surfaces and their impacts are extraordinarily prevalent due to the large specific surface areas prakash 2014 e g the specific area of sandstone can be approximately 1 500 cm2 cm3 bear 1988 wettability and mineralogy are two dominant properties for solids regulating fluid flow and migration anderson 1987 dullien 1991 iglauer 2017 maitland 2000 the importance of wettability in fluid dynamics in porous media is well documented in the literature e g affecting the capillary forces and relative permeability curves the minerals in rocks and soil can interact with the surrounding fluids through chemical reactions swelling deformation or dissolution changing the pore morphology porosity and permeability and subsequently affecting geofluid activity anderson et al 2010 lee et al 2016 mitchell 1976 peng et al 2016 xu et al 2017 furthermore there is a variety of minerals with random distributions present in rocks singh et al 2017 zhang et al 2018 other examples of pore wall surfaces affecting fluid transport include the adsorption of oil components on clay minerals boggs 2011 hu et al 2014 physicochemical reactions between injected co2 and the rocks wang et al 2013 adsorption and retardation of repository released radionuclides in the rocks oh et al 2017 and the storage and release of methane in the coalbeds and shale strata charoensuppanimit et al 2016 xiong et al 2016 the complex interfacial interactions exacerbate the characterization of subsurface fluid flows and transport processes therefore the construction of realistic rock wettability and mineralogy in the visual models remains a significant challenge the geometric features of porous media include pore size distributions coordination numbers and tortuosity in the numerical modeling of porous media predefined geometric parameters such as minkowski functionals e g volume surface curvature and connectivity are used to generate artificial pore networks lehmann et al 2008 similar to designing the flow paths in visual models rock based network designs as well as specially designed pore geometries are coupled into fabrications of the visual models micro and nanomodels bartels et al 2017 park et al 2015 due to the limitations in optical visualization and fabrication techniques the geometric parameters are usually modified before reprinted in the models for example porosities are typically increased when designing a rock based network in micromodels due to the reduced connectivity in 2d in recent years depth variation or 2 5d 3d micromodels have been developed to better represent the 3d geometrical features in porous media park et al 2015 xu et al 2017a yun et al 2017 moreover a mass of elegant geometrical designs for fluid flow and transport and static tests have been incorporated into the visual models as can be seen from the literature anbari et al 2018 bartels et al 2017 yun et al 2017 3 packed beds packed beds can reflect both the 3d geometry and the rock s pore wall surface features in this method solid particles with varied geometries and materials are subtly packed into the visual channels in comparison with the conventional reservoir core experiments microscale packed beds enable the real time visualization of two phase flow behaviors in a few pores from the channel walls with the aid of advanced visualization tools such as confocal microscopy krummel et al 2013 in both the core and micro packed experiments one can use magnetic resonance imaging mri sankey et al 2009 and x ray microcomputer tomography x ray μct kumar and fogden 2009 porter et al 2010 to construct the images of the flow process indirectly in this section models with glass beads and geomaterial grains as the packing materials are discussed 3 1 glass bead packed beds glass packings have been widely used for simulating subsurface fluid flows and transport processes due to the chemical similarities between glass and silicate minerals additionally glass beads can be produced with uniform sizes and controlled geometries enabling consistent and reproducible flow patterns capillaries krummel et al 2013 schluter et al 2016 single channels with connected filters bowden et al 2010 hele shaw cells trojer et al 2015 and cylinders holding semipermeable membranes murison et al 2014 are the commonly used containers for packing glass beads fig 1 sometimes the glass beads are sintered after packing to achieve denser frameworks krummel et al 2013 schluter et al 2016 wildenschild et al 2011 krummel et al 2013 employed a dense glass bead packing in a rectangular quartz capillary to study immiscible fluid displacement fig 1a with the aid of confocal microscopy they directly recorded the 3d structures of the trapped ganglia and the effects of capillary numbers on the residual fluid distribution krummel et al 2013 several other studies have also used similar packed beds to investigate the multiphase flows of subsurface fluids bowden et al 2010 hatiboglu and babadagli 2010 schluter et al 2016 glass beads can be functionalized to yield various wetting conditions in the packed beds and simulate the conditions in the groundwater oil reservoirs and soils this method of utilizing glass beads to yield various wetting conditions enables well defined mixed wettability in multi phase flow experiments trojer et al 2015 used a radial hele shaw cell packed with glass beads to visualize the displacement of water glycerol mixtures with air fig 1b chemical vapor deposition cvd with silane based materials was used to treat the surfaces of both the cell and the beads made of soda lime glass to study the effects of wettability on the displacement process both hydrophilic and hydrophobic wetting states have been achieved with water glycerol mixture air solid contact angles of 5 20 60 90 and 120 geistlinger and ataei dadavi 2015 generated glass bead monolayers with either heterogeneous or homogeneous wettability in hele shaw cells to investigate the capillary trapping phenomena fig 1c with this method untreated glass beads had displayed heterogeneous wetting states with both hydrophobic and hydrophilic surfaces and were used to form heterogeneous monolayers three homogenization methods were used to treat the glass beads to render homogeneous hydrophilic monolayers isopropanol flushing and oven drying interval oven drying and initial oven drying with nitrogen flushing in another study murison et al 2014 used a dense packing of functionalized glass beads to study the effects of spatial wettability on the displacement of an oil water interface fig 1d heterogeneous wettability features i e different spatial extensions were created using both untreated glass beads hydrophilic and gold or chlorotrimethoxysilane coated glass beads hydrophobic for the packing furthermore the protocols of functionalizing glass beads and generating the packs were varied to create four types of heterogeneous wettability in the models patchy janus mixed and cluster patterns the wettability of each sample was characterized using capillary pressure saturation cps experiments and x ray tomography of the dry samples although this approach has achieved spatial variations in wettability it is a time consuming process requiring more than 18 h for the coating steps 3 2 rock particle packed beds packing crushed rock or rock forming mineral particles has been used to integrate more realistic surface mineralogy for rocks and soils in the packed beds which has enabled investigations of solid fluid interactions occurring in the rocks and soils packed beds of water wet cryolite grains with a random and transparent packing structure were constructed inside cylindrical glass microchannels 100 μm in diameter to represent heterogeneous soil textures in primary drainage experiments fig 2 a zhu and papadopoulos 2012 lv et al 2017 used stratified packs of glass beads dolomite and quartz to examine the effects of heterogeneity in pore size and wettability for pore scale fluid flows fig 2b singh and mohanty 2017 packed two sizes of silica particles into two layers respectively to create a vertical heterogeneity in sand packs furthermore planar slabs of mica quartz and oxidized silicon wafers were added to the glass bead packs to model sandstone with mineralogical heterogeneity kumar et al 2012 similarly to provide functional analogs of siltstone and carbonate rocks crushed mineral grains and glass beads were packed into microchannels fig 2c bowden et al 2016 tanino et al 2018 packed beds with complex grains have been advantageous in presenting realistic pore wall surface chemistries of the rocks including complex mineralogy heterogeneous permeability and wettability and strong capillary continuity overall many packed bed systems have been developed to interpret flow mechanisms in subsurface porous media specifically packed beds involving grains of rocks incorporate the effects of mineralogy on the fluid solid interactions and characterizations of fluid dynamics although advanced visualization techniques such as mri and confocal microscopy can help the characterization of 3d fluid dynamics the use of rock grains or glass beads restricts the in depth visualization 4 hele shaw cells hele shaw cells named after henry selby hele shaw hele shaw 1898 are devices composed of two narrowly separated parallel plates with fluids transporting through the confined spaces the hele shaw geometry represents a quasi 2d geometry of which one dimension is much smaller than the other two for example a radial hele shaw cell with a diameter of 28 cm and a typical gap spacing of 254 μm has been employed to study the viscosity driven flow instability bischofberger et al 2014 the hele shaw cell is a powerful visual tool to study multiphase fluid dynamics in porous media due to the analogy between fluid transport through narrow gaps and in porous media saffman and taylor 1958 as well as the ease at which the interfaces of fluids can be directly visualized interfacial instabilities driven by the viscosity and density mismatch between the displacing and the displaced fluids bischofberger et al 2014 enjamoori et al 2011 hill 1952 homsy 1987 saffman and taylor 1958 sahimi 2011 truzzolillo and cipelletti 2017 white and ward 2014 or driven by chemical reactions de wit 2016 hejazi et al 2010 nagatsu et al 2014 related to various geological processes including enhanced oil production hornof and baig 1995 osei bonsu et al 2016 and co2 sequestration thomas et al 2016 white and ward 2012 have been examined using the hele shaw cell analogy many variations of hele shaw cells with specially designed compositional plates of different shapes sizes and materials have been proposed three common flow patterns in hele shaw cell setups are rectilinear flow radial source flow and five spot pattern homsy 1987 examples of hele shaw cells with rectilinear and radial source flows are presented in fig 3 a thomas et al 2016 and fig 3b song et al 2020 respectively besides rotating hele shaw cells and lifting hele shaw cells which are featured with the cell rotating about an axis perpendicular to the plates and the time dependent gap width respectively are used for specific situations in rotating hele shaw cells flows are driven by both viscosity contract and density difference between the fluids jiao and maxworthy 2008 lifting hele shaw cells have been primarily applied to study adhesion and radial viscous fingering with separated plates with either constant force or constant velocity sinha et al 2008 additionally djabbarov et al 2016 constructed square pvc cling films of different thicknesses in the cell to induce heterogeneous permeability in the hele shaw cells to examine the effects of surface roughness on the flow regimes in rough walled fractures rough walled hele shaw cells have been developed using surface patterned plates chen and horne 2006 other than the hele shaw cells mentioned above filling the cells with particles and forming packed beds within the typical hele shaw geometry trojer et al 2015 as illustrated in section 3 is noteworthy furthermore the hele shaw geometry is often observed in micro and nanofluidic models because the channel length and width are generally much larger than the channel depth examples of the hele shaw geometry are presented in section 5 in summary hele shaw cells have been widely used to investigate the 2d or quasi 2d dynamics of interfacial instability however the incomplete geometrical analogy between a porous medium and a hele shaw cell is well documented in the literature homsy 1987 when characterizing more complex flow diversions specially designed pore networks should be employed such as packed beds and microfluidic devices 5 synthesized micromodels with functionalized surfaces complex physical topologies and surface chemistries as well as dynamic parameters have been considered in the fabrication and operation of microfluidic devices to yield natural mimetic porous microenvironments commonly used materials in fabricating microchips include glass silicon and polymers such as pdms pmma and norland optical adhesive noa anbari et al 2018 ren et al 2013 the details of the micromodel material properties can be found in the work of anbari et al 2018 to rebuild the surface wettability in synthesized microchips many surface modification methods have been adopted and modified 5 1 polydimethylsiloxane pdms micromodels polydimethylsiloxane pdms is by far the most popular material to fabricate microfluidic chips some of the favorable chemical and physical properties of pdms have been summarized in the work of mcdonald and whitesides 2002 specifically pdms is a flexible elastomeric material that is suitable for fabricating complex geometries with tiny features however pdms shows hydrophobic surface characteristics in its unaltered form the surfaces generally need to be treated irreversibly or temporarily so that they possess specified wetting properties e g multiscale hydrophilic and patterned wetting properties to meet the requirements of different tasks furthermore the pdms material has poor compatibility with non polar organics many surface modification methods such as plasma treatment ultraviolet uv or uv ozone uvo treatment layer by layer lbl assembly and combinations of the different methods have been employed to produce the desired wetting states and improve the chemical resistance of pdms microchips 5 1 1 uniform hydrophilic wettability the formation of hydrophilic characteristics is the primary modification of the pdms micromodel surfaces through conventional surface treatment approaches plasma treatment is the most commonly used method to treat pdms surfaces for bonding and functionalizing chen and wharton 2017 kim et al 2019 meszaros et al 2018 tan et al 2010 by exposing pdms surfaces to air oxygen or other gases plasma the unit of o si ch 3 2 on the pdms surface is oxidized and the methyl groups ch 3 are transformed into a hydroxyl group oh to form a silanol group sioh rendering the surface hydrophilic hollahan and carlson 1970 furthermore the nano structuring of pdms during plasma treatment plays an essential role in hydrophilization bodas and khan malek 2007 unfortunately the effects of plasma treatment lack long term stability the hydrophobicity of the material could recover aggressively due to the movement of the untreated low molecular weight polymer chains to the surface fritz and owen 1995 and the elastomeric properties of pdms bodas and khan malek 2007 therefore the immediate use of the pdms micromodels after being treated by plasma for bonding is necessary and cannot be prolonged if the plasma induced hydrophilicity is employed an example is in the work of wu et al 2012 where the pdms glass microchips bonded by oxygen plasma treatment 30 w 30 s have been shown to be water wet within 1 h of bonding and oil wet after 24 h in single and two phase flow experiments another example is the work of berejnov et al 2008 where various wetting conditions had been created by exposing pdms to air at room temperature for various periods the distinctly functionalized pdms micromodels e g initial hydrophilic θ 20 and hydrophobic after 2 000 min θ 80 have been used to detect the role of wettability in multiphase flows in porous media many studies have explored the enhancement of plasma treatment to achieve stable and long lasting hydrophilicity the stability analysis of the plasma treated pdms surface has shown that changing the exposure environment to a high dielectric constant environment for example from air to water can slow down the wettability recovery rate chen and lindner 2007 therefore the way to store freshly treated pdms surfaces in the proper environment can be used in extending the formed hydrophilicity for several weeks chen and lindner 2007 more frequently plasma treatment had been used as a pretreatment process coupled with other surface modification methods to functionalize surfaces e g coupling plasma surface activation with subsequent physisorption of other chemicals to create long term pdms surface properties and to employ the lbl assembly after the plasma surface oxidization hemmila et al 2012 zhang et al 2018 the uv treatment technique is another significant method to tailor the surface wettability of pdms micromodels ma et al 2011 schneider and tabeling 2011 schneider et al 2010 this method is not as practical as the plasma treatment in practice e g prolonged treatment time is needed but it can provide a more in depth treatment coating the inner channel walls is another means to alter the wettability states in pdms microchips in this method mono or multiple layers of favorable molecules are attached to the activated pdms surfaces with plasma treatment by physisorption or polymerization e g grafting on and grafting from morin et al 2016 adopted the method reported by hemmila et al 2012 to coat the channel network with polyethylene glycol peg 200 hence the pdms microchannel had become water wet bauer et al 2010 produced long term e g months stable hydrophilic coatings in pdms microchannels by using an lbl assembly to yield poly allylamine hydrochloride pah and poly sodium 4 styrenesulfonate pss multilayers fig 4 a kim et al 2009 coated the microfluidic channels with a hybrid inorganic organic polymer hr4 to fabricate solvent resistant pdms microfluidic devices fig 4b this modification significantly increased the resistance of the pdms microfluidic channels to various solvents the hr4 modified pdms microfluidic device could be applied in the formation of water in oil w o and oil in water o w emulsions 5 1 2 patterned wettability due to the inherent complexity of rock and soil surface chemistry and their spatial and temporal heterogeneity new technologies are required to create wettability patterns and states in microchips uv treatments have the advantage of creating spatially patterned surface properties because the polymerization occurs only in the uv exposed areas schneider et al 2010 reported a uv initiated wettability patterning method in pdms microchips fig 5 the micromodel was first treated with the photoinitiator benzophenone bp and subsequently filled with an acrylic acid aa solution then the sealed micromodel was partially exposed to the uv light for several minutes using an appropriate mask the uv induced graft polymerization of poly acrylic acid paa on the pdms surfaces displayed long term e g six months or longer hydrophilicity this method improved both the wettability contrast and spatial resolution of the patterned structures in comparison with previous techniques the patterning method is particularly applicable to produce sophisticated microfluidic devices for studying parallel flow stabilization synthesize double emulsions and fabricate network microchips with patterned wettability schneider and tabeling 2011 produced microchips with heterogeneous pore scale wettability using the uv treatment method to study the impact of wettability patterning on mechanisms of oil water flows in the oil recovery processes the designed network was modified to simulate the wetting conditions of many oil reservoirs by altering the small pores 50 μm to be hydrophilic hexadecane water contact angle 30 while leaving the large channels 100 μm hydrophobic hexadecane water contact angle 180 similarly ma et al 2011 used the uvo treatment and a photomask to hydrophilize the pdms surfaces and pattern wettability in pdms microchips the oxidized surfaces were immersed in water until used in the multiphase flow experiments for mimetic heterogeneous oil reservoirs ma et al 2011 the top and bottom inner surfaces of the flow spaces should display consistent wettability when studying fluid flows and transport behaviors surface modification of materials is an ever developing research area many strategies to modify pdms microchips are being established but have yet to be applied to subsurface research further information on these strategies can be found in recent review articles hetemi and pinson 2017 wong and ho 2009 zhou et al 2012 5 2 glass micromodels glass is one of the first materials to be used for fabricating microfluidic devices mckellar and wardlaw 1982 glass is hard and inert to chemicals and solvents making the fabricated devices more compatible for experiments under reservoir conditions therefore even though etching glass and silicon is expensive and time consuming glass based devices are essential in the technology of micromodels furthermore glass slides are widely used as a cover to seal the channels in polymer and silicon substrates making the surface modification of glass surfaces especially important the use of glass micromodels for recording the events in subsurface processes is diverse including the visualization of microorganism transport in soil wan et al 1994 and the detection of fundamental transport phenomena e g fluid velocity the brownian motion of colloids and tracer diffusion from fractures in the matrix in matrix fracture micromodels wan et al 1996 recently many glass micromodels have been treated for the desired wetting states e g from the water wet state to the oil wet or mixed wetting states grate et al 2013 analyzed various pretreatment methods before silanizing the surfaces with hexamethyldisilazane hmds to yield a uniform oil wet state in silicon glass micromodels cleaning the glass surface with boiling concentrated nitric acid has been demonstrated to be an effective way of restoring the glass state to which it can be silanized to a similar oil wetness as silica the air water and oil water contact angles on silica were 95 and 140 respectively the pretreatment procedure has been determined to be useful for the modification of anodically bonded silicon glass micromodels where an elevated temperature 400 c is required to attain silanization the developed uniform wettability micromodels are especially useful for studying fluid dynamics as the wettability influences flow processes several methods have been developed to generate heterogeneous or patterned wettability in glass based micromodels zhang et al 2016 and meng et al 2016 created a heterogeneous surface wettability in a glass or quartz micro capillary by combining tailored photolithography with self assembled monolayer chemistry the surface modified microcapillaries were used to study the effects of heterogeneous surface wettability on emulsion stability fig 6 a a hydrophobic section was created in the capillary by coating a monolayer of octyltriethoxysilane otes the surface modified capillary displayed alternating hydrophilic water air contact angle of 27 3 measured on a flat surface and hydrophobic water air contact angle of 97 5 regions without changing the hydraulic diameter instead of tuning the wettability on the glass or quartz surface another study employed a novel method of simultaneously creating and tailoring the wettability of polymeric microstructures in glass micromodels fig 6b lee et al 2015 in this method polymeric microstructures were generated in the glass microchannels by photolithography followed by a uv polymerization reaction by changing the ratio of the hydrophilic and oleophilic crosslinking agents in the precursor solution and increasing the effects by copolymerization with the hydrophilic and oleophilic additives both heterogeneous and continuously changing wettability states e g water decane contact angle from 60 to 144 were achieved 5 3 silicon micromodels compared with glass etching in silicon is valuable for achieving high precision buchgraber et al 2012 silicon substrates with structural features were anodically bonded with glass slides to seal the channels forming silicon glass micromodels therefore the surface modification of these models involved both materials silicon based micromodels have initially shown excellent water wet features with the oxidization induced silica surface silanization is the primary approach to alter the wetting states in silicon based micromodels grate et al 2012 used different silanes to modify the wettability of silica surfaces and demonstrated a full range of wettability including the intermediate wetting state in a later study grate et al 2013 investigated the pretreatment methods before silanization with hmds on both glass and silica surfaces sandengen et al 2016 employed the same protocol of using pre treatment and hmds to render silicon and glass micromodels and oil wet sandstone plugs 5 4 optical adhesive micromodels optical adhesives such as noa are emerging fabricating materials for microfluidic devices these compounds are thiol ene cross linked photocurable polymers which display outstanding advantages in their application i the procedure of fabricating optical adhesive based devices is simple and inexpensive ii the devices formed show fair transparency under a microscope and are chemically resistant including aliphatic and aromatic compounds because of the existence of thiol ene and iii the devices are not permeable to air and water vapor therefore multiphase flows involving gases can be studied using noa based microfluidic devices the noa surface is hydrophilic e g the water contact angle is around 50 70 for noa81 many treatments such as oxygen plasma and uv treatment have been used to change the noa to be either hydrophilic or hydrophobic with relatively longer lasting stability than pdms wagli et al 2011 as a representative study zhao et al 2016 systematically altered the wettability of noa based visual cells with the contact angles ranging from 7 to 150 to study the effect of wettability on viscously unfavorable fluid fluid displacement the core of the hele shaw cell in their experiment was a patterned porous structure fabricated by soft imprint lithography with vertical posts noa81 used an extended uv radiation exposure time to increase the hydrophilicity levache et al 2012 levache and bartolo 2014 additionally trojer et al 2015 proposed the cvd of trimethoxysilane to alter the noa81 wetting state to hydrophobicity 6 microchip surface modification strategies microfluidic platforms have evolved into a mature technology this is due to the advancement of multiple microfabrication technologies such as hot embossing heckele et al 2006 injection molding becker and gartner 2008 laser ablation of polymers khan malek 2006 kinahan et al 2016 suriano et al 2011 glass channel fabrication mohammadi et al 2015a oosterbroek et al 2005 pan et al 2017 micromachining hsieh et al 2017 sugioka et al 2014 photolithography and soft lithography madadi et al 2013 mohammadi et al 2015b qin et al 2010 sollier et al 2011 however the fabricated microchips may not be ready for direct use because the desired microenvironments have not been obtained or more specifically the surfaces do not aid in the physicochemical reactions the most eminent applications of surface treatments have focused on biomolecule separation comprising rna reinholt et al 2014 dna kinahan et al 2016 amino acids lin et al 2016 proteins holczer and furjes 2017 roy et al 2013 and blood plasma madadi et al 2015 mohammadi et al 2015a as well as oil and gas applications lifton 2016 zhang et al 2018 in this section conventional techniques used to modify the surfaces of microfluidic channels are briefly evaluated fig 7 for details readers are referred to several critical reviews kitsara and ducree 2013 kumlangdudsana et al 2017 makamba et al 2003 wong and ho 2009 zhou et al 2010 2012 furthermore a crude oil aging method is discussed as a specific surface modification approach for subsurface oil and gas applications 6 1 conventional surface modification methods 6 1 1 plasma treatment the plasma activation process allows the transformation of a polymer surface to generate a transient hydrophilic surface with a few molecular layers due to crosslinking degradation and oxidation several parameters e g exposure time power and pressure in the plasma chamber type of substrate material and gas es present play vital roles in the plasma modification efficiency moon and vaziri 2009 pietro favia 1998 tsougeni et al 2009 presented a stable surface modification on pmma and polyether ether ketone peek the results demonstrated that the surface roughness retards aging considerably lin et al 2016 improved the hydrophilicity of pdms microfluidic devices by grafting dendrimers with oxygen plasma activation and the silane treatment to reduce the contact angle from 108 to 31 8 roy and yue roy and yue 2011 compared nitrogen oxygen and argon plasma treatments for cyclic olefin copolymer coc substrates the efficiency of the n2 plasma treatment was shown to be much higher than o2 and ar however the o2 plasma presented a greater thermal bond strength higher roughness hydrophilicity and enhanced hemocompatibility maheshwari et al 2010 completed a long term hydrophilic modification study on pdms using the o2 plasma modification and branched polyethylenimine b pei and recorded a reduction in the contact angle to 40 while the effects remained stable for over 240 h 6 1 2 ultraviolet uv treatment the uv treatment method can facilitate surface modification after the fabrication of microfluidic channels chang et al 2010 this technique notably minimized the analyte adsorption and enhanced the electroosmotic flow eof stability in the pdms microchannels furthermore compared with plasma treatment methods this technique presented a deeper surface treatment in the pdms substrate without cracking berdichevsky et al 2004 additionally uv light with a short wavelength of less than 200 nm is suggested for surface modification cefalas et al 2012 lippert 2005 and has been employed to activate the polymer through breaking surface bonds inside the microfluidic channel the water contact angle for example varied from 12 to 72 based on the uv power and processing time chang et al 2010 lin et al 2017 recently employed a new approach to enhance the stability of the uv ozone uvo treatment method for up to 16 weeks additionally the impact of air dehumidified and vacuum storage conditions have been studied for uvo treated polycarbonate pc coc and pmma the vacuum and dehumidified storage conditions were verified to inhibit the hydrophobic recovery of coc and pc whereas the storage conditions did not affect the pmma stability 6 1 3 chemical vapor deposition cvd treatment the cvd technique forms a thin film on the surfaces makamba et al 2003 cvd is used for surface modifications and thin film coatings in a variety of applications including microfluidics composites sensing optoelectronics photonics and nanobiotechnology gleason 2015 chen et al chen et al 2008 reported the first cvd method for surface treatments and bonding improvements with two complementary polymers poly 4 aminomethyl p xylylene co p xylylene and poly 4 formyl p xylylene co p xylylene bowman et al 2015 presented a new apparatus utilizing a combination of plasma activation and physical cvd to improve the surface modification of the pdms substrate ortiz et al 2017 modified a pmma droplet microfluidic device coating it with a silica nanoparticle sinp layer that produces super hydrophilic properties due to the generated nano roughness and subsequently utilizing dodecyltrichlorosilane dts to create a super hydrophobic surface allowing repeatable droplet generation for real time toxicity assays in another study prefabricated pdms microchannels were modified with a thin coat of fluoropolymer utilizing initiated cvd icvd riche et al 2011 the fluorinated coating comprised a cross link of 1h 1h 2h 2h perfluorodecyl acrylate pfda with ethylene glycol diacrylate egda generating a poly pfda co egda coating to provide low surface energy the fluoropolymer coating allowed the pdms microfluidic devices to resist swelling and absorption in the reaction synthesis dudek et al 2009 presented a range of surface treatments on the cyclic polyolefin based microfluidic substrates to generate a uniform and stable hydrophilic surface various techniques e g oxygen plasma activation alone or coupled with cvd dextran and silicon dioxide pe modifications have been utilized for wettability modifications the results demonstrated that pe and dioxide modifications yielded the most hydrophilic surfaces a summary of the cvd based surface modification techniques is provided by yoshida et al 2006 6 1 4 surfactant treatment treatments have been utilized by adding surfactants to the running buffer to modify the surface of a microchip several surfactant based modification studies have been summarized elsewhere zhou et al 2010 2012 surfactants have been used to modify microchip surface properties for instance to change the direction of electroosmotic flow eof liu et al 2005 holczer and fürjes holczer and furjes 2017 modified the hydrophilicity of the pdms surface using surfactants tx 100 and pdms b peo li et al 2017b utilized synthesized pluronic f127 as a surfactant for surface modifications in droplet based microfluidic devices madadi and casals terré madadi and casals terré 2012 used three surfactants tween 20 triton x 100 and brij 35 for the short and long term surface modifications of the pdms channels the results demonstrated that triton x 100 is more effective than brij 35 and tween 20 where the hydrophobic recovery was insignificant after two months 6 1 5 wet chemical method sol gel surface modifications and lbl deposition are the two leading wet chemical surface modification strategies for synthesized microchips the sol gel process has been widely utilized to generate a thin layer of an inorganic colloidal suspension or inorganic structures e g powder fiber and monoliths on a substrate some intrinsic characteristics such as low reaction temperatures cost effectiveness the ability to form precise structures and layers easily at the molecular level and nanoscale porosity make it a popular technique for thin layer formation park et al 2016 presented a sol gel surface modification process using a silica coating to enhance the hydrophilic properties of pdms microfluidic channels and increase the eof mobility by almost one order of magnitude moreover ma and zhang 2014 synthesized a 10 nm tio2 film on the microchannels to generate a super hydrophilic surface in silicon micromodels the ultra thin tio2 coated film created no negative impact on the channel morphology while the water flow velocity was four times higher than it had been additionally yang et al 2009 utilized the sol gel method with a tetraethoxysilane teos coating for pdms microchannels in a free flow isoelectric focusing system where the teos coating improved the bonding strength and chemical resistance lbl deposition is a pervasive surface modification technique that allows the formation of a thin film through sequentially adsorbing oppositely charged materials onto virtually any substrate makamba et al 2005 richardson et al 2015 2016 a wide variety of assembly techniques e g immersion spin and fluidics assembly materials e g organic and inorganic materials and substrates have been employed for coating microfluidic devices with complex geometries richardson et al 2015 to create polyelectrolyte clay protein layer films in a bioreactor mehta et al 2007 attached primary bone marrow cells on pdms surfaces by using the lbl assembly method more recently choi et al 2018 spatially patterned the surface wetting properties in pdms microchips by the lbl deposition of poly allylamine hydrochloride pah for the polycation and poly acrylic acid paa for the polyanion these patterned microchips were applied to produce multiple emulsion drops successfully the proposed on chip lbl modification is a rapid and straightforward process that requires a syringe vacuum induced segmented flow where many different patterns of wetting features could be created furthermore the lbl assembly technology has been employed to incorporate geomaterials onto microchip channel walls zhang et al 2018 nano or micro scale mineral particles with inherent charged properties in aqueous conditions have been utilized in the lbl assembly process more examples of using lbl deposition to modify the surfaces of microfluidic devices are presented in the literature minnikanti et al 2014 6 2 crude oil aging treatment in micromodels the deposition of oil components on rock minerals contributes to variable wettability states fogden 2010 jackson et al 2016 kumar and fogden 2009 lebedeva and fogden 2011 mahani et al 2015 2017 marathe et al 2012 kumar et al 2012 therefore a frequently used and straightforward aging method to provide micromodel wettability for subsurface applications is required to restore the original states of porous media to the underground conditions the adoption of standard aging methods for micromodels is required reservoir rocks have been saturated with geofluids throughout geological history and the wetting state of the crude oil brine rock system is the result of complex fluids solid interactions aging treatments aim to reconstruct realistic wetting states by allowing adequate crude oil brine mineral interactions in standard aging methods the micromodel is saturated with a specific crude oil or oil components and sealed for an adequate period after prolonged direct contact the polar components of the oil are prone to be adsorbed onto the solid surface causing the oil to be the wetting phase buchgraber et al 2012 noticed that the wettability of silicon glass micromodels had changed after flooding with crude oil with no initial water distribution in the micromodel this manner of wettability alteration is stable provided the micromodels are not cleaned with toluene or other strong solvents conn et al 2014 aged pdms microchips with dyed paraffin oil for over 24 h to recover a hydrophobic state the aged micromodels were experimentally used for the visualization of oil displacement by water air and foam various surface modification strategies have helped reconstruct the wetting state in microfluidic studies however the buildup of simplified wetting is not sufficient and the study of subsurface porous systems require more mimetic surface properties to be considered rock and soil are composed of minerals in which the grain surfaces of different compositions are spatially distributed furthermore long term geofluids solid interactions have significantly influenced rock and soil surface chemistries in the following section we provide a review of the techniques that incorporate geomaterials into microfluidic devices 7 geomaterial dominated micromodels in the context of the subsurface operations micromodels that contain geomaterials are significant and have attained popularity due to the involved mimetic surface chemistries these models provide the opportunity to study the fluid rock physicochemical interactions that are often absent in conventional micromodel studies synthesized micromodels including the simple planar surfaces can be improved by adding minerals or crushed rocks in the fabrication process in this section several techniques developed for introducing geomaterials in pore level studies are categorized and their performances are evaluated 7 1 planar solid surfaces the first category of geomaterial coated micromodels contains open planar surfaces of synthesized materials or natural rocks synthesized materials e g glass or quartz can be used because they have similar chemical compositions as natural rock forming minerals employing these planar surfaces for the static or dynamic simulations of geological phenomena is a straightforward and efficient process especially for studying fluid solid interactions in some studies slabs of synthesized materials or rocks are directly used as the solid surfaces where their interactions with the exposed fluids are documented lebedeva and fogden 2011b marathe et al 2012 rezaei gomari and joseph 2017 xie et al 2019 depositing the geomaterials on planar glass or quartz slides and the subsequent characterizations of the coated surfaces is another approach to probe the solid fluid interactions clays and other minerals e g carbonates have been widely used as materials deposited on the model surfaces berg et al 2010 cense et al 2011 fogden 2012 fogden and lebedeva 2012 lebedeva and fogden 2010 2011c mahani et al 2015a 2015c various types of planar surfaces have been developed by depositing kaolinite on a glass substrate through dripping clay suspensions on pre cleaned microscope slides followed by administering a heat treatment to immobilize the particles on the surface fogden 2012 fogden and lebedeva 2012 lebedeva and fogden 2010 2011c a field emission scanning electron microscopy fesem image of a formed kaolinite coating is shown in fig 8 a lebedeva and fogden 2011c the manufactured models are used to simulate the interactions between clay minerals and crude oil brines in particular the adsorption and deposition of polar components of crude oils on kaolinite under different brine conditions have been studied lebedeva and fogden 2010 researchers further conducted a series of experiments with the aid of such geomaterial coated surfaces berg et al 2010 cense et al 2011 mahani et al 2015 mahani et al 2015c mahani et al 2015a prepared a model of a sandstone system consisting of clay minerals na montmorillonite which deposited on a glass substrate to study the kinetics of oil detachment during low salinity waterflooding processes in sandstone this methodology deposited mineral suspensions on clean base substrates where the clay patches were dried in a desiccator to immobilize the deposited particles the model has been used to study the dependency of the oil water contact angle on the water salinity mahani et al 2015a in a similar study crushed carbonate grains limestone and dolomite were deposited on glass slides to fabricate carbonate surfaces mahani et al 2015c the slides were dried in a desiccator after the deposition to maintain the carbonate patches immobility during the experiments the formed mineral coating was thin 1 10 μm thick carbonate particle sizes ranging between 1 and 20 μm rough and circular fig 8b mahani et al 2015c the modeled carbonate surfaces had been used to study the wettability alteration during low salinity waterflooding processes in carbonate systems the use of desiccator drying is an improvement over the techniques used in earlier works where the clay particles were glued onto the glass slides berg et al 2010 cense et al 2011 7 2 micromodels coated with geomaterials similar to forming planar geomaterial functionalized substrates rock minerals also have been incorporated into transparent micromodels such micromodels have been used to study the wettability alteration bartels et al 2017 bondino et al 2013 and detachment of fine grains song and kovscek 2015 2016 on the recovery of oil during the waterflooding processes micromodels with a mineral coated pore network have successfully demonstrated the effects of rock fluid interactions during multiphase flow processes additionally mineral grains contribute to the improvement in the hydraulic continuity during a multiphase flow process providing fine paths for the connectivity of a wetting phase in a porous medium the major faults of the developed systems are the detachment of minerals during flooding and reduced visibility of fluids in the presence of solid particles the detachment of the solid particles can be prevented by heat treatment fig 9 a bondino et al 2013 song and kovscek 2015 by resorting to electrostatic forces between the negatively charged fine particles e g kaolinite and montmorillonite and positively charged polydiallyldimethylammonium chloride pdda solution fig 9b zhang et al 2018 or by simply plasma oxidizing the pdms surface alzahid et al 2018 7 3 micromodel coated with grown mineral crystals minerals can also be introduced to the micromodels through crystal growth lee et al 2016 created calcite posts on the polymerized surfaces of two glass plates positioned in parallel to form a channel fig 10a in this work the glass microchannel was firstly cured by photopatterning with uv light acting on a precursor solution containing a crosslinker polyethylene glycol diacrylate a photoinitiator a porogen polyethylene glycol and calcite caco3 nanoparticles lee et al 2016 the posts were subsequently grown in situ via supplying supersaturated solutions rich in ca2 and co3 2 ions lee et al 2016 the fundamental difficulty with the development of such a system is the proper patterning of posts to avoid plugging smaller pores additionally the glass surface between the posts is not crystalized because the calcite crystals form the grains of the micromodel only therefore the crystals do not contribute to the capillary continuity of the porous medium and the wettability of the glass surface may differ from the body of the solid grains similarly sekine et al sekine et al 2011 grew halite crystals inside a microchannel made of pdms by injecting a supersaturated brine solution followed by a cooling step wang et al 2017b developed an effective methodology for the in situ growth of caco3 nanocrystals with a thickness of less than 2 μm in glass microfluidic channels fig 10b in this method the surface of the borosilicate glass was functionalized with a chloroform phase containing silane made from n trimethoxysilylpropyl ethylenediaminetriacetate trisodium salt chloroform water and hydrochloric acid wang et al 2017b the calcite crystals were grown by the consecutive injections of cacl2 and na2co3 solutions wang et al 2017b the rough surface of the microchannels covered by calcite crystals could significantly improve the capillary continuity of a transparent porous medium without the detachment of fine particles the wettability of the porous medium could also be altered from water wet to oil wet by aging the medium with oil 7 4 micromodels fabricated with geomaterial real rock porous media have been used as cores using a core holder device in darcy scale experiments amyx et al 1960 recently geomaterials have been used as the fabrication material for micromodels these were either original rock sections e g sandstone shale coal and granite gerami et al 2017 gerold et al 2018 mahoney et al 2015 oh et al 2017 porter et al 2015 singh et al 2017 or synthesized mineral crystals e g quartz and calcite kelly et al 2016 mohammadi and mahani 2020 song et al 2014 this enabled the direct visualization of fluids flow and transport in realistic rock media a variety of different micromodels have evolved with the inclusion of etched rock sections as the central flowing media rocks are cut into thin sections followed by surface patterning on these thin sections song et al 2014 have pioneered a combination of laser engraving and chemical etching to create a pore network on the surface of a calcite wafer fig 11 a which is then kept against a glass slide to seal the pore network this assembly has been used to study the dissolution rate of calcite with acidic fluids although a transparent carbonate crystal utilized in the fabrication of a micromodel the heterogeneity in the chemistry of the carbonate reservoir rock cannot be representative due to the presence of a single calcite mineral in the porous medium another drawback of the developed micromodel is the difference in the wetting properties between the micromodel and the material used to seal it song et al 2014 in a similar study a quartz substrate was etched with the reactive ion method gorowitz and saia 1984 to create a nano scale pattern formed by a lacey carbon film resembling the pore network of tight shale permeable rocks fig 11b kelly et al 2016 the fabrication technique of micromodels using transparent minerals may have no remarkable advantage over that of glass microfluidic devices however the use of minerals represents a significant step toward the development of geomaterial mimetic microfluidic devices oh et al 2017 bonded a thin rock wafer e g shale and granite to a pdms layer that contained a straight conduit to observe the sorption of heavy metals with the rock minerals using micro x ray fluorescence μ xrf this assembly successfully demonstrated the interaction between the fluids and rock minerals oh et al 2017 in a similar study porter et al 2015 bonded a laser etched shale wafer to a glass slide to study the displacement of oil and brine with supercritical co2 fig 11c the chip was placed inside a pressure vessel equipped with a transparent window that allowed the application of confining pressures and the visualization of multiphase flows under reservoir conditions porter et al 2015 gerami et al 2017 developed a coal on a chip device by bonding an etched wafer of coal to pdms to study the contact angles among the fluids on the rough surface of the laser etched zones fig 11d similarly mahoney et al 2015 reproduced the original cleat of coals using reactive ion etching and uv laser etching methodologies without a remarkable modification of the surface chemistry of the etched zones alhuraishawy et al 2016 2018 placed slabs of sandstone and carbonate rocks between two acrylic plates thus adding transparency to their fluid flow studies such systems have successfully demonstrated the sweep and propagation of fluids on the surface of rock samples with a limited visualization of the microscopic phenomena at fluid interfaces more recently gerold et al 2018 proposed a procedure to integrate thin rock sections sandstone and shale into microchips called flow on rock device ford these devices have been introduced as the bridge between conventional synthetic microchips and core experiments thin sections of rocks have also been directly sealed into micromodels without patterning microchannels or flow networks within the flow spaces were the naturally occurring pores in the rock media in a recent study singh et al 2017 sealed a chip of rock with a cured pdms slab to study multiphase flow processes fig 11e the fluid flow was visualized at the darcy scale when a fluorescein free fluid displaced a fluorescein containing flow singh et al 2017 additionally confocal laser scanning microscopy clsm was used to extract the 2d images at different depths max depth 280 μm to reconstruct a 3d image of the multiphase flow process in which a fluorescein dyed phosphate buffer was displaced with a non dyed buffer singh et al 2017 in summary the use of properly sealed thin rock sections for visual investigations of in situ phenomena in reservoirs has been drawing an increasing amount of attention this approach provides a research methodology that is prone to bridge conventional microfluidic studies with core flooding experiments although these systems are similar to real porous media the poor visibility of the fluids interfaces in the matrices and the uncertainty in the reproduction of flow characteristics remain as the primary limitations additionally glass or polymer substrates used for sealing the etched pattern may demonstrate different wettability characteristics 8 three dimensional 3d micromodels micromodels with varying depths either 2 5d or 3d have been used in research at the pore network scale park et al 2015 xu et al 2017a yun et al 2017 the depth variable micromodels are better representations of the fluid dynamics in porous rocks xu et al 2017a yun et al 2017 packed beds also represent the 3d physical features with limited visualization capability as detailed in section 3 in this section we review the 3d micromodels fabricated using the microfabrication technique park et al 2015 used a depth averaging method to process the 3d digital images of the rock then multi layer lithography of su 8 and electroforming of nickel were used to form the mold followed by replicating the polymer based micromodels yun et al 2017 generated a second macro pore mask from a base mask extracted from sem images of a rock section by removing the micro pore structures with repeated erosion dilation e d processes followed by an optimized sequential etching approach was used to create the dual depth silicon based micromodels fig 12 a both of these approaches can fabricate micromodels with variable depths another approach to generate depth variable micromodels is to couple the standard lithography process with the isotropy of hydrofluoric hf etching to obtain shallower throats in a designed pore network fig 12b xu et al 2017a however only two depths can be induced in this method compared with the two methods detailed above by adjusting the pore design and etching parameters the depth variations of the pore throat are easily controlled in the model other than the traditional microfabrication methods cutting edge technologies such as 3d printing techniques have been applied to produce 3d replicas of subsurface porous media fereshtenejad and song 2016 hasiuk 2018 kong et al 2018 gypsum silica sand and resin are the primary materials used in printing 3d rocks for these models creating a feature size less than 100 μm thick is seemingly complicated while a microfluidic flow channel width of approximately 20 μm has been recently been reached using resin and customized digital light processing and stereolithography dlp sla gong et al 2017 3d printed gypsum rocks have been used for investigating microstructural changes e g micro fractures and micro pores during physical experiments kong et al 2018 elastic properties huang et al 2016 and dynamic crack coalescence jiang et al 2016 the primary limitations for 3d printed models for subsurface applications include the resolution and printing materials kong et al 2018 with advancements in 3d printing such models are expected to play essential roles in the physical modeling of flows in porous media while appreciating the significant accomplishments in fabricating 2 5d or 3d microchips for subsurface applications we should realize that transport phenomena are affected by the discrepancy between the solid surfaces in natural porous rocks and the created miniaturized models fortunately the chemical and geomaterial based surface modification methods have been deemed to fit into the 3d micromodels future research is necessary to integrate both the 3d features and surface geochemistry into such models 9 nanofluidic models nanofluidics is an emerging field contingent on the advancement of microfabrication techniques eijkel and van den berg 2010 nanofluidic devices have been referred to as those that have a channel or pore of which at least one dimension is in the range of 1 nm to 1 μm panigrahi 2016 some geological formations contain large bodies of nanoscale pores hence there is great potential for developing nanofluidic devices for subsurface applications this section explores two approaches for fabricating nanofluidic devices i etching nanochannels and ii sealing mesoporous media in micromodels a few examples of these devices for reservoir flows are discussed 9 1 nanomodels with designed nanostructures designed nanostructures can be patterned on substrates by conventional photolithography interference lithography electron beam lithography nanoimprint lithography polymer nanochannels and other approaches as discussed by xia et al 2012 three types of nanostructures have been developed planar nanochannels low aspect ratio ar square nanochannels ar 1 and deep nanochannels large ar among these planar nanochannels are the most advantageous with the ease of fabrication and experimental operation xia et al 2012 nanofluidic devices with planar nanochannels several tens to hundreds of nanometers in depth have been employed to study multiphase flows and single phase behaviors in underground reservoirs bao et al 2017 hasham et al 2018 zhong et al 2018a some representative research includes using silicon based nanochips with a planar channel array of 100 nm in depth to investigate the two phase gas slip effects wu et al 2014 employing silicon nanochips patterned with a channel network depth of 200 nm to visualize the effects of surfactants displacing oil he et al 2014 investigating hydraulic fracturing fluid dynamics with patterned planar networks depth of 175 nm hasham et al 2018 observing the capillary filling of 8 nm high nanochannels fig 13 a li et al 2017a and investigating the contact angles of gas liquid hydrocarbons in glass models with parallel channel arrays with the depth of 10 nm alfi et al 2016 the critical prerequisite of the nanofluidic based approach is the feasibility of optical visualizations of nano scale phenomena with the current microscopy tools the optical microscopy loses its efficiency when observing fluids dynamics at approximately the 10 nm scale where the phase contrast is undetectable with bright field microscopy li et al 2017a and the fluorescence intensity is out of detection range zhong et al 2018b a thin high refractive index silicon nitride si3n4 coating between the substrate and nanochannels has been reported to be able to facilitate the direct optical observations in sub 10 nm scales li et al 2017a zhong et al 2018b the si3n4 layer is formed by the low pressure cvd lpcvd and the light signals are enhanced in the integrated si3n4 base layer by fabry pérot interference li et al 2017a zhong et al 2018b the schematic of the nanochip fabrication procedure mechanism of the enhancement of light signals and an example of distinguishing liquid gas phases are shown in fig 13a li et al 2017a 9 2 nanomodels with mesoporous media mesoporous materials are often incorporated into micromodels as nanojunctions or membranes connecting microchannels for biomedical fields such models provide unique 3d nanoscale perspectives within the mesoporous media e g water capillary condensation in nanoconfinement ion concentration polarization icp and dna analysis ally et al 2016 kim et al 2017 vincent et al 2017 xia et al 2012 nafion is a popular porous material to be patterned printed or self sealed in pdms glass microchips for biomedical and chemical analyses kim et al 2010 2017 lee et al 2008 as shown in fig 13b nafion has been utilized as a nanoporous junction in a bifurcated system for icp operations kim et al 2017 the nafion membranes consist of charged nanopores with diameters of less than 10 nm in a recent study a layer 5 μm of mesoporous silicon posi on top of a p type silicon si wafer was patterned and bonded with a glass substrate to form a porous layer vincent et al 2017 this system was used to investigate the water imbibition by capillary condensation in nanopores fig 13c vincent et al 2017 the reported observations have provided useful information on the dynamics of the invasion by capillary condensation in the nanopores another approach is to generate nano packs in the microchannels ally et al 2016 developed a novel mineral nanoporous bed by packing the colloidal silica particles 150 nm in diameter in a conventional silicon glass microchip with a straight microchannel fig 13d the packing process is similar to that of packed beds firstly a plug made of iron oxide particles 6 μm in diameter was generated in the downstream of the microchannel then the silica particle suspension was streamed through the microchannel forming an 8 mm long packed bed ally et al 2016 the bed was cleaned and dried with toluene and nitrogen successively this nano pack was used to directly visualize the nanoscale capillary condensation of hydrocarbon and carbon dioxide under well controlled high pressure conditions ally et al 2016 despite the continuous improvements in fabricating nanostructures with nanofluidic technology no particular consideration has been given to surface modifications in these nanochannels additionally the active tailoring of surface properties is challenging primarily due to the extreme size scale alternative methods could be found in other research areas such as biomedical technology xia et al 2012 and membrane filtration mireles and gaborski 2017 these two microfabrication methods provide opportunities for future subsurface studies 10 selection guidelines in table 1 the key features of the reviewed visual models in the six categories are summarized including the geometries dimensions minimum feature sizes visualization tools interior surfaces and some examples of research for the geological flow studies even though 2d micromodels provide ample information about the flow in porous media 3d pore networks are essential to study the nature of heterogeneity in the formations and the induced events packed beds and hele shaw cells synthesized 3d micromodels and nanofluidic models are candidates for tools for 3d observations of geological processes among these methods the geometry and topology of synthesized 3d micromodels could be designed and experiments using these models can be repeatable however packed beds and hele shaw cells are easier and cheaper to be fabricated the resolution of 3d printed models and repeatability of experiments using packed beds and hele shaw cells have yet to be improved all visual models are subject to certain surface modifications to offer the desired wetting states mineralogy or roughness packed beds hele shaw cells and geomaterial dominated micromodels have been developed with single or complex mineralogy imitating natural subsurface porous media when proper packing particles or coating materials have been used packed beds and hele shaw cells are more easily assembled when compared with the fabrication of geomaterial dominated micromodels which involves the functionalization and surface characterizations moreover the endurance of functionalized micromodels planar surfaces under practical experimental conditions e g long term erosion by chemicals and operating at elevated temperatures or pressures has yet to be tested flows often involve complex chemicals such as surfactants acids and alkalis in the oil exploitation processes therefore compatibilities of the visual models are critical in many geological experiments and models fabricated with rigid materials e g glass and silicon are suitable 11 conclusions scientists in the geoscience and engineering community have extensively used visual models that simulate porous rocks and soils to investigate the multiphase flow transport and reactions at pore scales there are ongoing and future research opportunities i to advance the visual models for surface chemistry 3d aspects nano scale features and elevated pressure and temperature compatibility and ii to employ these models for rapidly screening the flow processes in underground formations we briefly summarize the modeling potential in the following 11 1 physical similarities incorporating petrophysical parameters into the design and fabrication of visual models is essential to improve the reliability of the modeling experiments critical elements include the features of the porous media such as 3d pore networks pore wall surfaces and their carrying fluids both the replicated complex porous structures from natural porous media and the computationally designed patterns are being used as the flow network in microchips parameters such as topology dimensions sizes and representative elemental volumes revs are necessary for careful designs with the advanced imaging techniques such as μct scanning the 2d and 3d reconstructions of pore geometries are feasible nowadays the 2 5d and 3d porous microchips are being developed using multilayer fabrication and 3d printing many strategies including chemical modifications and employing geomaterials have been developed to create reflective surfaces in visual models because rocks are formed on geological time scales it is unrealistic to replicate the surface properties in the visual models fully however the inclusion of actual minerals is becoming an increasingly essential requirement 11 2 chemically compatible devices most materials used in the fabrication of visual models such as glass quartz silicon and noa81 provide excellent chemical resistance to the typical components of geofluids pdms and resins suffer from relatively weak chemical resistance surface modifications have been developed to improve the internal channel surface properties as previously discussed e g coating the microfluidic channels with hybrid inorganic organic polymers hr4 to improve pdms s resistance to the solvents kim et al 2009 the development of visual models has primarily benefited from the recent progress in material synthesis microfabrication technology and advanced visualization tools with the ever developing surface treatment strategies both substrate surfaces and microflow structures have been functionalized with custom features 11 3 high pressure and high temperature hp ht conditions hp ht conditions are the typical state in underground environments microfluidic devices are generally limited in enduring the reservoir pressures and temperatures for instance the most widely used pdms glass microchips bonded with the plasma based sealing can only withstand net pressures of less than 0 5 mpa sollier et al 2011 efforts have been made to imitate elevated pressure and temperature conditions in microchips firstly the endurable pressures and temperatures are increased by using rigid materials such as silicon pinho et al 2014 glass molla et al 2016 quartz song et al 2014 and pmma kim et al 2013 secondly improved bonding techniques help to improve the resistance pressure of microfluidic devices by using anodic bonding hybrid silicon glass microchips have been reported to withstand 40 mpa and 200 c marre et al 2010 nguyen et al 2015 when employing a double cross linked nano adhesive dcna to bond both the rigid e g silicon wafer and glass and flexible substrates e g pdms poly imide pi and poly ethylene terephthalate pet the burst pressure of the developed microfluidic devices has been reported to be over 2 5 mpa and could reach a maximum value of 11 7 mpa while the surface features on the substrate can be preserved you et al 2013 finally using custom built chambers to offset the surrounding pressures has been proven to be an effective way to improve the maximum tolerable pressure of the devices george et al 2005 11 4 advanced visualization methods advanced visualization techniques have been adopted in the experimental routines visualization methods such as clsm provide 3d images of flow processes recent advances in non intrusive and non contact on chip sensing techniques are expected to provide new avenues for measuring various events in micromodels narang et al 2018 zarifi et al 2018 zarikos et al 2018 for instance microfluidics has been integrated with embedded sensors for detecting temperature pressure flow rates ion concentrations and concentrations of bioanalytes future sensors are expected to detect several real time parameters related to multiphase flows in microchannels including particle deposition phase change wettability alterations and others in both micro and nanochannels 11 5 practical questions in underground flow processes such as reservoir recovery processes conventional laboratory studies have included core flood and physical model experiments that are expensive and require substantial amounts of time for preparation execution and analysis although core flood experiments yield useful information for testing the feasibility of a process they are not useful for determining the physics at the pore scale visual models are powerful tools for i understanding the physics of fluids at pore scales and ii rapid screening of various flow systems related to underground flow processes such as enhanced oil production groundwater remediation and waste deposition to name a few data obtained from the visual experiments can guide the lengthy and expensive core flood experiments however it is necessary to be aware of the limitations in the direct upscaling of microscale visual experiments to the reservoir scale applications this leaves

contain hydrocarbons groundwater and gases are topics of interest in many scientific and engineering fields examples include the exploitation of fossil fuels and geothermal resources glassley 2014 gunda et al 2011 morin et al 2016 geological storage of carbon dioxide co2 bourg et al 2015 zuo et al 2013 disposal of hazardous materials oh et al 2017 groundwater hydrology bedient et al 1994 and soil science ciceri and allanore 2015 stanley et al 2016 to accurately model geological processes on large scales an understanding of the fluid flows species transport and chemical reactions occurring at the nano and micro scale rock soil geometries is required culligan et al 2006 the deeply buried and opaque nature of geological formations precludes the direct visualization of these processes therefore visual models that simulate the pore geometries of rocks have been employed to simulate the microscale events recent advances in microfabrication material synthesis and visualization have boosted the development of various microscale visual models with distinct properties anbari et al 2018 karadimitriou and hassanizadeh 2012 lifton 2016 sinton 2014 we have reviewed the available models

porous media when particles of glass beads or minerals are filled and packed in structured spaces e g circular cubic and hele shaw geometries to form additional fluid flow complexities packed beds with microscale porous structures are formed these methods have been extensively employed in the studies of pore scale physics and chemistries in porous media chuoke et al 1959 hwang et al 2006 microfluidic and nanofluidic technologies to simulate flow in a porous rock are currently the center of attention anbari et al 2018 bao et al 2017 fredriksen et al 2017 gunda et al 2011 hasham et al

concentrated on designing mimetic structures of the pore networks anbari et al 2018 generating reflective inner surface properties porter et al 2015 song and kovscek 2015 zhang et al 2018 zhao et al 2016 wang et al 2017b and extending the applications for screening enhanced oil recovery processes lifton 2016 sinton 2014 the pore networks in microchips are often designed based on regular arrays of varying geometries chatzis et al 1983 sayegh and fisher 2008 and microscopic images of the rocks keller et al 1997 kelly et al 2016 zuo et al 2013 furthermore microchips can be made from a variety of

coupling rock mineralogy in the fabrication of microchips and fabricating 3d and nanofluidic devices have generated enormous developments porter et al 2015 song and kovscek 2015 zhang et al 2018 wang et al 2017b the primary goal of this review is to aid researchers in geological formation research at different levels to be the person who has the answers before resolving questions when it comes to flow visualization in porous media this work for the first time reviews various types of visual models for studying subsurface science where the geological research background is specially integrated for each method the technical points practical applications and the advantages and disadvantages are examined in particular additional focus is placed on the technological advances in imitating the pore wall surfaces of porous geological media within the visual models this paper is organized as follows the roles and significance of the rock and soil pore wall surfaces in geological processes are briefly overviewed in section 2 sections 3 and 4 summarize the packed beds and hele shaw cells respectively in section 5 we review the use of microfluidics to study flow in porous media and introduce micromodels fabricated with synthesized materials and current strategies of modifying the surfaces of micromodels are discussed in section 6 the novel coupling of actual rock surface chemistries in geomaterial dominated microchips either by coating the inner walls of the microchannels with the geomaterials or directly employing the geomaterial as a fabrication material is addressed in section 7 the 3d micromodels and nanofluidic models are briefly discussed in sections 8 and 9 respectively the discussion ends with selection guidelines summarizing the features of the six categories of visual models and the outlooks highlighting the challenges and opportunities in using the visual models for research on transport in porous media 2 pore wall surface and geometric features in rocks and soils in geological formations pore wall surfaces and their impacts are extraordinarily prevalent due to the large specific surface areas prakash 2014 e g the specific area of sandstone can be approximately 1 500 cm2 cm3 bear 1988 wettability and mineralogy are two dominant properties for solids regulating fluid flow and migration anderson 1987 dullien 1991 iglauer 2017 maitland 2000 the importance of wettability in fluid dynamics in porous media is well documented in the literature e g affecting the capillary forces and relative permeability curves the minerals in rocks and soil can interact with the surrounding fluids through chemical reactions swelling deformation or dissolution changing the pore morphology porosity and permeability and subsequently affecting geofluid activity anderson et al 2010 lee et al 2016 mitchell 1976 peng et al 2016 xu et al 2017 furthermore there is a variety of minerals with random distributions present in rocks singh et al 2017 zhang et al 2018 other examples of pore wall surfaces affecting fluid transport include the adsorption of oil components on clay minerals boggs 2011 hu et al 2014 physicochemical reactions between injected co2 and the rocks wang et al 2013 adsorption and retardation of repository released radionuclides in the rocks oh et al 2017 and the storage and release of methane in the coalbeds and shale strata charoensuppanimit et al 2016 xiong et al 2016 the complex interfacial interactions exacerbate the characterization of subsurface fluid flows and transport processes therefore the construction of realistic rock wettability and mineralogy in the visual models remains a significant challenge the geometric features of porous media include pore size distributions coordination numbers and tortuosity in the numerical modeling of porous media predefined geometric parameters such as minkowski functionals e g volume surface curvature and connectivity are used to generate artificial pore networks lehmann et al 2008 similar to designing the flow paths in visual models rock based network designs as well as specially designed pore geometries are coupled into fabrications of the visual models micro and nanomodels bartels et al 2017 park et al 2015 due to the limitations in optical visualization and fabrication techniques the geometric parameters are usually modified before reprinted in the models for example porosities are typically increased when designing a rock based network in micromodels due to the reduced connectivity in 2d in recent years depth variation or 2 5d 3d micromodels have been developed to better represent the 3d geometrical features in porous media park et al 2015 xu et al 2017a yun et al 2017 moreover a mass of elegant geometrical designs for fluid flow and transport and static tests have been incorporated into the visual models as can be seen from the literature anbari et al 2018 bartels et al 2017 yun et al 2017 3 packed beds packed beds can reflect both the 3d geometry and the rock s pore wall surface features in this method solid particles with varied geometries and materials are subtly packed into the visual channels in comparison with the conventional reservoir core experiments microscale packed beds enable the real time visualization of two phase flow behaviors in a few pores from the channel walls with the aid of advanced visualization tools such as confocal microscopy krummel et al 2013 in both the core and micro packed experiments one can use magnetic resonance imaging mri sankey et al 2009 and x ray microcomputer tomography x ray μct kumar and fogden 2009 porter et al 2010 to construct the images of the flow process indirectly in this section models with glass beads and geomaterial grains as the packing materials are discussed 3 1 glass bead packed beds glass packings have been widely used for simulating subsurface fluid flows and transport processes due to the chemical similarities between glass and silicate minerals additionally glass beads can be produced with uniform sizes and controlled geometries enabling consistent and reproducible flow patterns capillaries krummel et al 2013 schluter et al 2016 single channels with connected filters bowden et al 2010 hele shaw cells trojer et al 2015 and cylinders holding semipermeable membranes murison et al 2014 are the commonly used containers for packing glass beads fig 1 sometimes the glass beads are sintered after packing to achieve denser frameworks krummel et al 2013 schluter et al 2016 wildenschild et al 2011 krummel et al 2013 employed a dense glass bead packing in a rectangular quartz capillary to study immiscible fluid displacement fig 1a with the aid of confocal microscopy they directly recorded the 3d structures of the trapped ganglia and the effects of capillary numbers on the residual fluid distribution krummel et al 2013 several other studies have also used similar packed beds to investigate the multiphase flows of subsurface fluids bowden et al 2010 hatiboglu and babadagli 2010 schluter et al 2016 glass beads can be functionalized to yield various wetting conditions in the packed beds and simulate the conditions in the groundwater oil reservoirs and soils this method of utilizing glass beads to yield various wetting conditions enables well defined mixed wettability in multi phase flow experiments trojer et al 2015 used a radial hele shaw cell packed with glass beads to visualize the displacement of water glycerol mixtures with air fig 1b chemical vapor deposition cvd with silane based materials was used to treat the surfaces of both the cell and the beads made of soda lime glass to study the effects of wettability on the displacement process both hydrophilic and hydrophobic wetting states have been achieved with water glycerol mixture air solid contact angles of 5 20 60 90 and 120 geistlinger and ataei dadavi 2015 generated glass bead monolayers with either heterogeneous or homogeneous wettability in hele shaw cells to investigate the capillary trapping phenomena fig 1c with this method untreated glass beads had displayed heterogeneous wetting states with both hydrophobic and hydrophilic surfaces and were used to form heterogeneous monolayers three homogenization methods were used to treat the glass beads to render homogeneous hydrophilic monolayers isopropanol flushing and oven drying interval oven drying and initial oven drying with nitrogen flushing in another study murison et al 2014 used a dense packing of functionalized glass beads to study the effects of spatial wettability on the displacement of an oil water interface fig 1d heterogeneous wettability features i e different spatial extensions were created using both untreated glass beads hydrophilic and gold or chlorotrimethoxysilane coated glass beads hydrophobic for the packing furthermore the protocols of functionalizing glass beads and generating the packs were varied to create four types of heterogeneous wettability in the models patchy janus mixed and cluster patterns the wettability of each sample was characterized using capillary pressure saturation cps experiments and x ray tomography of the dry samples although this approach has achieved spatial variations in wettability it is a time consuming process requiring more than 18 h for the coating steps 3 2 rock particle packed beds packing crushed rock or rock forming mineral particles has been used to integrate more realistic surface mineralogy for rocks and soils in the packed beds which has enabled investigations of solid fluid interactions occurring in the rocks and soils packed beds of water wet cryolite grains with a random and transparent packing structure were constructed inside cylindrical glass microchannels 100 μm in diameter to represent heterogeneous soil textures in primary drainage experiments fig 2 a zhu and papadopoulos 2012 lv et al 2017 used stratified packs of glass beads dolomite and quartz to examine the effects of heterogeneity in pore size and wettability for pore scale fluid flows fig 2b singh and mohanty 2017 packed two sizes of silica particles into two layers respectively to create a vertical heterogeneity in sand packs furthermore planar slabs of mica quartz and oxidized silicon wafers were added to the glass bead packs to model sandstone with mineralogical heterogeneity kumar et al 2012 similarly to provide functional analogs of siltstone and carbonate rocks crushed mineral grains and glass beads were packed into microchannels fig 2c bowden et al 2016 tanino et al 2018 packed beds with complex grains have been advantageous in presenting realistic pore wall surface chemistries of the rocks including complex mineralogy heterogeneous permeability and wettability and strong capillary continuity overall many packed bed systems have been developed to interpret flow mechanisms in subsurface porous media specifically packed beds involving grains of rocks incorporate the effects of mineralogy on the fluid solid interactions and characterizations of fluid dynamics although advanced visualization techniques such as mri and confocal microscopy can help the characterization of 3d fluid dynamics the use of rock grains or glass beads restricts the in depth visualization 4 hele shaw cells hele shaw cells named after henry selby hele shaw hele shaw 1898 are devices composed of two narrowly separated parallel plates with fluids transporting through the confined spaces the hele shaw geometry represents a quasi 2d geometry of which one dimension is much smaller than the other two for example a radial hele shaw cell with a diameter of 28 cm and a typical gap spacing of 254 μm has been employed to study the viscosity driven flow instability bischofberger et al 2014 the hele shaw cell is a powerful visual tool to study multiphase fluid dynamics in porous media due to the analogy between fluid transport through narrow gaps and in porous media saffman and taylor 1958 as well as the ease at which the interfaces of fluids can be directly visualized interfacial instabilities driven by the viscosity and density mismatch between the displacing and the displaced fluids bischofberger et al 2014 enjamoori et al 2011 hill 1952 homsy 1987 saffman and taylor 1958 sahimi 2011 truzzolillo and cipelletti 2017 white and ward 2014 or driven by chemical reactions de wit 2016 hejazi et al 2010 nagatsu et al 2014 related to various geological processes including enhanced oil production hornof and baig 1995 osei bonsu et al 2016 and co2 sequestration thomas et al 2016 white and ward 2012 have been examined using the hele shaw cell analogy many variations of hele shaw cells with specially designed compositional plates of different shapes sizes and materials have been proposed three common flow patterns in hele shaw cell setups are rectilinear flow radial source flow and five spot pattern homsy 1987 examples of hele shaw cells with rectilinear and radial source flows are presented in fig 3 a thomas et al 2016 and fig 3b song et al 2020 respectively besides rotating hele shaw cells and lifting hele shaw cells which are featured with the cell rotating about an axis perpendicular to the plates and the time dependent gap width respectively are used for specific situations in rotating hele shaw cells flows are driven by both viscosity contract and density difference between the fluids jiao and maxworthy 2008 lifting hele shaw cells have been primarily applied to study adhesion and radial viscous fingering with separated plates with either constant force or constant velocity sinha et al 2008 additionally djabbarov et al 2016 constructed square pvc cling films of different thicknesses in the cell to induce heterogeneous permeability in the hele shaw cells to examine the effects of surface roughness on the flow regimes in rough walled fractures rough walled hele shaw cells have been developed using surface patterned plates chen and horne 2006 other than the hele shaw cells mentioned above filling the cells with particles and forming packed beds within the typical hele shaw geometry trojer et al 2015 as illustrated in section 3 is noteworthy furthermore the hele shaw geometry is often observed in micro and nanofluidic models because the channel length and width are generally much larger than the channel depth examples of the hele shaw geometry are presented in section 5 in summary hele shaw cells have been widely used to investigate the 2d or quasi 2d dynamics of interfacial instability however the incomplete geometrical analogy between a porous medium and a hele shaw cell is well documented in the literature homsy 1987 when characterizing more complex flow diversions specially designed pore networks should be employed such as packed beds and microfluidic devices 5 synthesized micromodels with functionalized surfaces complex physical topologies and surface chemistries as well as dynamic parameters have been considered in the fabrication and operation of microfluidic devices to yield natural mimetic porous microenvironments commonly used materials in fabricating microchips include glass silicon and polymers such as pdms pmma and norland optical adhesive noa anbari et al 2018 ren et al 2013 the details of the micromodel material properties can be found in the work of anbari et al 2018 to rebuild the surface wettability in synthesized microchips many surface modification methods have been adopted and modified 5 1 polydimethylsiloxane pdms micromodels polydimethylsiloxane pdms is by far the most popular material to fabricate microfluidic chips some of the favorable chemical and physical properties of pdms have been summarized in the work of mcdonald and whitesides 2002 specifically pdms is a flexible elastomeric material that is suitable for fabricating complex geometries with tiny features however pdms shows hydrophobic surface characteristics in its unaltered form the surfaces generally need to be treated irreversibly or temporarily so that they possess specified wetting properties e g multiscale hydrophilic and patterned wetting properties to meet the requirements of different tasks furthermore the pdms material has poor compatibility with non polar organics many surface modification methods such as plasma treatment ultraviolet uv or uv ozone uvo treatment layer by layer lbl assembly and combinations of the different methods have been employed to produce the desired wetting states and improve the chemical resistance of pdms microchips 5 1 1 uniform hydrophilic wettability the formation of hydrophilic characteristics is the primary modification of the pdms micromodel surfaces through conventional surface treatment approaches plasma treatment is the most commonly used method to treat pdms surfaces for bonding and functionalizing chen and wharton 2017 kim et al 2019 meszaros et al 2018 tan et al 2010 by exposing pdms surfaces to air oxygen or other gases plasma the unit of o si ch 3 2 on the pdms surface is oxidized and the methyl groups ch 3 are transformed into a hydroxyl group oh to form a silanol group sioh rendering the surface hydrophilic hollahan and carlson 1970 furthermore the nano structuring of pdms during plasma treatment plays an essential role in hydrophilization bodas and khan malek 2007 unfortunately the effects of plasma treatment lack long term stability the hydrophobicity of the material could recover aggressively due to the movement of the untreated low molecular weight polymer chains to the surface fritz and owen 1995 and the elastomeric properties of pdms bodas and khan malek 2007 therefore the immediate use of the pdms micromodels after being treated by plasma for bonding is necessary and cannot be prolonged if the plasma induced hydrophilicity is employed an example is in the work of wu et al 2012 where the pdms glass microchips bonded by oxygen plasma treatment 30 w 30 s have been shown to be water wet within 1 h of bonding and oil wet after 24 h in single and two phase flow experiments another example is the work of berejnov et al 2008 where various wetting conditions had been created by exposing pdms to air at room temperature for various periods the distinctly functionalized pdms micromodels e g initial hydrophilic θ 20 and hydrophobic after 2 000 min θ 80 have been used to detect the role of wettability in multiphase flows in porous media many studies have explored the enhancement of plasma treatment to achieve stable and long lasting hydrophilicity the stability analysis of the plasma treated pdms surface has shown that changing the exposure environment to a high dielectric constant environment for example from air to water can slow down the wettability recovery rate chen and lindner 2007 therefore the way to store freshly treated pdms surfaces in the proper environment can be used in extending the formed hydrophilicity for several weeks chen and lindner 2007 more frequently plasma treatment had been used as a pretreatment process coupled with other surface modification methods to functionalize surfaces e g coupling plasma surface activation with subsequent physisorption of other chemicals to create long term pdms surface properties and to employ the lbl assembly after the plasma surface oxidization hemmila et al 2012 zhang et al 2018 the uv treatment technique is another significant method to tailor the surface wettability of pdms micromodels ma et al 2011 schneider and tabeling 2011 schneider et al 2010 this method is not as practical as the plasma treatment in practice e g prolonged treatment time is needed but it can provide a more in depth treatment coating the inner channel walls is another means to alter the wettability states in pdms microchips in this method mono or multiple layers of favorable molecules are attached to the activated pdms surfaces with plasma treatment by physisorption or polymerization e g grafting on and grafting from morin et al 2016 adopted the method reported by hemmila et al 2012 to coat the channel network with polyethylene glycol peg 200 hence the pdms microchannel had become water wet bauer et al 2010 produced long term e g months stable hydrophilic coatings in pdms microchannels by using an lbl assembly to yield poly allylamine hydrochloride pah and poly sodium 4 styrenesulfonate pss multilayers fig 4 a kim et al 2009 coated the microfluidic channels with a hybrid inorganic organic polymer hr4 to fabricate solvent resistant pdms microfluidic devices fig 4b this modification significantly increased the resistance of the pdms microfluidic channels to various solvents the hr4 modified pdms microfluidic device could be applied in the formation of water in oil w o and oil in water o w emulsions 5 1 2 patterned wettability due to the inherent complexity of rock and soil surface chemistry and their spatial and temporal heterogeneity new technologies are required to create wettability patterns and states in microchips uv treatments have the advantage of creating spatially patterned surface properties because the polymerization occurs only in the uv exposed areas schneider et al 2010 reported a uv initiated wettability patterning method in pdms microchips fig 5 the micromodel was first treated with the photoinitiator benzophenone bp and subsequently filled with an acrylic acid aa solution then the sealed micromodel was partially exposed to the uv light for several minutes using an appropriate mask the uv induced graft polymerization of poly acrylic acid paa on the pdms surfaces displayed long term e g six months or longer hydrophilicity this method improved both the wettability contrast and spatial resolution of the patterned structures in comparison with previous techniques the patterning method is particularly applicable to produce sophisticated microfluidic devices for studying parallel flow stabilization synthesize double emulsions and fabricate network microchips with patterned wettability schneider and tabeling 2011 produced microchips with heterogeneous pore scale wettability using the uv treatment method to study the impact of wettability patterning on mechanisms of oil water flows in the oil recovery processes the designed network was modified to simulate the wetting conditions of many oil reservoirs by altering the small pores 50 μm to be hydrophilic hexadecane water contact angle 30 while leaving the large channels 100 μm hydrophobic hexadecane water contact angle 180 similarly ma et al 2011 used the uvo treatment and a photomask to hydrophilize the pdms surfaces and pattern wettability in pdms microchips the oxidized surfaces were immersed in water until used in the multiphase flow experiments for mimetic heterogeneous oil reservoirs ma et al 2011 the top and bottom inner surfaces of the flow spaces should display consistent wettability when studying fluid flows and transport behaviors surface modification of materials is an ever developing research area many strategies to modify pdms microchips are being established but have yet to be applied to subsurface research further information on these strategies can be found in recent review articles hetemi and pinson 2017 wong and ho 2009 zhou et al 2012 5 2 glass micromodels glass is one of the first materials to be used for fabricating microfluidic devices mckellar and wardlaw 1982 glass is hard and inert to chemicals and solvents making the fabricated devices more compatible for experiments under reservoir conditions therefore even though etching glass and silicon is expensive and time consuming glass based devices are essential in the technology of micromodels furthermore glass slides are widely used as a cover to seal the channels in polymer and silicon substrates making the surface modification of glass surfaces especially important the use of glass micromodels for recording the events in subsurface processes is diverse including the visualization of microorganism transport in soil wan et al 1994 and the detection of fundamental transport phenomena e g fluid velocity the brownian motion of colloids and tracer diffusion from fractures in the matrix in matrix fracture micromodels wan et al 1996 recently many glass micromodels have been treated for the desired wetting states e g from the water wet state to the oil wet or mixed wetting states grate et al 2013 analyzed various pretreatment methods before silanizing the surfaces with hexamethyldisilazane hmds to yield a uniform oil wet state in silicon glass micromodels cleaning the glass surface with boiling concentrated nitric acid has been demonstrated to be an effective way of restoring the glass state to which it can be silanized to a similar oil wetness as silica the air water and oil water contact angles on silica were 95 and 140 respectively the pretreatment procedure has been determined to be useful for the modification of anodically bonded silicon glass micromodels where an elevated temperature 400 c is required to attain silanization the developed uniform wettability micromodels are especially useful for studying fluid dynamics as the wettability influences flow processes several methods have been developed to generate heterogeneous or patterned wettability in glass based micromodels zhang et al 2016 and meng et al 2016 created a heterogeneous surface wettability in a glass or quartz micro capillary by combining tailored photolithography with self assembled monolayer chemistry the surface modified microcapillaries were used to study the effects of heterogeneous surface wettability on emulsion stability fig 6 a a hydrophobic section was created in the capillary by coating a monolayer of octyltriethoxysilane otes the surface modified capillary displayed alternating hydrophilic water air contact angle of 27 3 measured on a flat surface and hydrophobic water air contact angle of 97 5 regions without changing the hydraulic diameter instead of tuning the wettability on the glass or quartz surface another study employed a novel method of simultaneously creating and tailoring the wettability of polymeric microstructures in glass micromodels fig 6b lee et al 2015 in this method polymeric microstructures were generated in the glass microchannels by photolithography followed by a uv polymerization reaction by changing the ratio of the hydrophilic and oleophilic crosslinking agents in the precursor solution and increasing the effects by copolymerization with the hydrophilic and oleophilic additives both heterogeneous and continuously changing wettability states e g water decane contact angle from 60 to 144 were achieved 5 3 silicon micromodels compared with glass etching in silicon is valuable for achieving high precision buchgraber et al 2012 silicon substrates with structural features were anodically bonded with glass slides to seal the channels forming silicon glass micromodels therefore the surface modification of these models involved both materials silicon based micromodels have initially shown excellent water wet features with the oxidization induced silica surface silanization is the primary approach to alter the wetting states in silicon based micromodels grate et al 2012 used different silanes to modify the wettability of silica surfaces and demonstrated a full range of wettability including the intermediate wetting state in a later study grate et al 2013 investigated the pretreatment methods before silanization with hmds on both glass and silica surfaces sandengen et al 2016 employed the same protocol of using pre treatment and hmds to render silicon and glass micromodels and oil wet sandstone plugs 5 4 optical adhesive micromodels optical adhesives such as noa are emerging fabricating materials for microfluidic devices these compounds are thiol ene cross linked photocurable polymers which display outstanding advantages in their application i the procedure of fabricating optical adhesive based devices is simple and inexpensive ii the devices formed show fair transparency under a microscope and are chemically resistant including aliphatic and aromatic compounds because of the existence of thiol ene and iii the devices are not permeable to air and water vapor therefore multiphase flows involving gases can be studied using noa based microfluidic devices the noa surface is hydrophilic e g the water contact angle is around 50 70 for noa81 many treatments such as oxygen plasma and uv treatment have been used to change the noa to be either hydrophilic or hydrophobic with relatively longer lasting stability than pdms wagli et al 2011 as a representative study zhao et al 2016 systematically altered the wettability of noa based visual cells with the contact angles ranging from 7 to 150 to study the effect of wettability on viscously unfavorable fluid fluid displacement the core of the hele shaw cell in their experiment was a patterned porous structure fabricated by soft imprint lithography with vertical posts noa81 used an extended uv radiation exposure time to increase the hydrophilicity levache et al 2012 levache and bartolo 2014 additionally trojer et al 2015 proposed the cvd of trimethoxysilane to alter the noa81 wetting state to hydrophobicity 6 microchip surface modification strategies microfluidic platforms have evolved into a mature technology this is due to the advancement of multiple microfabrication technologies such as hot embossing heckele et al 2006 injection molding becker and gartner 2008 laser ablation of polymers khan malek 2006 kinahan et al 2016 suriano et al 2011 glass channel fabrication mohammadi et al 2015a oosterbroek et al 2005 pan et al 2017 micromachining hsieh et al 2017 sugioka et al 2014 photolithography and soft lithography madadi et al 2013 mohammadi et al 2015b qin et al 2010 sollier et al 2011 however the fabricated microchips may not be ready for direct use because the desired microenvironments have not been obtained or more specifically the surfaces do not aid in the physicochemical reactions the most eminent applications of surface treatments have focused on biomolecule separation comprising rna reinholt et al 2014 dna kinahan et al 2016 amino acids lin et al 2016 proteins holczer and furjes 2017 roy et al 2013 and blood plasma madadi et al 2015 mohammadi et al 2015a as well as oil and gas applications lifton 2016 zhang et al 2018 in this section conventional techniques used to modify the surfaces of microfluidic channels are briefly evaluated fig 7 for details readers are referred to several critical reviews kitsara and ducree 2013 kumlangdudsana et al 2017 makamba et al 2003 wong and ho 2009 zhou et al 2010 2012 furthermore a crude oil aging method is discussed as a specific surface modification approach for subsurface oil and gas applications 6 1 conventional surface modification methods 6 1 1 plasma treatment the plasma activation process allows the transformation of a polymer surface to generate a transient hydrophilic surface with a few molecular layers due to crosslinking degradation and oxidation several parameters e g exposure time power and pressure in the plasma chamber type of substrate material and gas es present play vital roles in the plasma modification efficiency moon and vaziri 2009 pietro favia 1998 tsougeni et al 2009 presented a stable surface modification on pmma and polyether ether ketone peek the results demonstrated that the surface roughness retards aging considerably lin et al 2016 improved the hydrophilicity of pdms microfluidic devices by grafting dendrimers with oxygen plasma activation and the silane treatment to reduce the contact angle from 108 to 31 8 roy and yue roy and yue 2011 compared nitrogen oxygen and argon plasma treatments for cyclic olefin copolymer coc substrates the efficiency of the n2 plasma treatment was shown to be much higher than o2 and ar however the o2 plasma presented a greater thermal bond strength higher roughness hydrophilicity and enhanced hemocompatibility maheshwari et al 2010 completed a long term hydrophilic modification study on pdms using the o2 plasma modification and branched polyethylenimine b pei and recorded a reduction in the contact angle to 40 while the effects remained stable for over 240 h 6 1 2 ultraviolet uv treatment the uv treatment method can facilitate surface modification after the fabrication of microfluidic channels chang et al 2010 this technique notably minimized the analyte adsorption and enhanced the electroosmotic flow eof stability in the pdms microchannels furthermore compared with plasma treatment methods this technique presented a deeper surface treatment in the pdms substrate without cracking berdichevsky et al 2004 additionally uv light with a short wavelength of less than 200 nm is suggested for surface modification cefalas et al 2012 lippert 2005 and has been employed to activate the polymer through breaking surface bonds inside the microfluidic channel the water contact angle for example varied from 12 to 72 based on the uv power and processing time chang et al 2010 lin et al 2017 recently employed a new approach to enhance the stability of the uv ozone uvo treatment method for up to 16 weeks additionally the impact of air dehumidified and vacuum storage conditions have been studied for uvo treated polycarbonate pc coc and pmma the vacuum and dehumidified storage conditions were verified to inhibit the hydrophobic recovery of coc and pc whereas the storage conditions did not affect the pmma stability 6 1 3 chemical vapor deposition cvd treatment the cvd technique forms a thin film on the surfaces makamba et al 2003 cvd is used for surface modifications and thin film coatings in a variety of applications including microfluidics composites sensing optoelectronics photonics and nanobiotechnology gleason 2015 chen et al chen et al 2008 reported the first cvd method for surface treatments and bonding improvements with two complementary polymers poly 4 aminomethyl p xylylene co p xylylene and poly 4 formyl p xylylene co p xylylene bowman et al 2015 presented a new apparatus utilizing a combination of plasma activation and physical cvd to improve the surface modification of the pdms substrate ortiz et al 2017 modified a pmma droplet microfluidic device coating it with a silica nanoparticle sinp layer that produces super hydrophilic properties due to the generated nano roughness and subsequently utilizing dodecyltrichlorosilane dts to create a super hydrophobic surface allowing repeatable droplet generation for real time toxicity assays in another study prefabricated pdms microchannels were modified with a thin coat of fluoropolymer utilizing initiated cvd icvd riche et al 2011 the fluorinated coating comprised a cross link of 1h 1h 2h 2h perfluorodecyl acrylate pfda with ethylene glycol diacrylate egda generating a poly pfda co egda coating to provide low surface energy the fluoropolymer coating allowed the pdms microfluidic devices to resist swelling and absorption in the reaction synthesis dudek et al 2009 presented a range of surface treatments on the cyclic polyolefin based microfluidic substrates to generate a uniform and stable hydrophilic surface various techniques e g oxygen plasma activation alone or coupled with cvd dextran and silicon dioxide pe modifications have been utilized for wettability modifications the results demonstrated that pe and dioxide modifications yielded the most hydrophilic surfaces a summary of the cvd based surface modification techniques is provided by yoshida et al 2006 6 1 4 surfactant treatment treatments have been utilized by adding surfactants to the running buffer to modify the surface of a microchip several surfactant based modification studies have been summarized elsewhere zhou et al 2010 2012 surfactants have been used to modify microchip surface properties for instance to change the direction of electroosmotic flow eof liu et al 2005 holczer and fürjes holczer and furjes 2017 modified the hydrophilicity of the pdms surface using surfactants tx 100 and pdms b peo li et al 2017b utilized synthesized pluronic f127 as a surfactant for surface modifications in droplet based microfluidic devices madadi and casals terré madadi and casals terré 2012 used three surfactants tween 20 triton x 100 and brij 35 for the short and long term surface modifications of the pdms channels the results demonstrated that triton x 100 is more effective than brij 35 and tween 20 where the hydrophobic recovery was insignificant after two months 6 1 5 wet chemical method sol gel surface modifications and lbl deposition are the two leading wet chemical surface modification strategies for synthesized microchips the sol gel process has been widely utilized to generate a thin layer of an inorganic colloidal suspension or inorganic structures e g powder fiber and monoliths on a substrate some intrinsic characteristics such as low reaction temperatures cost effectiveness the ability to form precise structures and layers easily at the molecular level and nanoscale porosity make it a popular technique for thin layer formation park et al 2016 presented a sol gel surface modification process using a silica coating to enhance the hydrophilic properties of pdms microfluidic channels and increase the eof mobility by almost one order of magnitude moreover ma and zhang 2014 synthesized a 10 nm tio2 film on the microchannels to generate a super hydrophilic surface in silicon micromodels the ultra thin tio2 coated film created no negative impact on the channel morphology while the water flow velocity was four times higher than it had been additionally yang et al 2009 utilized the sol gel method with a tetraethoxysilane teos coating for pdms microchannels in a free flow isoelectric focusing system where the teos coating improved the bonding strength and chemical resistance lbl deposition is a pervasive surface modification technique that allows the formation of a thin film through sequentially adsorbing oppositely charged materials onto virtually any substrate makamba et al 2005 richardson et al 2015 2016 a wide variety of assembly techniques e g immersion spin and fluidics assembly materials e g organic and inorganic materials and substrates have been employed for coating microfluidic devices with complex geometries richardson et al 2015 to create polyelectrolyte clay protein layer films in a bioreactor mehta et al 2007 attached primary bone marrow cells on pdms surfaces by using the lbl assembly method more recently choi et al 2018 spatially patterned the surface wetting properties in pdms microchips by the lbl deposition of poly allylamine hydrochloride pah for the polycation and poly acrylic acid paa for the polyanion these patterned microchips were applied to produce multiple emulsion drops successfully the proposed on chip lbl modification is a rapid and straightforward process that requires a syringe vacuum induced segmented flow where many different patterns of wetting features could be created furthermore the lbl assembly technology has been employed to incorporate geomaterials onto microchip channel walls zhang et al 2018 nano or micro scale mineral particles with inherent charged properties in aqueous conditions have been utilized in the lbl assembly process more examples of using lbl deposition to modify the surfaces of microfluidic devices are presented in the literature minnikanti et al 2014 6 2 crude oil aging treatment in micromodels the deposition of oil components on rock minerals contributes to variable wettability states fogden 2010 jackson et al 2016 kumar and fogden 2009 lebedeva and fogden 2011 mahani et al 2015 2017 marathe et al 2012 kumar et al 2012 therefore a frequently used and straightforward aging method to provide micromodel wettability for subsurface applications is required to restore the original states of porous media to the underground conditions the adoption of standard aging methods for micromodels is required reservoir rocks have been saturated with geofluids throughout geological history and the wetting state of the crude oil brine rock system is the result of complex fluids solid interactions aging treatments aim to reconstruct realistic wetting states by allowing adequate crude oil brine mineral interactions in standard aging methods the micromodel is saturated with a specific crude oil or oil components and sealed for an adequate period after prolonged direct contact the polar components of the oil are prone to be adsorbed onto the solid surface causing the oil to be the wetting phase buchgraber et al 2012 noticed that the wettability of silicon glass micromodels had changed after flooding with crude oil with no initial water distribution in the micromodel this manner of wettability alteration is stable provided the micromodels are not cleaned with toluene or other strong solvents conn et al 2014 aged pdms microchips with dyed paraffin oil for over 24 h to recover a hydrophobic state the aged micromodels were experimentally used for the visualization of oil displacement by water air and foam various surface modification strategies have helped reconstruct the wetting state in microfluidic studies however the buildup of simplified wetting is not sufficient and the study of subsurface porous systems require more mimetic surface properties to be considered rock and soil are composed of minerals in which the grain surfaces of different compositions are spatially distributed furthermore long term geofluids solid interactions have significantly influenced rock and soil surface chemistries in the following section we provide a review of the techniques that incorporate geomaterials into microfluidic devices 7 geomaterial dominated micromodels in the context of the subsurface operations micromodels that contain geomaterials are significant and have attained popularity due to the involved mimetic surface chemistries these models provide the opportunity to study the fluid rock physicochemical interactions that are often absent in conventional micromodel studies synthesized micromodels including the simple planar surfaces can be improved by adding minerals or crushed rocks in the fabrication process in this section several techniques developed for introducing geomaterials in pore level studies are categorized and their performances are evaluated 7 1 planar solid surfaces the first category of geomaterial coated micromodels contains open planar surfaces of synthesized materials or natural rocks synthesized materials e g glass or quartz can be used because they have similar chemical compositions as natural rock forming minerals employing these planar surfaces for the static or dynamic simulations of geological phenomena is a straightforward and efficient process especially for studying fluid solid interactions in some studies slabs of synthesized materials or rocks are directly used as the solid surfaces where their interactions with the exposed fluids are documented lebedeva and fogden 2011b marathe et al 2012 rezaei gomari and joseph 2017 xie et al 2019 depositing the geomaterials on planar glass or quartz slides and the subsequent characterizations of the coated surfaces is another approach to probe the solid fluid interactions clays and other minerals e g carbonates have been widely used as materials deposited on the model surfaces berg et al 2010 cense et al 2011 fogden 2012 fogden and lebedeva 2012 lebedeva and fogden 2010 2011c mahani et al 2015a 2015c various types of planar surfaces have been developed by depositing kaolinite on a glass substrate through dripping clay suspensions on pre cleaned microscope slides followed by administering a heat treatment to immobilize the particles on the surface fogden 2012 fogden and lebedeva 2012 lebedeva and fogden 2010 2011c a field emission scanning electron microscopy fesem image of a formed kaolinite coating is shown in fig 8 a lebedeva and fogden 2011c the manufactured models are used to simulate the interactions between clay minerals and crude oil brines in particular the adsorption and deposition of polar components of crude oils on kaolinite under different brine conditions have been studied lebedeva and fogden 2010 researchers further conducted a series of experiments with the aid of such geomaterial coated surfaces berg et al 2010 cense et al 2011 mahani et al 2015 mahani et al 2015c mahani et al 2015a prepared a model of a sandstone system consisting of clay minerals na montmorillonite which deposited on a glass substrate to study the kinetics of oil detachment during low salinity waterflooding processes in sandstone this methodology deposited mineral suspensions on clean base substrates where the clay patches were dried in a desiccator to immobilize the deposited particles the model has been used to study the dependency of the oil water contact angle on the water salinity mahani et al 2015a in a similar study crushed carbonate grains limestone and dolomite were deposited on glass slides to fabricate carbonate surfaces mahani et al 2015c the slides were dried in a desiccator after the deposition to maintain the carbonate patches immobility during the experiments the formed mineral coating was thin 1 10 μm thick carbonate particle sizes ranging between 1 and 20 μm rough and circular fig 8b mahani et al 2015c the modeled carbonate surfaces had been used to study the wettability alteration during low salinity waterflooding processes in carbonate systems the use of desiccator drying is an improvement over the techniques used in earlier works where the clay particles were glued onto the glass slides berg et al 2010 cense et al 2011 7 2 micromodels coated with geomaterials similar to forming planar geomaterial functionalized substrates rock minerals also have been incorporated into transparent micromodels such micromodels have been used to study the wettability alteration bartels et al 2017 bondino et al 2013 and detachment of fine grains song and kovscek 2015 2016 on the recovery of oil during the waterflooding processes micromodels with a mineral coated pore network have successfully demonstrated the effects of rock fluid interactions during multiphase flow processes additionally mineral grains contribute to the improvement in the hydraulic continuity during a multiphase flow process providing fine paths for the connectivity of a wetting phase in a porous medium the major faults of the developed systems are the detachment of minerals during flooding and reduced visibility of fluids in the presence of solid particles the detachment of the solid particles can be prevented by heat treatment fig 9 a bondino et al 2013 song and kovscek 2015 by resorting to electrostatic forces between the negatively charged fine particles e g kaolinite and montmorillonite and positively charged polydiallyldimethylammonium chloride pdda solution fig 9b zhang et al 2018 or by simply plasma oxidizing the pdms surface alzahid et al 2018 7 3 micromodel coated with grown mineral crystals minerals can also be introduced to the micromodels through crystal growth lee et al 2016 created calcite posts on the polymerized surfaces of two glass plates positioned in parallel to form a channel fig 10a in this work the glass microchannel was firstly cured by photopatterning with uv light acting on a precursor solution containing a crosslinker polyethylene glycol diacrylate a photoinitiator a porogen polyethylene glycol and calcite caco3 nanoparticles lee et al 2016 the posts were subsequently grown in situ via supplying supersaturated solutions rich in ca2 and co3 2 ions lee et al 2016 the fundamental difficulty with the development of such a system is the proper patterning of posts to avoid plugging smaller pores additionally the glass surface between the posts is not crystalized because the calcite crystals form the grains of the micromodel only therefore the crystals do not contribute to the capillary continuity of the porous medium and the wettability of the glass surface may differ from the body of the solid grains similarly sekine et al sekine et al 2011 grew halite crystals inside a microchannel made of pdms by injecting a supersaturated brine solution followed by a cooling step wang et al 2017b developed an effective methodology for the in situ growth of caco3 nanocrystals with a thickness of less than 2 μm in glass microfluidic channels fig 10b in this method the surface of the borosilicate glass was functionalized with a chloroform phase containing silane made from n trimethoxysilylpropyl ethylenediaminetriacetate trisodium salt chloroform water and hydrochloric acid wang et al 2017b the calcite crystals were grown by the consecutive injections of cacl2 and na2co3 solutions wang et al 2017b the rough surface of the microchannels covered by calcite crystals could significantly improve the capillary continuity of a transparent porous medium without the detachment of fine particles the wettability of the porous medium could also be altered from water wet to oil wet by aging the medium with oil 7 4 micromodels fabricated with geomaterial real rock porous media have been used as cores using a core holder device in darcy scale experiments amyx et al 1960 recently geomaterials have been used as the fabrication material for micromodels these were either original rock sections e g sandstone shale coal and granite gerami et al 2017 gerold et al 2018 mahoney et al 2015 oh et al 2017 porter et al 2015 singh et al 2017 or synthesized mineral crystals e g quartz and calcite kelly et al 2016 mohammadi and mahani 2020 song et al 2014 this enabled the direct visualization of fluids flow and transport in realistic rock media a variety of different micromodels have evolved with the inclusion of etched rock sections as the central flowing media rocks are cut into thin sections followed by surface patterning on these thin sections song et al 2014 have pioneered a combination of laser engraving and chemical etching to create a pore network on the surface of a calcite wafer fig 11 a which is then kept against a glass slide to seal the pore network this assembly has been used to study the dissolution rate of calcite with acidic fluids although a transparent carbonate crystal utilized in the fabrication of a micromodel the heterogeneity in the chemistry of the carbonate reservoir rock cannot be representative due to the presence of a single calcite mineral in the porous medium another drawback of the developed micromodel is the difference in the wetting properties between the micromodel and the material used to seal it song et al 2014 in a similar study a quartz substrate was etched with the reactive ion method gorowitz and saia 1984 to create a nano scale pattern formed by a lacey carbon film resembling the pore network of tight shale permeable rocks fig 11b kelly et al 2016 the fabrication technique of micromodels using transparent minerals may have no remarkable advantage over that of glass microfluidic devices however the use of minerals represents a significant step toward the development of geomaterial mimetic microfluidic devices oh et al 2017 bonded a thin rock wafer e g shale and granite to a pdms layer that contained a straight conduit to observe the sorption of heavy metals with the rock minerals using micro x ray fluorescence μ xrf this assembly successfully demonstrated the interaction between the fluids and rock minerals oh et al 2017 in a similar study porter et al 2015 bonded a laser etched shale wafer to a glass slide to study the displacement of oil and brine with supercritical co2 fig 11c the chip was placed inside a pressure vessel equipped with a transparent window that allowed the application of confining pressures and the visualization of multiphase flows under reservoir conditions porter et al 2015 gerami et al 2017 developed a coal on a chip device by bonding an etched wafer of coal to pdms to study the contact angles among the fluids on the rough surface of the laser etched zones fig 11d similarly mahoney et al 2015 reproduced the original cleat of coals using reactive ion etching and uv laser etching methodologies without a remarkable modification of the surface chemistry of the etched zones alhuraishawy et al 2016 2018 placed slabs of sandstone and carbonate rocks between two acrylic plates thus adding transparency to their fluid flow studies such systems have successfully demonstrated the sweep and propagation of fluids on the surface of rock samples with a limited visualization of the microscopic phenomena at fluid interfaces more recently gerold et al 2018 proposed a procedure to integrate thin rock sections sandstone and shale into microchips called flow on rock device ford these devices have been introduced as the bridge between conventional synthetic microchips and core experiments thin sections of rocks have also been directly sealed into micromodels without patterning microchannels or flow networks within the flow spaces were the naturally occurring pores in the rock media in a recent study singh et al 2017 sealed a chip of rock with a cured pdms slab to study multiphase flow processes fig 11e the fluid flow was visualized at the darcy scale when a fluorescein free fluid displaced a fluorescein containing flow singh et al 2017 additionally confocal laser scanning microscopy clsm was used to extract the 2d images at different depths max depth 280 μm to reconstruct a 3d image of the multiphase flow process in which a fluorescein dyed phosphate buffer was displaced with a non dyed buffer singh et al 2017 in summary the use of properly sealed thin rock sections for visual investigations of in situ phenomena in reservoirs has been drawing an increasing amount of attention this approach provides a research methodology that is prone to bridge conventional microfluidic studies with core flooding experiments although these systems are similar to real porous media the poor visibility of the fluids interfaces in the matrices and the uncertainty in the reproduction of flow characteristics remain as the primary limitations additionally glass or polymer substrates used for sealing the etched pattern may demonstrate different wettability characteristics 8 three dimensional 3d micromodels micromodels with varying depths either 2 5d or 3d have been used in research at the pore network scale park et al 2015 xu et al 2017a yun et al 2017 the depth variable micromodels are better representations of the fluid dynamics in porous rocks xu et al 2017a yun et al 2017 packed beds also represent the 3d physical features with limited visualization capability as detailed in section 3 in this section we review the 3d micromodels fabricated using the microfabrication technique park et al 2015 used a depth averaging method to process the 3d digital images of the rock then multi layer lithography of su 8 and electroforming of nickel were used to form the mold followed by replicating the polymer based micromodels yun et al 2017 generated a second macro pore mask from a base mask extracted from sem images of a rock section by removing the micro pore structures with repeated erosion dilation e d processes followed by an optimized sequential etching approach was used to create the dual depth silicon based micromodels fig 12 a both of these approaches can fabricate micromodels with variable depths another approach to generate depth variable micromodels is to couple the standard lithography process with the isotropy of hydrofluoric hf etching to obtain shallower throats in a designed pore network fig 12b xu et al 2017a however only two depths can be induced in this method compared with the two methods detailed above by adjusting the pore design and etching parameters the depth variations of the pore throat are easily controlled in the model other than the traditional microfabrication methods cutting edge technologies such as 3d printing techniques have been applied to produce 3d replicas of subsurface porous media fereshtenejad and song 2016 hasiuk 2018 kong et al 2018 gypsum silica sand and resin are the primary materials used in printing 3d rocks for these models creating a feature size less than 100 μm thick is seemingly complicated while a microfluidic flow channel width of approximately 20 μm has been recently been reached using resin and customized digital light processing and stereolithography dlp sla gong et al 2017 3d printed gypsum rocks have been used for investigating microstructural changes e g micro fractures and micro pores during physical experiments kong et al 2018 elastic properties huang et al 2016 and dynamic crack coalescence jiang et al 2016 the primary limitations for 3d printed models for subsurface applications include the resolution and printing materials kong et al 2018 with advancements in 3d printing such models are expected to play essential roles in the physical modeling of flows in porous media while appreciating the significant accomplishments in fabricating 2 5d or 3d microchips for subsurface applications we should realize that transport phenomena are affected by the discrepancy between the solid surfaces in natural porous rocks and the created miniaturized models fortunately the chemical and geomaterial based surface modification methods have been deemed to fit into the 3d micromodels future research is necessary to integrate both the 3d features and surface geochemistry into such models 9 nanofluidic models nanofluidics is an emerging field contingent on the advancement of microfabrication techniques eijkel and van den berg 2010 nanofluidic devices have been referred to as those that have a channel or pore of which at least one dimension is in the range of 1 nm to 1 μm panigrahi 2016 some geological formations contain large bodies of nanoscale pores hence there is great potential for developing nanofluidic devices for subsurface applications this section explores two approaches for fabricating nanofluidic devices i etching nanochannels and ii sealing mesoporous media in micromodels a few examples of these devices for reservoir flows are discussed 9 1 nanomodels with designed nanostructures designed nanostructures can be patterned on substrates by conventional photolithography interference lithography electron beam lithography nanoimprint lithography polymer nanochannels and other approaches as discussed by xia et al 2012 three types of nanostructures have been developed planar nanochannels low aspect ratio ar square nanochannels ar 1 and deep nanochannels large ar among these planar nanochannels are the most advantageous with the ease of fabrication and experimental operation xia et al 2012 nanofluidic devices with planar nanochannels several tens to hundreds of nanometers in depth have been employed to study multiphase flows and single phase behaviors in underground reservoirs bao et al 2017 hasham et al 2018 zhong et al 2018a some representative research includes using silicon based nanochips with a planar channel array of 100 nm in depth to investigate the two phase gas slip effects wu et al 2014 employing silicon nanochips patterned with a channel network depth of 200 nm to visualize the effects of surfactants displacing oil he et al 2014 investigating hydraulic fracturing fluid dynamics with patterned planar networks depth of 175 nm hasham et al 2018 observing the capillary filling of 8 nm high nanochannels fig 13 a li et al 2017a and investigating the contact angles of gas liquid hydrocarbons in glass models with parallel channel arrays with the depth of 10 nm alfi et al 2016 the critical prerequisite of the nanofluidic based approach is the feasibility of optical visualizations of nano scale phenomena with the current microscopy tools the optical microscopy loses its efficiency when observing fluids dynamics at approximately the 10 nm scale where the phase contrast is undetectable with bright field microscopy li et al 2017a and the fluorescence intensity is out of detection range zhong et al 2018b a thin high refractive index silicon nitride si3n4 coating between the substrate and nanochannels has been reported to be able to facilitate the direct optical observations in sub 10 nm scales li et al 2017a zhong et al 2018b the si3n4 layer is formed by the low pressure cvd lpcvd and the light signals are enhanced in the integrated si3n4 base layer by fabry pérot interference li et al 2017a zhong et al 2018b the schematic of the nanochip fabrication procedure mechanism of the enhancement of light signals and an example of distinguishing liquid gas phases are shown in fig 13a li et al 2017a 9 2 nanomodels with mesoporous media mesoporous materials are often incorporated into micromodels as nanojunctions or membranes connecting microchannels for biomedical fields such models provide unique 3d nanoscale perspectives within the mesoporous media e g water capillary condensation in nanoconfinement ion concentration polarization icp and dna analysis ally et al 2016 kim et al 2017 vincent et al 2017 xia et al 2012 nafion is a popular porous material to be patterned printed or self sealed in pdms glass microchips for biomedical and chemical analyses kim et al 2010 2017 lee et al 2008 as shown in fig 13b nafion has been utilized as a nanoporous junction in a bifurcated system for icp operations kim et al 2017 the nafion membranes consist of charged nanopores with diameters of less than 10 nm in a recent study a layer 5 μm of mesoporous silicon posi on top of a p type silicon si wafer was patterned and bonded with a glass substrate to form a porous layer vincent et al 2017 this system was used to investigate the water imbibition by capillary condensation in nanopores fig 13c vincent et al 2017 the reported observations have provided useful information on the dynamics of the invasion by capillary condensation in the nanopores another approach is to generate nano packs in the microchannels ally et al 2016 developed a novel mineral nanoporous bed by packing the colloidal silica particles 150 nm in diameter in a conventional silicon glass microchip with a straight microchannel fig 13d the packing process is similar to that of packed beds firstly a plug made of iron oxide particles 6 μm in diameter was generated in the downstream of the microchannel then the silica particle suspension was streamed through the microchannel forming an 8 mm long packed bed ally et al 2016 the bed was cleaned and dried with toluene and nitrogen successively this nano pack was used to directly visualize the nanoscale capillary condensation of hydrocarbon and carbon dioxide under well controlled high pressure conditions ally et al 2016 despite the continuous improvements in fabricating nanostructures with nanofluidic technology no particular consideration has been given to surface modifications in these nanochannels additionally the active tailoring of surface properties is challenging primarily due to the extreme size scale alternative methods could be found in other research areas such as biomedical technology xia et al 2012 and membrane filtration mireles and gaborski 2017 these two microfabrication methods provide opportunities for future subsurface studies 10 selection guidelines in table 1 the key features of the reviewed visual models in the six categories are summarized including the geometries dimensions minimum feature sizes visualization tools interior surfaces and some examples of research for the geological flow studies even though 2d micromodels provide ample information about the flow in porous media 3d pore networks are essential to study the nature of heterogeneity in the formations and the induced events packed beds and hele shaw cells synthesized 3d micromodels and nanofluidic models are candidates for tools for 3d observations of geological processes among these methods the geometry and topology of synthesized 3d micromodels could be designed and experiments using these models can be repeatable however packed beds and hele shaw cells are easier and cheaper to be fabricated the resolution of 3d printed models and repeatability of experiments using packed beds and hele shaw cells have yet to be improved all visual models are subject to certain surface modifications to offer the desired wetting states mineralogy or roughness packed beds hele shaw cells and geomaterial dominated micromodels have been developed with single or complex mineralogy imitating natural subsurface porous media when proper packing particles or coating materials have been used packed beds and hele shaw cells are more easily assembled when compared with the fabrication of geomaterial dominated micromodels which involves the functionalization and surface characterizations moreover the endurance of functionalized micromodels planar surfaces under practical experimental conditions e g long term erosion by chemicals and operating at elevated temperatures or pressures has yet to be tested flows often involve complex chemicals such as surfactants acids and alkalis in the oil exploitation processes therefore compatibilities of the visual models are critical in many geological experiments and models fabricated with rigid materials e g glass and silicon are suitable 11 conclusions scientists in the geoscience and engineering community have extensively used visual models that simulate porous rocks and soils to investigate the multiphase flow transport and reactions at pore scales there are ongoing and future research opportunities i to advance the visual models for surface chemistry 3d aspects nano scale features and elevated pressure and temperature compatibility and ii to employ these models for rapidly screening the flow processes in underground formations we briefly summarize the modeling potential in the following 11 1 physical similarities incorporating petrophysical parameters into the design and fabrication of visual models is essential to improve the reliability of the modeling experiments critical elements include the features of the porous media such as 3d pore networks pore wall surfaces and their carrying fluids both the replicated complex porous structures from natural porous media and the computationally designed patterns are being used as the flow network in microchips parameters such as topology dimensions sizes and representative elemental volumes revs are necessary for careful designs with the advanced imaging techniques such as μct scanning the 2d and 3d reconstructions of pore geometries are feasible nowadays the 2 5d and 3d porous microchips are being developed using multilayer fabrication and 3d printing many strategies including chemical modifications and employing geomaterials have been developed to create reflective surfaces in visual models because rocks are formed on geological time scales it is unrealistic to replicate the surface properties in the visual models fully however the inclusion of actual minerals is becoming an increasingly essential requirement 11 2 chemically compatible devices most materials used in the fabrication of visual models such as glass quartz silicon and noa81 provide excellent chemical resistance to the typical components of geofluids pdms and resins suffer from relatively weak chemical resistance surface modifications have been developed to improve the internal channel surface properties as previously discussed e g coating the microfluidic channels with hybrid inorganic organic polymers hr4 to improve pdms s resistance to the solvents kim et al 2009 the development of visual models has primarily benefited from the recent progress in material synthesis microfabrication technology and advanced visualization tools with the ever developing surface treatment strategies both substrate surfaces and microflow structures have been functionalized with custom features 11 3 high pressure and high temperature hp ht conditions hp ht conditions are the typical state in underground environments microfluidic devices are generally limited in enduring the reservoir pressures and temperatures for instance the most widely used pdms glass microchips bonded with the plasma based sealing can only withstand net pressures of less than 0 5 mpa sollier et al 2011 efforts have been made to imitate elevated pressure and temperature conditions in microchips firstly the endurable pressures and temperatures are increased by using rigid materials such as silicon pinho et al 2014 glass molla et al 2016 quartz song et al 2014 and pmma kim et al 2013 secondly improved bonding techniques help to improve the resistance pressure of microfluidic devices by using anodic bonding hybrid silicon glass microchips have been reported to withstand 40 mpa and 200 c marre et al 2010 nguyen et al 2015 when employing a double cross linked nano adhesive dcna to bond both the rigid e g silicon wafer and glass and flexible substrates e g pdms poly imide pi and poly ethylene terephthalate pet the burst pressure of the developed microfluidic devices has been reported to be over 2 5 mpa and could reach a maximum value of 11 7 mpa while the surface features on the substrate can be preserved you et al 2013 finally using custom built chambers to offset the surrounding pressures has been proven to be an effective way to improve the maximum tolerable pressure of the devices george et al 2005 11 4 advanced visualization methods advanced visualization techniques have been adopted in the experimental routines visualization methods such as clsm provide 3d images of flow processes recent advances in non intrusive and non contact on chip sensing techniques are expected to provide new avenues for measuring various events in micromodels narang et al 2018 zarifi et al 2018 zarikos et al 2018 for instance microfluidics has been integrated with embedded sensors for detecting temperature pressure flow rates ion concentrations and concentrations of bioanalytes future sensors are expected to detect several real time parameters related to multiphase flows in microchannels including particle deposition phase change wettability alterations and others in both micro and nanochannels 11 5 practical questions in underground flow processes such as reservoir recovery processes conventional laboratory studies have included core flood and physical model experiments that are expensive and require substantial amounts of time for preparation execution and analysis although core flood experiments yield useful information for testing the feasibility of a process they are not useful for determining the physics at the pore scale visual models are powerful tools for i understanding the physics of fluids at pore scales and ii rapid screening of various flow systems related to underground flow processes such as enhanced oil production groundwater remediation and waste deposition to name a few data obtained from the visual experiments can guide the lengthy and expensive core flood experiments however it is necessary to be aware of the limitations in the direct upscaling of microscale visual experiments to the reservoir scale applications this leaves opportunities for future research on closing the gap between the visual models and core flood experiments declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing

17999,membrane technologies have broad applications in the removal of contaminants from drinking water and wastewater in recent decades ceramic membrane has made rapid progress in industrial municipal wastewater treatment and drinking water treatment owing to their advantageous properties over conventional polymeric membrane the beneficial characteristics of ceramic membranes include fouling

and poorer water quality in recent decades pressure driven membrane technologies have become the most promising approaches for water treatment seawater and brackish water desalination and wastewater reclamation membrane technologies have the advantages of lower thermal inputs smaller footprint lower chemical sludge effluent and higher removal efficiency over conventional water treatment technologies membranes are commonly classified polymeric and ceramic according to the materials used in their preparation based on their pore sizes membranes are classified into microfiltration mf ultrafiltration uf nanofiltration nf and reverse osmosis ro membranes polymeric membranes have been widely studied and are the leading membrane type employed in water filtration the various aspects of polymeric membranes such as membrane modifications membrane applications membrane fouling issues and membrane cleaning were intensively reported and reviewed choudhury et al 2018 liu et al 2017 taheran et al 2016 tul muntha et al 2017 however ceramic membranes have only been reviewed to a limited extent the publications on ceramic membranes have been expanding over the last 10 years from less than 150 in 2007 to a double in 2018 fig 1 a the search result of publication categorization from 2017 to present scopus 4th march 2019 shows that the researchers focus on the aspects of water treatment fouling nanomaterial fabrication and so on in ceramic membranes fig 1b based on a bibliometric analysis li et al 2018a research on ceramic membrane applications in water treatment has attracted increasing attention due to their extreme stability ceramic membranes are favored for challenging water purification processes such as textile wastewater treatment oil water separations and pharmaceutical wastewater treatment samaei et al 2018 the ceramic materials primarily composed of alumina silica zirconia mullite and other oxide mixtures and are typically sintered into the ceramic membrane at high temperature with an asymmetric structure consisting of support layer intermediate layer and top layer though ceramic mf and uf membrane commercially available in markets have been extensively tested for industrial wastewater treatment on a laboratory scale or full scale zoubeik et al 2018 the large scale use in water treatment is limited due to their high capital costs to encourage larger scale application of ceramic membranes much effort has been devoted towards decreasing the fabrication cost such as using clay as the membrane material hubadillah et al 2018 further research on ceramic mf and uf membrane is required to develop cheaper fabrication processes and higher quality membranes for continuous operation nf membranes are gaining much attention and popularity in water treatment due to their low rejection of monovalent ions high rejection of divalent ions superior contaminant removal and low energy consumption mohammad et al 2015 recently several studies revealed that ceramic nf membranes have the potential for reducing the formation of chlorinated disinfection by products during the treatment of surface water sentana et al 2011 as well as dye purification chen et al 2017c removal of ions and small molecules shang et al 2017 and pharmaceuticals controlling chu et al 2017 in recent years ceramic membranes have gained increasing attention due to their advantageous behavior over traditional polymeric membranes such as stronger mechanical thermal and chemical stability higher fouling resistance and more extended membrane longevity moreover the wastage or retreatment of water is lower in ceramic membrane systems owing to the less frequent need for backwashing compared to polymeric membranes freeman and shorney darby 2011 inevitable membrane fouling that shorten the lifetime of membranes and increase operation cost inhibit the wide application of membrane technology zhao et al 2018a therefore extensive studies have reported membrane fouling mechanisms and fouling control strategies for the polymeric membranes to promote the application of membrane technology goh et al 2018 jiang et al 2017 ceramic membranes were reported to be less influenced by membrane fouling compared with polymeric counterparts due to membrane surface chemistry but the fundamental membrane fouling mechanism of ceramic mf and uf membranes needed to be further elucidated khemakhem and ben amar 2012 thibault et al 2017 zuriaga agusti et al 2014 advances in polymeric nf membranes have been well reviewed in the literature mohammad et al 2015 tul muntha et al 2017 van der bruggen et al 2008 have pointed out some critical challenges and objectives in nf research such as membrane fouling alleviation further treatment of concentrates improving insufficient removal of special pollutants stronger chemical resistance and increasing the lifetime of membranes ceramic nf membranes offer promising solutions for the aforementioned challenges due to their unique material properties currently ceramic nf membrane technologies are less developed than ceramic uf mf membrane technologies and are mostly studied at the laboratory scale or in small scale applications thus investigations on ceramic nf membranes are of paramount importance for the further application in water treatment materials developed recently for ceramic nf membranes typically include porous ceramics and various nanoparticle composites lee et al 2016a the incorporation of nanoparticles into membranes has the function of resolving two important challenges of membranes the selectivity permeability trade off and the fouling issues ike et al 2017 the use of nanoparticles in the ceramic membrane preparation produces membranes porous in the nf range as well fig 2 a furthermore ceramic membranes functionalized with catalytic nanomaterials have been reported to provide membranes with additional functions zhang et al 2018a such as disinfection pollutant degradation and self cleaning ciston et al 2008 goei and lim 2014a fig 2b pendergast and hoek 2011 have proposed that nanostructured ceramic membranes are in the near potential commercial viability with significant performance enhancements commercial viability relates to material cost scalability and compatibility with existing manufacturing infrastructure we present herein a brief review of the progress in porous ceramic membranes ceramic nanomaterials and their modifications catalytic ceramic membrane technologies and membrane fouling finally the review discusses the prospects in the research and development of ceramic membranes along with the associated limitations and challenges 2 ceramic nanocomposite membrane development 2 1 ceramic mf uf membrane some major marketed ceramic mf uf membrane products from various international companies are listed in table 1 lee et al 2015 xing 2017 among them asymmetric multichannel tubular ceramic membranes dominate over other membrane geometries flat sheet ceramic membranes are mostly configured in immersed units for industrialization which facilitate the replacement of the membrane elements and membrane cleaning through air sparging flat disc membranes find limited applications in laboratory due to their low packing density thus their configuration needs further design and improvement hollow fiber membranes present the highest packing densities the number of chinese suppliers of ceramic membranes has been increasing in recent years however there are only a few prominent companies such as jiangsu jiu wu hi tech co ltd sinoma advanced material co ltd guangzhou tao xin environmental technology co ltd and guochu technology co ltd due to the lack of large scale production capacity the mf membrane products produced by chinese companies in the flat sheet or tubular shape are comparable in quality and performance with those produced by international companies jiangsu jiu wu hi tech co ltd has the ability to manufacture fine uf ceramic membranes with pore sizes in the range of 3 10 nm for industrial applications xing 2017 common fabrication techniques of ceramic membranes include extrusion pressing slip casting tape casting sol gel phase inversion anodic oxidation and chemical vapor deposition cvd methods generally preparing a porous ceramic membrane mainly includes three steps the slurry preparation shaping and sintering process ishak et al 2017 the product obtained after the above three steps is a symmetrical membrane applied as a support layer the flat support layer is usually prepared using tape casting while the tubes and multi channel supports with complex structures are often extruded or sliped and then dip coating cvd method and sol gel method can be used to prepare a transition layer or separation layer on the support layer to form composite membranes currently ceramic hollow fiber membranes are fabricated by combined phase inversion sintering in asymmetric structure with unique finger like and sponge like structure chen et al 2018b high capital cost is the chief disadvantage for ceramic membranes compared with polymeric membranes but their gap is narrowing based on recent technical and commercial developments freeman and shorney darby 2011 some efforts towards decreasing the capital cost of ceramic membranes in recent markets have been made on one hand some companies optimize the design of membrane module to increase the package density for example ceramac system which was developed by pwn technologies with membranes supplied by metawater combines up to 190 ceramic membrane elements into one vessel to form a highly economical and compact module and hence greatly reduces the costs of the ceramic membrane system to be competitive with polymeric membranes zheng et al 2015 additional development in the ceramic membrane modules is high surface area monolith structure where individual ceramic segments are potted together by nanostone water inc kurth et al 2018 on the other hand low cost raw materials and fabrication methods for ceramic membrane were intensively studied for example a major breakthrough in cm product cm 151tm nanostone to reduce cost is the high speed extrusion and firing process ceramic mf uf membranes are widely used in harsh environmental applications such as oil water separation mining textiles petrochemicals pharmaceutical and biotechnology and food and beverages industry the earliest application of ceramic membrane metawater co ltd in water plants in japan has been continuously in operation for up to 20 years maintaining good operating performance without damage lee et al 2015 in recent years ceramic membranes have gained increasing attention in mild environmental applications such as drinking water and municipal wastewater sewage treatments with the decrease in capital costs in addition to the traditional advantages of ceramic membranes over polymeric membranes dilaver 2011 for example unlike many other ceramic membranes the ceramic product from nanostone is specifically designed for treating surface water ground water and secondary treated waste water effluent nanostone water membrane filtration of surface water through ceramic membranes has been proven to be very reliable for drinking water production studies on drinking water production with ceramic mf uf membrane focus on comprehensive process which includes adsorption by powdered activated carbon matsui et al 2009 coagulation konieczny et al 2009 li et al 2011 loi bruegger et al 2006 zhang et al 2014a ozonation alpatova et al 2013 fan et al 2014 or ultraviolet uv zhang et al 2015 removal of dissolved organic carbon doc haloacetic acid analogues haa and trihalomethane thm formation potential and brominated dbps upon treatment of surface water by suspended ion exchange six pwn technologies netherlands coagulation ceramic mf membranes metawater japan pore size 0 1 μm was higher than the existing conventional process in long term pilot scale test because ion exchange preferentially removed low molecular weight mw compounds and coagulation favored the high mw compounds thus decreasing irreversible ceramic membrane fouling rockey et al 2018 the ceramic membrane process cer senic itn nanovation applied in drinking water supply combines precipitation and ceramic filtration precipitation brings arsenic into a particulate form and then it can be separated from the water by ultrafiltration with cfm systems ceramic flat membranes itn nanovation ceramic mf uf units may also be used as a pre treatment step to ro processes for the seawater desalination a drinking water plant in saudi arabia has been under construction since 2017 with a treatment capacity of 110 000 m3 day via high tech ro pretreatment and a ceramic uf system cfm systems itn nanovation singapore s first ceramic membrane water treatment at choa chu kang waterworks also one of the largest ceramic membrane filtration plants for drinking water treatment with 1 8 105 m3 day capacity in the world begins operation in 2019 it adopted the ceramic membrane ceramac system combined with ozone biological activated carbon filters for advanced water treatment the applications of ceramic membranes in water reclamations were also evaluated such as removal of phacs pharmaceutically active compounds by fine uf membranes with the molecular weight cut off mwco ranging from 1 to 8 kda garcia ivars et al 2017 and removal of ms2 virus and decreasing n nitrosodimethylamine ndma formation potential dbps combined with ozonation and coagulation im et al 2018 ceramic mbr membrane bioreactor systems have been intensively investigated for applications in municipal wastewater sewage treatment anaerobic fluidized membrane bioreactor anmbr with al2o3 ceramic membrane has a low electrical energy requirement and has been successfully employed for the treatment of low strength municipal wastewater achieving an overall chemical oxygen demand cod removal of 93 aslam et al 2017 2018 the hydrophilic ceramic membrane in an anmbr with periodic cleaning showed higher flux compared to the hydrophobic polyvinylidenefluoride pvdf membrane without periodic cleaning a pilot study with cfm system meidensha corporation installed in a wastewater treatment plant in japan with a treatment capacity of 50 m3 day were continuously operated for 3 years meiden review series no 164 2015 no 2 13 the pilot study results indicated that the performance of ceramic mbr systems is highly competitive and advantageous compared with their polymeric counterparts for the wastewater treatment tolkou et al 2014 despite of high capital cost ceramic membrane systems in water treatment plants wtps are cost effective compared to polymeric mf uf membrane systems because ceramic membrane have lower operation and maintenance o m cost and twice longer life span than polymeric counterparts for example based on life cycle costs lcc of water expressed as water production cost per unit volume comparable price 0 28 usd and 0 274 usd was reported by park et al 2015 from the ceramic and polymeric membrane wtps respectively guerra and pellegrino 2013 also identified that alumina membrane was cost competitive with the pes membrane considering the membrane lifespan membrane material cost and labor requirements a techno economic model is constructed to better analyze the capital and operating costs of ceramic membrane plant as compared to the benchmark polymeric mf uf membrane plant wise et al 2014 the savings on membrane replacement costs and labor outweighs the small premium in capital and electrical costs resulting in lower cost in total 20 year present worth for ceramic membrane system wise et al 2017 the main cost savings of ceramic membrane is the membrane replacement costs therefore life cycle assessment lca should be utilized in the economic feasibility of ceramic membranes for application in wtps 2 2 nanotechnology based ceramic mf uf membrane mf uf membranes have been widely applied in water treatment but suffered from low removal efficiencies of small doms and micropollutants as well as fouling issues membrane performance depends primarily on membrane materials over the past decades nanotechnology has been rapidly developed from an academic research to variety of commercial products qu et al 2013b with these advances in nanotechnology numerous studies have focused on the incorporation of nanomaterials into mf uf membranes to improve membrane

catalytic nano mno2 fe2o3 and tio2 adding nanomaterials into the porous polymeric membrane and thin film composite membrane has been reviewed elsewhere kim and van der bruggen 2010 and this review focuses on the progress seen in nanotechnology based ceramic membranes zeolite membranes as one of inorganic membranes have been intensively studied and reviewed elsewhere bedard and liu 2018 zeolite membrane is competitive with polymeric membranes due to high water flux so that the required membrane area will be low kuzniatsova et al 2008 ceramic membranes are frequently used as a support to prepare zeolite membranes to increase structural stability the most widely reported studies are generally mfi type zeolite ceramic membrane which have been intensively used in desalination zhu et al 2014 2015 pervaporation zhang et al 2018b and gas separation zhong et al 2016 chemically stable ceramic membranes modified with zeolite thin film coatings have also been shown to obtain high selectivity as nf membranes while maintaining higher permeability due to the well defined pores in nano range many studies have tested the performance of zeolite ceramic membranes for ion removal from water for example lit and faujasite fau zeolite have been coated on low cost ceramic supports through a hydrothermal route to achieve about 80 bsa retention kumar et al 2017 vasanth et al 2017 similarly fau zeolite membranes developed by hydrothermal treatment achieved up to 82 cr vi removal from aqueous solutions through electrostatic interaction which in additionally showed no fouling propensity basumatary et al 2016 nano ag as a broad spectrum antibacterial agent has been widely incorporated into ceramic microfilters for bacterial disinfection a coat of nano ag with a stabilizing agent that prevents the aggregation of the nano ag onto anodic al2o3 support by lbl layer by layer has been explored and exhibited slightly higher rejection of dextran with 100 kda mw than commercial uf membranes kawada et al 2014 nevertheless there is a general lack of investigation about the nano ag leaching into water from ceramic surfaces free chlorine at acceptable levels in drinking water could rapidly release ag either as nano ag or ag from a sio2 surface bielefeldt et al 2013 thus the risks in the exposure of the ceramic membrane to chlorine should be carefully monitored to ensure drinking water safety tio2 has attracted much attention because of its hydrophilicity chemical stability antimicrobial efficiency and high photocatalytic activity many studies have been performed to modify the polymeric membrane surface with tio2 through dip coating physical vapor deposition chemical physical deposition grafting and atomic layer deposition to enhance the selectivity permeability fouling resistance and ability of self cleaning bet moushoul et al 2016 oun et al 2017 demonstrated that tio2 modification of mf ceramic decreased permeate flux to a typical level for uf membrane while it improved the removal of alizarin red dye to 99 the deposition of a tio2 layer by dip coating on a ceramic support affords an extremely high removal efficiency of anionic and cationic dyes under electrostatic interactions bouazizi et al 2017 carbon based nanomaterials adopted in membrane technology including graphene oxide go and cnts have gained much attention recently for their unique properties cnts have advantages of the inherent surface smoothness high specific surface area excellent mechanical properties remarkable water transportation ability and chemical affinity for anchoring additional moieties which has encouraged the increased exploration of nanocomposite membranes incorporated with cnts al gharabli et al 2018 the use of porous ceramics incorporated with cnts through chemical vapor deposition was reported for removal of cu2 from water through adsorption tofighy and mohammadi 2015 and for removal of tiny oil droplets from water chen et al 2012 go consisting of oxygen groups and carboxyl groups can minimize transport resistance and maximize flux due to its high hydrophilic functional groups li et al 2013 smith and freeman 2014 until now go modified polymeric membranes have been studied for improving the permeate flux selectivity and antifouling properties for water treatment jiang et al 2016 safarpour et al 2014 it is a challenge for maintaining the integrity of go membranes in long term operations and their stability can be improved with ceramic supports zhang et al 2019c go modified inorganic membranes have not been evaluated extensively but they are gaining increasing attention lately the modification of alumina ceramics has been recently reviewed and pointed that graphene derivatives have strong potential to serve as modified materials ishak et al 2017 the formation of a covalent bond between the cooh groups of go and oh groups of the al2o3 surface during heat treatment has been confirmed hu et al 2015 moreover the modified membrane presented higher flux and oil rejection than the unmodified membrane therefore the application of carbon based nanomaterials holds great potential for ceramic membrane modification and needs to be explored in greater detail in addition the use of nanomaterial composites has the potential for further enhancing the performance of the modified membranes for example cnt has the potential to enhance the uniformity and coverage of tio2 coatings on support layers yao et al 2008 higher permeate flux dye rejection and stronger antifouling property were found for rgo tio2 pes membranes compared to tio2 or go modified pes membranes kumar et al 2016 the incorporation of three types of nanoparticles into the rgo nanosheets through in situ growth led to enlarged nanochannels ordered laminar structures and chemical bond between nanoparticles and rgo resulting in excellent water flux solute rejections and good structure stability under high pressure and cross flow filtration for industrial application zhang et al 2017a li et al 2019 also found that tio2 go modified ceramic membranes combined the advantages tio2 and go leading to relatively high permeate flux and structure stability therefore further evaluating the use of nanoparticles in ceramic membrane modifications is essential though promising the developed novel modified ceramic membranes were mostly tested on a lab scale for a relatively short time duration which is far from practical applications thus further long term evaluations are necessary to provide realistic perspectives on their feasibility for future research and applications 2 3 ceramic nf membrane ceramic nf membrane technologies are less developed than ceramic uf mf membrane technologies the commercial availability of ceramic nf membranes is rather limited around the world summarized in table 2 the recent promotion for scaling up ceramic nf membrane preparation of successfully increasing the membrane area from 0 25 m2 elements to 1 3 m2 elements is a promising attempt to reduce the cost for large scale applications voigt et al 2019 ceramic nf membranes commonly have pore sizes of 1 2 nm corresponding to a mwco in the range from 200 to 1000 da however some producers also define fine uf 1 kda and 5 kda as nf as shown in table 2 the sol gel process is a common method for ceramic nf membrane preparation with the ceramic mf uf membranes as a substrate a variety of metal oxides including gamma alumina γ al2o3 silica sio2 zirconia zro2 titania tio2 and their complexes were selected as the separation layer of nf membranes summarized in table 3 among them tio2 ceramic nf membrane one kind of non toxic and inexpensive material has been commercially available from inopor germany qi et al 2013 the first ceramic nf membrane in water treatment with an mwco of 450 da was made using tio2 via a polymeric sol gel method puhlfürß et al 2000 γ al2o3 presented inadequate chemical stability under severe conditions sio2 ceramic membranes are hydrothermally unstable due to the dissolution of silica into water at high temperature puthai et al 2016a while zro2 showed better stability than other materials as well as higher costs composite ceramic nf membranes such as sio2 zro2 pb tio2 and tio2 zro2 have been proposed and investigated to achieve better performance than the pure metal oxides guo et al 2018 of which the tio2 zro2 composite nf membranes have been commercially available due to their enhanced performance mazzoni et al 2009 sol gel methods suffer from the disadvantages of increased time and energy consumption complex operational challenges and not easy to be dense and having defects hence more advanced fabrication methods need to be explored and industrialized in addition the use of nanoparticles in ceramic membrane fabrication provides more opportunities for obtaining membranes with nano scale pore sizes than the above mentioned porous ceramic nf membranes via conventional sintering of ceramics summarized in table 4 fig 3 compared the membrane permeability and the mwco for reported ceramic nf membranes made from various materials and methods it is evident that the water permeability of commercial polymeric nf membranes is higher than commercial ceramic nf membranes high porosity narrow pore size distribution and thin membrane thickness lead to increased membrane permeability ceramic membranes are better than polymeric membranes due to their narrow pore size distribution and higher porosity koyuncu et al 2015 thus the major difference in permeate flux between the polymeric and ceramic membrane with similar mwco is attributed to the higher thickness of ceramic membranes especially thick intermediate layer therefore fabricating techniques in thin layers need to be improved in addition reported porosities of commercially ceramic nf membranes range from 30 to 40 which could be further enhanced the porosity mainly depends on the sintering process in general higher sintering temperature cause higher mechanical strength but lower porosity of the final membrane lee et al 2015 sacrificial pore formers such as organics polymer beads organic fibers starch cellulose and cotton and inorganic components nickel carbon and graphite could be used in the ceramic slurry to increase the membrane porosity nishihora et al 2018 in addition ceramic nf membranes prepared by conventional sol gel processes mostly exhibit relatively higher mwco while tight ceramic nf membranes are obtained from other nanomaterial modification methods such as cvd and ald tio2 is a promising material for tight ceramic nf membrane fabrication with relatively higher water permeability compared with other commonly studied materials higher permeability was observed for the tio2 modified membrane compared to the sol gel counterparts with similar mwco inhomogeneous deposition a thick intermediate layer and repetitive coating contribute to the decreased permeability go based ceramic nf membranes could present lower mwco but higher permeability needs to be achieved tio2 go nanocomposites combining the advantages of tio2 and go might be an alternative to achieving ceramic nf membranes with high permeate flux and low mwco which have been widely studied in photocatalytic membranes but less evaluated for nanofiltration the influential factors for ceramic nf membrane fabrication have been intensively studied while their performance has been scarcely evaluated it has been proposed that ceramic nf membranes are more suitable for the separation of nacl and na2so4 from dye solutions due to high dye rejection 90 and a low nacl 20 and na2so4 40 rejection than two commercial polymeric nf membranes chen et al 2017c another study elucidated the removal mechanisms governing phacs using four types of commercially available ceramic nf membranes and suggested that electrostatic interactions were more dominant than hydrophobic interactions due to higher hydrophilicity and lower densities of cooh and oh groups on the ceramic surface compared to the polymeric counterparts zhao et al 2018b but it is only applicable when phacs were spiked in deionised water hydrophobic interactions and adsorption made a major role when real wastewater effluent was used to form fouling layer garcia ivars et al 2017 therefore the further research on mechanism governing the separation and fouling processes of ceramic nf membrane or fine uf membranes in real water treatment is needed 2 4 ceramic photo catalytic membrane ceramic membranes fabricated with catalytic nanomaterials afford membranes with multiple functions such as degradation of pollutants and self cleaning qu et al 2013a in the past decades catalytic ceramic membranes have been intensively integrated with advanced oxidation processes aops such as photocatalysis athanasekou et al 2012 ozonation zhu et al 2011 peroxymonosulfate pms wu et al 2019a h2o2 and fenton reaction sun et al 2018b which can present synergistic effects for degradation of recalcitrant compounds membrane fouling mitigation disinfection and disinfection by product formation potential control polymeric membranes are vulnerable to oxidation by oh radical attacks thus ceramic membranes are more favorable compared with polymeric counterparts particularly in a catalyzed process due to their chemical resistance tio2 is the most widely investigated photocatalyst due to its relatively low band gap energy relatively high quantum yield chemical stability and low cost iglesias et al 2016a which allow its activation by near visible light tio2 can produce reactive oxygen species ros such as superoxide radical anions o2 and ho under irradiation which are reported to present effective degradation of pollutants katal et al 2018 and disinfection of extensive varieties of organisms zuo et al 2015 suspended tio2 suffers from the disadvantages of time consuming processes and costly post treatment currently numerous studies on immobilizing tio2 photocatalysts with membranes have been evaluated to address catalyst separation and recovery problems enhance the residence time for pollutant degradation and promote process intensification for water treatment iglesias et al 2016b leong et al 2014 paredes et al 2019 have successfully prepared and employed tio2 immobilized polyvinylidenefluoride pvdf membranes for the degradation of eight different pharmaceuticals in groundwater and secondary wastewater effluents ceramic membranes are more attractive for use as photocatalyst supports due to their robust nature against chemical attack than polymeric membranes it has been experimentally proven that tio2 layers led to a higher and more stable flux of ceramic membrane under uv light through enhanced membrane wettability mendret et al 2013 the publications since 2014 on tio2 ceramic composite membrane fabrication for photocatalytic processes through dip coating chemical vapor deposition cvd and atmospheric plasma spraying have been reviewed leong et al 2014 magnetron sputtering was also reported to be suitable for producing high fineness and well adhered coatings on membranes tio2 was immobilized on a ceramic nf membrane surface through magnetron sputtering to form uniformly distributed nanostructured columns sanches et al 2017 fig 4 the sputtering conditions were optimized for the effective photocatalytic rate of the pesticides a comparison between the water permeability and mb degradation of tio2 modified ceramic membranes using lbl and plasma enhanced cvd techniques has been reported starr et al 2016 both methods had no impact on the permeability of modified membranes while the lbl coated membranes have a higher removal efficiency of mb than plasma enhanced cvd coated membranes as the catalytic efficiency of p25 was higher than that of plasma enhanced cvd generated catalyst it is noteworthy that the membrane permeate side modifications shown in fig 5 showed the advantages of higher photocatalytic activity and independent separation layer and catalysis layer ayral 2019 the fabrication of tio2 modified ceramic membranes via different dip coating routes were studied and it was proposed that the substrates had an influence on the uniformity and smoothness of tio2 coating which ensures the self cleaning efficiency of tio2 modification after exposure to uv light alias et al 2018 however tio2 has the disadvantages of low efficiency and narrow light response range the development of visible light active photocatalysis is of paramount importance for developing practical applications of photocatalytic membrane processes a radical solution to improve photocatalytic activity is to combine tio2 with other materials with a higher adsorption capacity such as sio2 hap hydroxyapatite and carbonaceous nanomaterials to accelerate the pollutant adsorption onto the membrane surface zhang et al 2014b an alternate strategy is to dope metals rtimi et al 2019 or non metals leary and westwood 2011 with typical favorable properties into tio2 matrix most studies focused on the use of ag for enhancing the photocatalytic properties of tio2 due to its ability to improve electron hole separation interfacial charge transfer and anti microbial properties wang et al 2013 the nanocomposites of go tio2 have attracted intensive attention in photocatalytic applications due to their large surface area and the abundant oxygen containing functional groups of go for anchoring tio2 to decrease nanocomposite aggregation pastrana martinez et al 2015 xu et al 2016 diamantopoulou et al 2019 have demonstrated that go deposition reduces mesoporosity of the tio2 and increases its surface functionality affording increased pollutant adsorption the go tio2 composite was synthesized by a variety of methods such as in situ growth solution mixing hydrothermal and liquid phase deposition lpd methods in previous studies the reported go tio2 based photocatalytic membranes are mainly porous polymeric supported membranes gao et al 2014 xu et al 2016 for example the go tio2 pvdf membrane showed enhanced degradation efficiency and antifouling property than membranes functionalized with tio2 and go respectively however the limited mechanical strength thermal and chemical stability of these polymeric substrates remains a major challenge for broader application of go tio2 based membranes few reports on coating go tio2 nanocomposites on the ceramic membranes have been published to study the performance of the photocatalytic membrane athanasekou et al 2014 2015 which opens up new possibilities for the development of photocatalytic materials recent studies focusing on photocatalytic ceramic membranes functionalized with tio2 composite nanomaterials in hybrid membrane technologies for pollutant removal and disinfection are summarized in table 5 tio2 mediated disinfection has recently emerged as an alternative to chlorination and uv disinfection due to its strong oxidizing power no harmful and toxic disinfection by products formation long term photostability and low cost xiang et al 2012 tio2 sio2 and tio2 sio2 au coatings were reported to efficiently inactivate gram negative escherichia coli and total coliforms and gram positive bacteria enterococci under natural solar radiation a promising result for drinking water disinfection levchuk et al 2018 the inactivation mechanisms and influencing factors of tio2 based photocatalysts for disinfection of various microorganism types have been comprehensively reviewed laxma reddy et al 2017 uyguner demirel et al 2018 tio2 modified ro membranes exhibited photobactericidal properties leading to mitigation of biofouling under uv exposure miller et al 2017 recent studies have also discussed the application of tio2 based photocatalysts on ceramic surfaces for disinfection upon exposure to uv summarized in table 5 the concentration of the e coli and the lamp power had a significant effect on the e coli removal efficiency but the temperature had a limited effect on the removal of e coli from water using tio2 incorporated ceramic disk filters he et al 2018 goei and lim 2014a have proposed the possible anti microbial mechanisms of ag tio2 modified ceramic membranes for a photocatalytic membrane reactor pmr experiment including direct uv disinfection membrane rejection and ag ag and tio2 disinfection while significant improvements in the photocatalytic membrane technology have been achieved drawbacks such as poor pore size porosity control lack of effective dispersion of the catalyst particles loss of photo activity technical difficulties in irradiating the membrane surface deactivation and wash out of catalytic nanoparticles and controlling liquid residence time in the reactor need to be addressed metal oxides can promote the decomposition of ozone a commonly used oxidant for water treatment and generate hydroxyl ho or other radicals ceramic catalytic membranes were most widely coated by manganese or iron oxide nanoparticles in hybrid ozonation ceramic membrane filtration systems ceramic membrane functionalized with catalytic nanomaterials exhibited about 30 40 higher removal of doc disinfection and ozonation by products than the conventional membrane combined with ozonation karnik et al 2005a 2005b davies et al 2010 demonstrated that the use of fe2o3 coated membranes through layer by layer achieved over 85 removal of toc and reduced the formation of dbps significantly and eliminated 99 of bacteria and tio2 is less effective than mno2 and fe2o3 for the catalytic ozonation process the catalytic ozonation reaction of iron oxide nanoparticle incorporated ceramic membrane enhanced the decomposition of natural organic matter nom efficiently by generating hydroxyl radicals and hence reduced the flux decline park et al 2012 moreover the nom characterization results demonstrated that this hybrid ceramic membrane process led to effective removal of relatively high contents of aromatic humic acid and high molecular weight and hydrophobic nom fractions due to the preferential oxidation of electron rich moieties including carbon carbon double bonds and aromatic compounds the performance of the mno2 coated membrane was better than other membranes tested indicated by the lowest fouling the highest removal of toc and improved removal of trihalomethanes thms and haloacetic acid analogues haas precursors byun et al 2011 thus ozonation in ceramic catalytic systems has the advantage of controlling the formation of dbp over chlorination in drinking water treatment through reducing dbp precursors lee et al 2019 pointed that ceramic membrane impregnated with ceox throughout the membrane porous structure could effectively degrade micropollutants with less o3 consumption due to reduced mass transfer in pores that act as microreactors wang et al 2017 calculated the specific energy consumption of mno2 coated ceramic membrane ozonation system under different ozone dosing rates and operation modes and showed that the minimum energy consumption to treat 1000 l of water from lake lansing was calculated to be 0 97 kwh subsequently based on these laboratory data a life cycle assessment was conducted to compare the energy consumption and environmental impacts of the ozonation ceramic catalytic system with a conventional polymeric hollow fiber membrane and a chlorine disinfection system used for surface water treatment on an industrial scale wang et al 2019 in conclusion the ceramic catalytic membrane system had a lower environmental impact regardless of higher energy consumption and is a promising alternative for utilization in water supply with advancing technologies for saving the energy needed for ozone generation in addition heterogeneous catalysts for fenton like reactions such as fe3o4 fe2o3 α feooh and β feooh have been combined with membranes with the addition of h2o2 for the treatment of highly polluted wastewaters zhang et al 2019a 2020 catalytic ceramic membranes in hybrid membrane aop system were summarized in table 6 in summary the use of catalyst loaded ceramic membranes combined with ozone or uv and other strong oxidants afford higher contaminant removal lower fouling propensity and open up self cleaning possibilities tang et al 2017a uv irradiation combined with ceramic membranes have advantages of green chemistry concept but suffer from high cost of uv light source and complex device design ozonation have advantages of ozone dose controllable and strong design compatibility but ozone oxidation byproduct the fenton like process have advantages of environmentally benign reagents high degradation efficiency and mild operation conditions among the aop technologies but high synthesis costs of heterogeneous fenton catalysts zhang et al 2019b ceramic catalytic membranes were employed for coupling catalysis with the separation process in a single step which reduced the process complexity and resulted in a higher efficiency in water purification while these results are promising further studies are still needed for efficient scale up of these applications in such a reactor striking a balance between the catalytic activity and mass transfer under hydrodynamic conditions still remains an important challenge in addition the intermediate organic degradation products need to be retained by membranes molinari et al 2017 thus the preparation of catalytic membrane systems should be considered with suitable pore size distribution and uniform dispersion of the catalysts in addition until now most reported studies on hybrid ceramic membranes have focused on membrane fouling mitigation and the removal of typical organic matter but less attention has been devoted to the removal of organic micropollutants which is an emerging challenge in water treatment 3 membrane fouling in the ceramic membrane processes despite the remarkable membrane improvements achieved the wider application of membrane technology is still limited by the inevitable membrane fouling issues which result in poor water quality and high operating and maintenance costs the major drawbacks of polymeric membranes are their propensity to fouling as well as its susceptibility to chlorine ceramic membranes have a chlorine resistant property which could maintain their antibacterial function following chlorination procedures meanwhile ceramic membranes were reported to have a less fouling propensity and irreversible fouling than polymeric membranes lee and kim 2014 muric et al 2014 hofs et al 2011 compared the fouling behavior of four different ceramic membranes tio2 zro2 al2o3 and sic with one polymeric membrane using surface water ceramic membranes were found to exhibit higher removal of nom and uv254 and lower degree of fouling and irreversible fouling than the polymeric membrane summarized in table 7 the fouling characteristics of ceramic membranes were analyzed first using filtration models which have been applied to polymeric membranes and it indicated that these models built on cake filtration could also be utilized to simulate nom fouling of ceramic membrane fig 6 a lee et al 2013 ceramic membranes are more hydrophilic than polymeric membranes due to the different surface functional groups which led to weaker interaction of the foulants and membranes fig 6b in addition to their low fouling propensity cleaning methods that are more aggressive without influencing membrane longevity can be applied to reduce cleaning time and remove irreversible foulants for ceramic membranes additional investigations are necessary to get a better understanding of the detailed fouling mechanisms and cleaning strategies of ceramic membranes 3 1 fouling behavior in water treatment nom is a major organic constituent in surface and groundwater and causes severe fouling in membrane filtration the critical role of nom in membrane fouling has been widely studied albeit most studies were limited to polymeric membranes al amoudi 2010 kim and dempsey 2013 numerous studies have focused on investigating the factors influencing membrane fouling in ceramic membrane filtration such as membrane properties and feed water chemistry chen et al 2006 de angelis et al 2013 the effect of ph ca2 concentration and ionic strength in feed water on the nom fouling is similar but the degree of change is different between ceramic and polymeric membranes lee and kim 2014 ceramic membranes demonstrated improved efficiency in physical and chemical cleaning along with reduced nom fouling when compared to polymeric membranes a stronger influence of ph on fouling was also observed for ceramic membranes it is noteworthy that the effect of calcium ions on the decline in flux during nom fouling a challenging issue for practical membrane applications was much lower with ceramic membranes in addition irreversible fouling of ceramic membranes caused by various types of feed solutions was negligible lee et al 2013 in a similar finding alresheedi et al 2019 a much higher hydraulic reversibility and higher nom removal were realized with the ceramic uf than the polymeric uf these results are noteworthy as the adverse effects of calcium ion by severe irreversible fouling were found for polymeric membranes which deteriorated the process efficiency upon long term operation thus ceramic membranes are advantageous for applications in surface water treatment compared to polymeric membranes a systematic study describing the influence of inorganic ions on dom fouling of tio2 ceramic nf membranes was first reported by mustafa et al 2016b in this study membrane fouling was determined by the whole of the membrane surface chemistry rather than the sole membrane hydrophilicity the irreversible fouling of ceramic nf membranes caused by sodium alginate was higher than polymeric nf membranes mainly resulting from much lower content of cooh groups on the ceramic membrane surface shown in fig 6b zhao et al 2018b additionally ceramic membranes were applied in mbrs for domestic or industrial wastewater treatment where membrane fouling inevitably occurs anaerobic ceramic membrane bioreactor achieved higher water flux higher organic removal and lower membrane fouling than with the application of polymeric membranes though a high concentration of biomass was rejected the membrane fouling mitigation was mainly attributed to the superhydrophilic surface of the al2o3 ceramic membranes which decreased hydrophobic attraction of membrane foulants jeong et al 2018 the ceramic membrane with the roughest surface and biggest pore size applied in the mbr membrane bioreactor exhibited the severest fouling degree and suggested that membrane surface properties played a major role in membrane fouling jin et al 2010 similar results were found yue et al 2015 where harsh fouling was observed in larger pore sized ceramic membranes in anaerobic membrane bioreactor which was attributed to pore blocking by proteins membrane fouling can potentially influence rejection behavior phosphate retention by tight ceramic uf membranes after nom and effluent organic matter efom fouling with ca2 was decreased due to electrostatic interaction and cake enhanced concentration and a relatively higher phosphate rejection for efom fouling was due to additional adsorption of the biopolymers than nom fouling shang et al 2014 garcia ivars et al 2017 evaluated the performance of ceramic membranes with mwco in the range of 1 8 kda for removing ten selected phacs from wastewater effluents and determined that membrane fouling improved the retention through increasing adsorption and electrostatic repulsion between anionic compounds and the negatively charged membrane surface in recent years the impact of organic fouling on the retention of organic micropollutants by polymeric membranes has been extensively studied chang et al 2012 mahlangu et al 2014 sadmani et al 2014 which has led to either an improvement in micropollutant rejection due to an enhanced surface charge and micropollutant dom association or a reduction in rejection due to cake layer enhanced concentration polarization however the mechanisms governing the impact of organic fouling on membrane selectivity especially the micropollutant removal by a ceramic membrane has not yet been systematically investigated it is well documented that biofouling is the most harmful and is the most challenging to control li et al 2016 as the critical step in biofilm formation attachment of microbial cells onto membrane surface gets the most attention which is reported to be affected by membrane surface properties terada et al 2012 solution chemistry and bacterial properties ramsey and whiteley 2004 further review of publications on bacterial adhesion and biofouling in nf ro membrane systems can be found elsewhere gutman et al 2012 habimana et al 2014 recently only a few studies focusing on biofouling issues in ceramic membrane processes were reported for example a comparison of bacterial adhesion on three ceramic uf membranes with different photo catalysts that included various ratios of anatase phase to rutile phase was reported ciston et al 2008 they demonstrated that the use of photocatalysts could weaken bacterial adhesion and viability on ceramic membranes and may prevent flux decline blanpain avet et al 2011 investigated the mechanism associated with bacillus cereus spore adhesion to a tubular ceramic microfiltration membrane and found that the permeation drag force was shown to primarily control the cell membrane adhesion however the biofilm formation process the microbial community on the ceramic membrane and the mechanisms governing the biofouling effects were not adequately known for the filtrations using ceramic membranes the physicochemical properties of ceramic membrane surfaces including hydrophobicity zeta potential membrane roughness and chemical composition were different from those of polymeric membranes and thus the initial bacterial attachment onto the ceramic membrane surface and subsequent biofilm growth deserve further investigation 3 2 fouling prevention and mitigation many fouling control approaches such as pretreatment membrane cleaning membrane module design and surface modification asadollahi et al 2017 goh et al 2018 have been attempted past studies on polymeric membranes suggest that the antifouling properties of membranes are primarily determined by the membrane surface properties consequently the number of studies describing the surface modification of polymeric membranes in order to minimize membrane fouling has significantly increased meng et al 2014 ni et al 2014 different materials and techniques for the preparation of antifouling membranes have recently been reviewed in the literature kang and cao 2012 miller et al 2017 a complete review of the physical and chemical surface modifications of polyamide ro membranes has been conducted asadollahi et al 2017 chemical modification achieved by covalent bonding presents better chemical and structural stabilities for long term operations than physical modification however studies on the surface modification of ceramic membranes have received less attention as discussed previously the nanocomposite ceramic membranes and nanomaterials were primarily coated onto the ceramic membrane surface through dip coating and vacuum filtration to increase fouling resistance chemical modification has been reported less in comparison to physical modification due to the limited availability of modification approaches in the earlier decades alumina anopore membranes was graphed with poly ethylene glycol to improve surface hydrophilicity to reduce fouling yeu et al 2009 antifouling grafting techniques on ceramic membranes were recently developed mustafa et al 2014 2018 the membranes grafted with methyl groups using the grignard technique were reported to have low fouling sensitivity as compared to the pristine membranes while treating challenging wastewater mustafa et al 2016a lee et al 2016b grafted organosilanes onto alumina ceramic membranes via a silanization process for improving the antifouling properties the chemical grafting of inorganic substrates with organic materials retained the desirable advantages of both ceramic membranes and organic membranes therefore organic modifier materials need to be further developed for ceramic membrane modification furthermore the addition of antimicrobial nanomaterials into membranes could provide membranes with biofouling mitigation functions in multiple pathways such as releasing toxic ions ag damaging cell membranes by direct contact cnts and go or generating reactive oxygen species tio2 and fullerol qu et al 2013b meanwhile it is noteworthy that any modifications carried out to obtain antifouling ceramic membranes should not sacrifice the permeate flux and solute retention capacity in addition to membrane modifications hybrid ceramic membrane processes such as ceramic membranes combined with oxidation adsorption coagulation and filtration are also effective strategies for minimizing membrane fouling by removal of foulants and their precursors for example ferrate pretreatment was shown to effectively mitigate membrane fouling by changing the fouling mechanism from intermediate standard blocking to cake intermediate blocking liu et al 2018 ferrous iron peroxymonosulfate fe ii pms oxidation was utilized as a pretreatment method for ceramic ultrafiltration process cheng et al 2017a the effective reduction of organic loadings by coagulation with in situ formed fe iii reduced the membrane fouling caused by humic acid sodium alginate bovine serum albumin and their mixture in addition atrazine degradation was efficient due to the oxidation by sulfate and hydroxyl radicals whereas coagulation was ineffective in removing it the use of sulfate radical based oxidations fe ii pms uv pms and uv fe ii pms as ceramic uf membrane pretreatments effectively reduced the deposition of high mw biopolymers on membrane surfaces through decomposition of high mw biopolymers 20 000 da into low mw humic substances 1000 20 000 da cheng et al 2018 zhang et al 2015 made a comparative study about uv h2o2 and coagulation with aluminum chlorohydrate as a pretreatment for ceramic mf membrane for mitigating the fouling caused by soluble algal organic matter uv h2o2 pretreatment caused greater irreversible membrane fouling than coagulation due to the generation of small substances with lower mw from the oxidation of the larger substances but afforded higher microcystin removal recently tio2 uv photocatalytic treatment combined with ceramic membrane filtration was studied szymański et al 2016 this pretreatment changed the fouling potential of organics in the secondary effluent and caused lower flux decline compared to ceramic membrane filtration alone song et al 2018b tio2 uv pretreatment was reported to cause a significant decrease in cake filtration coefficients and a minor reduction in pore blocking coefficients with increasing uv tio2 treatment time which indicated tio2 uv pretreatment had a minor impact on irreversible fouling mitigation but mostly improved the reversible fouling alleviation yang et al 2019 many successful studies were recently examined to understand the effects of combining ceramic membrane filtration with ozonation for mitigating membrane fouling in both lab scale biscardi and duranceau 2016 kim et al 2008 szymanska et al 2014 zhang et al 2013 zouboulis et al 2014 and pilot scale study zhang et al 2016 for water and wastewater treatment pwn technologies have reported the impact of various pretreatment methods on ceramic membrane fouling for pilot studies in different locations such as coagulation and clarification ion exchange and the combination of ion exchange and in line coagulation and concluded that ozone led to a better operation though sometimes it was not cost effective galjaard et al 2011 zheng et al 2015 low ozone dosage was found to slightly mitigate membrane protein fouling while relatively high ozone dosage caused severe membrane fouling for pre ozonation at 10 mg l and for in situ ozonation at 4 and 10 mg l respectively song et al 2018a tang et al 2017b thus appropriate ozonation dosage should be evaluated in the hybrid ceramic membrane process tang et al 2019 also found that in situ ozonation increased phosphorus removal in ceramic mbr system in addition to membrane fouling alleviation owing to the enhanced abundance of phosphate accumulating bacteria in activated sludge the fouling layer was loosened by ozone and then easily washed off from the membrane surface zheng et al 2015 combining ozonation with catalytic tio2 in the ceramic uf membrane systems exhibited higher flux recovery after humic acid ha fouling and higher removal of doc and uv254 than using ozonation alone chen et al 2017a ozonation and uv h2o2 were found to reduce the concentration of nom with higher mw but did not substantially affect the low mw organics mw molecular weight in the raw water winter et al 2016 though the predominant fouling mechanism was kept unchanged for different oxidation and membrane mwco the fouling resistance was influenced through changing mw distribution of the foulants on membrane surface therefore it was proposed that the oxidation could not efficiently mitigate membrane fouling for lower mwco membranes as previously discussed when the ceramic membrane surface was coated with catalytic nanomaterials membrane fouling was reduced to a larger extent by oxidation in hybrid ceramic membrane process many cleaning processes are performed periodically to recover as much of the initial flux as possible after fouling physical cleaning normally achieved by backwashing can only recover the water flux decline caused by reversible fouling chemical cleaning is necessary to remove irreversible fouling when water flux has decreased to 40 50 of the initial flux lee et al 2015 soaking in naoh solution widely used for ceramic membrane cleaning could not remove all foulants from the membranes thus more aggressive procedures are required for cleaning fouled ceramic membranes hofs et al 2011 recently many studies have been directed towards chemically enhanced backwash ceb and cleaning in place cip procedures for ceramic membrane fouling control which is unsuitable for polymeric membranes under high concentration of chemicals because ceramic membranes can endure aggressive cleaning agents without membrane damage as listed in table 7 cip cleaning with a higher concentration of chemicals longer time and higher temperature reduces the irreversible fouling and offers reliable performance over long term operation the choice of cleaning agents chiefly depends on the foulant analysis it is well known that acids are commonly used to treat inorganic fouling and alkalis are used to treat organic fouling mei et al 2017 proposed an effective fouling control method in anaerobic ceramic membrane bioreactors ancmbrs using naoh enhanced backwash cleaning and it was found that 12 mmol l of naoh was the economical and optimal dosage yue et al 2018 utilized the naclo assisted backwashing to mitigate membrane fouling in ancmbrs by removing the foulants from membrane surfaces and influencing the nature of mixed liquor however a high concentration of naclo induced cell lysis from the diffusion of ocl into the cells leading to severe fouling the use of naclo was also reported to induce the release of soluble microbial products smp and extracellular polymeric substances eps via biomass decay and has a negative impact on membrane fouling control kimura and uchida 2019 thus the optimal chemical concentration in ceb cleaning should be evaluated and proposed in the investigation on line chemical cleaning with ozone was also attempted in a ceramic mbr system as the high ozone concentration led to a lower concentration of biopolymers with mw greater than 10 kda they were quickly rejected and formed fouling layers on the surface by the ceramic membranes sun et al 2018a a similar study using backwashing with ozonated water 2 mg o3 l for a few minutes effectively removed the cake layer on the ceramic mf membrane surface for sewer mining fujioka and nghiem 2015 in addition ultrasonic fields and minute electric field can be used to assist in cleaning membranes chen et al 2006 dong et al 2018 more environmentally friendly and effective membrane cleaning methods should be further explored for reliable long term operation lee et al 2015 4 conclusions and future perspectives this review aims at discussing the current state of the art in ceramic membranes namely ceramic nf membranes ceramic nanocomposite membranes ceramic catalytic membranes and membrane fouling the advantages of ceramic membranes and ceramic nanocomposite membranes in hybrid systems for water treatment are summarized in fig 7 hybrid ceramic ceramic nanocomposite membrane systems with uv or o3 based catalytic reactor coagulation or ro membrane have the advantages of self cleaning fouling mitigation pollutants degradation disinfection and dbps control the application of ceramic membranes in hybrid system was reported to have less fouling propensity lower irreversible fouling lower environmental impact lower energy consumption of manufacturing and backwashing higher flux loner lifetime and higher cleaning efficiency compared with using polymeric counterparts these advantageous properties offer excellent prospects for applications of ceramic membranes in mild water treatment conditions 1 ceramic mf and uf membranes that are commercially available in markets have been widely applied in industrial applications further research is required for the development of ceramic mf and uf membranes for improving ease of fabrication high packing density and lower costs while continuously maintaining high quality membranes for applications in drinking water wastewater treatment at large scales in addition extensive research on the fabrication and evaluation of ceramic nf membranes are also necessary the sol gel process was the commonly used method for preparation of ceramic nf membranes new methods such as ald cvd hydrothermal treatment and ldl should be explored and optimized for preparation of ceramic nf membranes to expand the applications of ceramic nf technology to industrial manufacturing and large scale applications a comprehensive study of the separation mechanism fouling processes and cleaning strategies of ceramic nf membranes are imperative 2 nanotechnology based ceramic membranes open up new possibilities for expanding ceramic membrane applications by overcoming the limitations of conventional materials though the information on nanomaterials for ceramic modification provided here is not exhaustive significant strategies for the preparation of ceramic nf membranes and catalytic ceramic membranes have been fundamentally dealt with the studies on tio2 based modifications strongly support the use of tio2 based nanocomposites as effective alternatives for fabricating photocatalytic membranes for water decontamination considering their well known practical applications in water treatment however most nanotechnology based ceramic membranes prepared on small disk supports and tested in dead end filtration do not meet the requirements for practical applications the performance of novel ceramic membranes needs evaluation through filtrating both synthetic wastewater and real wastewater for long term operations for commercial implementation 3 investigations into the integration of oxidation processes and ceramic membranes for replacement of conventional water treatment processes have attracted growing interest and have been proven highly reliable for drinking water production the incorporation of nanocomposites into ceramic membrane renders the integrated systems more effective for membrane fouling mitigation one step design and catalysis recovery the energy consumption and environmental impacts of the novel hybrid systems should be compared with existing conventional technologies in life cycle assessment 4 the catalytic ceramic membrane process works more effectively for removal of dyes but the studies on the integration of the process for degradation of dissolved organic matter micro pollutants and microorganisms are limited further studies should focus on investigating visible solar light active photocatalysts intermediate products of organic pollutants in the catalytic process and the disinfection mechanism to promote the application of catalytic ceramic membranes in the industry challenges is the design of the membrane reactor configuration especially for the photocatalytic membranes where the exposure of membrane surface to the uv irradiation and extension of hydraulic retention time in the reactor needs optimization the permeate side of membranes modified by catalysis has advantages of higher photocatalytic activity and independent separation layer and catalysis layer 5 lower fouling propensity and irreversible fouling were found for ceramic membranes because of the decreased interaction of the foulant in more hydrophilic ceramic surfaces compared to polymeric membranes further research in depth is necessary to understand the effects of surface properties of ceramic membranes on membrane fouling degree and analysis of foulants which will allow the selection of the appropriate cleaning strategy for reliable and long term operation furthermore efficient

and poorer water quality in recent decades pressure driven membrane technologies have become the most promising approaches for water treatment seawater and brackish water desalination and wastewater reclamation membrane technologies have the advantages of lower thermal inputs smaller footprint lower chemical sludge effluent and higher removal efficiency over conventional water treatment technologies membranes are commonly classified polymeric and ceramic according to the materials used in their preparation based on their pore sizes membranes are classified into microfiltration mf ultrafiltration uf nanofiltration nf and reverse osmosis ro membranes polymeric membranes have been widely studied and are the leading membrane type employed in water filtration the various aspects of polymeric membranes such as membrane modifications membrane applications membrane fouling issues and membrane cleaning were intensively reported and reviewed choudhury et al 2018 liu et al 2017 taheran et al 2016 tul muntha et al 2017 however ceramic membranes have only been reviewed to a limited extent the publications on ceramic membranes have been expanding over the last 10 years from less than 150 in 2007 to a double in 2018 fig 1 a the search result of publication categorization from 2017 to present scopus 4th march 2019 shows that the researchers focus on the aspects of water treatment fouling nanomaterial fabrication and so on in ceramic membranes fig 1b based on a bibliometric analysis li et al 2018a research on ceramic membrane applications in water treatment has attracted increasing attention due to their extreme stability ceramic membranes are favored for challenging water purification processes such as textile wastewater treatment oil water separations and pharmaceutical wastewater treatment samaei et al 2018 the ceramic materials primarily composed of alumina silica zirconia mullite and other oxide mixtures and are typically sintered into the ceramic membrane at high temperature with an asymmetric structure consisting of support layer intermediate layer and top layer though ceramic mf and uf membrane commercially available in markets have been extensively tested for industrial wastewater treatment on a laboratory scale or full scale zoubeik et al 2018 the large scale use in water treatment is limited due to their high capital costs to encourage larger scale application of ceramic membranes much effort has been devoted towards decreasing the fabrication cost such as using clay as the membrane material hubadillah et al 2018 further research on ceramic mf and uf membrane is required to develop cheaper fabrication processes and higher quality membranes for continuous operation nf membranes are gaining much attention and popularity in water treatment due to their low rejection of monovalent ions high rejection of divalent ions superior contaminant removal and low energy consumption mohammad et al 2015 recently several studies revealed that ceramic nf membranes have the potential for reducing the formation of chlorinated disinfection by products during the treatment of surface water sentana et al 2011 as well as dye purification chen et al 2017c removal of ions and small molecules shang et al 2017 and pharmaceuticals controlling chu et al 2017 in recent years ceramic membranes have gained increasing attention due to their advantageous behavior over traditional polymeric membranes such as stronger mechanical thermal and chemical stability higher fouling resistance and more extended membrane longevity moreover the wastage or retreatment of water is lower in ceramic membrane systems owing to the less frequent need for backwashing compared to polymeric membranes freeman and shorney darby 2011 inevitable membrane fouling that shorten the lifetime of membranes and increase operation cost inhibit the wide application of membrane technology zhao et al 2018a therefore extensive studies have reported membrane fouling mechanisms and fouling control strategies for the polymeric membranes to promote the application of membrane technology goh et al 2018 jiang et al 2017 ceramic membranes were reported to be less influenced by membrane fouling compared with polymeric counterparts due to membrane surface chemistry but the fundamental membrane fouling mechanism of ceramic mf and uf membranes needed to be further elucidated khemakhem and ben amar 2012 thibault et al 2017 zuriaga agusti et al 2014 advances in polymeric nf membranes have been well reviewed in the literature mohammad et al 2015 tul muntha et al 2017 van der bruggen et al 2008 have pointed out some critical challenges and objectives in nf research such as membrane fouling alleviation further treatment of concentrates improving insufficient removal of special pollutants stronger chemical resistance and increasing the lifetime of membranes ceramic nf membranes offer promising solutions for the aforementioned challenges due to their unique material properties currently ceramic nf membrane technologies are less developed than ceramic uf mf membrane technologies and are mostly studied at the laboratory scale or in small scale applications thus investigations on ceramic nf membranes are of paramount importance for the further application in water treatment materials developed recently for ceramic nf membranes typically include porous ceramics and various nanoparticle composites lee et al 2016a the incorporation of nanoparticles into membranes has the function of resolving two important challenges of membranes the selectivity permeability trade off and the fouling issues ike et al 2017 the use of nanoparticles in the ceramic membrane preparation produces membranes porous in the nf range as well fig 2 a furthermore ceramic membranes functionalized with catalytic nanomaterials have been reported to provide membranes with additional functions zhang et al 2018a such as disinfection pollutant degradation and self cleaning ciston et al 2008 goei and lim 2014a fig 2b pendergast and hoek 2011 have proposed that nanostructured ceramic membranes are in the near potential commercial viability with significant performance enhancements commercial viability relates to material cost scalability and compatibility with existing manufacturing infrastructure we present herein a brief review of the progress in porous ceramic membranes ceramic nanomaterials and their modifications catalytic ceramic membrane technologies and membrane fouling finally the review discusses the prospects in the research and development of ceramic membranes along with the associated limitations and challenges 2 ceramic nanocomposite membrane development 2 1 ceramic mf uf membrane some major marketed ceramic mf uf membrane products from various international companies are listed in table 1 lee et al 2015 xing 2017 among them asymmetric multichannel tubular ceramic membranes dominate over other membrane geometries flat sheet ceramic membranes are mostly configured in immersed units for industrialization which facilitate the replacement of the membrane elements and membrane cleaning through air sparging flat disc membranes find limited applications in laboratory due to their low packing density thus their configuration needs further design and improvement hollow fiber membranes present the highest packing densities the number of chinese suppliers of ceramic membranes has been increasing in recent years however there are only a few prominent companies such as jiangsu jiu wu hi tech co ltd sinoma advanced material co ltd guangzhou tao xin environmental technology co ltd and guochu technology co ltd due to the lack of large scale production capacity the mf membrane products produced by chinese companies in the flat sheet or tubular shape are comparable in quality and performance with those produced by international companies jiangsu jiu wu hi tech co ltd has the ability to manufacture fine uf ceramic membranes with pore sizes in the range of 3 10 nm for industrial applications xing 2017 common fabrication techniques of ceramic membranes include extrusion pressing slip casting tape casting sol gel phase inversion anodic oxidation and chemical vapor deposition cvd methods generally preparing a porous ceramic membrane mainly includes three steps the slurry preparation shaping and sintering process ishak et al 2017 the product obtained after the above three steps is a symmetrical membrane applied as a support layer the flat support layer is usually prepared using tape casting while the tubes and multi channel supports with complex structures are often extruded or sliped and then dip coating cvd method and sol gel method can be used to prepare a transition layer or separation layer on the support layer to form composite membranes currently ceramic hollow fiber membranes are fabricated by combined phase inversion sintering in asymmetric structure with unique finger like and sponge like structure chen et al 2018b high capital cost is the chief disadvantage for ceramic membranes compared with polymeric membranes but their gap is narrowing based on recent technical and commercial developments freeman and shorney darby 2011 some efforts towards decreasing the capital cost of ceramic membranes in recent markets have been made on one hand some companies optimize the design of membrane module to increase the package density for example ceramac system which was developed by pwn technologies with membranes supplied by metawater combines up to 190 ceramic membrane elements into one vessel to form a highly economical and compact module and hence greatly reduces the costs of the ceramic membrane system to be competitive with polymeric membranes zheng et al 2015 additional development in the ceramic membrane modules is high surface area monolith structure where individual ceramic segments are potted together by nanostone water inc kurth et al 2018 on the other hand low cost raw materials and fabrication methods for ceramic membrane were intensively studied for example a major breakthrough in cm product cm 151tm nanostone to reduce cost is the high speed extrusion and firing process ceramic mf uf membranes are widely used in harsh environmental applications such as oil water separation mining textiles petrochemicals pharmaceutical and biotechnology and food and beverages industry the earliest application of ceramic membrane metawater co ltd in water plants in japan has been continuously in operation for up to 20 years maintaining good operating performance without damage lee et al 2015 in recent years ceramic membranes have gained increasing attention in mild environmental applications such as drinking water and municipal wastewater sewage treatments with the decrease in capital costs in addition to the traditional advantages of ceramic membranes over polymeric membranes dilaver 2011 for example unlike many other ceramic membranes the ceramic product from nanostone is specifically designed for treating surface water ground water and secondary treated waste water effluent nanostone water membrane filtration of surface water through ceramic membranes has been proven to be very reliable for drinking water production studies on drinking water production with ceramic mf uf membrane focus on comprehensive process which includes adsorption by powdered activated carbon matsui et al 2009 coagulation konieczny et al 2009 li et al 2011 loi bruegger et al 2006 zhang et al 2014a ozonation alpatova et al 2013 fan et al 2014 or ultraviolet uv zhang et al 2015 removal of dissolved organic carbon doc haloacetic acid analogues haa and trihalomethane thm formation potential and brominated dbps upon treatment of surface water by suspended ion exchange six pwn technologies netherlands coagulation ceramic mf membranes metawater japan pore size 0 1 μm was higher than the existing conventional process in long term pilot scale test because ion exchange preferentially removed low molecular weight mw compounds and coagulation favored the high mw compounds thus decreasing irreversible ceramic membrane fouling rockey et al 2018 the ceramic membrane process cer senic itn nanovation applied in drinking water supply combines precipitation and ceramic filtration precipitation brings arsenic into a particulate form and then it can be separated from the water by ultrafiltration with cfm systems ceramic flat membranes itn nanovation ceramic mf uf units may also be used as a pre treatment step to ro processes for the seawater desalination a drinking water plant in saudi arabia has been under construction since 2017 with a treatment capacity of 110 000 m3 day via high tech ro pretreatment and a ceramic uf system cfm systems itn nanovation singapore s first ceramic membrane water treatment at choa chu kang waterworks also one of the largest ceramic membrane filtration plants for drinking water treatment with 1 8 105 m3 day capacity in the world begins operation in 2019 it adopted the ceramic membrane ceramac system combined with ozone biological activated carbon filters for advanced water treatment the applications of ceramic membranes in water reclamations were also evaluated such as removal of phacs pharmaceutically active compounds by fine uf membranes with the molecular weight cut off mwco ranging from 1 to 8 kda garcia ivars et al 2017 and removal of ms2 virus and decreasing n nitrosodimethylamine ndma formation potential dbps combined with ozonation and coagulation im et al 2018 ceramic mbr membrane bioreactor systems have been intensively investigated for applications in municipal wastewater sewage treatment anaerobic fluidized membrane bioreactor anmbr with al2o3 ceramic membrane has a low electrical energy requirement and has been successfully employed for the treatment of low strength municipal wastewater achieving an overall chemical oxygen demand cod removal of 93 aslam et al 2017 2018 the hydrophilic ceramic membrane in an anmbr with periodic cleaning showed higher flux compared to the hydrophobic polyvinylidenefluoride pvdf membrane without periodic cleaning a pilot study with cfm system meidensha corporation installed in a wastewater treatment plant in japan with a treatment capacity of 50 m3 day were continuously operated for 3 years meiden review series no 164 2015 no 2 13 the pilot study results indicated that the performance of ceramic mbr systems is highly competitive and advantageous compared with their polymeric counterparts for the wastewater treatment tolkou et al 2014 despite of high capital cost ceramic membrane systems in water treatment plants wtps are cost effective compared to polymeric mf uf membrane systems because ceramic membrane have lower operation and maintenance o m cost and twice longer life span than polymeric counterparts for example based on life cycle costs lcc of water expressed as water production cost per unit volume comparable price 0 28 usd and 0 274 usd was reported by park et al 2015 from the ceramic and polymeric membrane wtps respectively guerra and pellegrino 2013 also identified that alumina membrane was cost competitive with the pes membrane considering the membrane lifespan membrane material cost and labor requirements a techno economic model is constructed to better analyze the capital and operating costs of ceramic membrane plant as compared to the benchmark polymeric mf uf membrane plant wise et al 2014 the savings on membrane replacement costs and labor outweighs the small premium in capital and electrical costs resulting in lower cost in total 20 year present worth for ceramic membrane system wise et al 2017 the main cost savings of ceramic membrane is the membrane replacement costs therefore life cycle assessment lca should be utilized in the economic feasibility of ceramic membranes for application in wtps 2 2 nanotechnology based ceramic mf uf membrane mf uf membranes have been widely applied in water treatment but suffered from low removal efficiencies of small doms and micropollutants as well as fouling issues membrane performance depends primarily on membrane materials over the past decades nanotechnology has been rapidly developed from an academic research to variety of commercial products qu et al 2013b with these advances in nanotechnology numerous studies have focused on the incorporation of nanomaterials into mf uf membranes to improve membrane permeability selectivity and fouling alleviation nanomaterials applied in membrane technologies include hydrophilic nano al2o3 tio2 zeolite antimicrobial nano ag and cnts carbon nanotubes and catalytic nano mno2 fe2o3 and tio2 adding nanomaterials into the porous polymeric membrane and thin film composite membrane has been reviewed elsewhere kim and van der bruggen 2010 and this review focuses on the progress seen in nanotechnology based ceramic membranes zeolite membranes as one of inorganic membranes have been intensively studied and reviewed elsewhere bedard and liu 2018 zeolite membrane is competitive with polymeric membranes due to high water flux so that the required membrane area will be low kuzniatsova et al 2008 ceramic membranes are frequently used as a support to prepare zeolite membranes to increase structural stability the most widely reported studies are generally mfi type zeolite ceramic membrane which have been intensively used in desalination zhu et al 2014 2015 pervaporation zhang et al 2018b and gas separation zhong et al 2016 chemically stable ceramic membranes modified with zeolite thin film coatings have also been shown to obtain high selectivity as nf membranes while maintaining higher permeability due to the well defined pores in nano range many studies have tested the performance of zeolite ceramic membranes for ion removal from water for example lit and faujasite fau zeolite have been coated on low cost ceramic supports through a hydrothermal route to achieve about 80 bsa retention kumar et al 2017 vasanth et al 2017 similarly fau zeolite membranes developed by hydrothermal treatment achieved up to 82 cr vi removal from aqueous solutions through electrostatic interaction which in additionally showed no fouling propensity basumatary et al 2016 nano ag as a broad spectrum antibacterial agent has been widely incorporated into ceramic microfilters for bacterial disinfection a coat of nano ag with a stabilizing agent that prevents the aggregation of the nano ag onto anodic al2o3 support by lbl layer by layer has been explored and exhibited slightly higher rejection of dextran with 100 kda mw than commercial uf membranes kawada et al 2014 nevertheless there is a general lack of investigation about the nano ag leaching into water from ceramic surfaces free chlorine at acceptable levels in drinking water could rapidly release ag either as nano ag or ag from a sio2 surface bielefeldt et al 2013 thus the risks in the exposure of the ceramic membrane to chlorine should be carefully monitored to ensure drinking water safety tio2 has attracted much attention because of its hydrophilicity chemical stability antimicrobial efficiency and high photocatalytic activity many studies have been performed to modify the polymeric membrane surface with tio2 through dip coating physical vapor deposition chemical physical deposition grafting and atomic layer deposition to enhance the selectivity permeability fouling resistance and ability of self cleaning bet moushoul et al 2016 oun et al 2017 demonstrated that tio2 modification of mf ceramic decreased permeate flux to a typical level for uf membrane while it improved the removal of alizarin red dye to 99 the deposition of a tio2 layer by dip coating on a ceramic support affords an extremely high removal efficiency of anionic and cationic dyes under electrostatic interactions bouazizi et al 2017 carbon based nanomaterials adopted in membrane technology including graphene oxide go and cnts have gained much attention recently for their unique properties cnts have advantages of the inherent surface smoothness high specific surface area excellent mechanical properties remarkable water transportation ability and chemical affinity for anchoring additional moieties which has encouraged the increased exploration of nanocomposite membranes incorporated with cnts al gharabli et al 2018 the use of porous ceramics incorporated with cnts through chemical vapor deposition was reported for removal of cu2 from water through adsorption tofighy and mohammadi 2015 and for removal of tiny oil droplets from water chen et al 2012 go consisting of oxygen groups and carboxyl groups can minimize transport resistance and maximize flux due to its high hydrophilic functional groups li et al 2013 smith and freeman 2014 until now go modified polymeric membranes have been studied for improving the permeate flux selectivity and antifouling properties for water treatment jiang et al 2016 safarpour et al 2014 it is a challenge for maintaining the integrity of go membranes in long term operations and their stability can be improved with ceramic supports zhang et al 2019c go modified inorganic membranes have not been evaluated extensively but they are gaining increasing attention lately the modification of alumina ceramics has been recently reviewed and pointed that graphene derivatives have strong potential to serve as modified materials ishak et al 2017 the formation of a covalent bond between the cooh groups of go and oh groups of the al2o3 surface during heat treatment has been confirmed hu et al 2015 moreover the modified membrane presented higher flux and oil rejection than the unmodified membrane therefore the application of carbon based nanomaterials holds great potential for ceramic membrane modification and needs to be explored in greater detail in addition the use of nanomaterial composites has the potential for further enhancing the performance of the modified membranes for example cnt has the potential to enhance the uniformity and coverage of tio2 coatings on support layers yao et al 2008 higher permeate flux dye rejection and stronger antifouling property were found for rgo tio2 pes membranes compared to tio2 or go modified pes membranes kumar et al 2016 the incorporation of three types of nanoparticles into the rgo nanosheets through in situ growth led to enlarged nanochannels ordered laminar structures and chemical bond between nanoparticles and rgo resulting in excellent water flux solute rejections and good structure stability under high pressure and cross flow filtration for industrial application zhang et al 2017a li et al 2019 also found that tio2 go modified ceramic membranes combined the advantages tio2 and go leading to relatively high permeate flux and structure stability therefore further evaluating the use of nanoparticles in ceramic membrane modifications is essential though promising the developed novel modified ceramic membranes were mostly tested on a lab scale for a relatively short time duration which is far from practical applications thus further long term evaluations are necessary to provide realistic perspectives on their feasibility for future research and applications 2 3 ceramic nf membrane ceramic nf membrane technologies are less developed than ceramic uf mf membrane technologies the commercial availability of ceramic nf membranes is rather limited around the world summarized in table 2 the recent promotion for scaling up ceramic nf membrane preparation of successfully increasing the membrane area from 0 25 m2 elements to 1 3 m2 elements is a promising attempt to reduce the cost for large scale applications voigt et al 2019 ceramic nf membranes commonly have pore sizes of 1 2 nm corresponding to a mwco in the range from 200 to 1000 da however some producers also define fine uf 1 kda and 5 kda as nf as shown in table 2 the sol gel process is a common method for ceramic nf membrane preparation with the ceramic mf uf membranes as a substrate a variety of metal oxides including gamma alumina γ al2o3 silica sio2 zirconia zro2 titania tio2 and their complexes were selected as the separation layer of nf membranes summarized in table 3 among them tio2 ceramic nf membrane one kind of non toxic and inexpensive material has been commercially available from inopor germany qi et al 2013 the first ceramic nf membrane in water treatment with an mwco of 450 da was made using tio2 via a polymeric sol gel method puhlfürß et al 2000 γ al2o3 presented inadequate chemical stability under severe conditions sio2 ceramic membranes are hydrothermally unstable due to the dissolution of silica into water at high temperature puthai et al 2016a while zro2 showed better stability than other materials as well as higher costs composite ceramic nf membranes such as sio2 zro2 pb tio2 and tio2 zro2 have been proposed and investigated to achieve better performance than the pure metal oxides guo et al 2018 of which the tio2 zro2 composite nf membranes have been commercially available due to their enhanced performance mazzoni et al 2009 sol gel methods suffer from the disadvantages of increased time and energy consumption complex operational challenges and not easy to be dense and having defects hence more advanced fabrication methods need to be explored and industrialized in addition the use of nanoparticles in ceramic membrane fabrication provides more opportunities for obtaining membranes with nano scale pore sizes than the above mentioned porous ceramic nf membranes via conventional sintering of ceramics summarized in table 4 fig 3 compared the membrane permeability and the mwco for reported ceramic nf membranes made from various materials and methods it is evident that the water permeability of commercial polymeric nf membranes is higher than commercial ceramic nf membranes high porosity narrow pore size distribution and thin membrane thickness lead to increased membrane permeability ceramic membranes are better than polymeric membranes due to their narrow pore size distribution and higher porosity koyuncu et al 2015 thus the major difference in permeate flux between the polymeric and ceramic membrane with similar mwco is attributed to the higher thickness of ceramic membranes especially thick intermediate layer therefore fabricating techniques in thin layers need to be improved in addition reported porosities of commercially ceramic nf membranes range from 30 to 40 which could be further enhanced the porosity mainly depends on the sintering process in general higher sintering temperature cause higher mechanical strength but lower porosity of the final membrane lee et al 2015 sacrificial pore formers such as organics polymer beads organic fibers starch cellulose and cotton and inorganic components nickel carbon and graphite could be used in the ceramic slurry to increase the membrane porosity nishihora et al 2018 in addition ceramic nf membranes prepared by conventional sol gel processes mostly exhibit relatively higher mwco while tight ceramic nf membranes are obtained from other nanomaterial modification methods such as cvd and ald tio2 is a promising material for tight ceramic nf membrane fabrication with relatively higher water permeability compared with other commonly studied materials higher permeability was observed for the tio2 modified membrane compared to the sol gel counterparts with similar mwco inhomogeneous deposition a thick intermediate layer and repetitive coating contribute to the decreased permeability go based ceramic nf membranes could present lower mwco but higher permeability needs to be achieved tio2 go nanocomposites combining the advantages of tio2 and go might be an alternative to achieving ceramic nf membranes with high permeate flux and low mwco which have been widely studied in photocatalytic membranes but less evaluated for nanofiltration the influential factors for ceramic nf membrane fabrication have been intensively studied while their performance has been scarcely evaluated it has been proposed that ceramic nf membranes are more suitable for the separation of nacl and na2so4 from dye solutions due to high dye rejection 90 and a low nacl 20 and na2so4 40 rejection than two commercial polymeric nf membranes chen et al 2017c another study elucidated the removal mechanisms governing phacs using four types of commercially available ceramic nf membranes and suggested that electrostatic interactions were more dominant than hydrophobic interactions due to higher hydrophilicity and lower densities of cooh and oh groups on the ceramic surface compared to the polymeric counterparts zhao et al 2018b but it is only applicable when phacs were spiked in deionised water hydrophobic interactions and adsorption made a major role when real wastewater effluent was used to form fouling layer garcia ivars et al 2017 therefore the further research on mechanism governing the separation and fouling processes of ceramic nf membrane or fine uf membranes in real water treatment is needed 2 4 ceramic photo catalytic membrane ceramic membranes fabricated with catalytic nanomaterials afford membranes with multiple functions such as degradation of pollutants and self cleaning qu et al 2013a in the past decades catalytic ceramic membranes have been intensively integrated with advanced oxidation processes aops such as photocatalysis athanasekou et al 2012 ozonation zhu et al 2011 peroxymonosulfate pms wu et al 2019a h2o2 and fenton reaction sun et al 2018b which can present synergistic effects for degradation of recalcitrant compounds membrane fouling mitigation disinfection and disinfection by product formation potential control polymeric membranes are vulnerable to oxidation by oh radical attacks thus ceramic membranes are more favorable compared with polymeric counterparts particularly in a catalyzed process due to their chemical resistance tio2 is the most widely investigated photocatalyst due to its relatively low band gap energy relatively high quantum yield chemical stability and low cost iglesias et al 2016a which allow its activation by near visible light tio2 can produce reactive oxygen species ros such as superoxide radical anions o2 and ho under irradiation which are reported to present effective degradation of pollutants katal et al 2018 and disinfection of extensive varieties of organisms zuo et al 2015 suspended tio2 suffers from the disadvantages of time consuming processes and costly post treatment currently numerous studies on immobilizing tio2 photocatalysts with membranes have been evaluated to address catalyst separation and recovery problems enhance the residence time for pollutant degradation and promote process intensification for water treatment iglesias et al 2016b leong et al 2014 paredes et al 2019 have successfully prepared and employed tio2 immobilized polyvinylidenefluoride pvdf membranes for the degradation of eight different pharmaceuticals in groundwater and secondary wastewater effluents ceramic membranes are more attractive for use as photocatalyst supports due to their robust nature against chemical attack than polymeric membranes it has been experimentally proven that tio2 layers led to a higher and more stable flux of ceramic membrane under uv light through enhanced membrane wettability mendret et al 2013 the publications since 2014 on tio2 ceramic composite membrane fabrication for photocatalytic processes through dip coating chemical vapor deposition cvd and atmospheric plasma spraying have been reviewed leong et al 2014 magnetron sputtering was also reported to be suitable for producing high fineness and well adhered coatings on membranes tio2 was immobilized on a ceramic nf membrane surface through magnetron sputtering to form uniformly distributed nanostructured columns sanches et al 2017 fig 4 the sputtering conditions were optimized for the effective photocatalytic rate of the pesticides a comparison between the water permeability and mb degradation of tio2 modified ceramic membranes using lbl and plasma enhanced cvd techniques has been reported starr et al 2016 both methods had no impact on the permeability of modified membranes while the lbl coated membranes have a higher removal efficiency of mb than plasma enhanced cvd coated membranes as the catalytic efficiency of p25 was higher than that of plasma enhanced cvd generated catalyst it is noteworthy that the membrane permeate side modifications shown in fig 5 showed the advantages of higher photocatalytic activity and independent separation layer and catalysis layer ayral 2019 the fabrication of tio2 modified ceramic membranes via different dip coating routes were studied and it was proposed that the substrates had an influence on the uniformity and smoothness of tio2 coating which ensures the self cleaning efficiency of tio2 modification after exposure to uv light alias et al 2018 however tio2 has the disadvantages of low efficiency and narrow light response range the development of visible light active photocatalysis is of paramount importance for developing practical applications of photocatalytic membrane processes a radical solution to improve photocatalytic activity is to combine tio2 with other materials with a higher adsorption capacity such as sio2 hap hydroxyapatite and carbonaceous nanomaterials to accelerate the pollutant adsorption onto the membrane surface zhang et al 2014b an alternate strategy is to dope metals rtimi et al 2019 or non metals leary and westwood 2011 with typical favorable properties into tio2 matrix most studies focused on the use of ag for enhancing the photocatalytic properties of tio2 due to its ability to improve electron hole separation interfacial charge transfer and anti microbial properties wang et al 2013 the nanocomposites of go tio2 have attracted intensive attention in photocatalytic applications due to their large surface area and the abundant oxygen containing functional groups of go for anchoring tio2 to decrease nanocomposite aggregation pastrana martinez et al 2015 xu et al 2016 diamantopoulou et al 2019 have demonstrated that go deposition reduces mesoporosity of the tio2 and increases its surface functionality affording increased pollutant adsorption the go tio2 composite was synthesized by a variety of methods such as in situ growth solution mixing hydrothermal and liquid phase deposition lpd methods in previous studies the reported go tio2 based photocatalytic membranes are mainly porous polymeric supported membranes gao et al 2014 xu et al 2016 for example the go tio2 pvdf membrane showed enhanced degradation efficiency and antifouling property than membranes functionalized with tio2 and go respectively however the limited mechanical strength thermal and chemical stability of these polymeric substrates remains a major challenge for broader application of go tio2 based membranes few reports on coating go tio2 nanocomposites on the ceramic membranes have been published to study the performance of the photocatalytic membrane athanasekou et al 2014 2015 which opens up new possibilities for the development of photocatalytic materials recent studies focusing on photocatalytic ceramic membranes functionalized with tio2 composite nanomaterials in hybrid membrane technologies for pollutant removal and disinfection are summarized in table 5 tio2 mediated disinfection has recently emerged as an alternative to chlorination and uv disinfection due to its strong oxidizing power no harmful and toxic disinfection by products formation long term photostability and low cost xiang et al 2012 tio2 sio2 and tio2 sio2 au coatings were reported to efficiently inactivate gram negative escherichia coli and total coliforms and gram positive bacteria enterococci under natural solar radiation a promising result for drinking water disinfection levchuk et al 2018 the inactivation mechanisms and influencing factors of tio2 based photocatalysts for disinfection of various microorganism types have been comprehensively reviewed laxma reddy et al 2017 uyguner demirel et al 2018 tio2 modified ro membranes exhibited photobactericidal properties leading to mitigation of biofouling under uv exposure miller et al 2017 recent studies have also discussed the application of tio2 based photocatalysts on ceramic surfaces for disinfection upon exposure to uv summarized in table 5 the concentration of the e coli and the lamp power had a significant effect on the e coli removal efficiency but the temperature had a limited effect on the removal of e coli from water using tio2 incorporated ceramic disk filters he et al 2018 goei and lim 2014a have proposed the possible anti microbial mechanisms of ag tio2 modified ceramic membranes for a photocatalytic membrane reactor pmr experiment including direct uv disinfection membrane rejection and ag ag and tio2 disinfection while significant improvements in the photocatalytic membrane technology have been achieved drawbacks such as poor pore size porosity control lack of effective dispersion of the catalyst particles loss of photo activity technical difficulties in irradiating the membrane surface deactivation and wash out of catalytic nanoparticles and controlling liquid residence time in the reactor need to be addressed metal oxides can promote the decomposition of ozone a commonly used oxidant for water treatment and generate hydroxyl ho or other radicals ceramic catalytic membranes were most widely coated by manganese or iron oxide nanoparticles in hybrid ozonation ceramic membrane filtration systems ceramic membrane functionalized with catalytic nanomaterials exhibited about 30 40 higher removal of doc disinfection and ozonation by products than the conventional membrane combined with ozonation karnik et al 2005a 2005b davies et al 2010 demonstrated that the use of fe2o3 coated membranes through layer by layer achieved over 85 removal of toc and reduced the formation of dbps significantly and eliminated 99 of bacteria and tio2 is less effective than mno2 and fe2o3 for the catalytic ozonation process the catalytic ozonation reaction of iron oxide nanoparticle incorporated ceramic membrane enhanced the decomposition of natural organic matter nom efficiently by generating hydroxyl radicals and hence reduced the flux decline park et al 2012 moreover the nom characterization results demonstrated that this hybrid ceramic membrane process led to effective removal of relatively high contents of aromatic humic acid and high molecular weight and hydrophobic nom fractions due to the preferential oxidation of electron rich moieties including carbon carbon double bonds and aromatic compounds the performance of the mno2 coated membrane was better than other membranes tested indicated by the lowest fouling the highest removal of toc and improved removal of trihalomethanes thms and haloacetic acid analogues haas precursors byun et al 2011 thus ozonation in ceramic catalytic systems has the advantage of controlling the formation of dbp over chlorination in drinking water treatment through reducing dbp precursors lee et al 2019 pointed that ceramic membrane impregnated with ceox throughout the membrane porous structure could effectively degrade micropollutants with less o3 consumption due to reduced mass transfer in pores that act as microreactors wang et al 2017 calculated the specific energy consumption of mno2 coated ceramic membrane ozonation system under different ozone dosing rates and operation modes and showed that the minimum energy consumption to treat 1000 l of water from lake lansing was calculated to be 0 97 kwh subsequently based on these laboratory data a life cycle assessment was conducted to compare the energy consumption and environmental impacts of the ozonation ceramic catalytic system with a conventional polymeric hollow fiber membrane and a chlorine disinfection system used for surface water treatment on an industrial scale wang et al 2019 in conclusion the ceramic catalytic membrane system had a lower environmental impact regardless of higher energy consumption and is a promising alternative for utilization in water supply with advancing technologies for saving the energy needed for ozone generation in addition heterogeneous catalysts for fenton like reactions such as fe3o4 fe2o3 α feooh and β feooh have been combined with membranes with the addition of h2o2 for the treatment of highly polluted wastewaters zhang et al 2019a 2020 catalytic ceramic membranes in hybrid membrane aop system were summarized in table 6 in summary the use of catalyst loaded ceramic membranes combined with ozone or uv and other strong oxidants afford higher contaminant removal lower fouling propensity and open up self cleaning possibilities tang et al 2017a uv irradiation combined with ceramic membranes have advantages of green chemistry concept but suffer from high cost of uv light source and complex device design ozonation have advantages of ozone dose controllable and strong design compatibility but ozone oxidation byproduct the fenton like process have advantages of environmentally benign reagents high degradation efficiency and mild operation conditions among the aop technologies but high synthesis costs of heterogeneous fenton catalysts zhang et al 2019b ceramic catalytic membranes were employed for coupling catalysis with the separation process in a single step which reduced the process complexity and resulted in a higher efficiency in water purification while these results are promising further studies are still needed for efficient scale up of these applications in such a reactor striking a balance between the catalytic activity and mass transfer under hydrodynamic conditions still remains an important challenge in addition the intermediate organic degradation products need to be retained by membranes molinari et al 2017 thus the preparation of catalytic membrane systems should be considered with suitable pore size distribution and uniform dispersion of the catalysts in addition until now most reported studies on hybrid ceramic membranes have focused on membrane fouling mitigation and the removal of typical organic matter but less attention has been devoted to the removal of organic micropollutants which is an emerging challenge in water treatment 3 membrane fouling in the ceramic membrane processes despite the remarkable membrane improvements achieved the wider application of membrane technology is still limited by the inevitable membrane fouling issues which result in poor water quality and high operating and maintenance costs the major drawbacks of polymeric membranes are their propensity to fouling as well as its susceptibility to chlorine ceramic membranes have a chlorine resistant property which could maintain their antibacterial function following chlorination procedures meanwhile ceramic membranes were reported to have a less fouling propensity and irreversible fouling than polymeric membranes lee and kim 2014 muric et al 2014 hofs et al 2011 compared the fouling behavior of four different ceramic membranes tio2 zro2 al2o3 and sic with one polymeric membrane using surface water ceramic membranes were found to exhibit higher removal of nom and uv254 and lower degree of fouling and irreversible fouling than the polymeric membrane summarized in table 7 the fouling characteristics of ceramic membranes were analyzed first using filtration models which have been applied to polymeric membranes and it indicated that these models built on cake filtration could also be utilized to simulate nom fouling of ceramic membrane fig 6 a lee et al 2013 ceramic membranes are more hydrophilic than polymeric membranes due to the different surface functional groups which led to weaker interaction of the foulants and membranes fig 6b in addition to their low fouling propensity cleaning methods that are more aggressive without influencing membrane longevity can be applied to reduce cleaning time and remove irreversible foulants for ceramic membranes additional investigations are necessary to get a better understanding of the detailed fouling mechanisms and cleaning strategies of ceramic membranes 3 1 fouling behavior in water treatment nom is a major organic constituent in surface and groundwater and causes severe fouling in membrane filtration the critical role of nom in membrane fouling has been widely studied albeit most studies were limited to polymeric membranes al amoudi 2010 kim and dempsey 2013 numerous studies have focused on investigating the factors influencing membrane fouling in ceramic membrane filtration such as membrane properties and feed water chemistry chen et al 2006 de angelis et al 2013 the effect of ph ca2 concentration and ionic strength in feed water on the nom fouling is similar but the degree of change is different between ceramic and polymeric membranes lee and kim 2014 ceramic membranes demonstrated improved efficiency in physical and chemical cleaning along with reduced nom fouling when compared to polymeric membranes a stronger influence of ph on fouling was also observed for ceramic membranes it is noteworthy that the effect of calcium ions on the decline in flux during nom fouling a challenging issue for practical membrane applications was much lower with ceramic membranes in addition irreversible fouling of ceramic membranes caused by various types of feed solutions was negligible lee et al 2013 in a similar finding alresheedi et al 2019 a much higher hydraulic reversibility and higher nom removal were realized with the ceramic uf than the polymeric uf these results are noteworthy as the adverse effects of calcium ion by severe irreversible fouling were found for polymeric membranes which deteriorated the process efficiency upon long term operation thus ceramic membranes are advantageous for applications in surface water treatment compared to polymeric membranes a systematic study describing the influence of inorganic ions on dom fouling of tio2 ceramic nf membranes was first reported by mustafa et al 2016b in this study membrane fouling was determined by the whole of the membrane surface chemistry rather than the sole membrane hydrophilicity the irreversible fouling of ceramic nf membranes caused by sodium alginate was higher than polymeric nf membranes mainly resulting from much lower content of cooh groups on the ceramic membrane surface shown in fig 6b zhao et al 2018b additionally ceramic membranes were applied in mbrs for domestic or industrial wastewater treatment where membrane fouling inevitably occurs anaerobic ceramic membrane bioreactor achieved higher water flux higher organic removal and lower membrane fouling than with the application of polymeric membranes though a high concentration of biomass was rejected the membrane fouling mitigation was mainly attributed to the superhydrophilic surface of the al2o3 ceramic membranes which decreased hydrophobic attraction of membrane foulants jeong et al 2018 the ceramic membrane with the roughest surface and biggest pore size applied in the mbr membrane bioreactor exhibited the severest fouling degree and suggested that membrane surface properties played a major role in membrane fouling jin et al 2010 similar results were found yue et al 2015 where harsh fouling was observed in larger pore sized ceramic membranes in anaerobic membrane bioreactor which was attributed to pore blocking by proteins membrane fouling can potentially influence rejection behavior phosphate retention by tight ceramic uf membranes after nom and effluent organic matter efom fouling with ca2 was decreased due to electrostatic interaction and cake enhanced concentration and a relatively higher phosphate rejection for efom fouling was due to additional adsorption of the biopolymers than nom fouling shang et al 2014 garcia ivars et al 2017 evaluated the performance of ceramic membranes with mwco in the range of 1 8 kda for removing ten selected phacs from wastewater effluents and determined that membrane fouling improved the retention through increasing adsorption and electrostatic repulsion between anionic compounds and the negatively charged membrane surface in recent years the impact of organic fouling on the retention of organic micropollutants by polymeric membranes has been extensively studied chang et al 2012 mahlangu et al 2014 sadmani et al 2014 which has led to either an improvement in micropollutant rejection due to an enhanced surface charge and micropollutant dom association or a reduction in rejection due to cake layer enhanced concentration polarization however the mechanisms governing the impact of organic fouling on membrane selectivity especially the micropollutant removal by a ceramic membrane has not yet been systematically investigated it is well documented that biofouling is the most harmful and is the most challenging to control li et al 2016 as the critical step in biofilm formation attachment of microbial cells onto membrane surface gets the most attention which is reported to be affected by membrane surface properties terada et al 2012 solution chemistry and bacterial properties ramsey and whiteley 2004 further review of publications on bacterial adhesion and biofouling in nf ro membrane systems can be found elsewhere gutman et al 2012 habimana et al 2014 recently only a few studies focusing on biofouling issues in ceramic membrane processes were reported for example a comparison of bacterial adhesion on three ceramic uf membranes with different photo catalysts that included various ratios of anatase phase to rutile phase was reported ciston et al 2008 they demonstrated that the use of photocatalysts could weaken bacterial adhesion and viability on ceramic membranes and may prevent flux decline blanpain avet et al 2011 investigated the mechanism associated with bacillus cereus spore adhesion to a tubular ceramic microfiltration membrane and found that the permeation drag force was shown to primarily control the cell membrane adhesion however the biofilm formation process the microbial community on the ceramic membrane and the mechanisms governing the biofouling effects were not adequately known for the filtrations using ceramic membranes the physicochemical properties of ceramic membrane surfaces including hydrophobicity zeta potential membrane roughness and chemical composition were different from those of polymeric membranes and thus the initial bacterial attachment onto the ceramic membrane surface and subsequent biofilm growth deserve further investigation 3 2 fouling prevention and mitigation many fouling control approaches such as pretreatment membrane cleaning membrane module design and surface modification asadollahi et al 2017 goh et al 2018 have been attempted past studies on polymeric membranes suggest that the antifouling properties of membranes are primarily determined by the membrane surface properties consequently the number of studies describing the surface modification of polymeric membranes in order to minimize membrane fouling has significantly increased meng et al 2014 ni et al 2014 different materials and techniques for the preparation of antifouling membranes have recently been reviewed in the literature kang and cao 2012 miller et al 2017 a complete review of the physical and chemical surface modifications of polyamide ro membranes has been conducted asadollahi et al 2017 chemical modification achieved by covalent bonding presents better chemical and structural stabilities for long term operations than physical modification however studies on the surface modification of ceramic membranes have received less attention as discussed previously the nanocomposite ceramic membranes and nanomaterials were primarily coated onto the ceramic membrane surface through dip coating and vacuum filtration to increase fouling resistance chemical modification has been reported less in comparison to physical modification due to the limited availability of modification approaches in the earlier decades alumina anopore membranes was graphed with poly ethylene glycol to improve surface hydrophilicity to reduce fouling yeu et al 2009 antifouling grafting techniques on ceramic membranes were recently developed mustafa et al 2014 2018 the membranes grafted with methyl groups using the grignard technique were reported to have low fouling sensitivity as compared to the pristine membranes while treating challenging wastewater mustafa et al 2016a lee et al 2016b grafted organosilanes onto alumina ceramic membranes via a silanization process for improving the antifouling properties the chemical grafting of inorganic substrates with organic materials retained the desirable advantages of both ceramic membranes and organic membranes therefore organic modifier materials need to be further developed for ceramic membrane modification furthermore the addition of antimicrobial nanomaterials into membranes could provide membranes with biofouling mitigation functions in multiple pathways such as releasing toxic ions ag damaging cell membranes by direct contact cnts and go or generating reactive oxygen species tio2 and fullerol qu et al 2013b meanwhile it is noteworthy that any modifications carried out to obtain antifouling ceramic membranes should not sacrifice the permeate flux and solute retention capacity in addition to membrane modifications hybrid ceramic membrane processes such as ceramic membranes combined with oxidation adsorption coagulation and filtration are also effective strategies for minimizing membrane fouling by removal of foulants and their precursors for example ferrate pretreatment was shown to effectively mitigate membrane fouling by changing the fouling mechanism from intermediate standard blocking to cake intermediate blocking liu et al 2018 ferrous iron peroxymonosulfate fe ii pms oxidation was utilized as a pretreatment method for ceramic ultrafiltration process cheng et al 2017a the effective reduction of organic loadings by coagulation with in situ formed fe iii reduced the membrane fouling caused by humic acid sodium alginate bovine serum albumin and their mixture in addition atrazine degradation was efficient due to the oxidation by sulfate and hydroxyl radicals whereas coagulation was ineffective in removing it the use of sulfate radical based oxidations fe ii pms uv pms and uv fe ii pms as ceramic uf membrane pretreatments effectively reduced the deposition of high mw biopolymers on membrane surfaces through decomposition of high mw biopolymers 20 000 da into low mw humic substances 1000 20 000 da cheng et al 2018 zhang et al 2015 made a comparative study about uv h2o2 and coagulation with aluminum chlorohydrate as a pretreatment for ceramic mf membrane for mitigating the fouling caused by soluble algal organic matter uv h2o2 pretreatment caused greater irreversible membrane fouling than coagulation due to the generation of small substances with lower mw from the oxidation of the larger substances but afforded higher microcystin removal recently tio2 uv photocatalytic treatment combined with ceramic membrane filtration was studied szymański et al 2016 this pretreatment changed the fouling potential of organics in the secondary effluent and caused lower flux decline compared to ceramic membrane filtration alone song et al 2018b tio2 uv pretreatment was reported to cause a significant decrease in cake filtration coefficients and a minor reduction in pore blocking coefficients with increasing uv tio2 treatment time which indicated tio2 uv pretreatment had a minor impact on irreversible fouling mitigation but mostly improved the reversible fouling alleviation yang et al 2019 many successful studies were recently examined to understand the effects of combining ceramic membrane filtration with ozonation for mitigating membrane fouling in both lab scale biscardi and duranceau 2016 kim et al 2008 szymanska et al 2014 zhang et al 2013 zouboulis et al 2014 and pilot scale study zhang et al 2016 for water and wastewater treatment pwn technologies have reported the impact of various pretreatment methods on ceramic membrane fouling for pilot studies in different locations such as coagulation and clarification ion exchange and the combination of ion exchange and in line coagulation and concluded that ozone led to a better operation though sometimes it was not cost effective galjaard et al 2011 zheng et al 2015 low ozone dosage was found to slightly mitigate membrane protein fouling while relatively high ozone dosage caused severe membrane fouling for pre ozonation at 10 mg l and for in situ ozonation at 4 and 10 mg l respectively song et al 2018a tang et al 2017b thus appropriate ozonation dosage should be evaluated in the hybrid ceramic membrane process tang et al 2019 also found that in situ ozonation increased phosphorus removal in ceramic mbr system in addition to membrane fouling alleviation owing to the enhanced abundance of phosphate accumulating bacteria in activated sludge the fouling layer was loosened by ozone and then easily washed off from the membrane surface zheng et al 2015 combining ozonation with catalytic tio2 in the ceramic uf membrane systems exhibited higher flux recovery after humic acid ha fouling and higher removal of doc and uv254 than using ozonation alone chen et al 2017a ozonation and uv h2o2 were found to reduce the concentration of nom with higher mw but did not substantially affect the low mw organics mw molecular weight in the raw water winter et al 2016 though the predominant fouling mechanism was kept unchanged for different oxidation and membrane mwco the fouling resistance was influenced through changing mw distribution of the foulants on membrane surface therefore it was proposed that the oxidation could not efficiently mitigate membrane fouling for lower mwco membranes as previously discussed when the ceramic membrane surface was coated with catalytic nanomaterials membrane fouling was reduced to a larger extent by oxidation in hybrid ceramic membrane process many cleaning processes are performed periodically to recover as much of the initial flux as possible after fouling physical cleaning normally achieved by backwashing can only recover the water flux decline caused by reversible fouling chemical cleaning is necessary to remove irreversible fouling when water flux has decreased to 40 50 of the initial flux lee et al 2015 soaking in naoh solution widely used for ceramic membrane cleaning could not remove all foulants from the membranes thus more aggressive procedures are required for cleaning fouled ceramic membranes hofs et al 2011 recently many studies have been directed towards chemically enhanced backwash ceb and cleaning in place cip procedures for ceramic membrane fouling control which is unsuitable for polymeric membranes under high concentration of chemicals because ceramic membranes can endure aggressive cleaning agents without membrane damage as listed in table 7 cip cleaning with a higher concentration of chemicals longer time and higher temperature reduces the irreversible fouling and offers reliable performance over long term operation the choice of cleaning agents chiefly depends on the foulant analysis it is well known that acids are commonly used to treat inorganic fouling and alkalis are used to treat organic fouling mei et al 2017 proposed an effective fouling control method in anaerobic ceramic membrane bioreactors ancmbrs using naoh enhanced backwash cleaning and it was found that 12 mmol l of naoh was the economical and optimal dosage yue et al 2018 utilized the naclo assisted backwashing to mitigate membrane fouling in ancmbrs by removing the foulants from membrane surfaces and influencing the nature of mixed liquor however a high concentration of naclo induced cell lysis from the diffusion of ocl into the cells leading to severe fouling the use of naclo was also reported to induce the release of soluble microbial products smp and extracellular polymeric substances eps via biomass decay and has a negative impact on membrane fouling control kimura and uchida 2019 thus the optimal chemical concentration in ceb cleaning should be evaluated and proposed in the investigation on line chemical cleaning with ozone was also attempted in a ceramic mbr system as the high ozone concentration led to a lower concentration of biopolymers with mw greater than 10 kda they were quickly rejected and formed fouling layers on the surface by the ceramic membranes sun et al 2018a a similar study using backwashing with ozonated water 2 mg o3 l for a few minutes effectively removed the cake layer on the ceramic mf membrane surface for sewer mining fujioka and nghiem 2015 in addition ultrasonic fields and minute electric field can be used to assist in cleaning membranes chen et al 2006 dong et al 2018 more environmentally friendly and effective membrane cleaning methods should be further explored for reliable long term operation lee et al 2015 4 conclusions and future perspectives this review aims at discussing the current state of the art in ceramic membranes namely ceramic nf membranes ceramic nanocomposite membranes ceramic catalytic membranes and membrane fouling the advantages of ceramic membranes and ceramic nanocomposite membranes in hybrid systems for water treatment are summarized in fig 7 hybrid ceramic ceramic nanocomposite membrane systems with uv or o3 based catalytic reactor coagulation or ro membrane have the advantages of self cleaning fouling mitigation pollutants degradation disinfection and dbps control the application of ceramic membranes in hybrid system was reported to have less fouling propensity lower irreversible fouling lower environmental impact lower energy consumption of manufacturing and backwashing higher flux loner lifetime and higher cleaning efficiency compared with using polymeric counterparts these advantageous properties offer excellent prospects for applications of ceramic membranes in mild water treatment conditions 1 ceramic mf and uf membranes that are commercially available in markets have been widely applied in industrial applications further research is required for the development of ceramic mf and uf membranes for improving ease of fabrication high packing density and lower costs while continuously maintaining high quality membranes for applications in drinking water wastewater treatment at large scales in addition extensive research on the fabrication and evaluation of ceramic nf membranes are also necessary the sol gel process was the commonly used method for preparation of ceramic nf membranes new methods such as ald cvd hydrothermal treatment and ldl should be explored and optimized for preparation of ceramic nf membranes to expand the applications of ceramic nf technology to industrial manufacturing and large scale applications a comprehensive study of the separation mechanism fouling processes and cleaning strategies of ceramic nf membranes are imperative 2 nanotechnology based ceramic membranes open up new possibilities for expanding ceramic membrane applications by overcoming the limitations of conventional materials though the information on nanomaterials for ceramic modification provided here is not exhaustive significant strategies for the preparation of ceramic nf membranes and catalytic ceramic membranes have been fundamentally dealt with the studies on tio2 based modifications strongly support the use of tio2 based nanocomposites as effective alternatives for fabricating photocatalytic membranes for water decontamination considering their well known practical applications in water treatment however most nanotechnology based ceramic membranes prepared on small disk supports and tested in dead end filtration do not meet the requirements for practical applications the performance of novel ceramic membranes needs evaluation through filtrating both synthetic wastewater and real wastewater for long term operations for commercial implementation 3 investigations into the integration of oxidation processes and ceramic membranes for replacement of conventional water treatment processes have attracted growing interest and have been proven highly reliable for drinking water production the incorporation of nanocomposites into ceramic membrane renders the integrated systems more effective for membrane fouling mitigation one step design and catalysis recovery the energy consumption and environmental impacts of the novel hybrid systems should be compared with existing conventional technologies in life cycle assessment 4 the catalytic ceramic membrane process works more effectively for removal of dyes but the studies on the integration of the process for degradation of dissolved organic matter micro pollutants and microorganisms are limited further studies should focus on investigating visible solar light active photocatalysts intermediate products of organic pollutants in the catalytic process and the disinfection mechanism to promote the application of catalytic ceramic membranes in the industry challenges is the design of the membrane reactor configuration especially for the photocatalytic membranes where the exposure of membrane surface to the uv irradiation and extension of hydraulic retention time in the reactor needs optimization the permeate side of membranes modified by catalysis has advantages of higher photocatalytic activity and independent separation layer and catalysis layer 5 lower fouling propensity and irreversible fouling were found for ceramic membranes because of the decreased interaction of the foulant in more hydrophilic ceramic surfaces compared to polymeric membranes further research in depth is necessary to understand the effects of surface properties of ceramic membranes on membrane fouling degree and analysis of foulants which will allow the selection of the appropriate cleaning strategy for reliable and long term operation furthermore efficient solutions to the biofouling issues faced in the ceramic membrane filtration need to be explored declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial
