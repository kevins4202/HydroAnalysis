10010,agricultural ammonia nh3 emissions significantly reduce nitrogen n use efficiency nue and adversely affect environmental quality there is thus much interest in mitigating nh3 emissions through appropriate n fertilizer and water management in winter wheat a two year field study was conducted to quantify the recovery of 15n labelled n fertilizer and to investigate the nh3 flux grain yield yield scaled nh3 emissions nues and water use efficiency wue among different n application rates 0 120 240 and 360 kg n ha 1 abbreviated as n0 n120 n240 and n360 respectively under rain fed and supplemental irrigation condition the peak daily nh3 emissions reached 2 8 das after basal n fertilizer application and the fluxes decreased to relatively low levels thereafter most nh3 volatilization 90 occurred within one month after sowing the maximum accumulative nh3 emission was 66 kg n ha 1 in n360 which was increased by 104 2 fold and 12 fold compared with n240 n120 and n0 respectively averaged across water regimes and experimental years the nh3 emission factor of n360 was significantly increased by 43 and 77 compared with the other two n application rates n120 and n240 under rain fed and supplemental irrigation regimes respectively water regimes did not have a significant effect on nh3 fluxes or nh3 emission factors grain yield wue and yield scaled nh3 emissions generally increased with increasing n application rate and the highest values were achieved under n120 or n240 regardless of the water regimes all nue traits were reduced and the 15n residue in the soil profiles increased with increasing n application rates under both water regimes the results suggested that high nh3 emissions were the major reason for inferior nue which was further confirmed by the 15n stable isotope overall the medium n rate 120 240 kg n ha 1 is the optimal rate for achieving a high yield of 8 t ha 1 as further increases in n rates fail to produce significantly higher yield and even increase nh3 emissions lead to the deterioration of wue and nue and cause serious environmental costs graphical abstract ga1 keywords 15n labelled urea ammonia emission environmental pollution water use efficiency crop productivity 1 introduction china is the largest user of chemical nitrogen n fertilizers and consumes approximately 27 of global n fertilizer ifastat 2021 the use of n fertilizer has contributed to the rapid increase in wheat production and improved food security wu and ma 2015 shah and wu 2019 however the nitrogen use efficiency nue in wheat plants is relatively low 20 30 ju et al 2007 wu and ma 2015 low nue is attributed to a large n loss via nitrate leaching n2o emissions and ammonia nh3 volatilization beusen et al 2008 li et al 2020 nh3 volatilization in particular accounts for at least 25 of the total n applied ni et al 2014 pan et al 2016 xu et al 2018 the high percentage of nh3 losses not only leads to resource waste but also causes environmental impacts such as soil acidification water eutrophication and aerosol pm2 5 formation in the atmosphere liu et al 2017 xu et al 2018 degaspari et al 2020 nh3 pollution from farmland represents a high environmental cost to society for these reasons there is an urgent need to mitigate agricultural nh3 volatilization to avoid further damage to agriculture ecosystems and human health further study of crop management such as appropriate n fertilizer and water management to reduce nh3 loss in wheat fields is essential for achieving the efficient and clean production of wheat han et al 2014 li et al 2015 liu et al 2017 degaspari et al 2020 recent studies indicate that global nh3 emissions from chemical n fertilizer have increased dramatically from 2 to 17 tg n per year between 1961 and 2010 xu et al 2018 the nh3 emission factor is the major approach for quantifying nh3 volatilization from n fertilizer use this emission factor represents the percentage of applied n fertilizer emitting nh3 which depends on the type and amount of chemical n fertilizer applied beusen et al 2008 he et al 2018 nh3 volatilization usually shows a linear response as a function of the typical n application rate and an exponential increase when the n application rate is higher than the crop demand snyder et al 2009 pan et al 2016 many previous studies have evaluated the nh3 emission factor ni et al 2014 li et al 2015 he et al 2018 the most widely used emission factor of 10 was included in the ipcc intergovernmental panel on climate change tier 1 guidelines a higher emission factor of 14 21 has been reported in other studies beusen et al 2008 xu et al 2018 the n supply is the major limiting factor affecting wheat yield and high yielding wheat requires high n input fan et al 2010 liu et al 2018 meanwhile n deficiency leads to substantial yield reduction and serious n depletion in soil ju et al 2015 pareja sánchez et al 2020 however an excessive n application rate may shift the balance between vegetative and reproductive crop growth towards excessive vegetative development thereby delaying plant maturation and reducing crop yields wu and ma 2015 liu et al 2018 guo et al 2021 it may also lead to low nue and severe environmental risks such as soil degeneration nitrate leaching nh3 volatilization and n2o emissions snyder et al 2009 li et al 2020 there is thus a need to develop effective n fertilizer strategies to better synchronize n supply and demand to support crop productivity while minimizing environmental impacts räbiger et al 2020 degaspari et al 2020 yang et al 2020b appropriate n application rates as well as the timing of n application are the most critical components of n fertilizer management han et al 2014 wu et al 2019 which could enhance nues crop yield and producer profitability and reduce nh3 emissions by aiding the match between crop n demand and soil supply ju et al 2015 degaspari et al 2020 wheat production in dry semihumid areas is also limited by shortages in water resources which have become increasingly scarce because of dramatic increases in population size and global climate change li et al 2019 previous studies have reported that limited supplemental irrigation can increase wheat yield and wue in semihumid areas li et al 2017 however the current performance of irrigation practices in farmland is extremely low shah and wu 2019 it is because that local farmers tend to use the conventional over irrigation system for maximizing grain yield which results in a larger amount of irrigational water consumption and lower wue li et al 2017 limited supplemental irrigation regime have shown great potential for increasing wue and reducing n losses because they affect soil moisture soil microbes and enzymatic activity which in turn regulate nh3 emissions and n mineralization han et al 2014 jing et al 2020 optimizing irrigation management under limited supplemental irrigation regime to decrease the use of irrigation water as much as possible is thus essential as even a small amount of water saved can be used for other purposes wu and ma 2015 cai et al 2020 combined n and water deficit studies have suggested that wheat yield and nue are more sensitive to combined stresses than either single factor alone which implies that strategies for optimizing wheat growth should ensure that both n and water resources are equally available guo et al 2014 pareja sánchez et al 2020 in contrast both excessive n application and high irrigation regimes could enable nitrate leaching into deeper soil layers resulting in high residual n or even pollution of shallow groundwater guo et al 2014 li et al 2020 therefore appropriate use of n management and irrigation regimes are considered promising approaches for simultaneously reducing nh3 volatilization and increasing nue and grain yield li et al 2017 2019 however few studies have been conducted to simultaneously evaluate the comprehensive impact of n fertilizer management and irrigation regimes on nh3 volatilization nue and residual n in winter wheat cropping seasons n fertilizer management and irrigation regimes are two basic management practices for wheat production however excessive n application and inappropriate water management can lead to serious environmental pollution including increases in n losses through nh3 volatilization n denitrification nitrate leaching and runoff snyder et al 2009 zhang et al 2012 liu et al 2017 thus their procedures must be adjusted in a coordinated manner to ensure that nh3 emissions are reduced and nue wue and grain yield are increased we hypothesized that limited supplemental irrigation regime and optimized n application rates could maximize nutrient supply resource use efficiency and wheat yield while minimizing environmental burden here we conducted a two year field study using stable isotope 15n traced fertilizer to 1 quantify the recovery of 15n labelled n fertilizer in wheat plants and the residual 15n in soil 2 investigate nh3 volatilization and its emission factor and 3 evaluate the grain yield wue and yield scaled nh3 emissions between different n application rates and water management regimes including supplemental irrigation and rain fed in addition to shedding light on the feasibility with which nh3 emissions can be alleviated this study outlines a strategy for rational n application and water management practices in winter wheat cropping systems to achieve economic and environmental sustainability in the irrigated regions of dry semi humid areas 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site description two year field experiments were carried out in the 2014 2015 and 2015 2016 winter wheat seasons in the crop specimen area of northwest a f university altitude 520 m 34 20 n 108 24 e in shaanxi province china the experimental station is a typical dry semi humid area located in the guanzhong plain of northwest china the daily air temperature and rainfall during the two winter wheat seasons are illustrated in fig 1 the annual precipitation in the first and second years was 235 and 175 mm respectively at the beginning of the field experiment the soil type was loamy clay and the 0 20 cm soil layers contained 12 9 g kg 1 organic matter 7 42 mg kg 1 olsen p 197 mg kg 1 available k 0 84 g kg 1 total nitrogen 0 69 g kg 1 total phosphorus and 14 7 g kg 1 total potassium with a ph of 8 1 2 2 experimental design and field management the field experiment was laid out using a split plot arrangement based in a randomized complete block design with four n application rates 0 120 240 and 360 kg n ha 1 abbreviated as n0 n120 n240 and n360 respectively and two water regimes including rain fed and supplemental irrigation treatment si there were three replicates for each treatment the irrigation management scheme of the si plot followed the previous irrigation procedure of wang 2017 in which irrigational water was applied when the water content of the topsoil layer was below targeted 70 field capacity with assistance of the dynamic change in soil moisture within the 0 40 cm soil layers considering the drought event at wintering stage would seriously aggravate the freeze injury drought event at jointing stages substantially impair biomass production spike number and final yield performance supplemental irrigation was only considered at those two critical stages li et al 2017 wang et al 2017 li et al 2019 the amount of supplemental irrigation asi involved with the targeted soil moisture mentioned above and the targeted wetting soil depth 0 40 cm which was calculated using the following formula 1 a s i d ρ θ targeted θ i where d cm is the targeted wetting soil depth 0 40 cm p g cm 3 is the soil bulk density of targeted soil layer θtargeted mg g 1 is the targeted soil water content and θi mg g 1 is the soil water content of targeted soil layer before irrigation irrigational water flowed onto the si plots through our previously described irrigation pipe system without sprinkler fitted to a flow metre to measure the amount of water applied jing et al 2020 in both years si plots received the totally irrigation rate of 60 mm 30 mm at wintering stage plus 30 mm at jointing stage and no irrigation was performed under rain fed plots n fertilizer urea was split applied artificially at 0 and 180 days after sowing das in both seasons and the n splitting patterns were 60 and 40 respectively the basal fertilizers including phosphorus 25 kg p ha 1 as calcium superphosphate and potassium 30 kg k ha 1 as potassium chloride were broadcast and incorporated into the topsoil by rotary tillage from one day before sowing each plot was 3 m long and 4 m wide a 0 8 m wide space between adjacent plots was kept to avoid the possible influences of water and n seepage the wheat cultivar xinong979 was sown by hand at a seeding rate of 150 kg ha 1 in october and harvested in june in both years agronomic management such as insecticide and herbicide application followed the best locally recommended practice 2 3 plant sampling and measurements 2 3 1 ammonia volatilization flux nh4 n and no3 n concentrations and soil moisture soil ammonia volatilization flux was determined by the ventilation method yang et al 2020a two phosphoglycerol soaked sponges 3 cm thickness 15 cm diameter were placed in a pvc pipe 15 cm height and 15 cm inner diameter once the basal n fertilizer was applied the ammonia volatilized from soil was trapped by phosphoglycerol and the nh3 flux measurements were recorded daily for one week and were then monitored at an interval of 3 days until no ammonia was detected the samples collected in the sponges were immediately extracted with 300 ml of kcl solution 1 mol l 1 in a 500 ml container the solution was shaken for 1 h and the concentrations of nh4 n were recorded using a continuous segmented flow analyser aa3 hr autoanalyzer seal analytical inc mequon wisconsin usa the nh3 flux kg n ha 1 d 1 was calculated using the following formula 2 ammonia flux a area d 10 2 where a mg is the amount of ammonia collected by the phosphoglycerol soaked sponges area m2 is the cross sectional area of the pvc pipe d is the interval of ammonia collection total ammonia volatilization was the sum of the trapped ammonia volatilized during the entire measured period the nh3 emission factor ef was calculated as 3 ef nh 3 volatilization in n treated plot nh 3 volatilization in zero n plot n s u p p l y along with the ammonia volatilization measurements soil samples from the topsoil 0 20 cm were taken until the ammonia volatilization measurement ended soil nh4 n and no3 n concentrations were then extracted by 2 0 m kcl solution for 1 h on a rotary shaker and measured using a colorimetric method in an aa3 continuous flow analyser the dynamic change of soil water content at soil depths of 0 20 cm and 20 40 cm under all plots was measured by drying the soil to a constant weight 2 3 2 grain yield yield components n accumulation and n use efficiency at physiological maturity grain yields were determined by artificially harvesting the central plot area of 2 m2 and were reported at a standard moisture content of 0 12 g h2o g 1 fresh weight the plants from a 0 5 m2 area in two rows in the centre of each plot were sampled after counting the total spike number for the determination of the spike number per m2 the plant samples were divided into leaves stems and spikes the spikes were hand threshed the grain number per spike and grain weight mg were determined after oven drying at 70 c to a constant weight the aboveground total biomass was then weighted the tissue n concentration of each tissue component was determined by the kjeldahl method li et al 2017 all tissue samples were passed through a 100 mesh sieve to measure the n concentration whole n accumulation was recorded as the sum of the n contents of all plant sections the n agronomic efficiency nae kg kg 1 n recovery efficiency nre n physiological efficiency npe kg kg 1 n and partial factor productivity of applied n pfp kg kg 1 were calculated as follows 4 nae grain yield in n

was calculated as follows 8 yield scaled nh 3 emissions total nh 3 volatilization grian yield before sowing and after harvesting the soil water content to a depth of 200 cm with an increment of 20 cm in each plot was measured by drying the soil at 105 c to a constant weight total soil water storage sws mm from 0 to 200 cm was calculated as follows 9 sws i 1 n ρ i θ i h i where n is the number of soil layers ρ i g cm 3 is the soil bulk density θ i g g 1 is the gravimetric water content and h i mm is the soil layer thickness in soil layer i evapotranspiration et for the whole crop growing

to harvesting stage i mm is the total irrigation amount deep percolation and runoff were not considered because of the good water holding capacity of soil in this experimental field li et al 2019 the wue kg ha 1 mm 1 was determined as the grain yield kg ha 1 divided by et mm 2 3 3 the labelled 15n fertilizer implemented in microplots and stable isotopic analysis in each plot a microplot 0 4 m by 0 5 m surrounded by a pvc frame was built the frame was placed 40 cm deep into the soil layer to prevent surface runoff and lateral contamination 15n labelled urea with an abundance of 10 18 which was provided by shanghai research institute of chemical industry china was applied to the microplots at the same n rate as the subplot treatment and at the same time all management practices on the microplots were the same as on the corresponding subplots the fertilizer 15n recovery efficiency 15nre in plants from the microplots at maturity was calculated by the method of liu et al 2015 15n derived from fertilizer 15ndff in plants and in soil kg n ha 1 and 15nre was calculated as follows 11 15 ndff in plant n uptake in plant 15 n atom in the plant 15 n atom in fertilizer 12 15 ndff in soil n uptake in soil 15 n atom in the soil 15 n atom in fertilizer 13 15 nre 15 n d f f i n p l a n t n s u p p l y 100 the 15n concentrations of all samples were determined by isotope ratio mass spectrometry mat253 thermo scientific usa and the 15n atom excesses were corrected for a background abundance of 0 3663 cabrera and kissel 1989 2 4 statistical analyses data was subjected to analysis of variance for each year sas institute 2003 to evaluate the effects of water regimes n application rates and their interactions on all measured parameters means among treatments were compared based on the least significant difference test lsd0 05 the relationships between ammonia volatilization flux nh4 n concentration and soil water content in both years were evaluated with the reg procedure of

indirect impacts of n application rates and irrigation regimes on nh3 volatilization nue wue and grain yield in r version 4 0 0 r core team 2020 using the lavaan package rosseel 2012 the sem was created based on the following hypothesis 1 increasing n application rates could increase the nh3 emission factor and then enhance total nh3 volatilization 2 increasing n application rates could greatly reduce nue 3 irrigation could increase yield components and grain yield and 4 increasing n application rates could increase yield components and grain yield the sem fitness was evaluated on

and bayesian information criterion bic schermelleh engel et al 2003 kline 2005 3 results 3 1 ammonia emissions nh4 n and no3 n concentrations and soil moisture maximum nh3 fluxes were at 6 and 2 das under n360 regardless of water regime in both years fig 2 the nh3 fluxes of all plots then reduced to relatively low levels 3 kg n ha 1 d 1 within one week nh3 emissions were low after 35 and 25 das in the first and second experimental years until the top dressing n fertilizer was applied cumulative nh3 volatilization increased with increasing n application rates under both water regimes fig 3 the total nh3 emissions of n360 were 92 8 and 40 1 kg n ha 1 in the first and second experimental years respectively which increased by 97 133 and 447 in the first year and 110 263 and 19 fold in the second year compared with n240 n120 and n0 respectively the nh3 emission factor of n360 was significantly increased by 57 and 77 compared with n240 under rain fed and si in the first year in the second year the nh3 emission factors of n360 were significantly increased by 29 and 77 compared with those of n120 under rain fed and si treatments water regimes did not show a consistent effect on nh3 fluxes total nh3 volatilization or the nh3 emission factor nh4 n and no3 n concentrations in the 0 20 cm and 20 40 cm soil layers in both years are shown in figs 4 and 5 nh4 n and no3 n concentrations were both higher in the 0 20 cm soil layer than in the 20 40 cm soil layer nh4 peaked at appropriately 8 das in the 0 20 cm soil layer and at 15 das in the 20 40 cm soil layer and then gradually decreased a second peak appeared when top dressing n fertilizer was applied in both years no3 reached its maximum value at 8 das and gradually declined in the first year in the second year it peaked at almost 2 and 15 das in the 0 20 cm and 20 40 soil layers respectively nh4 n and no3 n concentrations both increased with increasing n application rates water regimes did not have a significant effect on nh4 n and no3 n concentrations n application rates and water regimes did not have a consistent effect on the soil water content for either soil layer in either year fig 6 the soil water content showed a positive relationship with the nh3 flux under both soil layers in the first years fig 7 moreover nh3 flux showed significant and positive relationships with nh4 n concentrations in both soil layers 3 2 grain yield wue and yield scaled nh3 emissions in both years grain yield increased significantly when n rates increased from 0 to 240 kg n ha 1 further increases in the n application rate higher than 240 kg n ha 1 did not result in a positive yield response table 1 the highest grain yields were always achieved under n240 in si conditions i e 8 7 and 6 7 t ha 1 in the first and second years respectively the grain yield under irrigation conditions was significantly increased by 21 2 compared with that under rain fed conditions in the second year a higher grain yield was associated with greater aboveground biomass production spike number and grain number per spike in both years aboveground biomass production spike number and grain number per spike increased with increasing n application rates however grain weight was reduced under high n rates both water regimes and n application rates had significant effects on et and wue table 1 the si treatment significantly increased et by 16 and 57 compared with the rain fed treatment averaged across four n application rates over two years the wue and yield scaled nh3 emissions increased with increasing n application rate and their highest values were mostly achieved under n240 in the rain fed treatment 3 3 n use efficiency and n residue in soil pfp and nae were significantly reduced with increasing n application rates under both si and rain fed treatments in both years table 2 for example the pfp and nae under n360 were reduced by 68 and 73 in the first year and 65 and 62 in the second year respectively compared with pfp and nae under n120 averaged across the two water regimes in the second year the nre and npe were greatly reduced by 68 and 49 under n240 compared with nre and npe under n120 averaged across the two water regimes nre was significantly reduced by 67 under n360 compared with n120 in the second year water regime did not have a significant effect on pfp nre npe or nae in the first year however pfp and nae were 24 and 47 higher in the irrigation plot than in the rain fed plot in the second year the 15ndff in the plants greatly increased with increasing n application rate under both si and rain fed treatments in both years table 2 the 15ndff in the plants under n360 increased by 155 and 11 compared with that under n120 averaged across the two water regimes in both years similar to nre 15nre based on the labelled 15n stable isotopic method was significantly reduced by 15 and 63 under n240 compared with n120 averaged across the two water regimes in the two years in general the nre ranging from 10 5 to 67 2 with a mean value of 34 averaged across two years was close to the 15nre ranging from 9 6 to 57 6 with a mean value of 28 averaged across two years fig 8 shows the 15n residue from in season fertilization in different soil layers in the second year the 15n residue was mostly reserved in the top 0 40 cm soil layer the 15n residue in the soil profile increased with increasing n application rate in both rain fed and si plots a significant difference in 15n residue was not observed between the two water regimes 3 4 pearson correlation and structural equation model sem most of the nue traits such as pfp nre npe nae 15ndff and 15nre showed positive correlations with wue and negative correlations with nh3 emissions nh3 emission factors and 15n residues fig 9 grain yield showed strong correlations with wue 15ndff 15nre nh3 emissions and several yield components such as spike number per m2 grain number per spike grain weight and biomass production the sem model showed that increased n rates resulted in higher nh3 emission factors and nh3 volatilization and directly reduced nue with greater factor loadings of 0 67 0 64 and 1 15 p 0 01 fig 10 in addition irrigation practices combined with appropriate n rates significantly increased yield related traits and grain yield and wue with high factor loadings of 0 46 0 98 and 0 54 p 0 01 respectively overall the data fit the hypothetical model well as indicated by χ2 df and other selection criteria 4 discussion 4 1 ammonia flux and its emission factor ammonia volatilization from farmland depends on compounding factors such as edaphic factor i e soil texture ph cation exchange capacity soil moisture and aeration agronomic managements i e fertilizer rate and sources application method organic amendments tillage system and irrigation regimes and climatic characteristics especially the rainfall and air temperature han et al 2014 liu et al 2017 degaspari et al 2020 li et al 2021 in this study a high n application rate tends to enhance nh3 volatilization and emission factors because part of the n from in season n application cannot be taken up by wheat plants especially for basal n fertilizer liu et al 2017 tian et al 2018 li et al 2021 the nh3 emission factor was increased up to 60 when the n application rate was increased to a high n application rate of 360 kg n ha 1 a similar result was also reported in ni et al 2014 who reported nh3 emission factor of 8 4 in winter wheat these results suggest that reducing the n application rate is an effective way to reduce nh3 emissions for wheat plants given that the total nh3 volatilization was reduced greatly by 61 5 under n120 compared with the highest n rate in this study similarly mariano et al 2012 found nh3 loss proportion of 16 in urea n applied at 50 kg n ha 1 and the proportion increased to appropriately 24 as n application rates increased to 200 kg n ha 1 degaspari et al 2020 also reported that nh3 losses increased from 11 to 16 when the n application rates increased from 60 to 180 kg n ha 1 n fertilizer applied to dry soil resulted in lower nh3 emissions as it could remain unhydrolysed in the soil for several weeks ni et al 2014 mira et al 2017 yang et al 2020b however si failed to increase nh3 emissions in this study although these practices can improve soil moisture at specific stages this could be partly explained by the fact that irrigational water could effectively wash urea to the deep soil when executing the irrigation procedure which reduced nh3 volatilization and increased nitrate n leaching from urea applied ju et al 2007 han et al 2014 other environmental factors such as soil ph soil temperature and soil texture have been reported to have strong effects on nh3 emissions mariano et al 2012 pan et al 2016 xu et al 2018 the variation in nh3 volatilization during the two experimental years could be explained by the different climate conditions especially the soil moisture and rainfall patterns at the timing of fertilizer application beusen et al 2008 li et al 2015 mariano et al 2012 compared to in the second year favourable soil moisture in the first year led to higher nh3 fluxes following the application of n fertilizer increasing precipitation in the second year 10 days after basal n fertilization application promotes nh3 fluxes thereafter compared with the first year in both years a shortage of precipitation and dry soil conditions in the late growth stage resulted in low nh3 fluxes this speculation was further supported by the consistent and close relationships between nh3 volatilization fluxes and inorganic n contents such as nh4 n and soil moisture fig 7 the dynamic changes in nh3 volatilization in the present study were consistent with previous studies which reported that the peak in daily nh3 emissions reached 2 8 das after basal n fertilizer application and then the fluxes declined to relatively low levels thereafter fig 2 he et al 2018 yang et al 2020a furthermore this study suggested that most nh3 volatilization 90 was emitted during the vegetative stage i e the first month after sowing even when top dressing fertilizer was applied at the joint stage the nh3 fluxes were relatively low and could be ignored wan et al 2021 this could be explained by the significant imbalance between higher n inputs and slower n uptake by wheat plants at the sowing stage ju et al 2007 liu et al 2018 4 2 wue nue and labelled 15n use efficiency the nues in crop production system could be calculated by a wide range of methods present study employed two mostly accepted methods including the subtraction method with elimination of unfertilized plot and enriched 15n stable isotope methods liu et al 2015 tian et al 2018 the low n application rate significantly increased most nue traits including pfp nre npe and nae the stable isotope 15n trace technique further suggested that the higher nue under the low n rate mainly stemmed from the lower 15n residue in the soil fig 8 and higher 15nre which ranged from 9 6 to 57 6 in this study table 2 the lower nue and inferior 15nre under the high n rate mainly stemmed from the unbalanced synchronization between the n demand of wheat plants and the soil n supply which eventually resulted in considerable n loss through nh3 volatilization denitrification nitrate leaching and runoff pan et al 2016 xu et al 2018 li et al 2020 guo et al 2021 in addition to the n application rate other options such as delayed top dressing n in the late stage or the use of slow release urea could help to match the n demand of plants with the soil supply to reduce nh3 volatilization improve nue and improve in season 15n use efficiency tian et al 2018 wu et al 2019 yang et al 2020b urease inhibitors that are known to retard urease activity and reduce the rate of nh4 release from urea provide plants with a greater opportunity to absorb more n thereby dropping nh3 emission and increasing nue simultaneously mira et al 2017 ni et al 2014 yang et al 2020a nh3 emissions following urea application from wheat fields are an essential pathway for n losses compared with other pathways such as n leaching and denitrification which are considered the major reasons for inferior nue mariano et al 2012 xu et al 2018 li et al 2020 this was further confirmed by the significant negative relationships between nh3 volatilization and nre and 15ndff as shown in the pearson correlation analysis fig 9 of this study this is consistent with the results of previous studies li et al 2021 ti et al 2020 additionally plants with high nue generally have superior root systems stronger nitrification capability and larger aboveground n accumulation that potentially favour n assimilation and in turn mitigate nh3 emissions fan et al 2010 enhancing wue has been a major focus of research which can be achieved by increasing grain yields and reducing et simultaneously li et al 2019 wue was generally higher under rain fed than under si conditions because of the increasing soil et coefficient table 1 and non beneficial soil evaporation in the latter li et al 2019 cai et al 2020 n application rates did not have a consistent effect on et but significantly increased grain yields under medium n rates of 120 240 kg n ha 1 therefore wue was usually higher under the medium n application rate than under the other n application rates further increasing the n rate to more than 240 kg n ha 1 deteriorated the wue because of increasing et or decreasing grain yield 4 3 improving grain yield with less environmental impact the highest attainable grain yield of more than 8 t ha 1 was generally achieved under the medium n application rate of 120 240 kg n ha 1 and further increasing the n application rate to 360 kg n ha 1 failed to produce a higher yield and even reduce the yield performance it was mainly because that the medium n application rate increased spikes number and biomass production compared with the zero n and highest n application rates while have did not have a negative influence on grain number per spike and grain weight other similar studies in china have suggested that n application rates ranging from 70 to 180 kg n ha 1 could be sufficient for achieving a maximum yield of approximately 8 t ha 1 ju et al 2007 li et al 2017 an excessive n supply stemming from the carryover effect of inorganic n fertilizer and strong n mineralization in farmer fields might be the main reasons for this invalid yield response to n doses liu et al 2018 degaspari et al 2020 pareja sánchez et al 2020 however local farmers at the experimental site currently apply over 300 kg n ha 1 according to our recent local survey which has major environmental impacts ju et al 2007 li et al 2019 2020 reducing the current n fertilizer rate in farmlands is thus critically important in wet year of 2014 15 supplemental irrigation was not necessary for increasing grain yield because there may be sufficient water available for wheat plants than is actually needed li et al 2019 but in dry year of 2015 16 supplemental irrigation significantly improved grain yield because of increasing biomass production compared with rain fed treatment it implied that irrigation regime needs to be arranged according to the local climate characteristics especially annual precipitation when assessing the feasibility of management options such as n application rates and water regimes in intensive agricultural systems comprehensive consideration of their effects on the environment pollution and crop yield is essential he et al 2018 zhang et al 2020 the yield scaled nh3 emissions based on the nh3 emissions per unit of grain production are a valuable indicator for balancing yield performance and environmental impact pittelkow et al 2014 he et al 2018 this study highlights that reducing the n application rate in combination with rain fed practices could be used to increase grain yield and resource use efficiency for n and water and reduce yield scaled nh3 emissions overall 120 240 kg n ha 1 in combination with rain fed practices is the optimal approach that should be implemented by local producers in dry years supplemental irrigation is used to alleviate drought stress and increase yield performance and economic return li et al 2019 5 conclusions the maximum accumulative nh3 emission was 66 kg n ha 1 which was observed in n360 and was increased by 104 2 fold and 12 fold compared with n240 n120 and n0 respectively averaged across water regimes and experimental years grain yield wue and yield scaled nh3 emissions increased with increasing n application rate and their highest values were observed under n120 or n240 regardless of the water regimes these results indicate that high nh3 emissions are the major reason for the inferior nue which was further confirmed by the 15n stable isotope overall this study suggests that the medium n rate of 120 240 kg n ha 1 can produce a high yield of 8 t ha 1 further increases in n rates failed to produce a significantly higher yield and even increased nh3 emissions led to a deterioration wue and nue and caused serious environmental pollution supplemental irrigation could be employed to alleviate drought stress in dry year declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they

10010,agricultural ammonia nh3 emissions significantly reduce nitrogen n use efficiency nue and adversely affect environmental quality there is thus much interest in mitigating nh3 emissions through appropriate n fertilizer and water management in winter wheat a two year field study was conducted to quantify the recovery of 15n labelled n fertilizer and to investigate the nh3 flux grain yield yield scaled nh3 emissions nues and water use efficiency wue among different n application rates 0 120 240 and 360 kg n ha 1 abbreviated as n0 n120 n240 and n360 respectively under rain fed and supplemental irrigation condition the peak daily nh3 emissions reached 2 8 das after basal n fertilizer application and the fluxes decreased to relatively low levels thereafter most nh3 volatilization 90 occurred within one month after sowing the maximum accumulative nh3 emission was 66 kg n ha 1 in n360 which was increased by 104 2 fold and 12 fold compared with n240 n120 and n0 respectively averaged across water regimes and experimental years the nh3 emission factor of n360 was significantly increased by 43 and 77 compared with the other two n application rates n120 and n240 under rain fed and supplemental irrigation regimes respectively water regimes did not have a significant effect on nh3 fluxes or nh3 emission factors grain yield wue and yield scaled nh3 emissions generally increased with increasing n application rate and the highest values were achieved under n120 or n240 regardless of the water regimes all nue traits were reduced and the 15n residue in the soil profiles increased with increasing n application rates under both water regimes the results suggested that high nh3 emissions were the major reason for inferior nue which was further confirmed by the 15n stable isotope overall the medium n rate 120 240 kg n ha 1 is the optimal rate for achieving a high yield of 8 t ha 1 as further increases in n rates fail to produce significantly higher yield and even increase nh3 emissions lead to the deterioration of wue and nue and cause serious environmental costs graphical abstract ga1 keywords 15n labelled urea ammonia emission environmental pollution water use efficiency crop productivity 1 introduction china is the largest user of chemical nitrogen n fertilizers and consumes approximately 27 of global n fertilizer ifastat 2021 the use of n fertilizer has contributed to the rapid increase in wheat production and improved food security wu and ma 2015 shah and wu 2019 however the nitrogen use efficiency nue in wheat plants is relatively low 20 30 ju et al 2007 wu and ma 2015 low nue is attributed to a large n loss via nitrate leaching n2o emissions and ammonia nh3 volatilization beusen et al 2008 li et al 2020 nh3 volatilization in particular accounts for at least 25 of the total n applied ni et al 2014 pan et al 2016 xu et al 2018 the high percentage of nh3 losses not only leads to resource waste but also causes environmental impacts such as soil acidification water eutrophication and aerosol pm2 5 formation in the atmosphere liu et al 2017 xu et al 2018 degaspari et al 2020 nh3 pollution from farmland represents a high environmental cost to society for these reasons there is an urgent need to mitigate agricultural nh3 volatilization to avoid further damage to agriculture ecosystems and human health further study of crop management such as appropriate n fertilizer and water management to reduce nh3 loss in wheat fields is essential for achieving the efficient and clean production of wheat han et al 2014 li et al 2015 liu et al 2017 degaspari et al 2020 recent studies indicate that global nh3 emissions from chemical n fertilizer have increased dramatically from 2 to 17 tg n per year between 1961 and 2010 xu et al 2018 the nh3 emission factor is the major approach for quantifying nh3 volatilization from n fertilizer use this emission factor represents the percentage of applied n fertilizer emitting nh3 which depends on the type and amount of chemical n fertilizer applied beusen et al 2008 he et al 2018 nh3 volatilization usually shows a linear response as a function of the typical n application rate and an exponential increase when the n application rate is higher than the crop demand snyder et al 2009 pan et al 2016 many previous studies have evaluated the nh3 emission factor ni et al 2014 li et al 2015 he et al 2018 the most widely used emission factor of 10 was included in the ipcc intergovernmental panel on climate change tier 1 guidelines a higher emission factor of 14 21 has been reported in other studies beusen et al 2008 xu et al 2018 the n supply is the major limiting factor affecting wheat yield and high yielding wheat requires high n input fan et al 2010 liu et al 2018 meanwhile n deficiency leads to substantial yield reduction and serious n depletion in soil ju et al 2015 pareja sánchez et al 2020 however an excessive n application rate may shift the balance between vegetative and reproductive crop growth towards excessive vegetative development thereby delaying plant maturation and reducing crop yields wu and ma 2015 liu et al 2018 guo et al 2021 it may also lead to low nue and severe environmental risks such as soil degeneration nitrate leaching nh3 volatilization and n2o emissions snyder et al 2009 li et al 2020 there is thus a need to develop effective n fertilizer strategies to better synchronize n supply and demand to support crop productivity while minimizing environmental impacts räbiger et al 2020 degaspari et al 2020 yang et al 2020b appropriate n application rates as well as the timing of n application are the most critical components of n fertilizer management han et al 2014 wu et al 2019 which could enhance nues crop yield and producer profitability and reduce nh3 emissions by aiding the match between crop n demand and soil supply ju et al 2015 degaspari et al 2020 wheat production in dry semihumid areas is also limited by shortages in water resources which have become increasingly scarce because of dramatic increases in population size and global climate change li et al 2019 previous studies have reported that limited supplemental irrigation can increase wheat yield and wue in semihumid areas li et al 2017 however the current performance of irrigation practices in farmland is extremely low shah and wu 2019 it is because that local farmers tend to use the conventional over irrigation system for maximizing grain yield which results in a larger amount of irrigational water consumption and lower wue li et al 2017 limited supplemental irrigation regime have shown great potential for increasing wue and reducing n losses because they affect soil moisture soil microbes and enzymatic activity which in turn regulate nh3 emissions and n mineralization han et al 2014 jing et al 2020 optimizing irrigation management under limited supplemental irrigation regime to decrease the use of irrigation water as much as possible is thus essential as even a small amount of water saved can be used for other purposes wu and ma 2015 cai et al 2020 combined n and water deficit studies have suggested that wheat yield and nue are more sensitive to combined stresses than either single factor alone which implies that strategies for optimizing wheat growth should ensure that both n and water resources are equally available guo et al 2014 pareja sánchez et al 2020 in contrast both excessive n application and high irrigation regimes could enable nitrate leaching into deeper soil layers resulting in high residual n or even pollution of shallow groundwater guo et al 2014 li et al 2020 therefore appropriate use of n management and irrigation regimes are considered promising approaches for simultaneously reducing nh3 volatilization and increasing nue and grain yield li et al 2017 2019 however few studies have been conducted to simultaneously evaluate the comprehensive impact of n fertilizer management and irrigation regimes on nh3 volatilization nue and residual n in winter wheat cropping seasons n fertilizer management and irrigation regimes are two basic management practices for wheat production however excessive n application and inappropriate water management can lead to serious environmental pollution including increases in n losses through nh3 volatilization n denitrification nitrate leaching and runoff snyder et al 2009 zhang et al 2012 liu et al 2017 thus their procedures must be adjusted in a coordinated manner to ensure that nh3 emissions are reduced and nue wue and grain yield are increased we hypothesized that limited supplemental irrigation regime and optimized n application rates could maximize nutrient supply resource use efficiency and wheat yield while minimizing environmental burden here we conducted a two year field study using stable isotope 15n traced fertilizer to 1 quantify the recovery of 15n labelled n fertilizer in wheat plants and the residual 15n in soil 2 investigate nh3 volatilization and its emission factor and 3 evaluate the grain yield wue and yield scaled nh3 emissions between different n application rates and water management regimes including supplemental irrigation and rain fed in addition to shedding light on the feasibility with which nh3 emissions can be alleviated this study outlines a strategy for rational n application and water management practices in winter wheat cropping systems to achieve economic and environmental sustainability in the irrigated regions of dry semi humid areas 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site description two year field experiments were carried out in the 2014 2015 and 2015 2016 winter wheat seasons in the crop specimen area of northwest a f university altitude 520 m 34 20 n 108 24 e in shaanxi province china the experimental station is a typical dry semi humid area located in the guanzhong plain of northwest china the daily air temperature and rainfall during the two winter wheat seasons are illustrated in fig 1 the annual precipitation in the first and second years was 235 and 175 mm respectively at the beginning of the field experiment the soil type was loamy clay and the 0 20 cm soil layers contained 12 9 g kg 1 organic matter 7 42 mg kg 1 olsen p 197 mg kg 1 available k 0 84 g kg 1 total nitrogen 0 69 g kg 1 total phosphorus and 14 7 g kg 1 total potassium with a ph of 8 1 2 2 experimental design and field management the field experiment was laid out using a split plot arrangement based in a randomized complete block design with four n application rates 0 120 240 and 360 kg n ha 1 abbreviated as n0 n120 n240 and n360 respectively and two water regimes including rain fed and supplemental irrigation treatment si there were three replicates for each treatment the irrigation management scheme of the si plot followed the previous irrigation procedure of wang 2017 in which irrigational water was applied when the water content of the topsoil layer was below targeted 70 field capacity with assistance of the dynamic change in soil moisture within the 0 40 cm soil layers considering the drought event at wintering stage would seriously aggravate the freeze injury drought event at jointing stages substantially impair biomass production spike number and final yield performance supplemental irrigation was only considered at those two critical stages li et al 2017 wang et al 2017 li et al 2019 the amount of supplemental irrigation asi involved with the targeted soil moisture mentioned above and the targeted wetting soil depth 0 40 cm which was calculated using the following formula 1 a s i d ρ θ targeted θ i where d cm is the targeted wetting soil depth 0 40 cm p g cm 3 is the soil bulk density of targeted soil layer θtargeted mg g 1 is the targeted soil water content and θi mg g 1 is the soil water content of targeted soil layer before irrigation irrigational water flowed onto the si plots through our previously described irrigation pipe system without sprinkler fitted to a flow metre to measure the amount of water applied jing et al 2020 in both years si plots received the totally irrigation rate of 60 mm 30 mm at wintering stage plus 30 mm at jointing stage and no irrigation was performed under rain fed plots n fertilizer urea was split applied artificially at 0 and 180 days after sowing das in both seasons and the n splitting patterns were 60 and 40 respectively the basal fertilizers including phosphorus 25 kg p ha 1 as calcium superphosphate and potassium 30 kg k ha 1 as potassium chloride were broadcast and incorporated into the topsoil by rotary tillage from one day before sowing each plot was 3 m long and 4 m wide a 0 8 m wide space between adjacent plots was kept to avoid the possible influences of water and n seepage the wheat cultivar xinong979 was sown by hand at a seeding rate of 150 kg ha 1 in october and harvested in june in both years agronomic management such as insecticide and herbicide application followed the best locally recommended practice 2 3 plant sampling and measurements 2 3 1 ammonia volatilization flux nh4 n and no3 n concentrations and soil moisture soil ammonia volatilization flux was determined by the ventilation method yang et al 2020a two phosphoglycerol soaked sponges 3 cm thickness 15 cm diameter were placed in a pvc pipe 15 cm height and 15 cm inner diameter once the basal n fertilizer was applied the ammonia volatilized from soil was trapped by phosphoglycerol and the nh3 flux measurements were recorded daily for one week and were then monitored at an interval of 3 days until no ammonia was detected the samples collected in the sponges were immediately extracted with 300 ml of kcl solution 1 mol l 1 in a 500 ml container the solution was shaken for 1 h and the concentrations of nh4 n were recorded using a continuous segmented flow analyser aa3 hr autoanalyzer seal analytical inc mequon wisconsin usa the nh3 flux kg n ha 1 d 1 was calculated using the following formula 2 ammonia flux a area d 10 2 where a mg is the amount of ammonia collected by the phosphoglycerol soaked sponges area m2 is the cross sectional area of the pvc pipe d is the interval of ammonia collection total ammonia volatilization was the sum of the trapped ammonia volatilized during the entire measured period the nh3 emission factor ef was calculated as 3 ef nh 3 volatilization in n treated plot nh 3 volatilization in zero n plot n s u p p l y along with the ammonia volatilization measurements soil samples from the topsoil 0 20 cm were taken until the ammonia volatilization measurement ended soil nh4 n and no3 n concentrations were then extracted by 2 0 m kcl solution for 1 h on a rotary shaker and measured using a colorimetric method in an aa3 continuous flow analyser the dynamic change of soil water content at soil depths of 0 20 cm and 20 40 cm under all plots was measured by drying the soil to a constant weight 2 3 2 grain yield yield components n accumulation and n use efficiency at physiological maturity grain yields were determined by artificially harvesting the central plot area of 2 m2 and were reported at a standard moisture content of 0 12 g h2o g 1 fresh weight the plants from a 0 5 m2 area in two rows in the centre of each plot were sampled after counting the total spike number for the determination of the spike number per m2 the plant samples were divided into leaves stems and spikes the spikes were hand threshed the grain number per spike and grain weight mg were determined after oven drying at 70 c to a constant weight the aboveground total biomass was then weighted the tissue n concentration of each tissue component was determined by the kjeldahl method li

soil layers ρ i g cm 3 is the soil bulk density θ i g g 1 is the gravimetric water content and h i mm is the soil layer thickness in soil layer i evapotranspiration et for the whole crop growing

to harvesting stage i mm is the total irrigation amount deep percolation and runoff were not considered because of the good water holding capacity of soil in this experimental field li et al 2019 the wue kg ha 1 mm 1 was determined as the grain yield kg ha 1 divided by et mm 2 3 3 the labelled 15n fertilizer implemented in microplots and stable isotopic analysis in each plot a microplot 0 4 m by 0 5 m surrounded by a pvc frame was built the frame was placed 40 cm deep into the soil layer to prevent surface runoff and lateral contamination 15n labelled urea with an abundance of 10 18 which was provided by shanghai research institute of chemical industry china was applied to the microplots at the same n rate as the subplot treatment and at the same time all management practices on the microplots were the same as on the corresponding subplots the fertilizer 15n recovery efficiency 15nre in plants from the microplots at maturity was calculated by the method of liu et al 2015 15n derived from fertilizer 15ndff in plants and in soil kg n ha 1 and 15nre was calculated as follows 11 15 ndff in plant n uptake in plant 15 n atom in the plant 15 n atom in fertilizer 12 15 ndff in

created based on the following hypothesis 1 increasing n application rates could increase the nh3 emission factor and then enhance total nh3 volatilization 2 increasing n application rates could

under n360 regardless of water regime in both years fig 2 the nh3 fluxes of all plots then reduced to relatively low levels 3 kg n ha 1 d 1 within one week nh3 emissions were low after 35 and 25 das in the first and second experimental years until the top dressing n fertilizer was applied cumulative nh3 volatilization increased with increasing n application rates under both water regimes fig 3 the total nh3 emissions of n360 were 92 8 and 40 1 kg n ha 1 in the first and second experimental years respectively which increased by 97 133 and 447 in the first year and 110 263 and 19 fold in the second year compared with n240 n120 and n0 respectively the nh3 emission factor of n360 was significantly increased by 57 and 77 compared with n240 under rain fed and si in the first year in the second year the nh3 emission factors of n360 were significantly increased by 29 and 77 compared with those of n120 under rain fed and si treatments water regimes did not show a consistent effect on nh3 fluxes total nh3 volatilization or the nh3 emission factor nh4 n and no3 n concentrations in the 0 20 cm and 20 40 cm soil layers in both years are shown in figs 4 and 5 nh4 n and no3 n concentrations were both higher in the 0 20 cm soil layer than in the 20 40 cm soil layer nh4 peaked at appropriately 8 das in the 0 20 cm soil layer and at 15 das in the 20 40 cm soil layer and then gradually decreased a second peak appeared when top dressing n fertilizer was applied in both years no3 reached its maximum value at 8 das and gradually declined in the first year in the second year it peaked at almost 2 and 15 das in the 0 20 cm and 20 40 soil layers respectively nh4 n and no3 n concentrations both increased with increasing n application rates water regimes did not have a significant effect on nh4 n and no3 n concentrations n application rates and water regimes did not have a consistent effect on the soil water content for either soil layer in either year fig 6 the soil water content showed a positive relationship with the nh3 flux under both soil layers in the first years fig 7 moreover nh3 flux showed significant and positive relationships with nh4 n concentrations in both soil layers 3 2 grain yield wue and yield scaled nh3 emissions in both years grain yield increased significantly when n rates increased from 0 to 240 kg n ha 1 further increases in the n application rate higher than 240 kg n ha 1 did not result in a positive yield response table 1 the highest grain yields were always achieved under n240 in si conditions i e 8 7 and 6 7 t ha 1 in the first and second years respectively the grain yield under irrigation conditions was significantly increased by 21 2 compared with that under rain fed conditions in the second year a higher grain yield was associated with greater aboveground biomass production spike number and grain number per spike in both years aboveground biomass production spike number and grain number per spike increased with increasing n application rates however grain weight was reduced under high n rates both water regimes and n application rates had significant effects on et and wue table 1 the si treatment significantly increased et by 16 and 57 compared with the rain fed treatment averaged across four n application rates over two years the wue and yield scaled nh3 emissions increased with increasing n application rate and their highest values were mostly achieved under n240 in the rain fed treatment 3 3 n use efficiency and n residue in soil pfp and nae were significantly reduced with increasing n application rates under both si and rain fed treatments in both years table 2 for example the pfp and nae under n360 were reduced by 68 and 73 in the first year and 65 and 62 in the second year respectively compared with pfp and nae under n120 averaged across the two water regimes in the second year the nre and npe were greatly reduced by 68 and 49 under n240 compared with nre and npe under n120 averaged across the two water regimes nre was significantly reduced by 67 under n360 compared with n120 in the second year water regime did not have a significant effect on pfp nre npe or nae in the first year however pfp and nae were 24 and 47 higher in the irrigation plot than in the rain fed plot in the second year the 15ndff in the plants greatly increased with increasing n application rate under both si and rain fed treatments in both years table 2 the 15ndff in the plants under n360 increased by 155 and 11 compared with that under n120 averaged across the two water regimes in both years similar to nre 15nre based on the labelled 15n stable isotopic method was significantly reduced by 15 and 63 under n240 compared with n120 averaged across the two water regimes in the two years in general the nre ranging from 10 5 to 67 2 with a mean value of 34 averaged across two years was close to the 15nre ranging from 9 6 to 57 6 with a mean value of 28 averaged across two years fig 8 shows the 15n residue from in season fertilization in different soil layers in the second year the 15n residue was mostly reserved in the top 0 40 cm soil layer the 15n residue in the soil profile increased with increasing n application rate in both rain fed and si plots a significant difference in 15n residue was not observed between the two water regimes 3 4 pearson correlation and structural equation model sem most of the nue traits such as pfp nre npe nae 15ndff and 15nre showed positive correlations with wue and negative correlations with nh3 emissions nh3 emission factors and 15n residues fig 9 grain yield showed strong correlations with wue 15ndff 15nre nh3 emissions and several yield components such as spike number per m2 grain number per spike grain weight and biomass production the sem model showed that increased n rates resulted in higher nh3 emission factors and nh3 volatilization and directly reduced nue with greater factor loadings of 0 67 0 64 and 1 15 p 0 01 fig 10 in addition irrigation practices combined with appropriate n rates significantly increased yield related traits and grain yield and wue with high factor loadings of 0 46 0 98 and 0 54 p 0 01 respectively overall the data fit the hypothetical model well as indicated by χ2 df and other selection criteria 4 discussion 4 1 ammonia flux and its emission factor ammonia volatilization from farmland depends on compounding factors such as edaphic factor i e soil texture ph cation exchange capacity soil moisture and aeration agronomic managements i e fertilizer rate and sources application method organic amendments tillage system and irrigation regimes and climatic characteristics especially the rainfall and air temperature han et al 2014 liu et al 2017 degaspari et al 2020 li et al 2021 in this study a high n application rate tends to enhance nh3 volatilization and emission factors because part of the n from in season n application cannot be taken up by wheat plants especially for basal n fertilizer liu et al 2017 tian et al 2018 li et al 2021 the nh3 emission factor was increased up to 60 when the n application rate was increased to a high n application rate of 360 kg n ha 1 a similar result was also reported in ni et al 2014 who reported nh3 emission factor of 8 4 in winter wheat these results suggest that reducing the n application rate is an effective way to reduce nh3 emissions for wheat plants given that the total nh3 volatilization was reduced greatly by 61 5 under n120 compared with the highest n rate in this study similarly mariano et al 2012 found nh3 loss proportion of 16 in urea n applied at 50 kg n ha 1 and the proportion increased to appropriately 24 as n application rates increased to 200 kg n ha 1 degaspari et al 2020 also reported that nh3 losses increased from 11 to 16 when the n application rates increased from 60 to 180 kg n ha 1 n fertilizer applied to dry soil resulted in lower nh3 emissions as it could remain unhydrolysed in the soil for several weeks ni et al 2014 mira et al 2017 yang et al 2020b however si failed to increase nh3 emissions in this study although these practices can improve soil moisture at specific stages this could be partly explained by the fact that irrigational water could effectively wash urea to the deep soil when executing the irrigation procedure which reduced nh3 volatilization and increased nitrate n leaching from urea applied ju et al 2007 han et al 2014 other environmental factors such as soil ph soil temperature and soil texture have been reported to have strong effects on nh3 emissions mariano et al 2012 pan et al 2016 xu et al 2018 the variation in nh3 volatilization during the two experimental years could be explained by the different climate conditions especially the soil moisture and rainfall patterns at the timing of fertilizer application beusen et al 2008 li et al 2015 mariano et al 2012 compared to in the second year favourable soil moisture in the first year led to higher nh3 fluxes following the application of n fertilizer increasing precipitation in the second year 10 days after basal n fertilization application promotes nh3 fluxes thereafter compared with the first year in both years a shortage of precipitation and dry soil conditions in the late growth stage resulted in low nh3 fluxes this speculation was further supported by the consistent and close relationships between nh3 volatilization fluxes and inorganic n contents such as nh4 n and soil moisture fig 7 the dynamic changes in nh3 volatilization in the present study were consistent with previous studies which reported that the peak in daily nh3 emissions reached 2 8 das after basal n fertilizer application and then the fluxes declined to relatively low levels thereafter fig 2 he et al 2018 yang et al 2020a furthermore this study suggested that most nh3 volatilization 90 was emitted during the vegetative stage i e the first month after sowing even when top dressing fertilizer was applied at the joint stage the nh3 fluxes were relatively low and could be ignored wan et al 2021 this could be explained by the significant imbalance between higher n inputs and slower n uptake by wheat plants at the sowing stage ju et al 2007 liu et al 2018 4 2 wue nue and labelled 15n use efficiency the nues in crop production system could be calculated by a wide range of methods present study employed two mostly accepted methods including the subtraction method with elimination of unfertilized plot and enriched 15n stable isotope methods liu et al 2015 tian et al 2018 the low n application rate significantly increased most nue traits including pfp nre npe and nae the stable isotope 15n trace technique further suggested that the higher nue under the low n rate mainly stemmed from the lower 15n residue in the soil fig 8 and higher 15nre which ranged from 9 6 to 57 6 in this study table 2 the lower nue and inferior 15nre under the high n rate mainly stemmed from the unbalanced synchronization between the n demand of wheat plants and the soil n supply which eventually resulted in considerable n loss through nh3 volatilization denitrification nitrate leaching and runoff pan et al 2016 xu et al 2018 li et al 2020 guo et al 2021 in addition to the n application rate other options such as delayed top dressing n in the late stage or the use of slow release urea could help to match the n demand of plants with the soil supply to reduce nh3 volatilization improve nue and improve in season 15n use efficiency tian et al 2018 wu et al 2019 yang et al 2020b urease inhibitors that are known to retard urease activity and reduce the rate of nh4 release from urea provide plants with a greater opportunity to absorb more n thereby dropping nh3 emission and increasing nue simultaneously mira et al 2017 ni et al 2014 yang et al 2020a nh3 emissions following urea application from wheat fields are an essential pathway for n losses compared with other pathways such as n leaching and denitrification which are considered the major reasons for inferior nue mariano et al 2012 xu et al 2018 li et al 2020 this was further confirmed by the significant negative relationships between nh3 volatilization and nre and 15ndff as shown in the pearson correlation analysis fig 9 of this study this is consistent with the results of previous studies li et al 2021 ti et al 2020 additionally plants with high nue generally have superior root systems stronger nitrification capability and larger aboveground n accumulation that potentially favour n assimilation and in turn mitigate nh3 emissions fan et al 2010 enhancing wue has been a major focus of research which can be achieved by increasing grain yields and reducing et simultaneously li et al 2019 wue was generally higher under rain fed than under si conditions because of the increasing soil et coefficient table 1 and non beneficial soil evaporation in the latter li et al 2019 cai et al 2020 n application rates did not have a consistent effect on et but significantly increased grain yields under medium n rates of 120 240 kg n ha 1 therefore wue was usually higher under the medium n application rate than under the other n application rates further increasing the n rate to more than 240 kg n ha 1 deteriorated the wue because of increasing et or decreasing grain yield 4 3 improving grain yield with less environmental impact the highest attainable grain yield of more than 8 t ha 1 was generally achieved under the medium n application rate of 120 240 kg n ha 1 and further increasing the n application rate to 360 kg n ha 1 failed to produce a higher yield and even reduce the yield performance it was mainly because that the medium n application rate increased spikes number and biomass production compared with the zero n and highest n application rates while have did not have a negative influence on grain number per spike and grain weight other similar studies in china have suggested that n application rates ranging from 70 to 180 kg n ha 1 could be sufficient for achieving a maximum yield of approximately 8 t ha 1 ju et al 2007 li et al 2017 an excessive n supply stemming from the carryover effect of inorganic n fertilizer and strong n mineralization in farmer fields might be the main reasons for this invalid yield response to n doses liu et al 2018 degaspari et al 2020 pareja sánchez et al 2020 however local farmers at the experimental site currently apply over 300 kg n ha 1 according to our recent local survey which has major environmental impacts ju et al 2007 li et al 2019 2020 reducing the current n fertilizer rate in farmlands is thus critically important in wet year of 2014 15 supplemental irrigation was not necessary for increasing grain yield because there may be sufficient water available for wheat plants than is actually needed li et al 2019 but in dry year of 2015 16 supplemental irrigation significantly improved grain yield because of increasing biomass production compared with rain fed treatment it implied that irrigation regime needs to be arranged according to the local climate characteristics especially annual precipitation when assessing the feasibility of management options such as n application rates and water regimes in intensive agricultural systems comprehensive consideration of their effects on the environment pollution and crop yield is essential he et al 2018 zhang et al 2020 the yield scaled nh3 emissions based on the nh3 emissions per unit of grain production are a valuable indicator for balancing yield performance and environmental impact pittelkow et al 2014 he et al 2018 this study highlights that reducing the n application rate in combination with rain fed practices could be used to increase grain yield and resource use efficiency for n and water and reduce yield scaled nh3 emissions overall 120 240 kg n ha 1 in combination with rain fed practices is the optimal approach that should be implemented by local producers in dry years supplemental irrigation is used to alleviate drought stress and increase yield performance and economic return li et al 2019 5 conclusions the maximum accumulative nh3 emission was 66 kg n ha 1 which was observed in n360 and was increased by 104 2 fold and 12 fold compared with n240 n120 and n0 respectively averaged across water regimes and experimental years grain yield wue and yield scaled nh3 emissions increased with increasing n application rate and their highest values were observed under n120 or n240 regardless of the water regimes these results indicate that high nh3 emissions are the major reason for the inferior nue which was further confirmed by the 15n stable isotope overall this study suggests that the medium n rate of 120 240 kg n ha 1 can produce a high yield of 8 t ha 1 further increases in n rates failed to produce a significantly higher yield and even increased nh3 emissions led to a deterioration wue and nue and caused serious environmental pollution supplemental irrigation could be employed to alleviate drought stress in dry year declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they

10011,knowledge about potato yield responses to water supply at low optimum and high levels is required to inform supplemental irrigation si but short term irrigation experiments may not produce this knowledge in a humid environment because of the difficulty in accurately controlling water supply with uncertain precipitation this study was conducted to characterize potato yield responses to water supply by treating the 2001 2018 potato yields in prince edward island pei canada as the results of an un replicated irrigation experiment with growing season gs precipitation as irrigation water supply and utilize the results to inform si yield responses to gs precipitation followed a second order polynomial regression with 88 of yield variation being explained by gs precipitation the yield increased from 19 2 to 33 mg ha as gs precipitation increased from 150 to 360 mm responded relatively insensitively 33 35 mg ha when gs precipitation was between 360 and 460 mm and decreased as the precipitation exceeded 460 mm water deficiency excess calculated as the difference between gs precipitation and evapotranspiration of the potato plant etc indicates that 16 of the 18 seasons required si of 30 300 mm while four of the 18 seasons required soil dewatering of 30 100 mm to maximize potato yields the yield regression equation predicted that si using a center pivot system could generate net profit in an extremely dry year but it is unlikely to do so in most years depending on the year si could use anywhere between 2 6 and 23 of annual average recharge in an intensively potato cropped watershed which can impose high stress on the groundwater discharge dependent ecosystems in a very dry season this study demonstrates that long term potato yield responses to precipitation in a humid climate can provide important information to inform si management and water allocation keywords groundwater allocation climate change evapotranspiration cost benefit analysis aquatic ecosystems 1 introduction potato constituting the fourth most important food staple crop after rice wheat and maize worldwide plays a significant role in global food and nutrition security defauw et al 2012 potato crops are shallow rooted plants and are sensitive to moisture in the root zone opena and porter 1999 unlu et al 2006 alva 2008 water supply in deficiency excess of potato plant growth need can compromise tuber yields and quality epstein and grant 1973 van loon 1981 shock et al 1998 cantore et al 2014 which can reduce growers competitiveness in the market thus improving water management is very important for the economic sustainability of potato production while most potato production in humid environments was traditionally rain fed supplemental irrigation si is becoming more important due to a changing climate with greater rainfall uncertainty and higher frequency of droughts cook et al 2014 romero lankao et al 2014 implementing si requires knowledge of potato yield responses to water management variables such as irrigation rate timing and frequency irrigation rate was commonly estimated using potential evapotranspiration of the potato plant which can be calculated using empirical equations allen et al 1998 in season si timing and frequency were generally estimated using crop growth stage information soil hydraulic parameters e g available soil water soil holding capacity minus permanent wilting point combined with precipitation forecasts in humid regions brouwer et al 1989 sexton et al 2008 alva 2008 however estimations of potato yield response to water supply not only included uncertainties but also varied from region to region depending on potato production systems soil and weather in addition estimating modeling potato yield response to water supply is challenging without experimental data consequently place based irrigation experiments were commonly conducted to fine tune estimations of potato yield response to water supply shaykewich et al 2002 alva 2008 steele 2013 however controlling water supply for an irrigation experiment in a humid region can be more challenging than in an arid or semiarid region in humid regions seasonal precipitation is unpredictable and can be significantly higher or lower than the water demand by the potato plant making it difficult to supply water at designed levels for instance several field experiments were conducted to assess the effects of si on potato productivity in a humid maritime climate e g porter et al 1999 bélanger et al 2000 xing et al 2012 afzaal et al 2020 but these experiments only covered irrigation water supply levels required for the specific experiment seasons understanding potato crop responses to a wider range of water supply treatments including water demands under dry normal and wet seasonal weather conditions which may not all occur during a short term experiment is required to estimate net yield benefit of si in addition short term experiments could not determine the frequency distribution of seasonal water demand of si which is important not only for si but also for water resources allocation decision making while uncertain precipitation presents a challenge for irrigation experiments it provides an opportunity to characterize potato yield responses to water management variables by treating historical potato yield responses to random precipitation as the outcome of a long term irrigation experiment examining this response relationship can fill in the knowledge gap where short term irrigation experiments cannot provide information for instance benoit and grant 1985 analyzed excess and deficient water stress effects based on precipitation and evapotranspiration data on 30 years of potato yields in aroostook county of maine us and reported that potato yields were related to the combined effect of yearly water excess and deficit and can be described by a multiple regression with r2 as 0 46 their results suggest that maximizing potato production in the humid northeast of us requires a water management system that includes both supplemental irrigation and drainage prince edward island pei is the smallest province 5670 km2 in canada yet it is one of canada s largest potato producing provinces with approximately 25 of the total canadian production statistics canada 2020 the potato industry is estimated to be worth 1b and creates 8283 jobs representing 12 of the total employment and contributing significantly to the local economy traditionally this intensive potato production was mainly rain fed however climate change has been altering precipitation patterns resulting in more frequent drought events growers have shown a growing interest in implementing si to mitigate drought related risks however si has been only implemented on 5 of potato land because growers have not been granted water sources to expand irrigation to greater areas surface water for irrigation is limited and has been fully allocated since the typical streams are relatively small and sustain sensitive aquatic ecosystems the island is underlain by a productive fractured sandstone aquifer which provides all the drinking water and the large majority nearly 100 in the summer of stream flow jiang et al 2004 jiang and somers 2009 the province imposed a moratorium on permits for high capacity irrigation wells in 2002 in response to concerns about drinking water and stream flow depletion by expanding irrigation the moratorium was in effect an application of the precautionary principle that provided the time required for more comprehensive assessments of the long term cumulative impacts of increased groundwater extractions on drinking water availability stream flow and dependent ecosystems while the availability of groundwater for si requires more assessments knowledge about the economic performance of si is also lacking and is required for making decision about si expansion and water allocation this study was conducted to investigate 18 years of potato yield responses to precipitation and water deficiency excess in prince edward island pei canada the specific objectives are to 1 estimate potential evapotranspiration of the potato plant etc 2 characterize potato yield responses to gs and monthly precipitation and water deficiency excess and estimate optimum water demand of the potato plant 3 estimate the economic benefit of si and 4 assess potential water demand of si in a heavily potato cropped watershed this study will generate data about economic benefits and environmental effects of si this information is critical for making decisions about si expansion and groundwater allocation for intensive potato production under increasing rainfall uncertainty in this humid region 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area pei is located on the eastern coast of canada the climate is characterized by mean annual precipitation of 1158 mm 25 as snow based on 1981 2010 data from the environment and climate change canada eccc weather station at the charlottetown airport environment and climate change canada charlottetown airport weather station eccc charlottetown airport 2020 the frost free period varied from 100 to 160 days the average annual growing degree days above 5 c was 1600 with may to september average degree days above 10 c being 800 the average january air temperature was 8 c and the average july air temperature was 19 c the island land surface is rolling the western section of the island has a gentle relief with slopes up to 7 the central section is more hilly including slopes up to 14 and the highest point with an elevation of 139 m above the sea level the eastern section follows a relief lying between those of the western and central areas macdougall et al 1988 the island is entirely underlain by a sandstone formation at a thickness of 1200 1600 m comprised of a sequence of permo carboniferous terrestrial red beds van de poll 1983 this formation is overlain by a layer of glacial till 0 10 m soils derived from the glacial till are sandy loam sandy loam or loamy sand well drained and relatively uniform across the island macdougall et al 1988 the soils have organic matter typically ranging from 1 5 to 3 5 nyiraneza et al 2017 and the average ph is 6 with a range of 5 0 7 2 potato production commonly takes place on these soils potato production commenced on the island in the late 1700 s and the tradition continues today with about 200 growers currently operating the production area was 15 000 ha in 1940 increased to 17 800 ha in 1965 peaked at 45 760 ha in the late 1990 s and stayed between 33 570 ha 2013 and 37 460 ha 2008 in recent years the current potato production area accounts for over 20 of all cropland corresponding to about 6 of the total land each year approximately 60 of the potatoes are destined for processing while 30 go to the fresh market through retail or food service and 10 are grown for seed purposes the most widely grown varieties include russet burbank goldrush superior yukon gold red norland and a number of proprietary varieties potato growers commonly adopted the minimum length of 3 year rotation as mandated by the province and followed local industry standard management practices as described by bernard et al 1993 traditionally growers mainly planted barley and forages e g red clover or a mix of red clover and one or two perennial grass species as the rotation crops in recent years growers have included more diverse annual crops e g spring wheat soybean corn buckwheat brown mustard or perennial hay grass crops in the rotations 2 2 data sets the provincial average potato yield data statistics canada 2020 collected from 2001 to 2018 by statistics canada s annual census of agriculture were used as one data set for relating potato average yields with meteorological parameters the census covered about 200 farms per year in pei the potato farms reported their potato areas and yields the potato area and yield were weighted in order to produce level indicators these level indicators undergo a validation process the estimates from a random sample of agriculture operations remained within the confidence interval of 95 the data represent aggregated total yield of various potato varieties in the province a second dataset was provided by the pei agriculture insurance corporation peiaic peiaic collected annual variety based potato yield data from representative participating farms to calculate benchmark variety based yields for crop production insurance compensation purposes these benchmarks reflected standard cultural practices and were used to determine production insurance compensation where in field yield losses occurred that were beyond the policy holders control the peiaic yield data were based on verified final production to count and not total yields the final production to count represents a marketable yield which is the remaining crop available for sale after cullage is subtracted from a total yield peiaic determined the variety based marketable yield for each participating farm by sampling and combined the yield data from all participating farms into a province wide benchmark yield the russet burbank rb variety yield data peiaic collected from 2000 to 2017 were used in this study as rb was the predominant variety grown in pei and can better approximate the variety aggregated yield data for verification purposes rb is the most widely grown potato variety in north america bethke et al 2014 the 2018 yield data were excluded as the data represented the harvested but not production yields because many potatoes were left in field without being harvested due to the extremely wet soil conditions in fall 2018 the meteorological data including daily precipitation air temperature and class a pan measurements from the harrington weather station of environment and climate change canada environment and climate change canada harrington weather station eccc harrington 2020 were used to calculate monthly seasonal and annual precipitation etc and water deficiency excess of potato crops the data from harrington were used simply because this station had the required data especially pan measurements available for 1988 1992 which were used to validate etc estimations and its central location is representative of average meteorological conditions for the whole island the missing data points at harrington were filled with the measurements from the nearby charlottetown airport weather station environment and climate change canada charlottetown airport weather station eccc charlottetown airport 2020 2 3 estimations of potential evapotranspiration and water deficiency excess potential evapotranspiration of the potato plant etc was estimated to approximate water demand of the potato plant firstly potential evaporation etlake from an extensive and uniform wet surface e g shallow lake was estimated using the linacre equation linacre 1977 which is a modified form of the penman equation penman 1948 for estimating etlake solely using air temperature measurements the linacre equation was adopted because only air temperature data were available as input the etlake values represented local reference evapotranspiration et0 secondly these et0 values were compared with class a pan evaporation measurements etpan multiplied by a conversion coefficient kl for validation the best value of kl was determined by adjusting kl by matching etpan kl etlake with the etpan measurements collected by eccc from 1988 to 1992 the class a pan data were provided by eccc upon request the estimated et0 values were considered validated if the best kl fell in the typical range as reported in linacre 1993 thirdly as pan measurements were only made from 1988 to 1992 the et0 values calculated from the linacre equation for the study period 2001 2018 were then converted into crop evapotranspiration etc by multiplying a crop factor kc crop type variety and development stage influence etc from crops grown in large well managed fields potato planting was assumed to match the typical planting time middle of may in pei potato growth stages and associated crop factor were defined as initiation 0 25 days may 15 june 10 kc 0 8 development stage 30 days june 11 july 10 kc 0 9 midseason 45 days july 11 august 25 kc 1 15 and late season 30 days august 26 september 25 kc 0 75 by following brouwer et al 1989 allen et al 1998 and sexton et al 2008 the growing season gs is defined as june 1 to september 30 which is similar to that as defined in maine us by benoit and grant 1985 water deficiency excess of potato plant was calculated as the difference between precipitation and etc with positive and negative values indicating water excess and deficiency respectively as indicated by long term monitoring of shallow groundwater level and stream flow in pei runoff and recharge were not accounted for gs water deficiency excess analysis as they were limited in gs jiang et al 2012 liang et al 2020 2 4 statistical analysis the responses of 18 years of yields to precipitation were simulated as the results of an un replicated irrigation experiment with precipitation rate as the treatment level the influences of other biophysical factors e g field management and soil were not analyzed regression analysis was performed by using the potato yields as the dependent variables with monthly precipitation water deficiency excess and gs precipitation and water deficiency excess as independent variables respectively the meteorological variables with potato yield were used to develop yield determining equations via a linear or polynomial regression whichever produced the best fit the significance of correlation was assessed through anova test of regression 2 5 supplemental irrigation cost benefit analysis an important question on the topic of potato water management is whether the economic gain from si can offset the associated costs in the absence of experimental data about potato yield responses to water supply varying from extremely dry to wet conditions potential total yield increases by si were estimated from the regression equation relating yield and gs precipitation it was assumed that si water supply equals to gs precipitation and that si and precipitation create similar yield responses the estimated yield gains were used to assess whether the economic return from si can offset the costs associated with si the gross profit was calculated using the 2018 potato price of 254 mg agriculture and agri food canada 2019 in the absence of local data about the costs of si the 2010 costs from maine us silver et al 2011 which has similar production conditions were used as a reference 2 6 estimating water demands for irrigation in the wilmot river watershed potential water demands for irrigation in the wilmot river watershed which represents one of the most intensively potato cropped watersheds in pei jiang et al 2015 was assessed the watershed has a drainage area of 61 km2 with 31 of the land being devoted to potato production every year from 2011 to 2017 liang et al 2020 annual potential water demands for irrigation were estimated as gs water deficiency multiplied by the percentage 31 of the land devoted to potato production in the watershed these potential water demands were compared with the empirical annual recharge average the ratios include maximum water demand from potential irrigation extraction at a watershed scale as a worst case scenario of irrigation pumping stress imposed on the groundwater discharge dependent ecosystems 3 results and discussion 3 1 weather conditions the majority of monthly precipitation averages varied within 50 100 mm at harrington with those in november and december being the highest fig 1 in the gs july had the lowest precipitation average 68 mm while june august and september averages ranged from 90 to 96 mm monthly precipitation averages were similar in june august and september but monthly precipitation in the gs fluctuated greatly with several outliers indicating inconsistent water supply to potato crops without irrigation fig 1 gs precipitation varied from 155 mm 2001 to 479 mm 2008 and averaged 340 mm with a standard deviation of 77 mm table 1 effective rainfall i e daily rainfall 5 mm in the gs averaged 86 and ranged from 78 2001 to 94 2002 the average was probably over 86 as the summation of the total amount of rainfall could be calculated without excluding 5 mm daily precipitation in this humid maritime environment where there were many days of rainfall in succession because total precipitation was very close to effective precipitation total rather than effective precipitation was adopted in all related analysis during 2001 2018 gs air temperature at harrington followed the local long term trends as presented in the study area section monthly and seasonal temperature did not significantly influence potato yield data not presented gs weekly etlake values multiplied by 1 3 matched the class a pan measurements with root mean square error rmse of 7 4 mm week fig 2 which represented the best fit rmse accounts for 33 of weekly etlake average and 20 of 1 3 maximum minimum etlake the discrepancy between the measurements and calculations from the linacre equation was likely due to the combination of measurement errors and the inability of the linacre equation to reflect the influences of meteorological parameters other than air temperature such as wind speed and relative air humidity the kl fell in the typical range in the literature e g linacre 1993 using etlake as et0 the estimated daily or weekly et0 values fig 2 were similar to the values et0 1 2 mm d around 10 2 4 mm d under 20 4 7 mm d 30 for a humid temperate region as reported by allen et al 1998 and under a similar climate in maine us e g sexton et al 2008 and new brunswick canada e g bélanger et al 2000 xing et al 2008 the etlake values were used as et0 for estimating weekly fig 3 monthly fig 4 and gs water deficiency excess table 1 evapotranspiration generally exceeded precipitation and recharge was limited in potato fields between june and october evapotranspiration subsequently diminished and snowmelt and or rainfall created significant recharge during october and may fig 3 these results are consistent with the responses of groundwater level and stream flow to seasonal recharge as reported by jiang et al 2012 and liang et al 2020 gs etc averaged 421 mm with a standard deviation of 18 mm table 1 the small standard deviation indicates that annual variation of gs etc was relatively small while the precipitation averages in may and june were higher than the etc values the respective precipitation averages in july and august were 70 and 37 mm lower than the etc values of the potato plant indicating water deficiency in the critical growing period under rain fed conditions fig 4 the water deficiency was much more severe in the extremely dry season of 2001 fig 4 3 2 potato yield responses to precipitation and water deficiency excess variety aggregated potato yields varied from 19 2 to 35 mg ha with an average of 31 2 and standard deviation of 3 3 mg ha and the rb yields varied from 16 3 to 33 2 mg ha with an average of 29 5 and standard deviation of 3 8 mg ha table 1 the rb yields were slightly lower than the variety aggregated yields partly because the rb yields represent marketable yields which should be lower than the total yields these yields were compatible with the data from a neighboring region i e maine us silver et al 2011 in 2001 the gs precipitation was only 45 of averages of 2001 2018 table 1 the extreme dry conditions resulted in extremely low yields variety aggregated 19 2 mg ha vs rb 16 3 mg ha the regression between variety aggregated yields and gs precipitation produced a second order polynomial curve with a perfect correlation r2 0 88 p 0 001 table 2 this regression indicates that gs precipitation accounted for 88 of the year to year variation in potato yield potato yield increased with the initial increments of water supply from 150 to 360 mm became relatively insensitive i e plateauing to water supplied from 360 to 460 mm then decreased with very high water supplies fig 5 note that the yield determining equation in fig 5 only characterizes how variety aggregated yields respond to gs precipitation under average soil weather and management conditions in pei as such the yield of a specific variety from a specific field year may deviate from this regression equation depending on how the field s soil and management practices differ from average conditions a perfect second order polynomial correlation r2 0 88 p 0 001 also exists between the variety aggregated yields and gs water deficiency excess fig 6 table 2 the fact that gs water deficiency excess was linearly correlated with gs precipitation r2 0 98 p 0 001 as a result of gs etc being close to a constant table 1 can well explain why the two correlations are so similar maximizing potato yield requires balancing the water supply and demand of potato plants in time and space applying this principle and the yield determining equations in figs 5 and 6 supplementing water supply with irrigation at 34 175 mm would be required in the majority 13 18 72 2 of the gss supplementing at 295 mm would be required in the 2001 season 5 5 and dewatering at rates of 18 34 mm would be required for four 22 2 gss i e 2002 2008 2009 and 2010 as the excessive water supply led to the yield going from plateauing to decreasing figs 5 and 6 the responses of rb yield to gs precipitation and water deficiency excess were also characterized by polynomial regression curves figs 7 and 8 the correlations were significant r2 0 77 and p 0 001 for precipitation and r2 0 79 and p 0 001 for water deficiency excess table 1 these rb yield data indicate that gs precipitation and water deficiency excess explained 77 and 79 of the yield variability respectively although the variety aggregated and rb data sets were from two different sources they produced highly consistent statistical results this consistency increases confidence in the yield determining equations solving the derivatives of the yield determining equations figs 5 and 6 by setting the yields to zero produced the optimum water supply for the potato plant as 460 and 399 mm for the variety aggregated and rb cases respectively this optimum water supply is highly consistent with the optimum water demand of the potato plant as indicated by the gs average etc 421 mm this consistency suggests that the estimations of the optimum water demand as indicated by etc are reliable the optimum water demand rates calculated from the etc data in fig 4 were 1 4 2 6 4 3 4 3 and 2 4 mm per day in may june july august and september respectively potato yield responded relatively insensitively as gs rainfall fell within 360 and 460 mm fig 5 or water deficiency excess varied within about 100 and 100 mm fig 6 for rb the insensitive precipitation fell within 300 400 mm fig 7 or water deficiency excess between about 70 and 0 mm fig 8 interestingly similar insensitive yield responses and water supply ranges were also observed by shaykewich et al 2002 from supplemental irrigation experiments in manitoba canada this consistency implies that potato yield intrinsically responds insensitively to a fairly large range of water supply as water supply approaches the optimum point this is very similar to the insensitive yield response to a fairly large range of fertilizer n input before reaching the optimum n input point e g zebarth et al 2012 the insensitive water supply range provides an opportunity for growers to consider the lower i e 360 mm as water supply or 100 mm as water deficiency excess instead of the upper bound i e 460 mm as water supply or 100 mm as water deficiency excess as a quasi optimum si water supply target adopting this quasi optimum target can potentially not only produce a yield almost identical to the maximum yield as determined by the yield determining equation but also reduce the cost of si pumping and conserve water which is important where water sources are limited in availability it is worth noting that the insensitive water supply range likely varies with potato variety the timing of monthly precipitation in the gs influenced potato yields differently table 2 precipitation in may was negatively correlated with rb yields r2 0 28 p 0 1 because excessive soil moisture in may can delay planting which can in turn reduce rb yield as a result of a shortened growing period for this long season variety in june the potato plants initiated and established esp for the commonly grown rb variety when leaf area was small and temperatures were usually cool water use etc was relatively low fig 4 while precipitation was relatively high fig 1 as such water deficiency likely did not occur and thus precipitation or water deficiency excess in june did not affect potato yields significantly in july when tubers initiated the plants were relatively sensitive to water stress however precipitation or water deficiency excess in july did not impose a significant effect on yield table 2 note that precipitation usually exceeded etc in may and june fig 4 in this humid region which allowed the excessive precipitation to be stored in soil and carried over into july this carried over soil moisture may have mitigated some of the impacts of rainfall deficiency in july resulting in the lack of significant yield response to july precipitation precipitation in august significantly positively influenced variety aggregated r2 0 4 p 0 05 and rb r2 0 3 p 0 1 yields table 2 water deficiency excess in august also significantly influenced variety aggregated r2 0 65 p 0 001 and rb r2 0 56 p 0 05 yields this is probably because potato tubers were bulking in august when the potato plants were most sensitive to water stress sexton et al 2008 water deficiency excess in september was positively correlated with variety aggregated r2 0 35 p 0 1 and rb yields r2 0 34 p 0 1 having sufficient soil moisture in september likely helped increase the yields by providing more time for the long season variety to grow the optimum water demand rates of the potato plant and yield responding patterns as discussed above have important implications for si management as potato yields were less sensitive to water supply and water deficiency usually did not occur in june implementing si in this month to match the gs optimum water demand should be a lower priority supplying water at 4 3 mm per day i e 1 2 in per week in july and august is important to achieve the optimum yield goal for long season varieties applying 2 3 mm per day in september can help to achieve the optimum yield target while adopting the gs quasi optimum water demand targets for water conservation reducing water input should be done outside of august since irrigation is meant to supplement the water deficiency created by insufficient rainfall in this humid area the recommended water supply rates must be deducted by local short term forecasted rainfall in all cases however controlling water supply by matching si plus gs rainfall with the optimum water demand targets is challenging as gs rainfall can vary substantially and is unpredictable in this humid area as a result applying a similar irrigation rate si in two growing seasons with two different rainfall rates r1 and r2 can end up with two largely different gs water supply rates si r1 vs si r2 and yield responses for example if r1 si is in the sensitive range and r2 si is in the insensitive range as indicated in fig 5 si r1 can create a yield response but r2 si cannot this may explain why some growers who applied a similar irrigation rate observed a yield benefit in some seasons but not in other seasons in pei personal communications likewise short term irrigation experiments may also produce inconsistent yield responses to a similar irrigation rate in a humid area but the inconsistency as driven by two different gs water supply rates may be attributed to other factors by mistake because the experiments may not map out the responding patterns including both sensitive and insensitive ranges as shown in fig 5 on an annual basis both variety aggregated r2 0 73 p 0 001 and rb r2 0 53 p 0 005 yields were significantly correlated with annual precipitation using a second order polynomial regression however the physics basis of these correlations is questionable although annual precipitation was used to correlate with potato yield in maine us by benoit and grant 1985 the fall winter early spring off season precipitation was normally higher than the gs precipitation fig 3 but the majority of the off season precipitation became groundwater recharge runoff and evapotranspiration with the remaining water stored in the soil which can create a saturated soil condition before planting potato crops jiang et al 2011 however growers are not able to plant potatoes under saturated or quasi saturated soil conditions as the agricultural equipment can get stuck in the wet fields the machines cannot work in fields until the soil moisture decreases below about 65 water holding capacity for the typical soils loam or sandy loam in pei this level of moisture which was estimated to correspond to about 25 mm of available water in the top 30 cm of soil where the majority of potato roots are present by using relevant soil retention parameters could diminish to the wilting point level through evapotranspiration within about 10 days without new precipitation and or irrigation given the typical crop etc of 1 4 2 6 mm d as shown before in addition this level of moisture only corresponds to a small fraction 7 8 of gs precipitation averages table 1 annual precipitation was correlated with potato yield simply because annual precipitation was linearly correlated with gs precipitation r2 0 46 p 0 01 as a consequence annual precipitation is mathematically correlated with potato yield but the yield responses were primarily driven by gs precipitation in other words only the upcoming gs precipitation rather than the previous off season precipitation had a significant impact on potato plant growth as identified above gs precipitation as water supply was the dominant variable responsible for year to year variation of potato yield which constitutes the key rationale for improving water management the 18 years of yield and weather data also demonstrated a wide range of water supply scenarios dry quasi optimum and wet and are important for potato water management decision making in this region particularly in the absence of long term irrigation experiment data however the data were derived from random precipitation as water supply and may not fully reflect real world si conditions recommended optimum soil moisture thresholds for potato plant growth range from 65 to 85 water holding capacity for vegetative growth tuber initiative and tuber bulking stages and from 50 to 65 water holding capacity for maturation stages e g allen et al 1998 sexton et al 2008 although the precipitation in four 2002 2007 2010 2011 of the 18 seasons was very close to the optimum water demand of the potato plant whether the random precipitation rates table 1 could have consistently maintained soil moisture within the optimum thresholds for irrigation is unknown it also remains to be verified whether strictly respecting the optimum moisture thresholds via si could have greatly changed the yield response patterns as shown in figs 5 8 irrigation studies conducted by shock et al 1998 in oregon us and lynch et al 1995 in alberta canada suggested that a short duration of water stress can result in an appreciable reduction in tuber yield and quality it should be noted that irrigation can meet the optimum moisture thresholds provided that precipitation does not exceed the water supply required for respecting the thresholds but cannot do so if the precipitation oversupplies water unless soil dewatering is carried out in this humid region in other words consistently meeting the optimum moisture thresholds would require a soil dewatering system such as tile drainage in addition to si as excessive water supply in the form of precipitation occurred in four out of the 18 years since the rb yield case had similarities with the variety aggregated yield case in terms of yield responses to precipitation and water deficiency excess it was considered as a validation of the latter and hereafter discussions will only focus on the variety aggregated yield case unless otherwise noted 3 3 economic implications of supplemental irrigation as predicted by the yield determining equation in fig 6 in an extremely dry year such as 2001 a rainfall depth duration frequency of 5 5 applying irrigation at 295 mm would be required to increase the yield from the rain fed level of 19 7 mg ha to the optimum si level of 33 mg ha i e 13 3 mg ha gain although reaching a yield gain of 35 19 7 15 3 mg ha is also possible in most years a rainfall depth duration frequency of 72 2 applying irrigation from 34 mm to 175 mm would be required to increase the yield from the rain fed level of 29 7 mg ha to the optimum si level of 33 mg ha i e 3 3 mg ha gain assuming 90 of total yield being marketable yield jiang et al 2019 multiplying the potato sale price e g 254 mg with the yield gains produced the si gross profits table 3 the gross profits represent increased gross profit from si alone as the growers would have to spend money on all other production costs regardless of si silver et al 2011 categorized the 2010 si costs in maine us into three classes capital costs equipment interest water development pond construction permitting engineering and operating and maintenance costs labor power repair they estimated the costs for hose reel traveler systems and center pivot systems with or without water development costs at 20 40 or 80 ha field size categories respectively as all these parameters influenced the overall costs they also noted that their cost estimates had a variable component reflecting the demand for irrigation water as the demand for irrigation water was dependent upon rainfall while operating costs increased with increasing amounts of irrigation applied average cost declined the respective average annual costs at 2010 prices associated with a center pivot system with and without water source development at 20 and 40 ha field sizes reported by silver et al 2011 were used as reference costs these reference costs were adjusted for inflation using an annual inflation average of 1 78 https www usinflationcalculator com inflation historical inflation rates accessed 28 july 2020 and converted into canadian currency by using the 2018 conversion rate 1 3 deducting the gross benefits of si with the si costs produces the net financial benefit of si table 3 based on the cost and benefit data in table 3 si has to increase total potato yield by over 10 6 and 5 9 mg ha for a 20 ha field size scenario and 5 2 and 3 3 mg t for a 40 ha field size scenario with and without water source development respectively in order to generate net profile as expected in an extremely dry year such as 2001 si could have substantially increased financial benefits as a result of potential total yield increase from 19 2 to 33 mg ha regardless of 20 and 40 ha field sizes with and without water source development compared to rain fed production table 3 however this only occurred in 5 5 of the 18 years in most of the 18 years si would have induced negative financial benefits in both 20 ha and 40 ha field sizes with and without water source development table 3 if si could have boosted the yield from 29 7 to 35 as shown in fig 5 in some seasons the gross profit 1146 ha from si would only offset the si costs 832 ha in a 40 ha field size scenario without water source development costs incurred these results demonstrate a great financial challenge of implementing si in this traditionally rain fed production area how the costs in maine us compare with the costs in pei is yet to be fully assessed particularly given pei s smaller fields and undulating often challenging terrain for center pivot systems in addition si can influence potato quality parameters lynch et al 1995 porter et al 1999 such as scab and specific gravity which can greatly influence potato sale price and associated profitability as well this is beyond the scope of this work however the potential yield gains observed here in response to rainfall suggest more work needs to be done to assess if strictly respecting soil moisture as required by optimum potato plant growth by si coupled with optimizing other potato production management variables can enhance potato productivity and quality to make si consistently profitable 3 4 implications of supplemental irrigation for groundwater management assuming equal water access for irrigating all potato lands 31 of land mass in the wilmot river watershed and annual recharge average being 400 mm as estimated by jiang et al 2004 and liang et al 2020 potential si would utilize 2 6 13 5 of annual recharge average i e 31 of 34 mm 400 mm to 175 mm 400 mm in 72 of the 18 years and 23 of annual recharge average i e 31 of 295 mm 400 mm in the extremely dry 2001 season in 5 5 of the 18 years based on water deficiency as shown in fig 6 although the potential extractions were not high compared to the annual recharge average except in the 2001 season it is important to recognize that irrigation extraction would mainly utilize groundwater storage as irrigation only occurs during the gs when recharge is limited fig 3 groundwater used for irrigation in the gs is expected to be fully replenished in the aquifer by forthcoming recharge in this recharge rich region however the concurrence of high extraction for irrigation with low recharge in the gs especially in the extremely drought prone season of 2001 representing the worst case scenario could impose high seasonal stress on the groundwater discharge dependent ecosystems by significantly reducing groundwater discharge into the receiving tributaries addressing the seasonal conflict of water uses between the environment and humans in an intensively farmed watershed poses a great challenge for groundwater management in this humid region 4 conclusions the 2001 2018 variety aggregated potato yield responses to gs precipitation were characterized by second order polynomial equations with 88 of the variation of the yield being explained by gs precipitation variety aggregated yield increased from 19 2 to 33 mg ha as gs precipitation increased from 155 to 360 mm responded relatively insensitive 33 35 mg ha as gs precipitation varied within 360 460 mm and then decreased to 31 mg ha as gs precipitation exceeded 460 mm similar correlation exists between the 2000 2017 russet burbank rb potato yields and gs precipitation gs etc of the potato plant was estimated to be 421 mm which was consistent with the optimum water demands 399 460 mm determined from the second order polynomial regressions between potato yields and gs precipitation to maximize potato yield 16 out of the 18 gss would require various levels 30 300 mm of supplemental irrigation while four out of the 18 seasons would require dewatering soil at 30 100 mm to mitigate excessive water supply on a monthly basis precipitation and water deficiency excess in august significantly positively influenced variety aggregated and rb yields precipitation in may significantly negatively influenced rb yield while water deficiency excess in september significantly positively influenced both variety aggregated and rb yields supplemental irrigation using a center pivot system would generate net profit in an extremely dry year such as 2001 but would lead to a net loss of profit in most years under both a 20 ha and a 40 ha field size scenarios irrigation extractions could use at anywhere between 2 6 and 23 of annual average recharge in one of the most intensively potato cropped watersheds depending on the year while the groundwater consumed by irrigation in the gs can be replenished by the forthcoming recharge the concurrence of high extraction for irrigation with low recharge in the dry season especially in an extremely drought prone season such as 2001 could impose high seasonal stress on the groundwater discharge dependent ecosystems in an intensively farmed watershed in this humid region this study demonstrates that long term yield responses to precipitation in a temperate humid climate can provide important information for making decision about si management and water resources allocation where short term control experiments cannot provided that the influences on yield from other management and soil

10011,knowledge about potato yield responses to water supply at low optimum and high levels is required to inform supplemental irrigation si but short term irrigation experiments may not produce this knowledge in a humid environment because of the difficulty in accurately controlling water supply with uncertain precipitation this study was conducted to characterize potato yield responses to water supply by treating the 2001 2018 potato yields in prince edward island pei canada as the results of an un replicated irrigation experiment with growing season gs precipitation as irrigation water supply and utilize the results to inform si yield responses to gs precipitation followed a second order polynomial regression with 88 of yield variation being explained by gs precipitation the yield increased from 19 2 to 33 mg ha as gs precipitation increased from 150 to 360 mm responded relatively insensitively 33 35 mg ha when gs precipitation was between 360 and 460 mm and decreased as the precipitation exceeded 460 mm water deficiency excess calculated as the difference between gs precipitation and evapotranspiration of the potato plant etc indicates that 16 of the 18 seasons required si of 30 300 mm while four of the 18 seasons required soil dewatering of 30 100 mm to maximize potato yields the yield regression equation predicted that si using a center pivot system could generate net profit in an extremely dry year but it is unlikely to do so in most years depending on the year si could use anywhere between 2 6 and 23 of annual average recharge in an intensively potato cropped watershed which can impose high stress on the groundwater discharge dependent ecosystems in a very dry season this study demonstrates that long term potato yield responses to precipitation in a humid climate can provide important information to inform si management and water allocation keywords groundwater allocation climate change evapotranspiration cost benefit analysis aquatic ecosystems 1 introduction potato constituting the fourth most important food staple crop after rice wheat and maize worldwide plays a significant role in global food and nutrition security defauw et al 2012 potato crops are shallow rooted plants and are sensitive to moisture in the root zone opena and porter 1999 unlu et al 2006 alva 2008 water supply in deficiency excess of potato plant growth need can compromise tuber yields and quality epstein and grant 1973 van loon 1981 shock et al 1998 cantore et al 2014 which can reduce growers competitiveness in the market thus improving water management is very important for the economic sustainability of potato production while most potato production in humid environments was traditionally rain fed supplemental irrigation si is becoming more important due to a changing climate with greater rainfall uncertainty and higher frequency of droughts cook et al 2014 romero lankao et al 2014 implementing si requires knowledge of potato yield responses to water management variables such as irrigation rate timing and frequency irrigation rate was commonly estimated using potential evapotranspiration of the potato plant which can be calculated using empirical equations allen et al 1998 in season si timing and frequency were generally estimated using crop growth stage information soil hydraulic parameters e g available soil water soil holding capacity minus permanent wilting point combined with precipitation forecasts in humid regions brouwer et al 1989 sexton et al 2008 alva 2008 however estimations of potato yield response to water supply not only included uncertainties but also varied from region to region depending on potato production systems soil and weather in addition estimating modeling potato yield response to water supply is challenging without experimental data consequently place based irrigation experiments were commonly conducted to fine tune estimations of potato yield response to water supply shaykewich et al 2002 alva 2008 steele 2013 however controlling water supply for an irrigation experiment in a humid region can be more challenging than in an arid or semiarid region in humid regions seasonal precipitation is unpredictable and can be significantly higher or lower than the water demand by the potato plant making it difficult to supply water at designed levels for instance several field experiments were conducted to assess the effects of si on potato productivity in a humid maritime climate e g porter et al 1999 bélanger et al 2000 xing et al 2012 afzaal et al 2020 but these experiments only covered irrigation water supply levels required for the specific experiment seasons understanding potato crop responses to a wider range of water supply treatments including water demands under dry normal and wet seasonal weather conditions which may not all occur during a short term experiment is required to estimate net yield benefit of si in addition short term experiments could not determine the frequency distribution of seasonal water demand of si which is important not only for si but also for water resources allocation decision making while uncertain precipitation presents a challenge for irrigation experiments it provides an opportunity to characterize potato yield responses to water management variables by treating historical potato yield responses to random precipitation as the outcome of a long term irrigation experiment examining this response relationship can fill in the knowledge gap where short term irrigation experiments cannot provide information for instance benoit and grant 1985 analyzed excess and deficient water stress effects based on precipitation and evapotranspiration data on 30 years of potato yields in aroostook county of maine us and reported that potato yields were related to the combined effect of yearly water excess and deficit and can be described by a multiple regression with r2 as 0 46 their results suggest that maximizing potato production in the humid northeast of us requires a water management system that includes both supplemental irrigation and drainage prince edward island pei is the smallest province 5670 km2 in canada yet it is one of canada s largest potato producing provinces with approximately 25 of the total canadian production statistics canada 2020 the potato industry is estimated to be worth 1b and creates 8283 jobs representing 12 of the total employment and contributing significantly to the local economy traditionally this intensive potato production was mainly rain fed however climate change has been altering precipitation patterns resulting in more frequent drought events growers have shown a growing interest in implementing si to mitigate drought related risks however si has been only implemented on 5 of potato land because growers have not been granted water sources to expand irrigation to greater areas surface water for irrigation is limited and has been fully allocated since the typical streams are relatively small and sustain sensitive aquatic ecosystems the island is underlain by a productive fractured sandstone aquifer which provides all the drinking water and the large majority nearly 100 in the summer of stream flow jiang et al 2004 jiang and somers 2009 the province imposed a moratorium on permits for high capacity irrigation wells in 2002 in response to concerns about drinking water and stream flow depletion by expanding irrigation the moratorium was in effect an application of the precautionary principle that provided the time required for more comprehensive assessments of the long term cumulative impacts of increased groundwater extractions on drinking water availability stream flow and dependent ecosystems while the availability of groundwater for si requires more assessments knowledge about the economic performance of si is also lacking and is required for making decision about si expansion and water allocation this study was conducted to investigate 18 years of potato yield responses to precipitation and water deficiency excess in prince edward island pei canada the specific objectives are to 1 estimate potential evapotranspiration of the potato plant etc 2 characterize potato yield responses to gs and monthly precipitation and water deficiency excess and estimate optimum water demand of the potato plant 3 estimate the economic benefit of si and 4 assess potential water demand of si in a heavily potato cropped watershed this study will generate data about economic benefits and environmental effects of si this information is critical for making decisions about si expansion and groundwater allocation for intensive potato production under increasing rainfall uncertainty in this humid region 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area pei is located on the eastern coast of canada the climate is characterized by mean annual precipitation of 1158 mm 25 as snow based on 1981 2010 data from the environment and climate change canada eccc weather station at the charlottetown airport environment and climate change canada charlottetown airport weather station eccc charlottetown airport 2020 the frost free period varied from 100 to 160 days the average annual growing degree days above 5 c was 1600 with may to september average degree days above 10 c being 800 the average january air temperature was 8 c and the average july air temperature was 19 c the island land surface is rolling the western section of the island has a gentle relief with slopes up to 7 the central section is more hilly including slopes up to 14 and the highest point with an elevation of 139 m above the sea level the eastern section follows a relief lying between those of the western and central areas macdougall et al 1988 the island is entirely underlain by a sandstone formation at a thickness of 1200 1600 m comprised of a sequence of permo carboniferous terrestrial red beds van de poll 1983 this formation is overlain by a layer of glacial till 0 10 m soils derived from the glacial till are sandy loam sandy loam or loamy sand well drained and relatively uniform across the island macdougall et al 1988 the soils have organic matter typically ranging from 1 5 to 3 5 nyiraneza et al 2017 and the average ph is 6 with a range of 5 0 7 2 potato production commonly takes place on these soils potato production commenced on the island in the late 1700 s and the tradition continues today with about 200 growers currently operating the production area was 15 000 ha in 1940 increased to 17 800 ha in 1965 peaked at 45 760 ha in the late 1990 s and stayed between 33 570 ha 2013 and 37 460 ha 2008 in recent years the current potato production area accounts for over 20 of all cropland corresponding to about 6 of the total land each year approximately 60 of the potatoes are destined for processing while 30 go to the fresh market through retail or food service and 10 are grown for seed purposes the most widely grown varieties include russet burbank goldrush superior yukon gold red norland and a number of proprietary varieties potato growers commonly adopted the minimum length of 3 year rotation as mandated by the province and followed local industry standard management practices as described by bernard et al 1993 traditionally growers mainly planted barley and forages e g red clover or a mix of red clover and one or two perennial grass species as the rotation crops in recent years growers have included more diverse annual crops e g spring wheat soybean corn buckwheat brown mustard or perennial hay grass crops in the rotations 2 2 data sets the provincial average potato yield data statistics canada 2020 collected from 2001 to 2018 by statistics canada s annual census of agriculture were used as one data set for relating potato average yields with meteorological parameters the census covered about 200 farms per year in pei the potato farms reported their potato areas and yields the potato area and yield were weighted in order to produce level indicators these level indicators undergo a validation process the estimates from a random sample of agriculture operations remained within the confidence interval of 95 the data represent aggregated total yield of various potato varieties in the province a second dataset was provided by the pei agriculture insurance corporation peiaic peiaic collected annual variety based potato yield data from representative participating farms to calculate benchmark variety based yields for crop production insurance compensation purposes these benchmarks reflected standard cultural practices and were used to determine production insurance compensation where in field yield losses occurred that were beyond the policy holders control the peiaic yield data were based on verified final production to count and not total yields the final production to count represents a marketable yield which is the remaining crop available for sale after cullage is subtracted from a total yield peiaic determined the variety based marketable yield for each participating farm by sampling and combined the yield data from all participating farms into a province wide benchmark yield the russet burbank rb variety yield data peiaic collected from 2000 to 2017 were used in this study as rb was the predominant variety grown in pei and can better approximate the variety aggregated yield data for verification purposes rb is the most widely grown potato variety in north america bethke et al 2014 the 2018 yield data were excluded as the data represented the harvested but not production yields because many potatoes were left in field without being harvested due to the extremely wet soil conditions in fall 2018 the meteorological data including daily precipitation air temperature and class a pan measurements from the harrington weather station of environment and climate change canada environment and climate change canada harrington weather station eccc harrington 2020 were used to calculate monthly seasonal and annual precipitation etc and water deficiency excess of potato crops the data from harrington were used simply because this station had the required data especially pan measurements available for 1988 1992 which were used to validate etc estimations and its central location is representative of average meteorological conditions for the whole island the missing data points at harrington were filled with the measurements from the nearby charlottetown airport weather station environment and climate change canada charlottetown airport weather station eccc charlottetown airport 2020 2 3 estimations of potential evapotranspiration and water deficiency excess potential evapotranspiration of the potato plant etc was estimated to approximate water demand of the potato plant firstly potential evaporation etlake from an extensive and uniform wet surface e g shallow lake was estimated using the linacre equation linacre 1977 which is a modified form of the penman equation penman 1948 for estimating etlake solely using air temperature measurements the linacre equation was adopted because only air temperature data were available as input the etlake values represented local reference evapotranspiration et0 secondly these et0 values were compared with class a pan evaporation measurements etpan multiplied by a conversion coefficient kl for validation the best value of kl was determined by adjusting kl by matching etpan kl etlake with the etpan measurements collected by eccc from 1988 to 1992 the class a pan data were provided by eccc upon request the estimated et0 values were considered validated if the best kl fell in the typical range as reported in linacre 1993 thirdly as pan measurements were only made from 1988 to 1992 the et0 values calculated from the linacre equation for the study period 2001 2018 were then converted into crop evapotranspiration etc by multiplying a crop factor kc crop type variety and development stage influence etc from crops grown in large well managed fields potato planting was assumed to match the typical planting time middle of may in pei potato growth stages and associated crop factor were defined as initiation 0 25 days may 15 june 10 kc 0 8 development stage 30 days june 11 july 10 kc 0 9 midseason 45 days july 11 august 25 kc 1 15 and late season 30 days august 26 september 25 kc 0 75 by following brouwer et al 1989 allen et al 1998 and sexton et al 2008 the growing season gs is defined as june 1 to september 30 which is similar to that as defined in maine us by benoit and grant 1985 water deficiency excess of potato plant was calculated as the difference between precipitation and etc with positive and negative values indicating water excess and deficiency respectively as indicated by long term monitoring of shallow groundwater level and stream flow in pei runoff and recharge were not accounted for gs water deficiency excess analysis as they were limited in gs jiang et al 2012 liang et al 2020 2 4 statistical analysis the responses of 18 years of yields to precipitation were simulated as the results of an un replicated irrigation experiment with precipitation rate as the treatment level the influences of other biophysical factors e g field management and soil were not analyzed regression analysis was performed by using the potato yields as the dependent variables with monthly precipitation water deficiency excess and gs precipitation and water deficiency excess as independent variables respectively the meteorological variables with potato yield were used to develop yield determining equations via a linear or polynomial regression whichever produced the best fit the significance of correlation was assessed through anova test of regression 2 5 supplemental irrigation cost benefit analysis an important question on the topic of potato water management is whether the economic gain from si can offset the associated costs in the absence of experimental data about potato yield responses to water supply varying from extremely dry to wet conditions potential total yield increases by si were estimated from the regression equation relating yield and gs precipitation it was assumed that si water supply equals to gs precipitation and that si and precipitation create similar yield responses the estimated yield gains were used to assess whether the economic return from si can offset the costs associated with si the gross profit was calculated using the 2018 potato price of 254 mg agriculture and agri food canada 2019 in the absence of local data about the costs of si the 2010 costs from maine us silver et al 2011 which has similar production conditions were used as a reference 2 6 estimating water demands for irrigation in the wilmot river watershed potential water demands for irrigation in the wilmot river watershed which represents one of the most intensively potato cropped watersheds in pei jiang et al 2015 was assessed the watershed has a drainage area of 61 km2 with 31 of the land being devoted to potato production every year from 2011 to 2017 liang et al 2020 annual potential water demands for irrigation were estimated as gs water deficiency multiplied by the percentage 31 of the land devoted to potato production in the watershed these potential water demands were compared with the empirical annual recharge average the ratios include maximum water demand from potential irrigation extraction at a watershed scale as a worst case scenario of irrigation pumping stress imposed on the groundwater discharge dependent ecosystems 3 results and discussion 3 1 weather conditions the majority of monthly precipitation averages varied within 50 100 mm at harrington with those in november and december being the highest fig 1 in the gs july had the lowest precipitation average 68 mm while june august and september averages ranged from 90 to 96 mm monthly precipitation averages were similar in june august and september but monthly precipitation in the gs fluctuated greatly with several outliers indicating inconsistent water supply to potato crops without irrigation fig 1 gs precipitation varied from 155 mm 2001 to 479 mm 2008 and averaged 340 mm with a standard deviation of 77 mm table 1 effective rainfall i e daily rainfall 5 mm in the gs averaged 86 and ranged from 78 2001 to 94 2002 the average was probably over 86 as the summation of the total amount of rainfall could be calculated without excluding 5 mm daily precipitation in this humid maritime environment where there were many days of rainfall in succession because total precipitation was very close to effective precipitation total rather than effective precipitation was adopted in all related analysis during 2001 2018 gs air temperature at harrington followed the local long term trends as presented in the study area section monthly and seasonal temperature did not significantly influence potato yield data not presented gs weekly etlake values multiplied by 1 3 matched the class a pan measurements with root mean square error rmse of 7 4 mm week fig 2 which represented the best fit rmse accounts for 33 of weekly etlake average and 20 of 1 3 maximum minimum etlake the discrepancy between the measurements and calculations from the linacre equation was likely due to the combination of measurement errors and the inability of the linacre equation to reflect the influences of meteorological parameters other than air temperature such as wind speed and relative air humidity the kl fell in the typical range in the literature e g linacre 1993 using etlake as et0 the estimated daily or weekly et0 values fig 2 were similar to the values et0 1 2 mm d around 10 2 4 mm d under 20 4 7 mm d 30 for a humid temperate region as reported by allen et al 1998 and under a similar climate in maine us e g sexton et al 2008 and new brunswick canada e g bélanger et al 2000 xing et al 2008 the etlake values were used as et0 for estimating weekly fig 3 monthly fig 4 and gs water deficiency excess table 1 evapotranspiration generally exceeded precipitation and recharge was limited in potato fields between june and october evapotranspiration subsequently diminished and snowmelt and or rainfall created significant recharge during october and may fig 3 these results are consistent with the responses of groundwater level and stream flow to seasonal recharge as reported by jiang et al 2012 and liang et al 2020 gs etc averaged 421 mm with a standard deviation of 18 mm table 1 the small standard deviation indicates that annual variation of gs etc was relatively small while the precipitation averages in may and june were higher than the etc values the respective precipitation averages in july and august were 70 and 37 mm lower than the etc values of the potato plant indicating water deficiency in the critical growing period under rain fed conditions fig 4 the water deficiency was much more severe in the extremely dry season of 2001 fig 4 3 2 potato yield responses to precipitation and water deficiency excess variety aggregated potato yields varied from 19 2 to 35 mg ha with an average of 31 2 and standard deviation of 3 3 mg ha and the rb yields varied from 16 3 to 33 2 mg ha with an average of 29 5 and standard deviation of 3 8 mg ha table 1 the rb yields were slightly lower than the variety aggregated yields partly because the rb yields represent marketable yields which should be lower than the total yields these yields were compatible with the data from a neighboring region i e maine us silver et al 2011 in 2001 the gs precipitation was only 45 of averages of 2001 2018 table 1 the extreme dry conditions resulted in extremely low yields variety aggregated 19 2 mg ha vs rb 16 3 mg ha the regression between variety aggregated yields and gs precipitation produced a second order polynomial curve with a perfect correlation r2 0 88 p 0 001 table 2 this regression indicates that gs precipitation accounted for 88 of the year to year variation in potato yield potato yield increased with the initial increments of water supply from 150 to 360 mm became relatively insensitive i e plateauing to water supplied from 360 to 460 mm then decreased with very high water supplies fig 5 note that the yield determining equation in fig 5 only characterizes how variety aggregated yields respond to gs precipitation under average soil weather and management conditions in pei as such the yield of a specific variety from a specific field year may deviate from this regression equation depending on how the field s soil and management practices differ from average conditions a perfect second order polynomial correlation r2 0 88 p 0 001 also exists between the variety aggregated yields and gs water deficiency excess fig 6 table 2 the fact that gs water deficiency excess was linearly correlated with gs precipitation r2 0 98 p 0 001 as a result of gs etc being close to a constant table 1 can well explain why the two correlations are so similar maximizing potato yield requires balancing the water supply and demand of potato plants in time and space applying this principle and the yield determining equations in figs 5 and 6 supplementing water supply with irrigation at 34 175 mm would be required in the majority 13 18 72 2 of the gss supplementing at 295 mm would be required in the 2001 season 5 5 and dewatering at rates of 18 34 mm would be required for four 22 2 gss i e 2002 2008 2009 and 2010 as the excessive water supply led to the yield going from plateauing to decreasing figs 5 and 6 the responses of rb yield to gs precipitation and water deficiency excess were also characterized by polynomial regression curves figs 7 and 8 the correlations were significant r2 0 77 and p 0 001 for precipitation and r2 0 79 and p 0 001 for water deficiency excess table 1 these rb yield data indicate that gs precipitation and water deficiency excess explained 77 and 79 of the yield variability respectively although the variety aggregated and rb data sets were from two different sources they produced highly consistent statistical results this consistency increases confidence in the yield determining equations solving the derivatives of the yield determining equations figs 5 and 6 by setting the yields to zero produced the optimum water supply for the potato plant as 460 and 399 mm for the variety aggregated and rb cases respectively this optimum water supply is highly consistent with the optimum water demand of the potato plant as indicated by the gs average etc 421 mm this consistency suggests that the estimations of the optimum water demand as indicated by etc are reliable the optimum water demand rates calculated from the etc data in fig 4 were 1 4 2 6 4 3 4 3 and 2 4 mm per day in may june july august and september respectively potato yield responded relatively insensitively as gs rainfall fell within 360 and 460 mm fig 5 or water deficiency excess varied within about 100 and 100 mm fig 6 for rb the insensitive precipitation fell within 300 400 mm fig 7 or water deficiency excess between about 70 and 0 mm fig 8 interestingly similar insensitive yield responses and water supply ranges were also observed by shaykewich et al 2002 from supplemental irrigation experiments in manitoba canada this consistency implies that potato yield intrinsically responds insensitively to a fairly large range of water supply as water supply approaches the optimum point this is very similar to the insensitive yield response to a fairly large range of fertilizer n input before reaching the optimum n input point e g zebarth et al 2012 the insensitive water supply range provides an opportunity for growers to consider the lower i e 360 mm as water supply or 100 mm as water deficiency excess instead of the upper bound i e 460 mm as water supply or 100 mm as water deficiency excess as a quasi optimum si water supply target adopting this quasi optimum target can potentially not only produce a yield almost identical to the maximum yield as determined by the yield determining equation but also reduce the cost of si pumping and conserve water which is important where water sources are limited in availability it is worth noting that the insensitive water supply range likely varies with potato variety the timing of monthly precipitation in the gs influenced potato yields differently table 2 precipitation in may was negatively correlated with rb yields r2 0 28 p 0 1 because excessive soil moisture in may can delay planting which can in turn reduce rb yield as a result of a shortened growing period for this long season variety in june the potato plants initiated and established esp for the commonly grown rb variety when leaf area was small and temperatures were usually cool water use etc was relatively low fig 4 while precipitation was relatively high fig 1 as such water deficiency likely did not occur and thus precipitation or water deficiency excess in june did not affect potato yields significantly in july when tubers initiated the plants were relatively sensitive to water stress however precipitation or water deficiency excess in july did not impose a significant effect on yield table 2 note that precipitation usually exceeded etc in may and june fig 4 in this humid region which allowed the excessive precipitation to be stored in soil and carried over into july this carried over soil moisture may have mitigated some of the impacts of rainfall deficiency in july resulting in the lack of significant yield response to july precipitation precipitation in august significantly positively influenced variety aggregated r2 0 4 p 0 05 and rb r2 0 3 p 0 1 yields table 2 water deficiency excess in august also significantly influenced variety aggregated r2 0 65 p 0 001 and rb r2 0 56 p 0 05 yields this is probably because potato tubers were bulking in august when the potato plants were most sensitive to water stress sexton et al 2008 water deficiency excess in september was positively correlated with variety aggregated r2 0 35 p 0 1 and rb yields r2 0 34 p 0 1 having sufficient soil moisture in september likely helped increase the yields by providing more time for the long season variety to grow the optimum water demand rates of the potato plant and yield responding patterns as discussed above have important implications for si management as potato yields were less sensitive to water supply and water deficiency usually did not occur in june implementing si in this month to match the gs optimum water demand should be a lower priority supplying water at 4 3 mm per day i e 1 2 in per week in july and august is important to achieve the optimum yield goal for long season varieties applying 2 3 mm per day in september can help to achieve the optimum yield target while adopting the gs quasi optimum water demand targets for water conservation reducing water input should be done outside of august since irrigation is meant to supplement the water deficiency created by insufficient rainfall in this humid area the recommended water supply rates must be deducted by local short term forecasted rainfall in all cases however controlling water supply by matching si plus gs rainfall with the optimum water demand targets is challenging as gs rainfall can vary substantially and is unpredictable in this humid area as a result applying a similar irrigation rate si in two growing seasons with two different rainfall rates r1 and r2 can end up with two largely different gs water supply rates si r1 vs si r2 and yield responses for example if r1 si is in the sensitive range and r2 si is in the insensitive range as indicated in fig 5 si r1 can create a yield response but r2 si cannot this may explain why some growers who applied a similar irrigation rate observed a yield benefit in some seasons but not in other seasons in pei personal communications likewise short term irrigation experiments may also produce inconsistent yield responses to a similar irrigation rate in a humid area but the inconsistency as driven by two different gs water supply rates may be attributed to other factors by mistake because the experiments may not map out the responding patterns including both sensitive and insensitive ranges as shown in fig 5 on an annual basis both variety aggregated r2 0 73 p 0 001 and rb r2 0 53 p 0 005 yields were significantly correlated with annual precipitation using a second order polynomial regression however the physics basis of these correlations is questionable although annual precipitation was used to correlate with potato yield in maine us by benoit and grant 1985 the fall winter early spring off season precipitation was normally higher than the gs precipitation fig 3 but the majority of the off season precipitation became groundwater recharge runoff and evapotranspiration with the remaining water stored in the soil which can create a saturated soil condition before planting potato crops jiang et al 2011 however growers are not able to plant potatoes under saturated or quasi saturated soil conditions as the agricultural equipment can get stuck in the wet fields the machines cannot work in fields until the soil moisture decreases below about 65 water holding capacity for the typical soils loam or sandy loam in pei this level of moisture which was estimated to correspond to about 25 mm of available water in the top 30 cm of soil where the majority of potato roots are present by using relevant soil retention parameters could diminish to the wilting point level through evapotranspiration within about 10 days without new precipitation and or irrigation given the typical crop etc of 1 4 2 6 mm d as shown before in addition this level of moisture only corresponds to a small fraction 7 8 of gs precipitation averages table 1 annual precipitation was correlated with potato yield simply because annual precipitation was linearly correlated with gs precipitation r2 0 46 p 0 01 as a consequence annual precipitation is mathematically correlated with potato yield but the yield responses were primarily driven by gs precipitation in other words only the upcoming gs precipitation rather than the previous off season precipitation had a significant impact on potato plant growth as identified above gs precipitation as water supply was the dominant variable responsible for year to year variation of potato yield which constitutes the key rationale for improving water management the 18 years of yield and weather data also demonstrated a wide range of water supply scenarios dry quasi optimum and wet and are important for potato water management decision making in this region particularly in the absence of long term irrigation experiment data however the data were derived from random precipitation as water supply and may not fully reflect real world si conditions recommended optimum soil moisture thresholds for potato plant growth range from 65 to 85 water holding capacity for vegetative growth tuber initiative and tuber bulking stages and from 50 to 65 water holding capacity for maturation stages e g allen et al 1998 sexton et al 2008 although the precipitation in four 2002 2007 2010 2011 of the 18 seasons was very close to the optimum water demand of the potato plant whether the random precipitation rates table 1 could have consistently maintained soil moisture within the optimum thresholds for irrigation is unknown it also remains to be verified whether strictly respecting the optimum moisture thresholds via si could have greatly changed the yield response patterns as shown in figs 5 8 irrigation studies conducted by shock et al 1998 in oregon us and lynch et al 1995 in alberta canada suggested that a short duration of water stress can result in an appreciable reduction in tuber yield and quality it should be noted that irrigation can meet the optimum moisture thresholds provided that precipitation does not exceed the water supply required for respecting the thresholds but cannot do so if the precipitation oversupplies water unless soil dewatering is carried out in this humid region in other words consistently meeting the optimum moisture thresholds would require a soil dewatering system such as tile drainage in addition to si as excessive water supply in the form of precipitation occurred in four out of the 18 years since the rb yield case had similarities with the variety aggregated yield case in terms of yield responses to precipitation and water deficiency excess it was considered as a validation of the latter and hereafter discussions will only focus on the variety aggregated yield case unless otherwise noted 3 3 economic implications of supplemental irrigation as predicted by the yield determining equation in fig 6 in an extremely dry year such as 2001 a rainfall depth duration frequency of 5 5 applying irrigation at 295 mm would be required to increase the yield from the rain fed level of 19 7 mg ha to the optimum si level of 33 mg ha i e 13 3 mg ha gain although reaching a yield gain of 35 19 7 15 3 mg ha is also possible in most years a rainfall depth duration frequency of 72 2 applying irrigation from 34 mm to 175 mm would be required to increase the yield from the rain fed level of 29 7 mg ha to the optimum si level of 33 mg ha i e 3 3 mg ha gain assuming 90 of total yield being marketable yield jiang et al 2019 multiplying the potato sale price e g 254 mg with the yield gains produced the si gross profits table 3 the gross profits represent increased gross profit from si alone as the growers would have to spend money on all other production costs regardless of si silver et al 2011 categorized the 2010 si costs in maine us into three classes capital costs equipment interest water development pond construction permitting engineering and operating and maintenance costs labor power repair they estimated the costs for hose reel traveler systems and center pivot systems with or without water development costs at 20 40 or 80 ha field size categories respectively as all these parameters influenced the overall costs they also noted that their cost estimates had a variable component reflecting the demand for irrigation water as the demand for irrigation water was dependent upon rainfall while operating costs increased with increasing amounts of irrigation applied average cost declined the respective average annual costs at 2010 prices associated with a center pivot system with and without water source development at 20 and 40 ha field sizes reported by silver et al 2011 were used as reference costs these reference costs were adjusted for inflation using an annual inflation average of 1 78 https www usinflationcalculator com inflation historical inflation rates accessed 28 july 2020 and converted into canadian currency by using the 2018 conversion rate 1 3 deducting the gross benefits of si with the si costs produces the net financial benefit of si table 3 based on the cost and benefit data in table 3 si has to increase total potato yield by over 10 6 and 5 9 mg ha for a 20 ha field size scenario and 5 2 and 3 3 mg t for a 40 ha field size scenario with and without water source development respectively in order to generate net profile as expected in an extremely dry year such as 2001 si could have substantially increased financial benefits as a result of potential total yield increase from 19 2 to 33 mg ha regardless of 20 and 40 ha field sizes with and without water source development compared to rain fed production table 3 however this only occurred in 5 5 of the 18 years in most of the 18 years si would have induced negative financial benefits in both 20 ha and 40 ha field sizes with and without water source development table 3 if si could have boosted the yield from 29 7 to 35 as shown in fig 5 in some seasons the gross profit 1146 ha from si would only offset the si costs 832 ha in a 40 ha field size scenario without water source development costs incurred these results demonstrate a great financial challenge of implementing si in this traditionally rain fed production area how the costs in maine us compare with the costs in pei is yet to be fully assessed particularly given pei s smaller fields and undulating often challenging terrain for center pivot systems in addition si can influence potato quality parameters lynch et al 1995 porter et al 1999 such as scab and specific gravity which can greatly influence potato sale price and associated profitability as well this is beyond the scope of this work however the potential yield gains observed here in response to rainfall suggest more work needs to be done to assess if strictly respecting soil moisture as required by optimum potato plant growth by si coupled with optimizing other potato production management variables can enhance potato productivity and quality to make si consistently profitable 3 4 implications of supplemental irrigation for groundwater management assuming equal water access for irrigating all potato lands 31 of land mass in the wilmot river watershed and annual recharge average being 400 mm as estimated by jiang et al 2004 and liang et al 2020 potential si would utilize 2 6 13 5 of annual recharge average i e 31 of 34 mm 400 mm to 175 mm 400 mm in 72 of the 18 years and 23 of annual recharge average i e 31 of 295 mm 400 mm in the extremely dry 2001 season in 5 5 of the 18 years based on water deficiency as shown in fig 6 although the potential extractions were not high compared to the annual recharge average except in the 2001 season it is important to recognize that irrigation extraction would mainly utilize groundwater storage as irrigation only occurs during the gs when recharge is limited fig 3 groundwater used for irrigation in the gs is expected to be fully replenished in the aquifer by forthcoming recharge in this recharge rich region however the concurrence of high extraction for irrigation with low recharge in the gs especially in the extremely drought prone season of 2001 representing the worst case scenario could impose high seasonal stress on the groundwater discharge dependent ecosystems by significantly reducing groundwater discharge into the receiving tributaries addressing the seasonal conflict of water uses between the environment and humans in an intensively farmed watershed poses a great challenge for groundwater management in this humid region 4 conclusions the 2001 2018 variety aggregated potato yield responses to gs precipitation were characterized by second order polynomial equations with 88 of the variation of the yield being explained by gs precipitation variety aggregated yield increased from 19 2 to 33 mg ha as gs precipitation increased from 155 to 360 mm responded relatively insensitive 33 35 mg ha as gs precipitation varied within 360 460 mm and then decreased to 31 mg ha as gs precipitation exceeded 460 mm similar correlation exists between the 2000 2017 russet burbank rb potato yields and gs precipitation gs etc of the potato plant was estimated to be 421 mm which was consistent with the optimum water demands 399 460 mm determined from the second order polynomial regressions between potato yields and gs precipitation to maximize potato yield 16 out of the 18 gss would require various levels 30 300 mm of supplemental irrigation while four out of the 18 seasons would require dewatering soil at 30 100 mm to mitigate excessive water supply on a monthly basis precipitation and water deficiency excess in august significantly positively influenced variety aggregated and rb yields precipitation in may significantly negatively influenced rb yield while water deficiency excess in september significantly positively influenced both variety aggregated and rb yields supplemental irrigation using a center pivot system would generate net profit in an extremely dry year such as 2001 but would lead to a net loss of profit in most years under both a 20 ha and a 40 ha field size scenarios irrigation extractions could use at anywhere between 2 6 and 23 of annual average recharge in one of the most intensively potato cropped watersheds depending on the year while the groundwater consumed by irrigation in the gs can be replenished by the forthcoming recharge the concurrence of high extraction for irrigation with low recharge in the dry season especially in an extremely drought prone season such as 2001 could impose high seasonal stress on the groundwater discharge dependent ecosystems in an intensively farmed watershed in this humid region this study demonstrates that long term yield responses to precipitation in a temperate humid climate can provide important information for making decision about si management and water resources allocation where short term control experiments cannot provided that the influences on yield from other management and soil

10012,data assimilation a state of the art method that merges remote sensing data with a dynamic model to improve model performance has been widely used in land surface process modeling application of data assimilation under various water conditions can provide insight of crop response to different water supply rates which is useful for agricultural water management in arid and semi arid regions for this purpose we developed a generic data assimilation methodology by integrating both the shuffled complex evolution sce and the ensemble kalman filter enkf algorithms into the simple algorithm for yield and evapotranspiration safye model to provide improved simulation of winter wheat biomass and yield and simulation of evapotranspiration et under different water supply scenarios an experiment with nine irrigation scenarios was conducted during the 2013 2015 growing cycles field spectral data were employed to retrieve the leaf area index lai which was then used as a single state variable to determine other parameters in the safye model using a global optimization algorithm time series lai was eventually assimilated in the safye model based on the enkf algorithm to improve overall model simulation the results showed that the simulated crop growth dynamics followed the measurements well in most cases when the estimated lai was assimilated the accuracy of simulated biomass at the daily step was improved with the maximum rmse decreased from 199 4 to 123 8 g m 2 and from 466 6 to 393 4 g m 2 for the 2013 2014 and 2014 2015 growing seasons respectively a good agreement was also achieved between the estimated and field measured grain yield r2 0 901 rmse 31 9 g m 2 rrmse 6 55 for both growing seasons the simulation of soil water content in the top 0 20 cm soil layer was better rmse 3 3 5 0 mm than that of 0 100 cm layer rmse 11 7 29 6 mm accuracy of the simulated et under early stage water deficit scenarios was lower than that under other scenarios with a positive mean relative error of 14 3 4 24 3 during two growing seasons this study demonstrates the great potential of coupling remote sensing data to improve the performance of safye model in modeling winter wheat growth graphical abstract ga1 keywords winter wheat safye model data assimilation lai evapotranspiration 1 introduction wheat is one of the major cereal crops cultivated in china

fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation fapar biomass and yield evapotranspiration et leaf and canopy nitrogen and soil moisture can be derived from remote sensing data many approaches for estimating these variables are based on conventional techniques by establishing statistical models between field measurements and spectral information such as vegetation index and spectral transformation liu et al 2012 liang et al 2015 these approaches are usually site specific and can lead to inconsistent results with the change of crop types or geographical locations fang et al 2011 cheng et al 2016 data assimilation a technique widely used in numerical weather prediction navon 2009 can incorporate observed data into dynamic mechanistic models to generate optimal estimates of state variables in a system huang et al 2019 for agricultural management crop growth models are effective tools to understand crop growth and diagnostic water fertilizer status in a growing cycle from sowing to harvest involving exchange of matter and energy in the soil vegetation atmosphere system the integration of spatial temporal information of the system captured by remote sensing can be useful for updating model state and correcting the potential trajectory of incorrect parameterization and mechanism machwitz et al 2014 representative assimilation strategies can be grouped into two categories variational and sequential approaches liang and qin 2008 the essence of the variational method is similar to the process of crop model calibration by optimizing a given criterion e g minimizing a cost function hence model parameters or initial state variables e g seeding density soil moisture are adjusted by obtaining the optimal agreement between the simulated and

models many studies have mainly focused on potential yield forecast at large scale and lacked a systematic analysis of different growth conditions e g water fertilizer heat ines et al 2013 conducted a study to assimilate crop lai into the dssat model using enkf and found that a substantial improvement can be achieved in crop yield prediction de wit and van diepen 2007 assimilated soil moisture in the wofost model to study the effectiveness of enkf for correcting simulation errors and found that assimilation clearly improved yield estimation of winter wheat for majority of regions they studied 66 silvestro et al 2017a evaluated data assimilation in both aquacrop and safy models for wheat yield estimation and obtained the lowest relative root mean square error of 18 using enkf with the safy model however most of the crop models were designed based on healthy growth scenarios which is difficult in effectively taking into consideration of various adverse stresses camargo and kemanian 2016 further studies are needed to evaluate the performance of data assimilation in order to improve simulation accuracies under different growth conditions the simple algorithm for yield and evapotranspiration safye model a highly scalable and robust model developed and promoted by duchemin et al 2008 2015 battude et al 2017 zhang et al 2019a was used in our study to model crop growth under various water conditions using a data assimilation approach in this study we developed an assimilation framework by incorporating canopy spectral data into the safye model to model winter wheat growth and yield and estimate soil water consumption under different water conditions both the sce shuffled complex evolution and enkf algorithms were implemented to complement each other in the assimilation process the main objective of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of the enkf assimilation method for improving the estimation of biomass yield et and soil water content under different water scenarios 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the data used in this study were obtained from a field irrigation experiment conducted at a water saving irrigation station of laboratory of agricultural soil and water engineering northwest china latitude 34 17 n longitude 108 04 e and elevation 506 m a s l fig 1 the experimental field was located in a typical irrigated agricultural district characterized by semiarid warm temperature and continental monsoon climate the average annual air temperature precipitation and potential et were 12 9 c 635 1 mm and 1500 mm respectively the soil of the experimental field was loam with an average field capacity of 0 31 cm3 cm 3 permanent wilting point of 0 12 cm3 cm 3 and dry bulk density of 1 31 g cm 3 measured in the laboratory using pressure plate apparatus the meteorological data air temperature relative humidity and sunshine hours etc during winter wheat growing seasons were automatically collected by the on site weather station 2 2 experimental design field experiment was carried out with nine irrigation scenarios during the 2013 2014 and 2014 2015 growing seasons two factors of irrigation management practice irrigation amount and timing were considered in the experiment for irrigation amount 80 mm sufficient and 40 mm deficit of water were applied according to local seasonal water demands wang and feng 2012 irrigation periods were determined following five winter wheat growth stages irrigation was applied at a given rate at these five growth stages except for a period consisting of two consecutive stages resulting in eight irrigation scenarios as given in table 1 in addition a control scenario with 80 mm water application at all growth stages was used to represent healthy growth condition each water deficit treatment was replicated three times while the control treatment replicated twice due to field restrictions winter wheat was sown on 15 october in both 2013 and 2014 after maize was harvested and final maturation was on 7 june in 2014 and 2 june in 2015 seeding density was 400 per m2 following a local practice the same winter wheat cultivar no 22 xiaoyan was used for the two seasons before planting urea and phosphorous pentoxide were broadcast and incorporated into soil at a rate of 140 kg ha 1 and 50 kg ha 1 respectively the plot size was 2 m 4 m consisting of 9 rows of plants a 1 5 m depth waterproof plastic partition was placed between adjacent plots to avoid water exchange all experimental treatments were randomly assigned to the plots other crop management practices were also followed to control weed pests and disease 2 3 data collection 2 3 1 crop and soil data crop data collected mainly included lai aboveground dry biomass and yield in each plot lai was measured between eight to nine times during the respective growing seasons using a sunscan canopy analyzer delta t devices ltd cambridge uk the measurements including lai and par were taken from the average of three replicate readings and were recorded in a palmtop aboveground biomass was measured concurrently with lai measurements the aboveground shoot portions of 15 winter wheat plants were collected and dried at 75 c for 72 h to determine the dry weight meanwhile the density of plants per square meter was counted to calculate the dry mass per square meter grain yields were harvested and measured at the maturity stage grains were threshed and weighed after air dried to a constant weight volumetric soil water content was measured using a neutron probe nanjing chishun science and technology co ltd china from the soil surface to a depth of 120 cm at 20 cm intervals soil water content collection was concurrent with other data and supplementary measurements were taken before irrigation for each plot 2 3 2 meteorological data daily meteorological data are essential to run the model the key data including air temperatures wind speed relative air humidity solar radiation and precipitation were recorded directly from the dynamet weather station from 2013 to 2015 dynamax inc houston tx us about 100 m away from the experimental site all data was regularly logged in a data logger cr1000 campbell scientific inc logan ut us the reference evapotranspiration et0 was calculated based on the weather station data using the fao penman monteith method allen et al 1998 the dynamics of et0 and radiation are depicted in fig 2 2 3 3 canopy reflectance spectra and preprocessing canopy reflectance spectra were collected using an asd fieldspec 3 spectroradiometer analytical spectral devices inc boulder colorado usa under cloudless condition at sloar noon spectral measurements were taken at about 1 3 m above the top of the canopy covering 3 rows of plants when the sensor looked downward vertically at each plot 10 scans were used and calibration measurement was made every 5 min using a white spectralon panel field canopy spectral measurements started from the reviving stage and were concurrent with that of other crop variables and soil water content after measurements each spectrum was smoothed using the quadratic polynomial of five spans the lai a key variable indicating crop growth and development status was selected as a unique coupling variable in assimilation systems therefore deriving lai from by reflectance spectra accurately is important various methods such as vegetation index non parametric regression and radiation transfer model rtm inversion have been reported for successful crop lai retrieval verrelst et al 2015 the partial least squares regression plsr compared with other methods could construct several principal components to take full advantage of the spectral information and was used to retrieve crop lai in this study an acceptable retrieval accuracy for lai was achieved with an r2 of 0 89 and rmse of 0 42 in previous study as reported in zhang et al 2019a a detailed description on lai estimation can be found in zhang et al 2018 thus the observed time series lai during the two winter wheat growing cycles were prepared for assimilating with crop model 3 model and methodology 3 1 safye model description the agro meteorological model named safye simple algorithm for yield and evapotranspiration developed by duchemin et al 2015 was used in this study the safye model combines the safy model with a water balance

the effect of potential water stress water budget and evapotranspiration components were supplemented in safye water exchange is calculated using a water balance equation determined with several irrigation components evapotranspiration runoff and infiltration a simplified three soil layers evaporation root and deep layer are used for processing soil water transfer thus water transfer mechanisms are simulated in three soil layers gravity and diffusive fluxes and the interaction between soil and atmosphere evaporation and transpiration evapotranspiration is the main consumption source of soil water storage in safye model the fao 56 method allen et al 1998 multiplying et0 with dual crop coefficients ke and kt to estimate the rate of plant transpiration and soil evaporation

proposed by duchemin et al 2015 given that the sensitivity of water deficit tolerance varies during the growing stage a nonlinear stress function was adopted following the aquacrop model raes et al

of the kalman filter evensen 2003 is one of the typical methods of sequential data assimilation which can incorporate available observations to adjust the model state value of the trajectory the basic principles can be described as below the kalman filter algorithm assumes that the observations are linearly related to a state variable x t e g lai at time t as 12 z t h x t v t where z t is the observation value v t is a gaussian random white noise with a mean of zero and observation error covariance r h is the measurement operator that maps the model variable space to the observation space and t represents time at the current time t we assume that an ensemble of forecast x t f x 1 t f x 2 t f x n t f n ensemble size z t z 1 t z 2 t z n t are made thus the forecast x t is gaussian distributed with mean x t f and error covariance p t f based on this assumption the estimated state variable and error covariance are updated as 13 x t f m x t 1 a 14 x t a x t f k t z t h x t f where m is the function that transfers the state from time t 1 to time t the safye model in this study x t a and x t f are the analyzed optimal estimate ensemble the mean of x t a is the best estimate at time t and forecasted vector of the ensemble at time t respectively the k t is the kalman gain at time t defined as 15 k t p t f h t h p t f h t r t 1 in the present study lai was the only state

observable biophysical descriptors such as lai yield and or biomass distribution in different organs of the plants ceglar et al 2011 in general model calibration is conducted using field observations measurements rather than remote sensing derived estimates because of the scaling difficulty in remote sensing products and their associated uncertainties huang et al 2019 therefore the first step is to calibrate the model for this region using the collected field data the inputs outputs and parameters of the safye model are given in table 2 typically the parameters could be categorized as conservative and specific the conservative parameters i e crop specific are general to a given species without significant change in most cases which can be referenced from literature studies the specific non conservative parameters have to be calibrated for different cultivars geographical locations environment and management practices the determination and sources are listed in table 2 the four parameters of pla plb stt and rs controlling the crop growth and development should be calibrated using in situ measured lai these parameters were then adjusted and optimized by minimizing the root mean square error rmse between time series simulated lai and in situ measured lai the cost function for parameter calibration is as follows 18 min rmse 1 n i 1 n lai mea lai sim 2 to effectively optimize the cost function a global optimization algorithm the shuffled complex evolution university of arizona sce ua developed by duan et al 1993 was used the sce ua algorithm is insensitive to the initial values of the parameters by integrating the concepts of competitive and shuffled complex evolution which can efficiently prevent from convergence to a locally optimal solution different parameter matrix presents an optimal solution data used for parameter calibration was from unstressed healthy plots i400 during the 2013 2014 growing season fig 2 a total of 500 repetitions were conducted to reduce the uncertainty of parameter changes and high frequency parameter values were selected after calibration the model is ready to simulate lai biomass eta and water balance under different irrigation scenarios 3 3 2 assimilation the second step is to assimilate observations into the calibrated safye model to dynamically adjust the model state the safye was ran from the sowing date on the first day of simulation with gaussian white noise added as perturbation to the simulated lai to generate an ensemble of 50 forecasted lai flai1 flai2 flai50 if an observed lai was available at time t gaussian perturbations were added to generate a 50 observation ensemble flai1 flai2 flai50 then the forecast ensemble and the observation ensemble were processed using the enkf algorithm to generate an optimal ensemble of lai estimate at time t to update the state variable using eq 14 the mean of the optimal estimate ensemble would be input to the safye model as a benchmark to simulate the state of the next step time t 1 if there is no observed lai at time t the forward simulation would be conducted using the model alone the above process was repeated until the last observation had been assimilated and the safye model was run to the end of the crop growth cycle to achieve these goals an updating assimilation algorithm based on the enkf was developed the performance of the assimilation framework was evaluated using the field data with three statistical criteria the root mean square error rmse the relative rmse rrmse and the refined index of agreement d r willmott et al 2012 results of the lai with and without assimilation were also compared 4 results 4 1 evaluation of assimilation for crop lai dry aboveground biomass and grain yield estimation 4 1 1 leaf area index fig 3 depicts the seasonal variation of the observed lai and simulated lai with and without data assimilation under different irrigation scenarios results showed that the simulated lai followed the general growth dynamics as represented by the observed lai in most cases with a peak around day after sowing das 200 during the 2013 2014 growing season due to a low initial soil water content the development of crop lai was delayed with rapid growth starting after das 150 apparent difference between the simulated and retrieved lai was observed for all irrigation scenarios during the period of das 175 188 when the temperature and solar radiation dropped suddenly fig 2 resulting in a stress effect in model simulation inconsistent results were observed in water scenarios dw r and dr j for the two growing cycles owing to different meteorological conditions and initial soil water conditions leading to noticeable underestimation of the model without data assimilation in 2014 2015 the accuracies of the simulated lai are given in table 3 in general the accuracies of irrigation scenarios with a total amount of 240 mm water 2013 2014 rmse 0 2 0 3 2014 2015 rmse 0 2 0 8 were better than those of 120 mm water 2013 2014 rmse 0 3 0 5 2014 2015 rmse 0 2 0 9 in both growing seasons higher accuracy was obtained for the later stage water deficit scenarios dj h and dh f rrmse 10 than for the early stage water deficit scenarios 20 rmse 30 the variations of dr of different irrigation scenarios for the lai were consistent in terms of rmse and rrmse with more than 0 8 in later stage water deficit scenarios the simulated lai with data assimilation followed the dynamic of the observed lai better than that without data assimilation in both growing cycles the large discrepancies between the simulated and observed lai was reduced through data assimilation for i120dr j and i240dr j 2013 2014 and dw r and dr j 2014 2015 fig 3 the accuracy of the assimilated lai showed a significant improvement with the minimum rmse rrmse and maximum dr achieving 0 1 2 0 and 0 95 respectively good agreement rrmse 10 was also achieved between the simulated and observed lai for the eight irrigation scenarios this demonstrates that lai simulation can be improved when observed lai is available for assimilation using the safye model 4 1 2 aboveground dry biomass comparisons of the simulated biomass with and without assimilation under the eight irrigation scenarios are shown in fig 4 and table 3 similar to lai better agreement between the simulated and measured biomass was achieved for later stage water deficit scenarios with minimum rmse rrmse and dr of 47 4 6 8 and 0 96 respectively the accuracy of rrmse 30 for i120dw r in 2013 and i120dr j i240dw r in 2014 growing seasons were obtained showing an inferior performance in interpreting biomass dynamic under such water conditions the deviation between simulated and measured biomass mainly emerged from doy 175 when winter wheat was in the tillering stage the performance of the simulated biomass with data assimilation for i120 240dw r showed improvement in comparison with that without assimilation with the rmse and rrmse decreased from 36 5 to 22 7 and 23 2 10 7 in 2013 2014 and from 29 1 to 15 9 and 38 4 27 9 in 2014 2015 growing cycles respectively although results showed obvious difference between simulated biomass with and without data assimilation for the early stage water deficits scenarios the improvement for the later stage water deficits scenarios i120 240dj h and i120 240dh f was limited as shown by rmse rrmse and dr 4 1 3 grain yield the simulated daily increment of biomass partitioned to grain under each irrigation scenario was also displayed in fig 4 the formation of grain yield starts when lai stops increase i e the daily lai increment reaches zero eq 3 pl 0 this was at approximately das 195 when winter wheat was at the heading stage specifically this was das 198 in 2013 2014 and 192 in 2014 2015 due to varying weather conditions in the two growth cycles a comparison between the measured and simulated final grain yield is shown in fig 5 a good agreement was observed with a satisfactory overall performance r2 0 90 rmse 31 9 g m 2 rrmse 6 6 and dr 0 824 although inconsistency was observed for some scenarios the samples are distributed close to the 1 1 reference line and mostly within the 95 confidence interval the larger discrepancy was mainly observed in treatments i120dr j and i120dh f in both seasons in general the safye model with data assimilation showed improved performance in simulating crop grain yield under different irrigation scenarios 4 2 evaluation of soil water content and crop actual evapotranspiration simulation 4 2 1 total soil water content in 0 20 cm and 0 100 cm soil layers as described in section 3 1 the safye model simplified water transfer in all three soil layers evaporation root and deep layer the simulation results of soil water content with data assimilation for each irrigation scenarios in the top 0 20 cm and 0 1 m soil layers during the two growing cycles were evaluated and the results are shown in fig 5 and table 4 for the 0 20 cm soil layer the safye model could simulate the variation of soil water during field consumption and after irrigation the simulated water content for each irrigation scenario followed well 10 rrmse 20 with the in situ measured soil moisture in both seasons the comparable performance was observed in both 120 mm and 240 mm irrigation amount with the rmse ranging from 3 3 to 5 0 mm the maximum root depth of winter wheat during one growing cycle is around 1 0 1 2 m and about 80 of the roots were concentrate in the 0 40 cm soil depth xue et al 2003 therefore water storage in the 0 1 m soil layer was the main source for crop growth consumption in general the variation of total water content in 0 1 m soil layer ranged from around 250 120 mm the simulated dynamics of soil water content followed the variability of in situ measurements for each water stress scenario the soil water consumption was derived using a soil water balance approach which was mainly determined by et related to crop lai eq 6 therefore the consumption rates descending slope of soil water content increased with crop canopy development during the winter dormancy stage before 150 das water reduction by crop consumption was long lasting and the simulated values were well consistent with the measurements discrepancy was observed when the crop was at the reviving stage and the errors accumulated until the end of the growth stage comparing the accuracy of simulated soil water content at 0 1 m soil depth greater errors were easily observed in early stage water deficit scenarios i120 240dw r r j than that in other scenarios in both seasons 4 2 2 soil evaporation and crop transpiration crop evapotranspiration is a key factor in indicating crop development status and is critical for estimating crop water requirements and determining irrigation regimes fig 6 shows the dynamics of the simulated soil evaporation crop transpiration and cumulative et for each irrigation scenario during the two growing cycles the measured total soil water consumption and simulated total et are also given in table 5 the simulated soil evaporation for the top 20 cm soil layer showed consistent variability for each irrigation scenario in both cycles daily soil evaporation was relatively stable at around 0 1 mm d 1 during the growing season evaporation increased significantly to a maximum of 2 0 mm d 1 after irrigation at the peak growth stage 175 200 das soil evaporation for the dr j and dj h irrigation scenarios declined to zero due to water deficit and lush canopy this was much more obvious in the second season due to a denser canopy higher lai the simulated crop transpiration showed a similar variation trend as that of crop lai similar to soil evaporation crop transpiration also increased significantly right after irrigation the dynamics of crop transpiration at four water deficit stages were different a series of low transpiration 0 25 mm d 1 before the first irrigation das 182 was observed for the i120 240dw r scenario and then increased considerably to 6 mm d 1 with three consecutive irrigations similarly simulated transpiration for the i120 240dr j scenarios was consistent except for a stage of the bulge after winter irrigation conversely no transpiration was observed in later stage non irrigation scenario in both seasons i e i120dh f treatment in general the inter annual variability of et for each irrigation scenario in both growing cycles was comparable ranging from 192 to 327 mm and 202 347 mm respectively the simulated cumulative et in the irrigation amount of 240 mm scenarios were greater than that in the irrigation amount of 120 mm with an average difference of 100 mm et 310 mm vs 210 mm under the same irrigation quota 120 240 mm the variability of cumulative et under different water deficit scenarios was not consistent which was mainly due to difference in irrigation implementation the proportion of evaporation and transpiration in et was not the same in the two growing seasons with a lower evaporation in the 2013 2014 growing season the simulation results showed a slight overestimation of crop cumulative et for all irrigation scenarios compared with other treatments relatively higher overestimation errors re 20 were observed for the early stage water deficit scenarios such as i120 240dw r and i120 240dr j good agreement for dh f treatments was achieved with a minimum relative error of 3 4 based on soil water balance the change of soil water content was mainly attributed to water uptake from crop root soil zone for evapotranspiration therefore the overestimation simulated et was consistent with the variability of simulated soil water content mentioned in above that simulated underestimated soil water content was using for crop evapotranspiration fig 7 5 discussion 5 1 methods in model calibration and data assimilation model calibration is essential to ensure high quality simulation and data assimilation comparing with other water driven models the safye model is less complex given that the procedure can be determined by a few parameters silvestro et al 2017b generally parameter selection for model calibration is based on sensitivity analysis by evaluating the effect of parameter variation on simulation results previous sensitivity studies on safy safye model duchemin et al 2008 silvestro et al 2017b zhang et al 2019b have revealed from an analogous standpoint that parameters in eqs 3 and 4 pla plb stt rs played a major role in controlling the variation of lai higher sensitivity and contribution of these parameters for the variation of lai and biomass would greatly weak the effectiveness of other parameters and treatments hence these parameters require determination firstly at healthy growth conditions non stress and then the different growth response for variation of water condition were expected to be appraised by water stress coefficient ks battude et al 2016 and liao et al 2019 proposed a correlation between two to three of these parameters sla lue pla b and rs to reduce the model complexity our previous study zhang et al 2019b showed that correlations among parameters e g pla plb stt and rs were not stable that depend highly on seeding date and climate conditions which can led to different regression relations although there are controversy on variation of lue at different growth stages most studies proposed a range of 2 0 2 2 g mj 1 for the lue of wheat cultivar modulated by stresses e g water or nitrogen calderini et al 1997 ali et al 2012 thus to enhance the effects of the water stress factor ks on responding crop growth variability under various soil water statuses we did not consider possible temporal variations of lue but only considered a fixed lue value equivalent to the seasonal average of 2 0 g mj 1 calderini et al 1997 to take advantage of the combined benefits of variational and sequential assimilation methods both sce and enkf were applied to improve winter wheat biomass yield simulation and evapotranspiration estimation 5 2 performances for simulating crop lai and dry biomass development crop lai aboveground biomass and yield are typical prediction variables in the data assimilation framework which reveal the crop growth development and production different from studies focused on final yield estimation our study intends to reveal the effectiveness of the enkf assimilation method for simulating different water statuses during the crop growth cycle the larger discrepancies between simulated without assimilation and observed lai were mainly resulted from serious water deficit total irrigation amount 120 mm and early stage water deficit deficit in winter and reviving stage scenarios this limitation was observed not only in the safye model but also in several other complex models e g dasst yao et al 2015 rzwqm yu et al 2006 and aquacrop iqbal et al 2014 fang et al 2010 analyzed the hybrid rzwqm2 model for wheat simulation and observed a decreased performance when drought became more severe and the stage under drought condition was early although the safye model had been improved with a water stress module to take into consideration of multiple water statuses zhang et al 2019a the performance was still not ideal fig 3 and table 3 in contrast when the observed lai was assimilated significant improvement in simulation was achieved this confirms the usefulness of assimilating observed lai into the crop model to improve model performance under different water conditions especially under severe and early stage water deficit conditions similar results were also observed in simulating the dynamics of winter wheat aboveground biomass but the improvement in accuracy was not apparent as that of simulating lai significant improvements were only witnessed in early stage deficit treatments dw r and there was no change in simulation accuracy for other scenarios the accumulation of aboveground biomass was based on the light use efficiency model in the safye crop model which takes into consideration of both lai and other stress effects the derivation of the fraction of the absorbed photosynthetically active radiation from lai was based on the beer lambert law and biomass accumulation is not proportional to lai as crop develop to the reproductive stages monsi and saeki 1953 thus performance of biomass simulation is not as effective as that of lai simulation in later stage water deficit treatments the model did not properly simulate the total harvested biomass with a slight overestimation a similar situation has been reported by baup et al 2019 who observed a large overestimation in total harvested biomass this could be due to dropping of the leaves from plants during the maturity stage betbeder et al 2016 therefore baup et al 2019 proposed to implement the falling leaves module for this situation estimation of grain yield in the safye model is the final product which is usually derived by multiplying the biomass daily increment or final harvest with a grain filling rate or the harvest index silvestro et al 2017b pointed out that the safye model did not present advantageous capability comparing with the original safy model for wheat yield estimation our previous studies without data assimilation showed that both safy and safye model did not improve grain yield estimation for winter wheat zhang et al 2019a 2019b good agreement with a satisfactory global accuracy r2 0 901 rmse 31 9 g m 2 rrmse 6 55 was achieved due to similar lai and dry matter in the later stage deficit and sufficient irrigation treatments accuracy refinement was mainly reflected in the early stage water deficit treatment 5 3 capability for revealing variability in soil water and crop evapotranspiration soil water is the main source of crop water supply and an important factor used to determine crop growth conditions surface soil moisture content has been an important target for optical remote sensing drought monitoring which contributes to both vegetation transpiration and soil evaporation simulation results showed good interpretation capability for varying soil water content under various irrigation scenarios with an accuracy table 4 rmse 3 3 5 0 mm rrmse 10 0 15 2 comparable to other crop modeling studies iqbal et al 2014 in soil moisture simulation water amount exceeding soil water holding capacity field capacity was treated as infiltration into deeper layers as such the increment of water content in 0 20 cm soil layers under 40 and 80 mm irrigation quota was equal besides when the simulated water content was below the wilting point it stopped decreasing further as the crop et was closed by full water stress ks 0 the total available soil water storage in the root zone is the maximum amount that crops can use unlike soil water movement in the 0 20 cm soil layer in which excessive irrigation would infiltrate into the deeper layers limited irrigation and deep underground water determined that soil water was mainly stored in 0 100 cm soil layer hence once a large error was resulted in a simulation step it would propagate and continue to subsequent simulation steps fig 5 although underestimations occurred in almost all treatment scenarios in both growing seasons good global simulation accuracy in the 0 1 m soil layer table 4 rmse 11 7 29 6 mm rrmse 5 9 15 0 was achieved in comparison with other models aquacrop relative error 11 21 boudhina et al 2019 rmse 24 5 37 6 mm iqbal et al 2014 dssat ceres relative error 0 43 20 4 yang et al 2006 rzwqm2 rmse 28 5 34 8 mm fang et al 2010 crop evapotranspiration is a key factor in determining crop water requirements crop et usually increases with crop development exhibiting a low value in early growth stage winter reviving stage and high value after jointing stage but would rapidly decline during maturity besides the variation of et depends largely on irrigation practices both evaporation and transpiration increased considerably after an irrigation fig 6 the mean peak value of evaporation and transpiration were 1 5 mm d 1 and 6 mm d 1 respectively which is in consistent with the result by chen et al 2006 unfortunately their data cannot be verified in this study because evaporation and transpiration by eddy covariance at plot scale cannot be separated the simulated total cumulative et showed slight overestimation in both growth cycles with a positive mean relative error of 14 table 5 the overestimation corresponds to the underestimation of the root layer soil water content fig 5 thus the simulation accuracy was satisfactory in this study with the r2 rmse and rrmse of 0 95 33 8 mm and 14 5 respectively data not shown several studies have been compiled to evaluate the performance of the safye model for estimating crop et duchemin et al 2015 reported a simulation error of 20 for wheat et using the safye model they observed an underestimation of et for maize rrmse 20 and attributed it to a delay in the actual emergence iqbal et al 2014 evaluated the aquacrop model for winter wheat et with an error between 0 6 and 21 7 and an aggregated rmse of 33 2 mm fang et al 2010 obtained a rmse of 41 5 mm using the rzwqm2 model to simulate the et of a wheat maize cropping system nevertheless compared with direct estimation from remote sensing data e g marshall et al 2016 r2 0 4 rrmse 27 66 estimation of crop et could be effectively improved by assimilating remote sensing lai into a crop model 5 4 contributions and limitations in this study lai derived from canopy reflectance was assimilated into the safye model using both sce and enkf algorithms to simulate winter wheat growth and estimate crop et and soil water content the main contributions are as follows 1 revealed the effects of enkf method for assimilating lai into a simple crop model safye 2 developed an assimilation strategy to improve soil water content and crop et estimation the methodology has the potential of being applied to crop growth simulation yield forecasting and irrigation guidance further improvements are needed for large scale application 1 parameters of default and calibrated would be fixed as the exception of the parameter values not to vary dramatically although this assumption complies with the principle that typical values of crop growth model parameters fall within a limited range boogaard et al 2014 spatial variability can induce changes in model parameters such as soil properties crop cultivars and planting structures 2 although grain yield simulation achieved satisfactory accuracy the estimation was not significantly improved compared with the case without data assimilation adding a time dependent adjustment factor to the partition coefficient py may refine the simulation results under different growth conditions steduto et al 2009 3 the assimilated lai in this study was derived from optical spectral data only which may introduce potential retrieval uncertainty additional study using multi source remote sensing data combining both optical and radar data to derive lai in safye model could potentially improve the results furthermore other studies incorporating multivariate assimilation into the crop model is expected to improve model predictive capability nearing et al 2012 ines et al 2013 huang et al 2015 6 conclusion in this study we combined two algorithms sce and enkf to assimilate the lai into the safye model for improved winter wheat biomass simulation and evapotranspiration estimation under different water scenarios the results showed that assimilating the canopy reflectance derived lai into crop model has a great potential in improving simulation accuracy the model state trajectory was adjusted when incorporating the observed lai and the time series dynamics followed the measurements better in most cases than using the unassimilated lai data assimilation in the safye model showed more reliable performance in simulating crop growth and yield production under different irrigation scenarios than that simulated without data assimilation only parameter calibration the lai simulation accuracy was significantly improved particularly in early stage water deficit treatments achieving a maximum rmse of 0 3 the accuracy of the assimilated biomass estimation was also adequately improved with the maximum rmse dropping from 199 4 to 123 8 g m 2 and from 466 6 to 393 4 g m 2 for the two growing seasons against the safye model estimation without assimilating lai by the enkf method the aggregated error in grain yield estimation in terms of rmse and rrmse were 31 9 g m 2 and 6 55 respectively for the two years combined for soil water content better interpretation of variation in the top 0 20 cm soil layer was achieved than that of in the total root layer 0 100 cm an underestimation of soil water content of 0 100 cm soil layer was observed in both growing seasons leading to the overestimation with a positive mean relative error of 14 in crop total accumulated et this work highlights the great potential of coupling remote sensing data with the safye model to construct winter wheat growth dynamics predict yield and estimate soil water consumption under different water conditions from an agricultural point of view the

10012,data assimilation a state of the art method that merges remote sensing data with a dynamic model to improve model performance has been widely used in land surface process modeling application of data assimilation under various water conditions can provide insight of crop response to different water supply rates which is useful for agricultural water management in arid and semi arid regions for this purpose we developed a generic data assimilation methodology by integrating both the shuffled complex evolution sce and the ensemble kalman filter enkf algorithms into the simple algorithm for yield and evapotranspiration safye model to provide improved simulation of winter wheat biomass and yield and simulation of evapotranspiration et under different water supply scenarios an experiment with nine irrigation scenarios was conducted during the 2013 2015 growing cycles field spectral data were employed to retrieve the leaf area index lai which was then used as a single state variable to determine other parameters in the safye model using a global optimization algorithm time series lai was eventually assimilated in the safye model based on the enkf algorithm to improve overall model simulation the results showed that the simulated crop growth dynamics followed the measurements well in most cases when the estimated lai was assimilated the accuracy of simulated biomass at the daily step was improved with the maximum rmse decreased from 199 4 to 123 8 g m 2 and from 466 6 to 393 4 g m 2 for the 2013 2014 and 2014 2015 growing seasons respectively a good agreement was also achieved between the estimated and field measured grain yield r2 0 901 rmse 31 9 g m 2 rrmse 6 55 for both growing seasons the simulation of soil water content in the top 0 20 cm soil layer was better rmse 3 3 5 0 mm than that of 0 100 cm layer rmse 11 7 29 6 mm accuracy of the simulated et under early stage water deficit scenarios was lower than that under other scenarios with a positive mean relative error of 14 3 4 24 3 during two growing seasons this study demonstrates the great potential of coupling remote sensing data to improve the performance of safye model in

disease and pest detection and disaster assessment etc joyce et al 2009 khatami et al 2016 zhang et al 2019c for crop growth monitoring both crop and soil state variables such as leaf area index lai fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation fapar biomass and yield evapotranspiration et leaf and canopy nitrogen and soil moisture can be derived from remote sensing data many approaches for estimating these variables are based on conventional techniques by establishing statistical models between field measurements and spectral information such as vegetation index and spectral transformation liu et al 2012 liang et al 2015 these approaches are usually site specific and can lead to inconsistent results with the change of crop types or geographical locations fang et al 2011 cheng et al 2016 data assimilation a technique widely used in numerical weather prediction navon 2009 can incorporate observed data into dynamic mechanistic models to generate optimal estimates of state variables in a system huang et al 2019 for agricultural management crop growth models are effective tools to understand crop growth and diagnostic water fertilizer status in a growing cycle from sowing to harvest involving exchange of matter and energy in the soil vegetation atmosphere system the integration of spatial temporal information of the system captured by remote sensing can be useful for updating model state and correcting the potential trajectory of incorrect parameterization and mechanism machwitz et al 2014 representative assimilation strategies can be grouped into two categories variational and sequential approaches liang and qin 2008 the essence of the variational method is similar to the process of crop model calibration by optimizing a given criterion e g minimizing a cost function hence model parameters or initial state variables e g seeding density soil moisture are adjusted by obtaining the optimal agreement between the simulated and observed retrieved from remote sensing data variables e g lai in contrast the sequential assimilation updates current state of the model using subsequent observation by separately weighting the errors caused by the uncertainty of model simulation and remotely sensed observations ines et al 2013 for this method several types of algorithms have been developed including the most widely used ensemble kalman filter enkf a refined form of kalman filter used in wofost de wit and van diepen 2007 ines et al 2013 huang et al 2016 dssat nearing et al 2012 xie et al 2017 and safy silvestro et al 2017a models many studies have mainly focused on potential yield forecast at large scale and lacked a systematic analysis of different growth conditions e g water fertilizer heat ines et al 2013 conducted a study to assimilate crop lai into the dssat model using enkf and found that a substantial improvement can be achieved in crop yield prediction de wit and van diepen 2007 assimilated soil moisture in the wofost model to study the effectiveness of enkf for correcting simulation errors and found that assimilation clearly improved yield estimation of winter wheat for majority of regions they studied 66 silvestro et al 2017a evaluated data assimilation in both aquacrop and safy models for wheat yield estimation and obtained the lowest relative root mean square error of 18 using enkf with the safy model however most of the crop models were designed based on healthy growth scenarios which is difficult in effectively taking into consideration of various adverse stresses camargo and kemanian 2016 further studies are needed to evaluate the performance of data assimilation in order to improve simulation accuracies under different growth conditions the simple algorithm for yield and evapotranspiration safye model a highly scalable and robust model developed and promoted by duchemin et al 2008 2015 battude et al 2017 zhang et al 2019a was used in our study to model crop growth under various water conditions using a data assimilation approach in this study we developed an assimilation framework by incorporating canopy spectral data into the safye model to model winter wheat growth and yield and estimate soil water consumption under different water conditions both the sce shuffled complex evolution and enkf algorithms were implemented to complement each other in the assimilation process the main objective of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of the enkf assimilation method for improving the estimation of biomass yield et and soil water content under different water scenarios 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the data used in this study were obtained from a field irrigation experiment conducted at a water saving irrigation station of laboratory of agricultural soil and water engineering northwest china latitude 34 17 n longitude 108 04 e and elevation 506 m a s l fig 1 the experimental field was located in a typical irrigated agricultural district characterized by semiarid warm temperature and continental monsoon climate the average annual air temperature precipitation and potential et were 12 9 c 635 1 mm and 1500 mm respectively the soil of the experimental field was loam with an average field capacity of 0 31 cm3 cm 3 permanent wilting point of 0 12 cm3 cm 3 and dry bulk density of 1 31 g cm 3 measured in the laboratory using pressure plate apparatus the meteorological data air temperature relative humidity and sunshine hours etc during winter wheat growing seasons were automatically collected by the on site weather station 2 2 experimental design field experiment was carried out with nine irrigation scenarios during the 2013 2014 and 2014 2015 growing seasons two factors of irrigation management practice irrigation amount and timing were considered in the experiment for irrigation amount 80 mm sufficient and 40 mm deficit of water were applied according to local seasonal water demands wang and feng 2012 irrigation periods were determined following five winter wheat growth stages irrigation was applied at a given rate at these five growth stages except for a period consisting of two consecutive stages resulting in eight irrigation scenarios as given in table 1 in addition a control scenario with 80 mm water application at all growth stages was used to represent healthy growth condition each water deficit treatment was replicated three times while the control treatment replicated twice due to field restrictions winter wheat was sown on 15 october in both 2013 and 2014 after maize was harvested and final maturation was on 7 june in 2014 and 2 june in 2015 seeding density was 400 per m2 following a local practice the same winter wheat cultivar no 22 xiaoyan was used for the two seasons before planting urea and phosphorous pentoxide were broadcast and incorporated into soil at a rate of 140 kg ha 1 and 50 kg ha 1 respectively the plot size was 2 m 4 m consisting of 9 rows of plants a 1 5 m depth waterproof plastic partition was placed between adjacent plots to avoid water exchange all experimental treatments were randomly assigned to the plots other crop management practices were also followed to control weed pests and disease 2 3 data collection 2 3 1 crop and soil data crop data collected mainly included lai aboveground dry biomass and yield in each plot lai was measured between eight to nine times during the respective growing seasons using a sunscan canopy analyzer delta t devices ltd cambridge uk the measurements including lai and par were taken from the average of three replicate readings and were recorded in a palmtop aboveground biomass was measured concurrently with lai measurements the aboveground shoot portions of 15 winter wheat plants were collected and dried at 75 c for 72 h to determine the dry weight meanwhile the density of plants per square meter was counted to calculate the dry mass per square meter grain yields were harvested and measured at the maturity stage grains were threshed and weighed after air dried to a constant weight volumetric soil water content was measured using a neutron probe nanjing chishun science and technology co ltd china from the soil surface to a depth of 120 cm at 20 cm intervals soil water content collection was concurrent with other data and supplementary measurements were taken before irrigation for each plot 2 3 2 meteorological data daily meteorological data are essential to run the model the key data including air temperatures wind speed relative air humidity solar radiation and precipitation were recorded directly from the dynamet weather station from 2013 to 2015 dynamax inc houston tx us about 100 m away from the experimental site all data was regularly logged in a data logger cr1000 campbell scientific inc logan ut us the reference evapotranspiration et0 was calculated based on the weather station data using the fao penman monteith method allen et al 1998 the dynamics of et0 and radiation are depicted in fig 2 2 3 3 canopy reflectance spectra and preprocessing canopy reflectance spectra were collected using an asd fieldspec 3 spectroradiometer analytical spectral devices inc boulder colorado usa under cloudless condition at sloar noon spectral measurements were taken at about 1 3 m above the top of the canopy covering 3 rows of plants when the sensor looked downward vertically at each plot 10 scans were used and calibration measurement was made every 5 min using a white spectralon panel field canopy spectral measurements started from the reviving stage and were concurrent with that of other crop variables and soil water content after measurements each spectrum was smoothed using the quadratic polynomial of five spans the lai a key variable indicating crop growth and development status was selected as a unique coupling variable in assimilation systems therefore deriving lai from by reflectance spectra accurately is important various methods such as vegetation index non parametric regression and radiation transfer model rtm inversion have been reported for successful crop lai retrieval verrelst et al 2015 the partial least squares regression plsr compared with other methods could construct several principal components to take full advantage of the spectral information and was used to retrieve crop lai in this study an acceptable retrieval accuracy for lai was achieved with an r2 of 0 89 and rmse of 0 42 in previous study as reported in zhang et al 2019a a detailed description on lai estimation can be found in zhang et al 2018 thus the observed time series lai during the two winter wheat growing cycles were prepared for assimilating with crop model 3 model and methodology 3 1 safye model description the agro meteorological model named safye simple algorithm for yield and evapotranspiration developed by duchemin et al 2015 was used in this study the safye model combines the safy model with a water balance component aiming to simulate crop growth with the temporal evolution of lai dry masses evapotranspiration and soil water content it has been validated for different crop types such as wheat dong et al 2016 duchemin et al 2015 zhang et al 2019a corn battude et al 2017 baup et al 2019 soybean betbeder et al 2016 liao et al 2019 in various climates the basic theory of the safye model was the same as safy that crop above ground phytomass was converted from solar radiation based on the light use efficiency model monteith 1972 the following meteorological variables are needed for driving the model global solar radiation air temperature and et0 in this paper the main processes of the model related to vegetation growth and evapotranspiration component are presented hereinafter and a full description of the safye model is provided in duchemin et al 2015 battude et al 2017 daily incremental production of biomass md g m 2 is determined as a function of global radiation rg mj m 2 d 1 with three parameters light use efficiency lue g mj 1 climatic efficiency εc and light interception efficiency εi furthermore both temperature stress coefficient ft and water stress coefficient ks interpreting the effects of temperature cold and heat and soil water deficit on crop development were also considered the final function of above ground phytomass is 1 m d r g ε c ε i lue f t k s the parameters ε c is determined by lai and canopy light extinction coefficient k following the beer lambert law the temperature stress factor f t is regulated by threshold temperatures minimum optimum and maximum following a quadratic polynomial function derived from the stics model brisson et al 2003 the development of the lai can be split into two phases leaf generation and senescence which are controlled by accumulated temperature during the leaf growing period daily incremental lai lai is allocated from daily md using a leaf partition function proposed by maas 1993 which varies with two parameters pla and plb and accumulated temperature at c eqs 2 and 3 leaf senescence occurs when accumulated temperature from plant emergence reaches a given threshold stt c the decrease of lai lai is modulated using a parameter rs c day 1 defined as the rate of senescence eq 4 thus the lai at day t is updated by last lai day t 1 increase lai and decrease lai of lai grain filling starts when the leaf begins to senesce duchemin et al 2008 the increment of grain yield is calculated from the total dry mass dm with a parameter py defined as a proportion of grain partition eq 5 2 lai m d pl sla pl

the effect of potential water stress water budget and evapotranspiration components were supplemented in safye water exchange is calculated using a water balance equation determined with several irrigation components evapotranspiration runoff and infiltration a simplified three soil layers evaporation root and deep layer are used for processing soil water transfer thus water transfer mechanisms are simulated in three soil layers gravity and diffusive fluxes and the interaction between soil and atmosphere evaporation and transpiration evapotranspiration is the main consumption source of soil water storage in safye model the fao 56 method allen et al 1998 multiplying et0 with dual crop coefficients ke and kt to estimate the rate of plant transpiration and soil evaporation was used to calculate the evapotranspiration et eq 6 the effect of water stress on canopy transpiration was considered as a water stress coefficient ks down regulating the basal crop coefficient kcb 6 et k e k t et 0 k e k cb k s et 0 evaporation ke is mainly from topsoil and is a function of the fraction of crop canopy cover cc it is formulated using a semi empirical equation that uses evaporation reduction coefficient β and the relative depletion soil moisture in the top 0 20 cm soil layer rsm battude et al 2017 eq 7 crop canopy cover is calculated as a function of lai eq 8 following nielsen et al 2012 eq 8 7 k e 1 cc 1 1 rsm β 8 cc 94 00 1 e 0 43 lai 0 52 the basal crop coefficient kcb represents crop potential transpiration rate dependent of development stages a simplified formulation of kcb was adopted in this study using crop maximum transpiration and lai duchemin et al 2006 eq 9 9 k cb k cb max 1 e k trp lai the water stress coefficient ks is expected to interpret water stress effects it varies from 1 to 0 dependent of the relative humidity of the soil layer there is a distinct assumption for ks between this study and the original model in which a linear stress function was proposed by duchemin et al 2015 given that the sensitivity of water deficit tolerance varies during the growing stage a nonlinear stress function was adopted following the aquacrop model raes et al 2009 in general wheat as a dryland crop is usually not affected by mild water deficit thus the stress function ks is convex varying from 1 to 0 regulated by a shape coefficient f and relative depletion of soil water content srel eq 10 the srel was calculated as the ratio of root zoon soil moisture smr mm to total available moisture water content between field capacity and wilting point mm implemented using the upper pu and lower pl thresholds eq 11 10 k s 1 e s rel f 1 e f 1 11 s rel p u sm r taw p u p l p l s rel p u 3 2 the ensemble kalman filter enkf the enkf a monte carlo variant of the kalman filter evensen 2003 is one of the typical methods of sequential data assimilation which can incorporate available observations to adjust the model state value of the trajectory the basic principles can be described as below the kalman filter algorithm assumes that the observations are linearly related to a state variable x t e g lai at time t as 12 z t h x t v t where z t is the observation value v t is a gaussian random white noise with a mean of zero and observation error covariance r h is the measurement operator that maps the model variable space to the observation space and t represents time at the current time t we assume that an ensemble of forecast x t f x 1 t f x 2 t f x n t f n ensemble size z t z 1 t z 2 t z n t are made thus the forecast x t is gaussian distributed with mean x t f and error covariance p t f based on this assumption the estimated state variable and error covariance are updated as 13 x t f m x t 1 a 14 x t a x t f k t z t h x t f where m is the function that transfers the state from time t 1 to time t the safye model in this study x t a and x t f are the analyzed optimal estimate ensemble the mean of x t a is the best estimate at time t and forecasted vector of the ensemble at time t respectively the k t is the kalman gain at time t defined as 15 k t p t f h t h p t f h t r t 1 in the present study lai was the only state variable assimilated using the retrieved lai from the canopy spectrum observation operator h is an identity matrix with no other observations are involved thus eq 13 and eq 14 can be rewritten as 16 lai t f m lai t 1 a 17 lai t a lai t f p t f p t f r t lai t obs lai t f 3 3 model calibration and assimilation 3 3 1 calibration before data assimilation the crop model should be calibrated using observable biophysical descriptors such as lai yield and or biomass distribution in different organs of the plants ceglar et al 2011 in general model calibration is conducted using field observations measurements rather than remote sensing derived estimates because of the scaling difficulty in remote sensing products and their associated uncertainties huang et al 2019 therefore the first step is to calibrate the model for this region using the collected field data the inputs outputs and parameters of the safye model are given in table 2 typically the parameters could be categorized as conservative and specific the conservative parameters i e crop specific are general to a given species without significant change in most cases which can be referenced from literature studies the specific non conservative parameters have to be calibrated for different cultivars geographical locations environment and management practices the determination and sources are listed in table 2 the four parameters of pla plb stt and rs controlling the crop growth and development should be calibrated using in situ measured lai these parameters were then adjusted and optimized by minimizing the root mean square error rmse between time series simulated lai and in situ measured lai the cost function for parameter calibration is as follows 18 min rmse 1 n i 1 n lai mea lai sim 2 to effectively optimize the cost function a global optimization algorithm the shuffled complex evolution university of arizona sce ua developed by duan et al 1993 was used the sce ua algorithm is insensitive to the initial values of the parameters by integrating the concepts of competitive and shuffled complex evolution which can efficiently prevent from convergence to a locally optimal solution different parameter matrix presents an optimal solution data used for parameter calibration was from unstressed healthy plots i400 during the 2013 2014 growing season fig 2 a total of 500 repetitions were conducted to reduce the uncertainty of parameter changes and high frequency parameter values were selected after calibration the model is ready to simulate lai biomass eta and water balance under different irrigation scenarios 3 3 2 assimilation the second step is to assimilate observations into the calibrated safye model to dynamically adjust the model state the safye was ran from the sowing date on the first day of simulation with gaussian white noise added as perturbation to the simulated lai to generate an ensemble of 50 forecasted lai flai1 flai2 flai50 if an observed lai was available at time t gaussian perturbations were added to generate a 50 observation ensemble flai1 flai2 flai50 then the forecast ensemble and the observation ensemble were processed using the enkf algorithm to generate an optimal ensemble of lai estimate at time t to update the state variable using eq 14 the mean of the optimal estimate ensemble would be input to the safye model as a benchmark to simulate the state of the next step time t 1 if there is no observed lai at time t the forward simulation would be conducted using the model alone the above process was repeated until the last observation had been assimilated and the safye model was run to the end of the crop growth cycle to achieve these goals an updating assimilation algorithm based on the enkf was developed the performance of the assimilation framework was evaluated using the field data with three statistical criteria the root mean square error rmse the relative rmse rrmse and the refined index of agreement d r willmott et al 2012 results of the lai with and without assimilation were also compared 4 results 4 1 evaluation of assimilation for crop lai dry aboveground biomass and grain yield estimation 4 1 1 leaf area index fig 3 depicts the seasonal variation of the observed lai and simulated lai with and without data assimilation under different irrigation scenarios results showed that the simulated lai followed the general growth dynamics as represented by the observed lai in most cases with a peak around day after sowing das 200 during the 2013 2014 growing season due to a low initial soil water content the development of crop lai was delayed with rapid growth starting after das 150 apparent difference between the simulated and retrieved lai was observed for all irrigation scenarios during the period of das 175 188 when the temperature and solar radiation dropped suddenly fig 2 resulting in a stress effect in model simulation inconsistent results were observed in water scenarios dw r and dr j for the two growing cycles owing to different meteorological conditions and initial soil water conditions leading to noticeable underestimation of the model without data assimilation in 2014 2015 the accuracies of the simulated lai are given in table 3 in general the accuracies of irrigation scenarios with a total amount of 240 mm water 2013 2014 rmse 0 2 0 3 2014 2015 rmse 0 2 0 8 were better than those of 120 mm water 2013 2014 rmse 0 3 0 5 2014 2015 rmse 0 2 0 9 in both growing seasons higher accuracy was obtained for the later stage water deficit scenarios dj h and dh f rrmse 10 than for the early stage water deficit scenarios 20 rmse 30 the variations of dr of different irrigation scenarios for the lai were consistent in terms of rmse and rrmse with more than 0 8 in later stage water deficit scenarios the simulated lai with data assimilation followed the dynamic of the observed lai better than that without data assimilation in both growing cycles the large discrepancies between the simulated and observed lai was reduced through data assimilation for i120dr j and i240dr j 2013 2014 and dw r and dr j 2014 2015 fig 3 the accuracy of the assimilated lai showed a significant improvement with the minimum rmse rrmse and maximum dr achieving 0 1 2 0 and 0 95 respectively good agreement rrmse 10 was also achieved between the simulated and observed lai for the eight irrigation scenarios this demonstrates that lai simulation can be improved when observed lai is available for assimilation using the safye model 4 1 2 aboveground dry biomass comparisons of the simulated biomass with and without assimilation under the eight irrigation scenarios are shown in fig 4 and table 3 similar to lai better agreement between the simulated and measured biomass was achieved for later stage water deficit scenarios with minimum rmse rrmse and dr of 47 4 6 8 and 0 96 respectively the accuracy of rrmse 30 for i120dw r in 2013 and i120dr j i240dw r in 2014 growing seasons were obtained showing an inferior performance in interpreting biomass dynamic under such water conditions the deviation between simulated and measured biomass mainly emerged from doy 175 when winter wheat was in the tillering stage the performance of the simulated biomass with data assimilation for i120 240dw r showed improvement in comparison with that without assimilation with the rmse and rrmse decreased from 36 5 to 22 7 and 23 2 10 7 in 2013 2014 and from 29 1 to 15 9 and 38 4 27 9 in 2014 2015 growing cycles respectively although results showed obvious difference between simulated biomass with and without data assimilation for the early stage water deficits scenarios the improvement for the later stage water deficits scenarios i120 240dj h and i120 240dh f was limited as shown by rmse rrmse and dr 4 1 3 grain yield the simulated daily increment of biomass partitioned to grain under each irrigation scenario was also displayed in fig 4 the formation of grain yield starts when lai stops increase i e the daily lai increment reaches zero eq 3 pl 0 this was at approximately das 195 when winter wheat was at the heading stage specifically this was das 198 in 2013 2014 and 192 in 2014 2015 due to varying weather conditions in the two growth cycles a comparison between the measured and simulated final grain yield is shown in fig 5 a good agreement was observed with a satisfactory overall performance r2 0 90 rmse 31 9 g m 2 rrmse 6 6 and dr 0 824 although inconsistency was observed for some scenarios the samples are distributed close to the 1 1 reference line and mostly within the 95 confidence interval the larger discrepancy was mainly observed in treatments i120dr j and i120dh f in both seasons in general the safye model with data assimilation showed improved performance in simulating crop grain yield under different irrigation scenarios 4 2 evaluation of soil water content and crop actual evapotranspiration simulation 4 2 1 total soil water content in 0 20 cm and 0 100 cm soil layers as described in section 3 1 the safye model simplified water transfer in all three soil layers evaporation root and deep layer the simulation results of soil water content with data assimilation for each irrigation scenarios in the top 0 20 cm and 0 1 m soil layers during the two growing cycles were evaluated and the results are shown in fig 5 and table 4 for the 0 20 cm soil layer the safye model could simulate the variation of soil water during field consumption and after irrigation the simulated water content for each irrigation scenario followed well 10 rrmse 20 with the in situ measured soil moisture in both seasons the comparable performance was observed in both 120 mm and 240 mm irrigation amount with the rmse ranging from 3 3 to 5 0 mm the maximum root depth of winter wheat during one growing cycle is around 1 0 1 2 m and about 80 of the roots were concentrate in the 0 40 cm soil depth xue et al 2003 therefore water storage in the 0 1 m soil layer was the main source for crop growth consumption in general the variation of total water content in 0 1 m soil layer ranged from around 250 120 mm the simulated dynamics of soil water content followed the variability of in situ measurements for each water stress scenario the soil water consumption was derived using a soil water balance approach which was mainly determined by et related to crop lai eq 6 therefore the consumption rates descending slope of soil water content increased with crop canopy development during the winter dormancy stage before 150 das water reduction by crop consumption was long lasting and the simulated values were well consistent with the measurements discrepancy was observed when the crop was at the reviving stage and the errors accumulated until the end of the growth stage comparing the accuracy of simulated soil water content at 0 1 m soil depth greater errors were easily observed in early stage water deficit scenarios i120 240dw r r j than that in other scenarios in both seasons 4 2 2 soil evaporation and crop transpiration crop evapotranspiration is a key factor in indicating crop development status and is critical for estimating crop water requirements and determining irrigation regimes fig 6 shows the dynamics of the simulated soil evaporation crop transpiration and cumulative et for each irrigation scenario during the two growing cycles the measured total soil water consumption and simulated total et are also given in table 5 the simulated soil evaporation for the top 20 cm soil layer showed consistent variability for each irrigation scenario in both cycles daily soil evaporation was relatively stable at around 0 1 mm d 1 during the growing season evaporation increased significantly to a maximum of 2 0 mm d 1 after irrigation at the peak growth stage 175 200 das soil evaporation for the dr j and dj h irrigation scenarios declined to zero due to water deficit and lush canopy this was much more obvious in the second season due to a denser canopy higher lai the simulated crop transpiration showed a similar variation trend as that of crop lai similar to soil evaporation crop transpiration also increased significantly right after irrigation the dynamics of crop transpiration at four water deficit stages were different a series of low transpiration 0 25 mm d 1 before the first irrigation das 182 was observed for the i120 240dw r scenario and then increased considerably to 6 mm d 1 with three consecutive irrigations similarly simulated transpiration for the i120 240dr j scenarios was consistent except for a stage of the bulge after winter irrigation conversely no transpiration was observed in later stage non irrigation scenario in both seasons i e i120dh f treatment in general the inter annual variability of et for each irrigation scenario in both growing cycles was comparable ranging from 192 to 327 mm and 202 347 mm respectively the simulated cumulative et in the irrigation amount of 240 mm scenarios were greater than that in the irrigation amount of 120 mm with an average difference of 100 mm et 310 mm vs 210 mm under the same irrigation quota 120 240 mm the variability of cumulative et under different water deficit scenarios was not consistent which was mainly due to difference in irrigation implementation the proportion of evaporation and transpiration in et was not the same in the two growing seasons with a lower evaporation in the 2013 2014 growing season the simulation results showed a slight overestimation of crop cumulative et for all irrigation scenarios compared with other treatments relatively higher overestimation errors re 20 were observed for the early stage water deficit scenarios such as i120 240dw r and i120 240dr j good agreement for dh f treatments was achieved with a minimum relative error of 3 4 based on soil water balance the change of soil water content was mainly attributed to water uptake from crop root soil zone for evapotranspiration therefore the overestimation simulated et was consistent with the variability of simulated soil water content mentioned in above that simulated underestimated soil water content was using for crop evapotranspiration fig 7 5 discussion 5 1 methods in model calibration and data assimilation model calibration is essential to ensure high quality simulation and data assimilation comparing with other water driven models the safye model is less complex given that the procedure can be determined by a few parameters silvestro et al 2017b generally parameter selection for model calibration is based on sensitivity analysis by evaluating the effect of parameter variation on simulation results previous sensitivity studies on safy safye model duchemin et al 2008 silvestro et al 2017b zhang et al 2019b have revealed from an analogous standpoint that parameters in eqs 3 and 4 pla plb stt rs played a major role in controlling the variation of lai higher sensitivity and contribution of these parameters for the variation of lai and biomass would greatly weak the effectiveness of other parameters and treatments hence these parameters require determination firstly at healthy growth conditions non stress and then the different growth response for variation of water condition were expected to be appraised by water stress coefficient ks battude et al 2016 and liao et al 2019 proposed a correlation between two to three of these parameters sla lue pla b and rs to reduce the model complexity our previous study zhang et al 2019b showed that correlations among parameters e g pla plb stt and rs were not stable that depend highly on seeding date and climate conditions which can led to different regression relations although there are controversy on variation of lue at different growth stages most studies proposed a range of 2 0 2 2 g mj 1 for the lue of wheat cultivar modulated by stresses e g water or nitrogen calderini et al 1997 ali et al 2012 thus to enhance the effects of the water stress factor ks on responding crop growth variability under various soil water statuses we did not consider possible temporal variations of lue but only considered a fixed lue value equivalent to the seasonal average of 2 0 g mj 1 calderini et al 1997 to take advantage of the combined benefits of variational and sequential assimilation methods both sce and enkf were applied to improve winter wheat biomass yield simulation and evapotranspiration estimation 5 2 performances for simulating crop lai and dry biomass development crop lai aboveground biomass and yield are typical prediction variables in the data assimilation framework which reveal the crop growth development and production different from studies focused on final yield estimation our study intends to reveal the effectiveness of the enkf assimilation method for simulating different water statuses during the crop growth cycle the larger discrepancies between simulated without assimilation and observed lai were mainly resulted from serious water deficit total irrigation amount 120 mm and early stage water deficit deficit in winter and reviving stage scenarios this limitation was observed not only in the safye model but also in several other complex models e g dasst yao et al 2015 rzwqm yu et al 2006 and aquacrop iqbal et al 2014 fang et al 2010 analyzed the hybrid rzwqm2 model for wheat simulation and observed a decreased performance when drought became more severe and the stage under drought condition was early although the safye model had been improved with a water stress module to take into consideration of multiple water statuses zhang et al 2019a the performance was still not ideal fig 3 and table 3 in contrast when the observed lai was assimilated significant improvement in simulation was achieved this confirms the usefulness of assimilating observed lai into the crop model to improve model performance under different water conditions especially under severe and early stage water deficit conditions similar results were also observed in simulating the dynamics of winter wheat aboveground biomass but the improvement in accuracy was not apparent as that of simulating lai significant improvements were only witnessed in early stage deficit treatments dw r and there was no change in simulation accuracy for other scenarios the accumulation of aboveground biomass was based on the light use efficiency model in the safye crop model which takes into consideration of both lai and other stress effects the derivation of the fraction of the absorbed photosynthetically active radiation from lai was based on the beer lambert law and biomass accumulation is not proportional to lai as crop develop to the reproductive stages monsi and saeki 1953 thus performance of biomass simulation is not as effective as that of lai simulation in later stage water deficit treatments the model did not properly simulate the total harvested biomass with a slight overestimation a similar situation has been reported by baup et al 2019 who observed a large overestimation in total harvested biomass this could be due to dropping of the leaves from plants during the maturity stage betbeder et al 2016 therefore baup et al 2019 proposed to implement the falling leaves module for this situation estimation of grain yield in the safye model is the final product which is usually derived by multiplying the biomass daily increment or final harvest with a grain filling rate or the harvest index silvestro et al 2017b pointed out that the safye model did not present advantageous capability comparing with the original safy model for wheat yield estimation our previous studies without data assimilation showed that both safy and safye model did not improve grain yield estimation for winter wheat zhang et al 2019a 2019b good agreement with a satisfactory global accuracy r2 0 901 rmse 31 9 g m 2 rrmse 6 55 was achieved due to similar lai and dry matter in the later stage deficit and sufficient irrigation treatments accuracy refinement was mainly reflected in the early stage water deficit treatment 5 3 capability for revealing variability in soil water and crop evapotranspiration soil water is the main source of crop water supply and an important factor used to determine crop growth conditions surface soil moisture content has been an important target for optical remote sensing drought monitoring which contributes to both vegetation transpiration and soil evaporation simulation results showed good interpretation capability for varying soil water content under various irrigation scenarios with an accuracy table 4 rmse 3 3 5 0 mm rrmse 10 0 15 2 comparable to other crop modeling studies iqbal et al 2014 in soil moisture simulation water amount exceeding soil water holding capacity field capacity was treated as infiltration into deeper layers as such the increment of water content in 0 20 cm soil layers under 40 and 80 mm irrigation quota was equal besides when the simulated water content was below the wilting point it stopped decreasing further as the crop et was closed by full water stress ks 0 the total available soil water storage in the root zone is the maximum amount that crops can use unlike soil water movement in the 0 20 cm soil layer in which excessive irrigation would infiltrate into the deeper layers limited irrigation and deep underground water determined that soil water was mainly stored in 0 100 cm soil layer hence once a large error was resulted in a simulation step it would propagate and continue to subsequent simulation steps fig 5 although underestimations occurred in almost all treatment scenarios in both growing seasons good global simulation accuracy in the 0 1 m soil layer table 4 rmse 11 7 29 6 mm rrmse 5 9 15 0 was achieved in comparison with other models aquacrop relative error 11 21 boudhina et al 2019 rmse 24 5 37 6 mm iqbal et al 2014 dssat ceres relative error 0 43 20 4 yang et al 2006 rzwqm2 rmse 28 5 34 8 mm fang et al 2010 crop evapotranspiration is a key factor in determining crop water requirements crop et usually increases with crop development exhibiting a low value in early growth stage winter reviving stage and high value after jointing stage but would rapidly decline during maturity besides the variation of et depends largely on irrigation practices both evaporation and transpiration increased considerably after an irrigation fig 6 the mean peak value of evaporation and transpiration were 1 5 mm d 1 and 6 mm d 1 respectively which is in consistent with the result by chen et al 2006 unfortunately their data cannot be verified in this study because evaporation and transpiration by eddy covariance at plot scale cannot be separated the simulated total cumulative et showed slight overestimation in both growth cycles with a positive mean relative error of 14 table 5 the overestimation corresponds to the underestimation of the root layer soil water content fig 5 thus the simulation accuracy was satisfactory in this study with the r2 rmse and rrmse of 0 95 33 8 mm and 14 5 respectively data not shown several studies have been compiled to evaluate the performance of the safye model for estimating crop et duchemin et al 2015 reported a simulation error of 20 for wheat et using the safye model they observed an underestimation of et for maize rrmse 20 and attributed it to a delay in the actual emergence iqbal et al 2014 evaluated the aquacrop model for winter wheat et with an error between 0 6 and 21 7 and an aggregated rmse of 33 2 mm fang et al 2010 obtained a rmse of 41 5 mm using the rzwqm2 model to simulate the et of a wheat maize cropping system nevertheless compared with direct estimation from remote sensing data e g marshall et al 2016 r2 0 4 rrmse 27 66 estimation of crop et could be effectively improved by assimilating remote sensing lai into a crop model 5 4 contributions and limitations in this study lai derived from canopy reflectance was assimilated into the safye model using both sce and enkf algorithms to simulate winter wheat growth and estimate crop et and soil water content the main contributions are as follows 1 revealed the effects of enkf method for assimilating lai into a simple crop model safye 2 developed an assimilation strategy to improve soil water content and crop et estimation the methodology has the potential of being applied to crop growth simulation yield forecasting and irrigation guidance further improvements are needed for large scale application 1 parameters of default and calibrated would be fixed as the exception of the parameter values not to vary dramatically although this assumption complies with the principle that typical values of crop growth model parameters fall within a limited range boogaard et al 2014 spatial variability can induce changes in model parameters such as soil properties crop cultivars and planting structures 2 although grain yield simulation achieved satisfactory accuracy the estimation was not significantly improved compared with the case without data assimilation adding a time dependent adjustment factor to the partition coefficient py may refine the simulation results under different growth conditions steduto et al 2009 3 the assimilated lai in this study was derived from optical spectral data only which may introduce potential retrieval uncertainty additional study using multi source remote sensing data combining both optical and radar data to derive lai in safye model could potentially improve the results furthermore other studies incorporating multivariate assimilation into the crop model is expected to improve model predictive capability nearing et al 2012 ines et al 2013 huang et al 2015 6 conclusion in this study we combined two algorithms sce and enkf to assimilate the lai into the safye model for improved winter wheat biomass simulation and evapotranspiration estimation under different water scenarios the results showed that assimilating the canopy reflectance derived lai into crop model has a great potential in improving simulation accuracy the model state trajectory was adjusted when incorporating the observed lai and the time series dynamics followed the measurements better in most cases than using the unassimilated lai data assimilation in the safye model showed more reliable performance in simulating crop growth and yield production under different irrigation scenarios than that simulated without data assimilation only parameter calibration the lai simulation accuracy was significantly improved particularly in early stage water deficit treatments achieving a maximum rmse of 0 3 the accuracy of the assimilated biomass estimation was also adequately improved with the maximum rmse dropping from 199 4 to 123 8 g m 2 and from 466 6 to 393 4 g m 2 for the two growing seasons against the safye model estimation without assimilating lai by the enkf method the aggregated error in grain yield estimation in terms of rmse and rrmse were 31 9 g m 2 and 6 55 respectively for the two years combined for soil water content better interpretation of variation in the top 0 20 cm soil layer was achieved than that of in the total root layer 0 100 cm an underestimation of soil water content of 0 100 cm soil layer was observed in both growing seasons leading to the overestimation with a positive mean relative error of 14 in crop total accumulated et this work highlights the great potential of coupling remote sensing data with the safye model to construct winter wheat growth dynamics predict yield and estimate soil water consumption under different water conditions from an agricultural point of view the

10013,artificial subsurface drainage impacts the hydrological system but its spatial distribution is typically uncertain hindering the understanding of the hydrological behaviour of a certain catchment in this study the effects of using four different sources to delineate the spatial distribution of subsurface drainage systems on hydrological modelling performance and simulated water balance were assessed this work was addressed using swat and swat modflow that is four swat models and four swat modflow models were set up and evaluated the spatial distribution of subsurface drainage systems were based on 1 low electrical resistivity as a proxy for clay content in the top 4 m of the subsurface 2 historical maps from contractors which conducted the drainage work 3 settings from previous successful swat set ups in denmark and 4 similar settings as in scenario 3 but adjusted according to the national drained area probability map in denmark scenarios 1 and 4 and scenarios 2 and 3 respectively showed similar fractions of subsurface drained areas out of the total catchment area large and small respectively scenarios 2 and 3 showed better statistical performance with swat while scenarios 1 and 4 performed better using swat modflow best statistical and graphical performances were obtained with the large drain fraction scenarios and when using the coupled model first low drain fraction scenarios underestimated subsurface drainage flow to the stream besides swat modflow performed better than swat because modflow was able to simulate groundwater flow across the surface catchment whereas swat by default is not capable of doing so all things considered impacts of different subsurface drainage scenarios on catchment hydrology are assessed using both swat and swat modflow for the first time in this work revealing the relevance of this input step for satisfactory hydrological modelling and reinforcing previous authors findings regarding the better performance of the coupled model over swat but being even more relevant in this none zero balance catchment the proposed method of modelling coupling and delineating subsurface drained areas using geophysical data is promising and can be adopted by other researchers to evaluate the water balance impact of land use and climate changes around the world keywords subsurface drainage streamflow water balance catchment modelling swat modflow 1 introduction in agricultural lowland regions with a thin unsaturated zone artificial drainage open ditches and subsurface drainage is a common practice to improve crop yields by lowering water tables around 60 of denmark is cultivated arable land that is worked by ploughing and sowing and raising crops and around 50 of the cultivated land is artificially drained mainly by subsurface drainage møller et al 2018 because subsurface drainage can be a significant hydrologic pathway in agricultural catchments king et al 2014 with detrimental consequences for stream ecosystems it is an important consideration in hydrological modelling of such areas one of the most commonly used hydrological models for agricultural areas at catchment scale to partition total discharge into individual flow components is the soil and water assessment tool swat arnold et al 1998 among other advantages swat implements very detailed soil water dynamics and allows highly detailed inputs regarding agricultural management however swat has limitations in the simulation of the groundwater component swat uses a lumped linear reservoir approach this might result in modelling inaccuracies when simulating lowland regions with a thin unsaturated zone with strong influence of groundwater on streamflow to overcome this shortcoming in swat bailey et al 2016 coupled swat with modflow modflow nwt niswonger et al 2011 which is one of the most commonly used 3d physically based fully distributed groundwater flow models in the world the coupling of swat and modflow allows a more accurate representation of the hydrogeological processes such as temporal and spatial patterns of groundwater surface water interactions bailey et al 2016 gao et al 2019 or recharge mosase et al 2019 yifru et al 2020 however the number of successful swat modflow applications is still very limited and so are studies assessing the benefits of using swat modflow over swat alone bailey et al 2016 who developed and tested swat modlfow for a catchment in the us already found that the coupled model performed statistically better producing a higher baseflow fraction that fitted the observations aliyari et al 2019 guevara ochoa et al 2020 in catchments in us and argentina respectively found that swat modflow performed better than swat model itself particularly for low flows in europe swat modflow has been only successfully applied in northern denmark liu et al 2020 molina navarro et al 2019 both studies compared swat and swat modflow with a focus on groundwater abstractions impacts and their findings showed that both models demonstrate good performance they however found that swat modflow performed better particularly during recession curves and low flow periods and that only swat modflow provided realistic results when simulating groundwater abstractions finally semiromi and koch 2019 contrary to previous studies did not found improvements in streamflow simulation when coupling modflow to swat in an iranian catchment probably because of the low contribution of groundwater flow to streamflow the present paper will further explore the effects of introducing modflow into swat simulations with a new focus on subsurface drainage representation and non zero balance catchment the spatial distribution of subsurface drained areas has a significant impact on streamflow and water balance koch et al 2013 rahman et al 2014 but the location of drained areas is uncertain and different sources might suggest different things historically in denmark the individual contractors conducting the drainage work have been obligated to put their records in a national database managed by hedeselskabet but not all work has been reported in the literature more general applicable methods have been presented studies have located subsurface drainage for example using ground penetrating radar allred et al 2004 allred and redman 2010 aerial photos northcott et al 2000 verma et al 1996 statistical approaches hirt et al 2005 and more recently machine learning møller et al 2018 a main outcome of møller et al 2018 is a national map of predicted probability of artificial drainage for denmark møller et al 2018 suggested that the most important covariates for the prediction of artificially drained areas relate primarily to soil properties in particular clay content and topography the present paper will explore the effect of using different generally accessible sources to delineate the spatial distribution of subsurface drained areas on water balance simulations the main purpose of this study is to investigate the importance of subsurface drainage distribution on hydrological model performance and water balance in an agricultural catchment using swat and swat modflow to achieve it these models were set up for a subsurface drained agriculturally dominated small catchment in denmark testing four different scenarios of spatial distribution of subsurface drained areas 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the javngyde catchment is a 10 9 square km headwater catchment located in the central part of jutland denmark fig 1 two tributaries confluence to form the main stream which flows into the ravn lake sandy loam soils are present in the catchment and the subsurface consists of heterogeneous glacial deposits clay till and sand kim et al 2019 the eastern sub basin has a highly complicated structure while the western sub basin shows relatively homogenous features for example dipping clayey thrust structures are seen in the eastern sub basin while the western sub basin is covered by clay till approx 10 m thick which is underlain by meltwater sand and gravel approx 40 m thick in the stream valley the top clay layer may be eroded resulting in direct contact between the deep aquifer and the stream in areas with superficial clay till in the hilly parts of the catchment perched water tables form and generate drain flow in addition to perched water tables the meltwater sand and gravel constitute a deep aquifer the unsaturated zone thickness for this aquifer ranges from 0 to about 40 m elevation in the catchment ranges from about 25 115 m above sea level and around 75 of the catchment presents slopes below 8 main land uses are agriculture and urban areas which cover 85 and 6 respectively of the catchment other land uses are minor the area is mostly rural with two small population centres javngyde towards the outlet of the catchment and nørre vissing in the eastern part however water extraction in the catchment is 2 mm year the system has two main runoff components first drain flow which is evident from field inspections and a flashy hydrograph second direct groundwater seepage through the streambed and banks historical data show that average annual precipitation ranges from about 550 1050 mm year with most precipitation occurring august through february however net precipitation exceeds stream discharge at the outlet station with around 40 and geomorphology geology and water tables suggest that the excess water leaves the surface catchment as groundwater flow towards the southern lakes 2 2 model set up and coupling 2 2 1 swat set up swat2012 rev 664 was used in this project the model was set up using the qgis interface for swat qswat dile et al 2016 version 1 5 fig 1 shows an overview of the model set up the topography was based on a lidar digital elevation model with a resolution of 10 m fig 2a a threshold of 70 ha was chosen to create the stream network and 11 sub basins were created fig 1 a stream network shapefile from the area was used as burn in to ensure a correct representation of the stream channels the outlet was manually added matching with the monitoring station 21000759 where flow data is available for calibration fig 1 land use and soil type maps were provided to define together with the slope class the hydrological response units hrus which are the main computational units in the swat model the land use map fig 2b was based on the danish area information system nielsen 2000 to simplify the hru definition and smooth the swat modflow coupling all the urban land uses were assigned a unique category for the same purpose scrubland and deciduous forest 0 36 and 0 02 of total modelled area were merged into the general forest category and water land use 0 72 of total modelled area was merged with wetlands since agriculture is the dominant land use in the catchment the default parametrization was adapted to local conditions assigning a 5 year rotation with different crop types based on agricultural statistics for the region statistics denmark 2014 and expert knowledge rotating crops were spring barley and seed grass for the first year spring barley for the second year winter rape for the third year and winter wheat for the last two years of the rotation the three layer denmark s national soil map of 250 m grid resolution greve et al 2007 was used for representing soils fig 2c the hydraulic soil properties were parameterized for swat using the hypres pedotransfer function wösten et al 1999 soils dk4018 and dk4038 were only found in the outlet sub basin and combined they covered only 0 02 thus they were merged into a unique soil class keeping the dk4038 properties since it covered a larger area the surface slope was divided into three classes 0 2 2 8 and 8 fig 2d as a result 248 hrus were created climate data were obtained from the danish meteorological institute dmi daily precipitation solar radiation and wind speed were obtained from national grid data 10 km grid for precipitation 20 km grid for the others scharling 2001 daily maximum temperature minimum temperature and relative humidity were obtained from the two closest dmi climate stations located respectively 44 km northwest and 51 km northeast of the catchment boundary potential evapotranspiration pet was calculated by swat using the penman monteith equation to ensure an accurate representation of the hydrological processes in the catchment the default values of channel width and depth were edited after taking measurements during field work as a result the dimensions in table 1 were incorporated in the model 2 2 2 hydrogeological model because of the strong influence of hydrogeological processes on streamflow and water balance in the study area a detailed mapping and modelling of the subsurface is required for the groundwater flow model the study area has been intensely mapped with a transient electromagnetic method called ttem auken et al 2019 ttem data resolve electrical resistivity variations from land surface to 70 100 m depth the ttem survey uses a 1d sharp model formulation vignoli et al 2015 in a spatial constrained inversion setup viezzoli et al 2009 the ttem data set were collected in the ropen project https hgg au dk projects ropen to aid the modelling of groundwater nitrate reduction because the electrical resistivity models cannot be used directly as input to the groundwater flow model they were translated to hydrogeological units using the clay fraction clustering method foged et al 2014 vilhelmsen et al 2019 first resistivity models were translated into clay fraction values ranging from 0 to 100 clay the translation function are based on the assumption that clay materials are more electric conductive than non clay materials for determination of the optimal function for translating resistivity to clay fraction the method uses lithological information from boreholes because of the spatial variability in depositional and geochemical environment a spatially varying translation function in 3d is used a clay fraction value is assigned to each corresponding resistivity model and then clay fraction values and resistivity models are delineated into hydrogeological units using k means clustering because smaller areas in javngyde catchment were inaccessible and therefore not mapped gaps are present in the geophysical data coverage and hydrogeological model coverage first the hydrogeological units were interpolated from points x y z to a 3d grid by kriging using s gems remy 2005 the 3d grid was discretized into 30 by 30 by 2 m voxels x y z respectively and covered the same area as the swat model second the gaps were filled by multi points statistics using direct sampling algorithm mariethoz et al 2010 four hydrogeological units from most clayey to least clayey were used to represent the subsurface system based on the information from boreholes and ttem data detailed information about combining clustering methods with mps to simulate hydrogeological models can be found in vilhelmsen et al 2019 2 2 3 modflow set up modflow nwt niswonger et al 2011 was used in this study area mainly because this is the only version working with the current swat modflow code bailey et al 2016 the spatial extent of the modflow model was the same as for the swat model the modflow model was discretized into a grid of 140 rows and 226 columns in north south and west east directions respectively with cell sizes of 30 by 30 m the active modflow model domain matches the swat domain the model boundaries were defined as no flow boundaries except for the southern boundary towards the southern lakes swat sub basins 4 7 11 8 and 2 fig 1 which is defined as a general head boundary ghb to simulate groundwater flow across the surface catchment this boundary condition was assigned based on extensive geophysical data lithological information from boreholes and observed groundwater contour patterns the vertical discretization of the groundwater flow model is different from that of the hydrogeological model the groundwater flow model was discretized vertically into four layers 2 8 20 30 m thick respectively vertical and horizontal effective hydraulic conductivities were calculated within each cell of the groundwater model depending on the relative elevation of the hydrogeological model layers compared to the groundwater flow model layers the effective hydraulic property values are vertically averaged from the hydrogeological model grid to the groundwater model grid using the weighted arithmetic mean value and weighted geometric mean value for the horizontal hydraulic conductivity and vertical hydraulic conductivity respectively the up scaled hydrogeological model was imported into modflow using the upw package 2 2 4 swat modflow coupling swat and modflow models were coupled using qswatmod v 1 18 park et al 2019 a qgis based graphical user interface to couple swat and modflow models and execute post process and evaluate swat modflow the swat modflow fortran code included in this qswatmod version was further edited to enable swat tile drain flow routine and the modflow general head boundary package which are key features in this work detailed information about the coupling procedure can be found in bailey et al 2017 2016 park et al 2019 and in the swat modflow download site https swat tamu edu software swat modflow swat simulates surface and soil zone processes and hru s deep percolation enters in modflow as recharge while water leaves the modflow model in three ways 1 groundwater discharge to streams which is simulated using the river riv package here the stream network was similar to the stream network in swat 2 subsurface drainage flow calculated by swat when the water table is higher than a certain level and thus water re enters the soil zone swat domain 3 groundwater flow across the surface catchment calculated by modflow using the general head boundary ghb package 2 3 subsurface drainage scenarios it is important to include subsurface drainage in hydrological models to simulate groundwater flow patterns and nutrient transport in subsurface drained agricultural catchments kiesel et al 2010 in javngyde both field observations appendix a and the stream network used for burn in in swat evidenced the abundance of subsurface drains typically however information about which agricultural fields are drained is lacking this study tests four different scenarios in order to assess the effect of subsurface drained area on model performance and water balance the four scenarios are described in the following and the spatial distribution of drained areas for the four scenarios are shown in fig 3 in scenario 1 an area is subsurface drained if clay content is high in the top 4 m of the subsurface because little information about clay content is available in javngyde we based the delineation of drained areas on the distribution of hydrogeological units the most clayey hydrogeological unit was number 4 so areas that have unit 4 in modflow model layer 1 is subsurface drained in scenario 2 the spatial distribution of drained areas is based on historical maps from contractors which conducted the drainage work in scenario 3 following other successful swat set ups in denmark e g molina navarro et al 2017 2019 thodsen et al 2015 drained areas were set up in those hrus with agricultural land use slope below 2 and clay content in the second soil layer over 8 in scenario 4 a variation of scenario 3 was implemented tile drained surface in scenario 3 represented only 16 of the catchment area however according to the drained area probability map developed by møller et al 2018 59 of the javngyde catchment has a probability of having subsurface drainage over 50 thus drained surface set up was expanded to all those areas with slope below 8 instead of 2 but removing them in sub basins 8 10 and 11 where the probability following møller et al 2018 is small this represent a 55 of the total modelled area which is close to the above mentioned 59 2 4 model calibration and validation swat calibration was performed for each model set up corresponding to the four subsurface drainage scenarios calibration on a daily time step was addressed from 01 01 2005 31 12 2009 against discharge values from the monitoring station 21000759 fig 1 outlet of sub basin 11 using a warm up period of 10 years 1995 2004 the sequential uncertainty fitting algorithm sufi2 was used to carry out an automatic calibration with swat cup v 5 1 6 abbaspour et al 2015 the flow calibration scheme proposed by molina navarro et al 2017 was further developed to include deep aquifer swat parameters and to calibrate separately soil parameters for each soil type thus 24 parameters were included in the automatic calibration appendix c three iterations of 1000 simulations were run updating the parameter ranges after each iteration but keeping them within realistic values to ensure reality constrains in the model for additional details see molina navarro et al 2017 initially and following these authors the summation form of the square error sum was used however for some iterations the best simulation appointed by swat cup which is based on of statistical performance yielded a completely flat and thus unrealistic hydrograph for the low flows thus a combination of objective functions including also the percent bias pbias and the coefficient of determination r2 was used to ensure a satisfactory and realistic model performance finally the model performance was evaluated both graphically and statistically the statistical indices mentioned before were used as performance metrics since they represent three different groups standard regression r2 dimensionless nse and error index pbias thus guaranteeing a robust model performance afterwards swat was coupled with modflow as explained above and the only modification in the coupled models was a manual calibration of the riverbed hydraulic conductance from the modflow riv package since it was also found useful in bailey et al 2016 molina navarro et al 2019 and taie semiromi and koch 2019 then swat modflow models were evaluated and the performances of swat and swat modflow for each subsurface drainage scenario were compared model validation is out of the scope of this manuscript since the aim is not a concrete hydrological application but exploring the plausible benefits of swat modflow over swat alone and different subsurface drainage scenarios in a non zero balance catchment 3 results and discussion 3 1 differences between swat and swat modflow 3 1 1 model performance fig 4 shows the swat and swat modflow simulated vs observed monthly hydrographs for each subsurface drainage scenario during the calibration period daily versions of these hydrographs are also presented in appendix b both swat and swat modflow represented well the timing in the streamflow discharge in all the scenarios fig 4 appendix b however the accuracy when simulating peak flows and low flows differed generally speaking discharges were always overestimated by swat both during peak flows and low flows swat modflow however represented the low flows better than swat while peak flows were over or underestimated depending on the scenarios the daily hydrographs also reveal swat modflow represented better than swat the shape of the recession curve after peak flows appendix b these facts might be related with a better representation of the groundwater component of the streamflow in swat modflow than in swat which has already been discussed e g aliyari et al 2019 bailey et al 2016 molina navarro et al 2019 in this particular study case where the catchment water balance is not closed the inability of swat to deal with such a situation becomes evident not being able to lower the flow and to achieve the observed values despite addressing an automatic calibration with 3 iterations of 1000 simulations just by coupling the model with modflow and manually calibrating the riverbed conductance the model improvement is noticeable table 2 shows the daily and monthly performance metrics values achieved during calibration swat and swat modflow for all the subsurface drainage scenarios both daily and monthly swat performed better in the scenarios with lower drain surface scenarios 2 and 3 r2 values were similar or even better for swat modflow at a monthly time step but nse values were always higher for swat which might rely on a better simulation of the peak flows zhang et al 2015 underestimated in swat modflow in those scenarios however the better pbias yielded by swat in these scenarios relied on a compensation of over and underestimations rather than a satisfactory streamflow discharge representation fig 4 this is especially visible in the daily hydrographs appendix c where swat simulated hydrographs are relatively flat and constitutes a good example of the importance of assessing model performance both graphically and statistically nonetheless none of the swat simulations achieved a satisfactory performance for all the three metrics following the standards by moriasi et al 2015 swat modflow however performed statistically better in those scenarios with larger tile drained surface scenarios 1 and 4 in fact both scenarios achieved good nse and pbias or very good r2 standards for monthly calibration following moriasi et al 2015 more specific differences across scenarios are discussed in subsection 3 2 3 1 2 water balance table 3 shows the results obtained for the main components of the water balance in the javngyde catchment for swat and swat modflow for all four subsurface drainage scenarios during the calibration period both models simulated actual evapotranspiration appropriately accounting for 62 63 of precipitation and yielding a net precipitation of 315 328 mm in calibration period which is an expected value for this region noticeable differences were found however in streamflow table 3 swat modflow simulated less total streamflow than swat for all the subsurface drainage scenarios values for direct flow and subsurface drainage flow were similar for the two models whereas swat modflow simulated less groundwater discharge to the stream than swat this is expected because modflow is able to simulate groundwater flow across the surface catchment by the ghb package whereas swat is not capable of simulating flow out of the catchment as already anticipated above when discussing the overestimation in the models this together with the globally better graphical and statistical model performance obtained with swat modflow reinforces the findings of previous authors above discussed regarding the outperformance of the coupled model versus single swat our study additionally contributes testing it in a non zero balance catchment a common situation in flat or hydrogeologically complex areas becoming the differences even more evident thus the subsequent analysis differences between subsurface drainage scenarios is focused only on the coupled model results 3 2 differences between subsurface drainage scenarios 3 2 1 model parameters table 4 in appendix c shows the optimized parameter values for the different subsurface drainage scenarios scenario 1 and 4 show exactly the same optimized parameter values which means that the optimization process in sufi2 led to the same parameter set probably because of having a similar subsurface drained area this confers credibility to the model and the sufi2 algorithm and proves that limiting initially the parameter ranges to cope with realistic local conditions avoids plausible equifinality problems having different parameter sets providing equally good models daggupati et al 2015 molina navarro et al 2017 yen et al 2014 scenarios 2 and 3 however yielded different parameter sets probably driving the model to artificially minimize flows giving the inability of swat to route water out of the catchments which is particularly relevant in these two setups with lower drained surface and thus higher groundwater contribution to streamflow 3 2 2 model performance scenarios 1 and 4 showed better statistical performance during the calibration period than scenarios 2 and 3 table 2 regarding the graphical performance they also represented better the timing and the magnitude of the streamflow the latest being underestimated in scenarios 2 and 3 particularly during high flow periods fig 4 and appendix b however there are differences also between scenarios 1 and 4 daily hydrographs appendix b reveal that scenario 4 reproduces worse the lower part of the recession curve underestimating flow while its flow overestimation in peaks is larger than in scenario 1 on the contrary scenario 1 represents better recession curves flow peaks and low flows thus rendering a better daily nse table 2 thus scenario 1 for swat modflow showed the best performance during the calibration period 2005 2009 statistical and graphical performance of scenario 1 was superior to other swat modflow applications in which as in this study a calibrated swat model has been directly coupled to a modflow model or additionally just adjusting the riverbed conductance e g aliyari et al 2019 bailey et al 2016 chunn et al 2019 guevara ochoa et al 2020 besides an error index pbias was used in this study additionally to r2 and nse to evaluate the models this is generally overlooked in the cited studies and gives robustness to our results since metrics of three different kinds have been used moriasi et al 2015 the better performance in this study could be attributed to the detailed description of the hydrogeological processes by modflow thus providing a more accurate simulation 3 2 3 water balance the four subsurface drainage scenarios simulated similar annual average values for actual evapotranspiration ranging from 525 to 538 mm table 3 however noticeable differences between the scenarios were observed for the remaining water balance components overall scenario 1 and 4 had one set of similar values while scenario 2 and 3 had another set of similar values this is very likely because scenario 1 and 4 and scenario 2 and 3 respectively had similar fractions of subsurface drained areas out of the total modelled area large and small fraction scenarios respectively logically the small fraction scenarios simulated less drain flow and direct flow to the stream than the large fraction scenarios while the opposite was the case for groundwater discharge additionally the small fraction scenarios showed a larger difference between swat and swat modflow simulations of annual average values for streamflow and water balance residual than the large fraction scenarios overall scenarios 1 and 4 seem to be most correct considering the measured flow in the gauging station and pbias values in table 2 this is likely because small fraction scenarios are more dominated by groundwater flow processes and as a consequence amplify the effect of the conceptual differences between swat and swat modflow regarding hydrogeological processes as discussed earlier that is swat not being able to route water out of the catchment to the best of our knowledge this is the first time that the impacts of different subsurface drainage scenarios on catchment hydrology are assessed using swat and swat modflow thus our study reveals that the input of subsurface drainage spatial distribution is a key stage during modelling set up to guarantee a successful hydrological simulation 3 3 implications for delineation of subsurface drained areas in similar catchments it is worth re emphasising that the best performing model scenario was swat modflow with subsurface drainage scenario 1 using clay content in upper few meters of the subsurface to delineate subsurface drained areas it is well known that information about the actual location of subsurface drained fields is hard almost impossible to obtain even in denmark where the individual contractors conducting the drainage work have been obligated to put their records into a national database the information is incorrect studies have used ground penetrating radar aerial photos statistical approaches and machine learning however the spatial distribution of subsurface drainage on local scale is uncertain results in møller et al 2018 indicated that one of the most important covariates for the prediction of subsurface drained areas is clay content however information on clay content is rarely available on an appropriate scale for catchment scale studies we used geophysical mapping and modelling to obtain information about electrical conductivity of the upper few meters and used this information as a proxy for clay content the method is data driven and we obtain high spatial resolution 20 by 10 m and information for all accessible agricultural fields within the area however this level of information is not typically available in other catchments nonetheless we recommend the presented method to delineate subsurface drained areas in agricultural catchments once scenario 1 has been seen as the best performing in this complex study case subsurface drained agricultural catchment non closed water balance future work could include a combined swat modflow calibration as in liu et al 2020 followed by the simulation of relevant scenarios in the study area e g climate change or solute transport modelling 4 conclusions this work was undertaken to investigate the effect of using four different delineations of the spatial distribution of subsurface drainage systems on hydrological model performance and catchment water balance the four scenarios were based on 1 low electrical resistivity as a proxy for clay content in the top 4 m of the subsurface 2 historical maps from contractors which conducted the drainage work 3 settings from previous successful swat set ups in denmark and 4 similar settings as in scenario 3 but adjusted according to the national drained area probability map in denmark scenarios 1 and 4 had large fractions of subsurface drained areas out of the total surface catchment area whereas scenarios 2 and 3 had small fractions in total four swat models and four swat modflow models were set up for the study area a small agricultural catchment in denmark scenarios 2 and 3 lower tile drained areas showed better statistical performance with swat while scenarios 1 and 4 larger tile drained areas performed better using swat modflow however scenarios 2 and 3 underestimated the magnitude of streamflow particularly during high flow periods because of underestimating subsurface drainage flow to the stream moreover swat modflow showed overall better statistical and graphical performance than swat swat overestimated both peak flows and low flows because the model overestimated groundwater discharge to the stream the primary reason is that swat modflow is able to simulate groundwater flow across the surface catchment whereas swat simulates closed sub basins as an overall conclusion our results suggest that the spatial distribution of subsurface drainage systems in agricultural catchments is a key input step when modelling hydrology since it has appreciable effects on model performance and water balance simulation additionally the results showed that appropriate modelling of the hydrogeological processes is also important for model performance and water balance the proposed method of handling these elements by coupling a surface catchment model to a highly detailed groundwater flow model and delineating subsurface drained areas using geophysical data is promising the method can be adopted by other researchers and water administrations and might aid to

10013,artificial subsurface drainage impacts the hydrological system but its spatial distribution is typically uncertain hindering the understanding of the hydrological behaviour of a certain catchment in this study the effects of using four different sources to delineate the spatial distribution of subsurface drainage systems on hydrological modelling performance and simulated water balance were assessed this work was addressed using swat and swat modflow that is four swat models and four swat modflow models were set up and evaluated the spatial distribution of subsurface drainage systems were based on 1 low electrical resistivity as a proxy for clay content in the top 4 m of the subsurface 2 historical maps from contractors which conducted the drainage work 3 settings from previous successful swat set ups in denmark and 4 similar settings as in scenario 3 but adjusted according to the national drained area probability map in denmark scenarios 1 and 4 and scenarios 2 and 3 respectively showed similar fractions of subsurface drained areas out of the total catchment area large and small respectively scenarios 2 and 3 showed better statistical performance with swat while scenarios 1 and 4 performed better using swat modflow best statistical and graphical performances were obtained with the large drain fraction scenarios and when using the coupled model first low drain fraction scenarios underestimated subsurface drainage flow to the stream besides swat modflow performed better than swat because modflow was able to simulate groundwater flow across the surface catchment whereas swat by default is not capable of doing so all things considered impacts of different subsurface drainage scenarios on catchment hydrology are assessed using both swat and swat modflow for the first time in this work revealing the relevance of this input step for satisfactory hydrological modelling and reinforcing previous authors findings regarding the better performance of the coupled model over swat but being even more relevant in this none zero balance catchment the proposed method of modelling coupling and delineating subsurface drained areas using geophysical data is promising and can be adopted by other researchers to evaluate the water balance impact of land use and climate changes around the world keywords subsurface drainage streamflow water balance catchment modelling swat modflow 1 introduction in agricultural lowland regions with a thin unsaturated zone artificial drainage open ditches and subsurface drainage is a common practice to improve crop yields by lowering water tables around 60 of denmark is cultivated arable land that is worked by ploughing and sowing and raising crops and around 50 of the cultivated land is artificially drained mainly by subsurface drainage møller et al 2018 because subsurface drainage can be a significant hydrologic pathway in agricultural catchments king et al 2014 with detrimental consequences for stream ecosystems it is an important consideration in hydrological modelling of such areas one of the most commonly used hydrological models for agricultural areas at catchment scale to partition total discharge into individual flow components is the soil and water assessment tool swat arnold et al 1998 among other advantages swat implements very detailed soil water dynamics and allows highly detailed inputs regarding agricultural management however swat has limitations in the simulation of the groundwater component swat uses a lumped linear reservoir approach this might result in modelling inaccuracies when simulating lowland regions with a thin unsaturated zone with strong influence of groundwater on streamflow to overcome this shortcoming in swat bailey et al 2016 coupled swat with modflow modflow nwt niswonger et al 2011 which is one of the most commonly used 3d physically based fully distributed groundwater flow models in the world the coupling of swat and modflow allows a more accurate representation of the hydrogeological processes such as temporal and spatial patterns of groundwater surface water interactions bailey et al 2016 gao et al 2019 or recharge mosase et al 2019 yifru et al 2020 however the number of successful swat modflow applications is still very limited and so are studies assessing the benefits of using swat modflow over swat alone bailey et al 2016 who developed and tested swat modlfow for a catchment in the us already found that the coupled model performed statistically better producing a higher baseflow fraction that fitted the observations aliyari et al 2019 guevara ochoa et al 2020 in catchments in us and argentina respectively found that swat modflow performed better than swat model itself particularly for low flows in europe swat modflow has been only successfully applied in northern denmark liu et al 2020 molina navarro et al 2019 both studies compared swat and swat modflow with a focus on groundwater abstractions impacts and their findings showed that both models demonstrate good performance they however found that swat modflow performed better particularly during recession curves and low flow periods and that only swat modflow provided realistic results when simulating groundwater abstractions finally semiromi and koch 2019 contrary to previous studies did not found improvements in streamflow simulation when coupling modflow to swat in an iranian catchment probably because of the low contribution of groundwater flow to streamflow the present paper will further explore the effects of introducing modflow into swat simulations with a new focus on subsurface drainage representation and non zero balance catchment the spatial distribution of subsurface drained areas has a significant impact on streamflow and water balance koch et al 2013 rahman et al 2014 but the location of drained areas is uncertain and different sources might suggest different things historically in denmark the individual contractors conducting the drainage work have been obligated to put their records in a national database managed by hedeselskabet but not all work has been reported in the literature more general applicable methods have been presented studies have located subsurface drainage for example using ground penetrating radar allred et al 2004 allred and redman 2010 aerial photos northcott et al 2000 verma et al 1996 statistical approaches hirt et al 2005 and more recently machine learning møller et al 2018 a main outcome of møller et al 2018 is a national map of predicted probability of artificial drainage for denmark møller et al 2018 suggested that the most important covariates for the prediction of artificially drained areas relate primarily to soil properties in particular clay content and topography the present paper will explore the effect of using different generally accessible sources to delineate the spatial distribution of subsurface drained areas on water balance simulations the main purpose of this study is to investigate the importance of subsurface drainage distribution on hydrological model performance and water balance in an agricultural catchment using swat and swat modflow to achieve it these models were set up for a subsurface drained agriculturally dominated small catchment in denmark testing four different scenarios of spatial distribution of subsurface drained areas 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the javngyde catchment is a 10 9 square km headwater catchment located in the central part of jutland denmark fig 1 two tributaries confluence to form the main stream which flows into the ravn lake sandy loam soils are present in the catchment and the subsurface consists of heterogeneous glacial deposits clay till and sand kim et al 2019 the eastern sub basin has a highly complicated structure while the western sub basin shows relatively homogenous features for example dipping clayey thrust structures are seen in the eastern sub basin while the western sub basin is covered by clay till approx 10 m thick which is underlain by meltwater sand and gravel approx 40 m thick in the stream valley the top clay layer may be eroded resulting in direct contact between the deep aquifer and the stream in areas with superficial clay till in the hilly parts of the catchment perched water tables form and generate drain flow in addition to perched water tables the meltwater sand and gravel constitute a deep aquifer the unsaturated zone thickness for this aquifer ranges from 0 to about 40 m elevation in the catchment ranges from about 25 115 m above sea level and around 75 of the catchment presents slopes below 8 main land uses are agriculture and urban areas which cover 85 and 6 respectively of the catchment other land uses are minor the area is mostly rural with two small population centres javngyde towards the outlet of the catchment and nørre vissing in the eastern part however water extraction in the catchment is 2 mm year the system has two main runoff components first drain flow which is evident from field inspections and a flashy hydrograph second direct groundwater seepage through the streambed and banks historical data show that average annual precipitation ranges from about 550 1050 mm year with most precipitation occurring august through february however net precipitation exceeds stream discharge at the outlet station with around 40 and geomorphology geology and water tables suggest that the excess water leaves the surface catchment as groundwater flow towards the southern lakes 2 2 model set up and coupling 2 2 1 swat set up swat2012 rev 664 was used in this project the model was set up using the qgis interface for swat qswat dile et al 2016 version 1 5 fig 1 shows an overview of the model set up the topography was based on a lidar digital elevation model with a resolution of 10 m fig 2a a threshold of 70 ha was chosen to create the stream network and 11 sub basins were created fig 1 a stream network shapefile from the area was used as burn in to ensure a correct representation of the stream channels the outlet was manually added matching with the monitoring station 21000759 where flow data is available for calibration fig 1 land use and soil type maps were provided to define together with the slope class the hydrological response units hrus which are the main computational units in the swat model the land use map fig 2b was based on the danish area information system nielsen 2000 to simplify the hru definition and smooth the swat modflow coupling all the urban land uses were assigned a unique category for the same purpose scrubland and deciduous forest 0 36 and 0 02 of total modelled area were merged into the general forest category and water land use 0 72 of total modelled area was merged with wetlands since agriculture is the dominant land use in the catchment the default parametrization was adapted to local conditions assigning a 5 year rotation with different crop types based on agricultural statistics for the region statistics denmark 2014 and expert knowledge rotating crops were spring barley and seed grass for the first year spring barley for the second year winter rape for the third year and winter wheat for the last two years of the rotation the three layer denmark s national soil map of 250 m grid resolution greve et al 2007 was used for representing soils fig 2c the hydraulic soil properties were parameterized for swat using the hypres pedotransfer function wösten et al 1999 soils dk4018 and dk4038 were only found in the outlet sub basin and combined they covered only 0 02 thus they were merged into a unique soil class keeping the dk4038 properties since it covered a larger area the surface slope was divided into three classes 0 2 2 8 and 8 fig 2d as a result 248 hrus were created climate data were obtained from the danish meteorological institute dmi daily precipitation solar radiation and wind speed were obtained from national grid data 10 km grid for precipitation 20 km grid for the others scharling 2001 daily maximum temperature minimum temperature and relative humidity were obtained from the two closest dmi climate stations located respectively 44 km northwest and 51 km northeast of the catchment boundary potential evapotranspiration pet was calculated by swat using the penman monteith equation to ensure an accurate representation of the hydrological processes in the catchment the default values of channel width and depth were edited after taking measurements during field work as a result the dimensions in table 1 were incorporated in the model 2 2 2 hydrogeological model because of the strong influence of hydrogeological processes on streamflow and water balance in the study area a detailed mapping and modelling of the subsurface is required for the groundwater flow model the study area has been intensely mapped with a transient electromagnetic method called ttem auken et al 2019 ttem data resolve electrical resistivity variations from land surface to 70 100 m depth the ttem survey uses a 1d sharp model formulation vignoli et al 2015 in a spatial constrained inversion setup viezzoli et al 2009 the ttem data set were collected in the ropen project https hgg au dk projects ropen to aid the modelling of groundwater nitrate reduction because the electrical resistivity models cannot be used directly as input to the groundwater flow model they were translated to hydrogeological units using the clay fraction clustering method foged et al 2014 vilhelmsen et al 2019 first resistivity models were translated into clay fraction values ranging from 0 to 100 clay the translation function are based on the assumption that clay materials are more electric conductive than non clay materials for determination of the optimal function for translating resistivity to clay fraction the method uses lithological information from boreholes because of the spatial variability in depositional and geochemical environment a spatially varying translation function in 3d is used a clay fraction value is assigned to each corresponding resistivity model and then clay fraction values and resistivity models are delineated into hydrogeological units using k means clustering because smaller areas in javngyde catchment were inaccessible and therefore not mapped gaps are present in the geophysical data coverage and hydrogeological model coverage first the hydrogeological units were interpolated from points x y z to a 3d grid by kriging using s gems remy 2005 the 3d grid was discretized into 30 by 30 by 2 m voxels x y z respectively and covered the same area as the swat model second the gaps were filled by multi points statistics using direct sampling algorithm mariethoz et al 2010 four hydrogeological units from most clayey to least clayey were used to represent the subsurface system based on the information from boreholes and ttem data detailed information about combining clustering methods with mps to simulate hydrogeological models can be found in vilhelmsen et al 2019 2 2 3 modflow set up modflow nwt niswonger et al 2011 was used in this study area mainly because this is the only version working with the current swat modflow code bailey et al 2016 the spatial extent of the modflow model was the same as for the swat model the modflow model was discretized into a grid of 140 rows and 226 columns in north south and west east directions respectively with cell sizes of 30 by 30 m the active modflow model domain matches the swat domain the model boundaries were defined as no flow boundaries except for the southern boundary towards the southern lakes swat sub basins 4 7 11 8 and 2 fig 1 which is defined as a general head boundary ghb to simulate groundwater flow across the surface catchment this boundary condition was assigned based on extensive geophysical data lithological information from boreholes and observed groundwater contour patterns the vertical discretization of the groundwater flow model is different from that of the hydrogeological model the groundwater flow model was discretized vertically into four layers 2 8 20 30 m thick respectively vertical and horizontal effective hydraulic conductivities were calculated within each cell of the groundwater model depending on the relative elevation of the hydrogeological model layers compared to the groundwater flow model layers the effective hydraulic property values are vertically averaged from the hydrogeological model grid to the groundwater model grid using the weighted arithmetic mean value and weighted geometric mean value for the horizontal hydraulic conductivity and vertical hydraulic conductivity respectively the up scaled hydrogeological model was imported into modflow using the upw package 2 2 4 swat modflow coupling swat and modflow models were coupled using qswatmod v 1 18 park et al 2019 a qgis based graphical user interface to couple swat and modflow models and execute post process and evaluate swat modflow the swat modflow fortran code included in this qswatmod version was further edited to enable swat tile drain flow routine and the modflow general head boundary package which are key features in this work detailed information about the coupling procedure can be found in bailey et al 2017 2016 park et al 2019 and in the swat modflow download site https swat tamu edu software swat modflow swat simulates surface and soil zone processes and hru s deep percolation enters in modflow as recharge while water leaves the modflow model in three ways 1 groundwater discharge to streams which is simulated using the river riv package here the stream network was similar to the stream network in swat 2 subsurface drainage flow calculated by swat when the water table is higher than a certain level and thus water re enters the soil zone swat domain 3 groundwater flow across the surface catchment calculated by modflow using the general head boundary ghb package 2 3 subsurface drainage scenarios it is important to include subsurface drainage in hydrological models to simulate groundwater flow patterns and nutrient transport in subsurface drained agricultural catchments kiesel et al 2010 in javngyde both field observations appendix a and the stream network used for burn in in swat evidenced the abundance of subsurface drains typically however information about which agricultural fields are drained is lacking this study tests four different scenarios in order to assess the effect of subsurface drained area on model performance and water balance the four scenarios are described in the following and the spatial distribution of drained areas for the four scenarios are shown in fig 3 in scenario 1 an area is subsurface drained if clay content is high in the top 4 m of the subsurface because little information about clay content is available in javngyde we based the delineation of drained areas on the distribution of hydrogeological units the most clayey hydrogeological unit was number 4 so areas that have unit 4 in modflow model layer 1 is subsurface drained in scenario 2 the spatial distribution of drained areas is based on historical maps from contractors which conducted the drainage work in scenario 3 following other successful swat set ups in denmark e g molina navarro et al 2017 2019 thodsen et al 2015 drained areas were set up in those hrus with agricultural land use slope below 2 and clay content in the second soil layer over 8 in scenario 4 a variation of scenario 3 was implemented tile drained surface in scenario 3 represented only 16 of the catchment area however according to the drained area probability map developed by møller et al 2018 59 of the javngyde catchment has a probability of having subsurface drainage over 50 thus drained surface set up was expanded to all those areas with slope below 8 instead of 2 but removing them in sub basins 8 10 and 11 where the probability following møller et al 2018 is small this represent a 55 of the total modelled area which is close to the above mentioned 59 2 4 model calibration and validation swat calibration was performed for each model set up corresponding to the four subsurface drainage scenarios calibration on a daily time step was addressed from 01 01 2005 31 12 2009 against discharge values from the monitoring station 21000759 fig 1 outlet of sub basin 11 using a warm up period of 10 years 1995 2004 the sequential uncertainty fitting algorithm sufi2 was used to carry out an automatic calibration with swat cup v 5 1 6 abbaspour et al 2015 the flow calibration scheme proposed by molina navarro et al 2017 was further developed to include deep aquifer swat parameters and to calibrate separately soil parameters for each soil type thus 24 parameters were included in the automatic calibration appendix c three iterations of 1000 simulations were run updating the parameter ranges after each iteration but keeping them within realistic values to ensure reality constrains in the model for additional details see molina navarro et al 2017 initially and following these authors the summation form of the square error sum was used however for some iterations the best simulation appointed by swat cup which is based on of statistical performance yielded a completely flat and thus unrealistic hydrograph for the low flows thus a combination of objective functions including also the percent bias pbias and the coefficient of determination r2 was used to ensure a satisfactory and realistic model performance finally the model performance was evaluated both graphically and statistically the statistical indices mentioned before were used as performance metrics since they represent three different groups standard regression r2 dimensionless nse and error index pbias thus guaranteeing a robust model performance afterwards swat was coupled with modflow as explained above and the only modification in the coupled models was a manual calibration of the riverbed hydraulic conductance from the modflow riv package since it was also found useful in bailey et al 2016 molina navarro et al 2019 and taie semiromi and koch 2019 then swat modflow models were evaluated and the performances of swat and swat modflow for each subsurface drainage scenario were compared model validation is out of the scope of this manuscript since the aim is not a concrete hydrological application but exploring the plausible benefits of swat modflow over swat alone and different subsurface drainage scenarios in a non zero balance catchment 3 results and discussion 3 1 differences between swat and swat modflow 3 1 1 model performance fig 4 shows the swat and swat modflow simulated vs observed monthly hydrographs for each subsurface drainage scenario during the calibration period daily versions of these hydrographs are also presented in appendix b both swat and swat modflow represented well the timing in the streamflow discharge in all the scenarios fig 4 appendix b however the accuracy when simulating peak flows and low flows differed generally speaking discharges were always overestimated by swat both during peak flows and low flows swat modflow however represented the low flows better than swat while peak flows were over or underestimated depending on the scenarios the daily hydrographs also reveal swat modflow represented better than swat the shape of the recession curve after peak flows appendix b these facts might be related with a better representation of the groundwater component of the streamflow in swat modflow than in swat which has already been discussed e g aliyari et al 2019 bailey et al 2016 molina navarro et al 2019 in this particular study case where the catchment water balance is not closed the inability of swat to deal with such a situation becomes evident not being able to lower the flow and to achieve the observed values despite addressing an automatic calibration with 3 iterations of 1000 simulations just by coupling the model with modflow and manually calibrating the riverbed conductance the model improvement is noticeable table 2 shows the daily and monthly performance metrics values achieved during calibration swat and swat modflow for all the subsurface drainage scenarios both daily and monthly swat performed better in the scenarios with lower drain surface scenarios 2 and 3 r2 values were similar or even better for swat modflow at a monthly time step but nse values were always higher for swat which might rely on a better simulation of the peak flows zhang et al 2015 underestimated in swat modflow in those scenarios however the better pbias yielded by swat in these scenarios relied on a compensation of over and underestimations rather than a satisfactory streamflow discharge representation fig 4 this is especially visible in the daily hydrographs appendix c where swat simulated hydrographs are relatively flat and constitutes a good example of the importance of assessing model performance both graphically and statistically nonetheless none of the swat simulations achieved a satisfactory performance for all the three metrics following the standards by moriasi et al 2015 swat modflow however performed statistically better in those scenarios with larger tile drained surface scenarios 1 and 4 in fact both scenarios achieved good nse and pbias or very good r2 standards for monthly calibration following moriasi et al 2015 more specific differences across scenarios are discussed in subsection 3 2 3 1 2 water balance table 3 shows the results obtained for the main components of the water balance in the javngyde catchment for swat and swat modflow for all four subsurface drainage scenarios during the calibration period both models simulated actual evapotranspiration appropriately accounting for 62 63 of precipitation and yielding a net precipitation of 315 328 mm in calibration period which is an expected value for this region noticeable differences were found however in streamflow table 3 swat modflow simulated less total streamflow than swat for all the subsurface drainage scenarios values for direct flow and subsurface drainage flow were similar for the two models whereas swat modflow simulated less groundwater discharge to the stream than swat this is expected because modflow is able to simulate groundwater flow across the surface catchment by the ghb package whereas swat is not capable of simulating flow out of the catchment as already anticipated above when discussing the overestimation in the models this together with the globally better graphical and statistical model performance obtained with swat modflow reinforces the findings of previous authors above discussed regarding the outperformance of the coupled model versus single swat our study additionally contributes testing it in a non zero balance catchment a common situation in flat or hydrogeologically complex areas becoming the differences even more evident thus the subsequent analysis differences between subsurface drainage scenarios is focused only on the coupled model results 3 2 differences between subsurface drainage scenarios 3 2 1 model parameters table 4 in appendix c shows the optimized parameter values for the different subsurface drainage scenarios scenario 1 and 4 show exactly the same optimized parameter values which means that the optimization process in sufi2 led to the same parameter set probably because of having a similar subsurface drained area this confers credibility to the model and the sufi2 algorithm and proves that limiting initially the parameter ranges to cope with realistic local conditions avoids plausible equifinality problems having different parameter sets providing equally good models daggupati et al 2015 molina navarro et al 2017 yen et al 2014 scenarios 2 and 3 however yielded different parameter sets probably driving the model to artificially minimize flows giving the inability of swat to route water out of the catchments which is particularly relevant in these two setups with lower drained surface and thus higher groundwater contribution to streamflow 3 2 2 model performance scenarios 1 and 4 showed better statistical performance during the calibration period than scenarios 2 and 3 table 2 regarding the graphical performance they also represented better the timing and the magnitude of the streamflow the latest being underestimated in scenarios 2 and 3 particularly during high flow periods fig 4 and appendix b however there are differences also between scenarios 1 and 4 daily hydrographs appendix b reveal that scenario 4 reproduces worse the lower part of the recession curve underestimating flow while its flow overestimation in peaks is larger than in scenario 1 on the contrary scenario 1 represents better recession curves flow peaks and low flows thus rendering a better daily nse table 2 thus scenario 1 for swat modflow showed the best performance during the calibration period 2005 2009 statistical and graphical performance of scenario 1 was superior to other swat modflow applications in which as in this study a calibrated swat model has been directly coupled to a modflow model or additionally just adjusting the riverbed conductance e g aliyari et al 2019 bailey et al 2016 chunn et al 2019 guevara ochoa et al 2020 besides an error index pbias was used in this study additionally to r2 and nse to evaluate the models this is generally overlooked in the cited studies and gives robustness to our results since metrics of three different kinds have been used moriasi et al 2015 the better performance in this study could be attributed to the detailed description of the hydrogeological processes by modflow thus providing a more accurate simulation 3 2 3 water balance the four subsurface drainage scenarios simulated similar annual average values for actual evapotranspiration ranging from 525 to 538 mm table 3 however noticeable differences between the scenarios were observed for the remaining water balance components overall scenario 1 and 4 had one set of similar values while scenario 2 and 3 had another set of similar values this is very likely because scenario 1 and 4 and scenario 2 and 3 respectively had similar fractions of subsurface drained areas out of the total modelled area large and small fraction scenarios respectively logically the small fraction scenarios simulated less drain flow and direct flow to the stream than the large fraction scenarios while the opposite was the case for groundwater discharge additionally the small fraction scenarios showed a larger difference between swat and swat modflow simulations of annual average values for streamflow and water balance residual than the large fraction scenarios overall scenarios 1 and 4 seem to be most correct considering the measured flow in the gauging station and pbias values in table 2 this is likely because small fraction scenarios are more dominated by groundwater flow processes and as a consequence amplify the effect of the conceptual differences between swat and swat modflow regarding hydrogeological processes as discussed earlier that is swat not being able to route water out of the catchment to the best of our knowledge this is the first time that the impacts of different subsurface drainage scenarios on catchment hydrology are assessed using swat and swat modflow thus our study reveals that the input of subsurface drainage spatial distribution is a key stage during modelling set up to guarantee a successful hydrological simulation 3 3 implications for delineation of subsurface drained areas in similar catchments it is worth re emphasising that the best performing model scenario was swat modflow with subsurface drainage scenario 1 using clay content in upper few meters of the subsurface to delineate subsurface drained areas it is well known that information about the actual location of subsurface drained fields is hard almost impossible to obtain even in denmark where the individual contractors conducting the drainage work have been obligated to put their records into a national database the information is incorrect studies have used ground penetrating radar aerial photos statistical approaches and machine learning however the spatial distribution of subsurface drainage on local scale is uncertain results in møller et al 2018 indicated that one of the most important covariates for the prediction of subsurface drained areas is clay content however information on clay content is rarely available on an appropriate scale for catchment scale studies we used geophysical mapping and modelling to obtain information about electrical conductivity of the upper few meters and used this information as a proxy for clay content the method is data driven and we obtain high spatial resolution 20 by 10 m and information for all accessible agricultural fields within the area however this level of information is not typically available in other catchments nonetheless we recommend the presented method to delineate subsurface drained areas in agricultural catchments once scenario 1 has been seen as the best performing in this complex study case subsurface drained agricultural catchment non closed water balance future work could include a combined swat modflow calibration as in liu et al 2020 followed by the simulation of relevant scenarios in the study area e g climate change or solute transport modelling 4 conclusions this work was undertaken to investigate the effect of using four different delineations of the spatial distribution of subsurface drainage systems on hydrological model performance and catchment water balance the four scenarios were based on 1 low electrical resistivity as a proxy for clay content in the top 4 m of the subsurface 2 historical maps from contractors which conducted the drainage work 3 settings from previous successful swat set ups in denmark and 4 similar settings as in scenario 3 but adjusted according to the national drained area probability map in denmark scenarios 1 and 4 had large fractions of subsurface drained areas out of the total surface catchment area whereas scenarios 2 and 3 had small fractions in total four swat models and four swat modflow models were set up for the study area a small agricultural catchment in denmark scenarios 2 and 3 lower tile drained areas showed better statistical performance with swat while scenarios 1 and 4 larger tile drained areas performed better using swat modflow however scenarios 2 and 3 underestimated the magnitude of streamflow particularly during high flow periods because of underestimating subsurface drainage flow to the stream moreover swat modflow showed overall better statistical and graphical performance than swat swat overestimated both peak flows and low flows because the model overestimated groundwater discharge to the stream the primary reason is that swat modflow is able to simulate groundwater flow across the surface catchment whereas swat simulates closed sub basins as an overall conclusion our results suggest that the spatial distribution of subsurface drainage systems in agricultural catchments is a key input step when modelling hydrology since it has appreciable effects on model performance and water balance simulation additionally the results showed that appropriate modelling of the hydrogeological processes is also important for model performance and water balance the proposed method of handling these elements by coupling a surface catchment model to a highly detailed groundwater flow model and delineating subsurface drained areas using geophysical data is promising the method can be adopted by other researchers and water administrations and might aid to

10014,current irrigation water quality guidelines for sodicity hazard in use since the 1980s are based on assessments of salinity electrical conductivity ec and sodicity sodium adsorption ratio sar where sar considers the positive effects of calcium ca and magnesium mg against the adverse effects of sodium na on soil permeability recent research and practice however have provided ample evidence for negative effects of both potassium k and mg on soil physical properties in addition to na this paper 1 discusses a proposed irrigation water quality parameter which generalizes sar by including the potassium adsorption ratio par along with two adjustable numerical coefficients for the k and mg concentrations to reflect their role as dispersive cations 2 discusses the tradeoffs from including k and the complex effects of mg in irrigation water quality assessment 3 analyzes water quality using the new parameter for 600 water samples from irrigated regions around the world and 4 proposes revised irrigation water quality guidelines for assessing soil permeability hazard a generalization of sodicity hazard revising current irrigation water quality guidelines in this way will help practitioners assess the suitability of a given water more accurately and will guide fit for purpose options and associated management strategies to ensure the sustainability of irrigated agriculture as the use of marginal quality waters increases to meet the challenge of freshwater scarcity keywords soil permeability irrigated agriculture marginal quality water sodium adsorption ratio potassium adsorption ratio cation ratio of structural stability 1 introduction salt concentration in an irrigation water affects crop growth and yield directly but the impact of salts on soil permeability is more complex soil permeability increases with increasing irrigation water salinity whereas it decreases with increasing irrigation water sodium na concentration u s salinity laboratory staff 1954 shainberg and letey 1984 ayers and westcot 1985 excessively high na concentration leads to soil sodicity enhancing the susceptibility to crusting runoff erosion and poor aeration as well as the deterioration of soil hydraulic properties such as infiltration rate and hydraulic conductivity sumner 1993 quirk 2001 levy 2012 these physical phenomena in turn have significant negative impacts on both soil health and crop yield the sodicity hazard posed by an irrigation water has been traditionally assessed by the sodium adsorption ratio sar which depends on the cation composition of the water u s salinity laboratory staff 1954 1 sar c na c ca c mg 2 0 5 where c represents the charge concentration in mmolc l of na calcium ca or magnesium mg eq 1 has been applied widely and with notable success in the arid and semi arid regions of the world levy 2012 a corresponding potassium adsorption ratio par also was defined by the salinity laboratory staff 1954 with the potassium k charge concentration replacing that of na in eq 1 but no irrigation water quality guidelines based on par were developed probably because na concentrations usually are much higher than those of k in irrigated soils and exchangeable k was deemed to have only a slight or no adverse effect upon the physical properties of soils u s salinity laboratory staff 1954 in both sar and par mg is considered to have positive effects on soil permeability equal to those of ca thereby justifying the grouping of the two bivalent cations together in the denominator of eq 1 however bresler et al 1982 noted that this customary grouping may not reflect the true status of mg the effect of which can be masked by the typical two to five fold greater concentration of ca over mg in irrigation waters eq 1 also does not consider the impact of precipitation or dissolution of calcite caco3 in irrigated soil this effect may be accounted for by replacing cca in eq 1 with the calculated charge concentration of ca in equilibrium with calcite under given conditions of carbon dioxide co2 partial pressure and bicarbonate hco3 concentration sposito 2016 making this replacement in eq 1 defines the adjusted sodium adsorption ratio adjrna suarez 1981 2012 ayers and westcot 1985 sposito 2016 research and practice in recent years have demonstrated that k and mg in addition to na can have adverse impacts on the permeability of irrigated soils rengasamy and marchuk 2011 arienzo et al 2012 laurenson et al 2012 smith et al 2015 buelow et al 2015 high concentrations of k and mg are typical of recycled municipal wastewaters that are now widely under consideration for reuse as irrigation water oster et al 2016 and there are emerging examples of surface water agricultural drainage water and groundwater in irrigated areas wherein k and mg have been associated with negative impacts on infiltration water quality and plant growth vyshpolsky et al 2008 smiles and smith 2004 qadir et al 2018 in the view of the authors this new evidence necessitates a reexamination of irrigation water quality guidelines as to the merit of generalizing sar to assess not only sodicity hazard but soil permeability hazard more broadly accordingly this study 1 discusses a proposed irrigation water quality parameter which generalizes sar by including the four cationic constituents na k ca and mg along with two adjustable numerical coefficients for k and mg to reflect their role as dispersive cations 2 discusses the tradeoffs from including k and the complex effects of mg in irrigation water quality assessment 3 analyzes water quality in light of the new parameter for 600 water samples representing arid and semi arid regions around the world and 4 proposes revised irrigation water quality guidelines for assessing soil permeability hazard 2 assessing soil permeability hazard 2 1 cation ratio of structural stability cross the four cations ca mg k and na occur commonly in irrigation water in soil solutions and on soil cation exchange sites with concentrations and relative distributions controlled by both natural and anthropogenic factors research undertaken in the 1950s reeve et al 1954 quirk and schofield 1955 and in later years aylmore and sills 1982 levy and van der watt 1990 rengasamy and sumner 1998 dontsova and norton 2002 zhang and norton 2002 vyshpolsky et al 2010 has reported negative impacts of not only na which are well known but also k and mg on the physical properties of soils in river basins around the world studies during the past decade have confirmed and further documented these negative impacts arienzo et al 2012 rengasamy and marchuk 2011 smith et al 2015 buelow et al 2015 sposito et al 2016 bennett et al 2016 qadir et al 2018 zhu et al 2019 liang et al 2021 which have been shown to depend on soil clay mineralogy as well as on the relative amounts of k and mg on soil exchange sites and in irrigation water as compared with na and ca respectively laurenson et al 2011 buelow et al 2015 bennett et al 2016 zhu et al 2019 liang et al 2021 within the concept of sar there is of course no recognition of k in promoting soil clay dispersion nor of the difference between ca and mg in promoting soil clay flocculation rengasamy and marchuk 2011 therefore proposed an alternative to sar that incorporates these two effects this new irrigation water quality parameter the cation ratio of structural stability cross assumes that the inverse of the critical flocculation concentration cfc for a cation saturated soil clay provides a quantitative measure of the flocculating power of the cation using cfc values for na k mg and ca saturated clays extracted from four soils they calculated the average relative flocculating power of a cation by dividing its average cfc value into the average cfc of na clay taken as a reference compared to the flocculating power of na taken as 1 the results for the average relative flocculating power of k mg and ca for the four investigated soils were 1 8 0 3 27 5 0 and 45 8 0 respectively cross is then developed by summing sar and par modified by introducing ratios of relative flocculating power as numerical coefficients of the k and mg concentrations the coefficient of the k concentration assumed to be a measure of its relative dispersing power the inverse of its flocculating power relative to na is set equal to 1 1 8 0 56 and the coefficient for the mg concentration a measure of its flocculating power relative to ca is accordingly set equal to 27 45 0 60 resulting in eq 2 2 cross c na 0 56 c k c ca 0 60 c mg 2 0 5 rengasamy and marchuk 2011 proposed that by including the dispersive effect of k in addition to that of na and differentiating the flocculating effect of mg from that of ca the use of cross should be more predictive than sar in assessing irrigation water quality for soil permeability hazard but as noted by jayawardane et al 2011 unlike sar and the degree of na adsorption oster and sposito 1980 sposito 2016 cross is not based on the exchange isotherm and cannot predict the degree of adsorption of na and k however it can potentially be used to predict the dispersive effects on soil stability and hydraulic properties depending on the relative amounts of the four cations present in the equilibrium soil solution the assumptions for the use of eq 2 are that the theoretically derived values of the relative flocculating power of cations accurately reflect their effects on soil stability and hydraulic properties jayawardane et al 2011 considering that the two numerical coefficients in cross are likely to be soil specific suggested generalizing its definition by replacing these coefficients with the variable parameters a and b representing the coefficients of k concentration and mg concentration respectively soil specific values of a and b have been calculated by zhu et al 2019 based on cfc values for clay fractions separated from 17 contrasting soils and chemically treated to produce na k mg and ca clays the soils investigated differed in clay mineralogy clay content ph and ec the mean cfc values mmolc l for the four homoionic soil clays were found to be na 28 38 k 15 24 mg 1 29 ca 0 85 however cfc values varied significantly among the soils particularly those for na clay which ranged from 5 66 to 98 1 mmolc l with a standard deviation of 26 9 mmolc l moreover the na k mg and ca saturated montmorillonite dominant soil clays appeared to require lower electrolyte concentrations to achieve flocculation than did the homoionic illite dominant soil clays the resulting average numerical coefficient for the mg concentration in cross was 0 677 ranging from 0 488 to 0 855 with a standard deviation of 0 097 this average value for the mg coefficient is consistent with the value 0 60 utilized by rengasamy and sumner 1998 zhu et al 2019 found that the numerical coefficient for the k concentration in cross was in the range of 0 309 0 777 with an average value of 0 605 and a standard deviation of 0 140 which is also consistent with the value in eq 2 smith et al 2015 have made the case that the a and b coefficients in cross should be evaluated based on electrolyte concentrations that cause soil clay dispersion not those that cause soil clay flocculation because clay dispersion is the process underlying soil permeability reduction levy 2012 they accordingly calculated a and b by adjusting their values to optimize a linear correlation between cross and a set of threshold electrolyte concentrations tec that resulted in a 15 reduction in the saturated hydraulic conductivity of a sodosol from the riverina region of australia arienzo et al 2012 as such a reduction in the saturated hydraulic conductivity is related to clay swelling and dispersion the electrolyte concentrations at which it would occur will be lower than the electrolyte concentrations required to cause soil clay flocculation quirk 2001 dang et al 2018 the resulting values for a and b were 0 335 0 038 and 0 0758 0 012 respectively which produced an r2 value of 0 95 for linear correlation between cross and tec by contrast an r2 value of only 0 64 was obtained when cross defined by eq 2 was linearly correlated with the tec data the optimized cross proposed by smith et al 2015 and designated as crossopt is thus 3 cross opt c na 0 335 c k c ca 0 0758 c mg 2 0 5 the coefficient of the k concentration in eq 3 indicates that the dispersing power of k is only about one third that of na however this value is consistent with the range of a values derived from cfc data reported by zhu et al 2019 in that 0 335 was not a statistical outlier when tested against those a values which ranged as low as 0 309 the optimized value of b in eq 3 on the other hand is not consistent with the range of b values reported by zhu et al 2019 which never fell below 0 488 the value of b determined by smith et al 2015 implies that the concentration of mg in irrigation water would need to be about 13 times larger than that of ca to have the same effect as ca in preventing clay swelling and dispersion in regard to clay flocculation the relative effect of mg when compared to that for ca is an order of magnitude smaller the average value of b determined by zhu et al 2019 implies that the mg concentration would need to be only 1 4 times larger than that for ca to cause flocculation thus eqs 2 and 3 offer different interpretations of the concept of cross in recognition of this difference cross defined by eq 2 will be henceforth designated crossf smith et al 2015 while cross with undesignated values of the coefficients a and b will be termed cross jayawardane et al 2011 2 2 reassessing the roles of potassium and magnesium 2 2 1 potassium despite the potential utility of cross in assessing soil permeability hazard recent experimental evidence suggests that exchangeable k in soils does not always reduce soil permeability and that the impact of k likely depends on soil clay mineralogy laurenson et al 2012 buelow et al 2015 smith et al 2015 in addition since cross is not related to cation exchange theory and therefore does not account for competition between k and na for exchange sites its indiscriminate use can lead to overestimating soil permeability hazard in situations where soils are irrigated with waters of high par and sar for example in soils irrigated with high k waters such as winery wastewaters k concentration 10 mmolc l the relationship between na concentration and exchangeable na is modified less adsorption of na on cation exchange sites and consequently lower sodicity hazard as compared to irrigation waters with comparable na concentrations but with little or no k laurenson et al 2012 liang et al 2021 although not related to the impacts on soil permeability irrigation of grapes with high k waters also has a negative impact on wine quality and thus the translocation of k in vines irrigated with winery wastewater investigating three vineyard soils of differing clay mineralogy from the napa and lodi regions of california buelow et al 2015 found that low par solutions had no negative effect on hydraulic conductivity while the effects of increasing par were different for each soil hydraulic conductivity was reduced in soils dominated by 2 1 clay mineralogy montmorillonite and vermiculite for all sar treatments sar 3 6 and 9 but vermiculite rich and kaolinite rich soils exhibited equal or greater reductions in hydraulic conductivity for the par treatments par 1 2 4 and 9 when compared with the sar treatments such interactions of na and k in soils with differing clay mineralogy led the authors to conclude that the reuse of winery wastewater with increasing par is least problematic for montmorillonite dominated soils and most detrimental to soils dominated by vermiculite other studies have demonstrated the dispersive effects of k in addition to na on soil structure and hydraulic conductivity assouline et al 2015 at low sar values 5 there is apparently little adverse effect whereas at higher sar values both na and k can cause a decrease in hydraulic conductivity with a reduction in the salinity of the applied water but the decrease with k is much less arienzo et al 2012 the long term use of irrigation water with elevated k concentrations is therefore expected in general to pose significant challenges to maintaining good soil structure and adequate infiltration rates smiles and smith 2004 laurenson et al 2011 buelow et al 2015 sposito et al 2016 liang et al 2021 examples of k rich waters include but are not limited to wastewater generated by dairies piggeries wineries and olive or tomato processing plants such high k concentrations result from the use of k based cleaning products and or shifting animal diets to k rich constituents which usually has been done intentionally to avoid or minimize the negative effect of otherwise na rich wastewater on soil permeability 2 2 2 magnesium deleterious effects on soil permeability attributable to high exchangeable mg have been documented over the past six decades sposito et al 2016 and attributed to specific effects of mg on soil physical properties although it has long been appreciated that mg is less efficient than ca in flocculating clays mcneal et al 1968 shainberg and letey 1984 it is also true that ca concentrations are usually much higher than mg concentrations in most agricultural soils and irrigation waters thus ca plays a dominant role maintaining soil structure and improving other physical properties of soils including salt affected soils smith et al 2015 oster et al 2016 if present at elevated levels on the other hand mg may cause deleterious effects on soil structure like those caused by na and this is particularly important under conditions in which irrigation waters have mg concentrations higher than ca concentrations vyshpolsky et al 2008 using four calcareous soils from arid and semiarid regions of iran abdollahpour et al 2020 found that the use of mg enriched irrigation water caused a gradual increase in mg concentration in the soil solution and an increase in the exchangeable magnesium percentage emp from 23 to 90 when the ca to mg ratio was decreased from 4 1 1 10 comparing the effects of mg and ca on three non calcareous soils exchangeable sodium percentage esp 5 20 alperovitch et al 1981 found that exchangeable mg resulted in structural degradation and greater reduction in soil hydraulic properties than ca in experiments conducted on two soils blount loam fine illitic mesic aeric epiaqualfs and catlin silt loam fine silty mixed mesic superactive oxyaquic argiudolls from the corn belt of the united states dontsova and norton 2002 reported that higher soil mg concentrations than ca concentrations resulted in increased surface sealing and triggered soil erosion during and after the rainfall events magnesium treated soils had half the long term infiltration rate as ca treated soils an important aspect of the effect of exchangeable mg on soil hydraulic properties which poses a soil and irrigation water management challenge is that this effect can be masked by the negative effect of exchangeable na mcneal et al 1968 yousaf et al 1987 sposito et al 2016 thus mg effects may remain hidden or unnoticed causing a gradual degradation of irrigated soils and a delay in implementing remedial soil and irrigation management strategies soil clay mineralogy plays an important role in showcasing the negative effects of mg on soil structure and permeability for example the negative effects of mg are more easily detectable in soils with clay mineralogy dominated by smectite and illite type clay minerals rahman and rowell 1979 smectite and mica curtin et al 1994 or interstratified montmorillonite and kaolinite sposito et al 2016 while assessing the impacts of exchangeable ca mg and na on the dispersive behavior of illites in water emerson and chi 1977 found that for a given degree of soil clay dispersion the emp value responsible was an order of magnitude larger than the corresponding esp value mcneal et al 1968 reported that the decrease in saturated hydraulic conductivity caused by emp was insignificant compared to esp at the same value rahman and rowell 1979 reported similar results for soils with clay mineralogy dominated by vermiculite illite and mixed illite montmorillonite clay minerals rengasamy et al 1986 also concluded that illitic soils are more sensitive to exchangeable mg than those soils in which smectite or kaolinite are dominant in the clay fraction 3 water quality data analysis and synthesis to obtain a sense of the comparative impact of the use of crossf or crossopt instead of sar to assess soil permeability hazard we analyzed water quality data for 600 samples originating from nearly 50 countries afghanistan algeria argentina australia bahrain bolivia botswana chad chile cyprus egypt el salvador ethiopia germany greece guyana haiti india indonesia iran iraq jamaica jordan kazakhstan libya madagascar malawi mauritius mexico nicaragua nigeria oman pakistan peru philippines qatar senegal south korea swaziland syria turkey turkmenistan uae usa uzbekistan yemen and zimbabwe these water quality data some of which have been reported in earlier publications ayers and westcot 1985 oster et al 2016 qadir et al 2018 represent a range of water resources including freshwater municipal wastewater agricultural drainage water and groundwater although some samples may be a mix of these waters mixing of different types of marginal quality water resources with freshwater is becoming an increasing practice as an approach to mitigate the adverse impacts of effluent irrigation on soil properties minhas et al 2019 assouline et al 2020 the water quality data for the 600 samples include electrical conductivity ec ds m and the charge concentrations of ca mg na and k mmolc l which in turn were used to calculate sar eq 1 crossf eq 2 and crossopt eq 3 following the approach recommended by oster et al 2016 soil permeability hazard was assessed with each of the three water quality parameters by incorporating it into the well known interpretive guidelines proposed by ayers and westcot 1985 the use of either crossf or crossopt in these guidelines replacing sar is expected to result in a more conservative assessment of soil permeability hazard oster et al 2016 although the ca concentration used in our calculations was from the water quality data it is straightforward to replace this concentration with that in equilibrium with calcite following the approach described in the introduction to calculate an adjusted cross which offers an even more conservative assessment of soil permeability hazard oster et al 2016 3 1 characteristics of the water samples there was a wide range of ec values in the data set varying from as low as 0 03 ds m to as high as 35 51 ds m with a median value of 2 72 ds m median values are used instead of mean values because the data set displayed a skewed distribution for which the median is a more accurate measure of central tendency than the mean the concentration of ca ranged from 0 10 to 42 58 mmolc l with a median value of 5 47 mmolc l magnesium concentrations in general were higher than those of ca and ranged from 0 10 to 107 67 mmolc l with a median value of 5 60 mmolc l sodium concentrations were the highest among all cations ranging from 0 04 mmolc l to 221 33 mmolc l with the median value being 12 69 mmolc l by contrast k concentrations were the lowest among all cations and even undetectable in a number of samples ranging from 0 00 to 4 86 mmolc l with a median value of 0 01 mmolc l the ordering of concentrations among the four cations is thus na 12 69 mmolc l mg 5 60 ca 5 47 k 0 01 it is evident from this comparison that k was essentially an unimportant constituent of the water samples the sar values calculated for the water samples ranged from 0 03 to 28 14 with a median value of 4 97 while the corresponding crossf values despite the negligibly low sample concentrations of k were somewhat higher than the sar values lying in the range 0 04 34 05 with a median value of 5 65 the percentage increase in crossf over sar ranged from 1 96 to 49 37 with that based on median values being 13 70 reflecting its smaller coefficient for the mg concentration crossopt was higher than both sar and crossf and ranged between 0 05 and 54 75 with a median value of 7 73 the percentage increase in cross opt over sar ranged from 4 56 to 261 45 with an increase of 47 34 based on median values the percentage increase in crossopt over crossf ranged from 0 05 to 165 09 with an increase of 29 59 based on median values the ordering crossopt crossf sar is as expected oster et al 2016 3 2 potential impacts on soil permeability based on the calculated values of sar crossf and crossopt along with the corresponding values of ec incorporated into the modified guidelines of ayers and westcot 1985 the quality of at least 390 water samples 65 of all water samples was judged suitable for irrigation without potential soil permeability hazard for these water samples ec varied from as low as 0 72 ds m to as high as 35 51 ds m with a median value of 4 37 ds m table 1 the concentration of ca in these samples was between 0 4 and 42 6 mmolc l with a median value of 9 1 mmolc l magnesium concentrations were higher and ranged between 0 1 and 107 7 mmolc l with a median value of 11 2 mmolc l sodium concentrations ranged between 0 2 mmolc l and 221 3 mmolc l the median value being 24 0 mmolc l the k concentrations were between 0 0 and 4 9 mmolc l with a median value of 0 0 mmolc l a strong indicator that k was not an important constituent of these samples the ordering of median cation concentrations in the 390 water samples was thus na 24 0 mmolc l mg 11 2 ca 9 1 with a median value of 7 8 the sar values ranged from 0 1 to 28 1 while the corresponding crossf values were in the range of 0 1 34 1 median value 8 8 the values of crossopt ranged between 0 2 and 54 8 median value 11 4 these median values are higher than the corresponding values for all 600 water samples suggesting that despite the higher sar crossf and crossopt sufficiently high concentrations of salts ec were present to prevent these waters from posing a potential soil permeability hazard according to the modified ayers westcot guidelines the remaining 210 water samples were deemed by the modified ayers westcot guidelines to fall into either slight to moderate or severe categories of soil permeability hazard the ec values of these water samples indicated they were non saline varying from 0 03 ds m to 3 97 ds m with a very low median value of 0 67 ds m the concentration of ca ranged between 0 1 and 5 0 mmolc l with a median value of 1 9 mmolc l magnesium concentrations were comparable to those of ca and ranged from 0 1 to 6 6 mmolc l with a median value of 1 6 mmolc l which is only one third of the median value of the mg concentration in all 600 samples 5 6 mmolc l sodium concentrations ranged between 0 04 mmolc l and 31 7 mmolc l the median value being 3 4 mmolc l which is about one fourth of the median value of na in all 600 samples 12 7 mmolc l the k concentrations ranged between 0 0 and 0 7 mmolc l with a median value of 0 1 mmolc l the ordering of cation concentrations in these water samples was thus na 3 4 mmolc l ca 1 9 mg 1 6 k 0 1 the sar values of the 210 water samples ranged from 0 03 to 22 5 median value 2 6 crossf values ranged between 0 04 and 27 9 median value 2 9 and crossopt ranged between 0 05 and 49 0 median value 3 6 by comparison the median values of sar crossf and cross opt in the 390 water samples suitable for unrestricted use were almost triple the corresponding median values of sar crossf and cross opt in the 210 problematic water samples these results suggest that the very low median values of sar crossf and crossopt in the 210 water samples were nonetheless sufficient to pose a potential soil permeability hazard because the ec median value 0 67 ds m was very low according to the modified ayers westcot guidelines among the 210 water samples there was no change in soil permeability hazard category for 154 samples 73 when either crossf or crossopt was used instead of sar while the remaining 56 210 154 56 water samples 27 moved to a higher category table 1 similar results were found by oster et al 2016 for california water samples these changes were driven by the mg concentration the median charge concentration of mg 2 9 mmolc l being higher than that of ca 2 7 mmolc l in the 56 water samples whereas the median charge concentration of mg 1 2 mmolc l was lower than that of ca 1 6 mmolc l in the 154 samples 4 irrigation water quality guidelines current irrigation water quality guidelines refer to infiltration problems related to unfavorable changes in soil permeability induced by the quality of irrigation water applied ayers and westcot 1985 these problems involve both salinity and sodicity hazard as assessed by sar of the applied water but they do not consider either the role of k as a dispersive cation similar to na or the possibility that mg does not impact soil hydraulic properties as positively as ca following the approach taken by oster et al 2016 for california we propose global irrigation water quality guidelines which generalize those proposed by ayers and westcot by replacing sar with cross fig 1 for whatever combination of a and b coefficients are used to calculate cross in a graphical representation we plot the centroid of the slight to moderate soil permeability hazard range for ec and sar ayers and westcot 1985 replacing sar with cross in a graph of ec vs cross with error bars representing the full slight to moderate ranges of the two variables see also table 1 in oster et al 2016 thus in fig 1 the region above the error bars indicates combinations of ec and cross for which it is safe to use a candidate irrigation water while the region below the error bars indicates combinations for which it is not safe these broad revised guidelines are intended to cover a wide range of water quality conditions encountered in irrigated agriculture the changes in the permeability of irrigated soils depend on a range of factors such as soil texture clay mineralogy soil depth presence of compacted layer s in the subsoil crop s to be grown depth and quality of groundwater methods and timing of irrigation provision of a drainage system and its efficiency rainfall pattern and ambient climatic conditions 5 conclusions the results of the present study indicate that replacing sar with cross in 91 of the 600 water samples investigated and 27 of the 210 water samples deemed to pose a permeability hazard did not make a difference in the assessment of that hazard however the results also indicate that the use of cross in place of sar is advisable for waters with ec 4 ds m and mg concentration ca concentration because doing so led to a more conservative assessment of soil permeability hazard these waters occur widely in irrigation schemes such as those in the aral sea basin in central asian countries the indus basin in pakistan the central plateau basin in iran the indo gangetic plains in india the cauca river valley in colombia and the murray darling basin in australia garcia ocampo 2003 vyshpolsky et al 2010 qadir et al 2018 in addition more wastewaters with high k concentrations such as those generated by dairies piggeries wineries and olive or tomato processing plants laurenson et al 2011 buelow et al 2015 liang et al 2021 are expected in years to come to be used for irrigation either directly or indirectly after mixing with freshwater resources assouline et al 2020 unlike sar the input data for the estimation of cross require that ca and mg as well as na and k be determined separately in irrigation water samples most district level water testing facilities in developing countries have determined only the combined ca and mg concentration in water samples by titration with ethylenediaminetetraacetate u s salinity laboratory staff 1954 although simple to adopt laboratory methods to determine ca and mg separately need specific steps taken by and support from relevant institutions in low income and low to middle income countries in addition standard equipment for the direct determination of na and k in most district level laboratories in developing countries is not available or not functional due to lack of maintenance and insufficient technical support because district and local level laboratories in developing countries work with growers to advise them on the suitability of an irrigation water based on its quality it is vital to ensure that water testing facilities are provided with resources to enable ca and mg as well as na and k concentrations to be determined separately finally districts may choose to optimize cross for a specific set of soils and water quality data smith et al 2015 zhu et al 2019 this kind of fine tuning will help guide fit for

10014,current irrigation water quality guidelines for sodicity hazard in use since the 1980s are based on assessments of salinity electrical conductivity ec and sodicity sodium adsorption ratio sar where sar considers the positive effects of calcium ca and magnesium mg against the adverse effects of sodium na on soil permeability recent research and practice however have provided ample evidence for negative effects of both potassium k and mg on soil physical properties in addition to na this paper 1 discusses a proposed irrigation water quality parameter which generalizes sar by including the potassium adsorption ratio par along with two adjustable numerical coefficients for the k and mg concentrations to reflect their role as dispersive cations 2 discusses the tradeoffs from including k and the complex effects of mg in irrigation water quality assessment 3 analyzes water quality using the new parameter for 600 water samples from irrigated regions around the world and 4 proposes revised irrigation water quality guidelines for assessing soil permeability hazard a generalization of sodicity hazard revising current irrigation water quality guidelines in this way will help practitioners assess the suitability of a given water more accurately and will guide fit for purpose options and associated management strategies to ensure the sustainability of irrigated agriculture as the use of marginal quality waters increases to meet the challenge of freshwater scarcity keywords soil permeability irrigated agriculture marginal quality water sodium adsorption ratio potassium adsorption ratio cation ratio of structural stability 1 introduction salt concentration in an irrigation water affects crop growth and yield directly but the impact of salts on soil permeability is more complex soil permeability increases with increasing irrigation water salinity whereas it decreases with increasing irrigation water sodium na concentration u s salinity laboratory staff 1954 shainberg and letey 1984 ayers and westcot 1985 excessively high na concentration leads to soil sodicity enhancing the susceptibility to crusting runoff erosion and poor aeration as well as the deterioration of soil hydraulic properties such as infiltration rate and hydraulic conductivity sumner 1993 quirk 2001 levy 2012 these physical phenomena in turn have significant negative impacts on both soil health and crop yield the sodicity hazard posed by an irrigation water has been traditionally assessed by the sodium adsorption ratio sar which depends on the cation composition of the water u s salinity laboratory staff 1954 1 sar c na c ca c mg 2 0 5 where c represents the charge concentration in mmolc l of na calcium ca or magnesium mg eq 1 has been applied widely and with notable success in the arid and semi arid regions of the world levy 2012 a corresponding potassium adsorption ratio par also was defined by the salinity laboratory staff 1954 with the potassium k charge concentration replacing that of na in eq 1 but no irrigation water quality guidelines based on par were developed probably because na concentrations usually are much higher than those of k in irrigated soils and exchangeable k was deemed to have only a slight or no adverse effect upon the physical properties of soils u s salinity laboratory staff 1954 in both sar and par mg is considered to have positive effects on soil permeability equal to those of ca thereby justifying the grouping of the two bivalent cations together in the denominator of eq 1 however bresler et al 1982 noted that this customary grouping may not reflect the true status of mg the effect of which can be masked by the typical two to five fold greater concentration of ca over mg in irrigation waters eq 1 also does not consider the impact of precipitation or dissolution of calcite caco3 in irrigated soil this effect may be accounted for by replacing cca in eq 1 with the calculated charge concentration of ca in equilibrium with calcite under given conditions of carbon dioxide co2 partial pressure and bicarbonate hco3 concentration sposito 2016 making this replacement in eq 1 defines the adjusted sodium adsorption ratio adjrna suarez 1981 2012 ayers and westcot 1985 sposito 2016 research and practice in recent years have demonstrated that k and mg in addition to na can have adverse impacts on the permeability of irrigated soils rengasamy and marchuk 2011 arienzo et al 2012 laurenson et al 2012 smith et al 2015 buelow et al 2015 high concentrations of k and mg are typical of recycled municipal wastewaters that are now widely under consideration for reuse as irrigation water oster et al 2016 and there are emerging examples of surface water agricultural drainage water and groundwater in irrigated areas wherein k and mg have been associated with negative impacts on infiltration water quality and plant growth vyshpolsky et al 2008 smiles and smith 2004 qadir et al 2018 in the view of the authors this new evidence necessitates a reexamination of irrigation water quality guidelines as to the merit of generalizing sar to assess not only sodicity hazard but soil permeability hazard more broadly accordingly this study 1 discusses a proposed irrigation water quality parameter which generalizes sar by including the four cationic constituents na k ca and mg along with two adjustable numerical coefficients for k and mg to reflect their role as dispersive cations 2 discusses the tradeoffs from including k and the complex effects of mg in irrigation water quality assessment 3 analyzes water quality in light of the new parameter for 600 water samples representing arid and semi arid regions around the world and 4 proposes revised irrigation water quality guidelines for assessing soil permeability hazard 2 assessing soil permeability hazard 2 1 cation ratio of structural stability cross the four cations ca mg k and na occur commonly in irrigation water in soil solutions and on soil cation exchange sites with concentrations and relative distributions controlled by both natural and anthropogenic factors research undertaken in the 1950s reeve et al 1954 quirk and schofield 1955 and in later years aylmore and sills 1982 levy and van der watt 1990 rengasamy and sumner 1998 dontsova and norton 2002 zhang and norton 2002 vyshpolsky et al 2010 has reported negative impacts of not only na which are well known but also k and mg on the physical properties of soils in river basins around the world studies during the past decade have confirmed and further documented these negative impacts arienzo et al 2012 rengasamy and marchuk 2011 smith et al 2015 buelow et al 2015 sposito et al 2016 bennett et al 2016 qadir et al 2018 zhu et al 2019 liang et al 2021 which have been shown to depend on soil clay mineralogy as well as on the relative amounts of k and mg on soil exchange sites and in irrigation water as compared with na and ca respectively laurenson et al 2011 buelow et al 2015 bennett et al 2016 zhu et al 2019 liang et al 2021 within the concept of sar there is of course no recognition of k in promoting soil clay dispersion nor of the difference between ca and mg in promoting soil clay flocculation rengasamy and marchuk 2011 therefore proposed an alternative to sar that incorporates these two effects this new irrigation water quality parameter the cation ratio of structural stability cross assumes that the inverse of the critical flocculation concentration cfc for a cation saturated soil clay provides a quantitative measure of the flocculating power of the cation using cfc values for na k mg and ca saturated clays extracted from four soils they calculated the average relative flocculating power of a cation by dividing its average cfc value into the average cfc of na clay taken as a reference compared to the flocculating power of na taken as 1 the results for the average relative flocculating power of k mg and ca for the four investigated soils were 1 8 0 3 27 5 0 and 45 8 0 respectively cross is then developed by summing sar and par modified by introducing ratios of relative flocculating power as numerical coefficients of the k and mg concentrations the coefficient of the k concentration assumed to be a measure of its relative dispersing power the inverse of its flocculating power relative to na is set equal to 1 1 8 0 56 and the coefficient for the mg concentration a measure of its flocculating power relative to ca is accordingly set equal to 27 45 0 60 resulting in eq 2 2 cross c na 0 56 c k c ca 0 60 c mg 2 0 5 rengasamy and marchuk 2011 proposed that by including the dispersive effect of k in addition to that of na and differentiating the flocculating effect of mg from that of ca the use of cross should be more predictive than sar in assessing irrigation water quality for soil permeability hazard but as noted by jayawardane et al 2011 unlike sar and the degree of na adsorption oster and sposito 1980 sposito 2016 cross is not based on the exchange isotherm and cannot predict the degree of adsorption of na and k however it can potentially be used to predict the dispersive effects on soil stability and hydraulic properties depending on the relative amounts of the four cations present in the equilibrium soil solution the assumptions for the use of eq 2 are that the theoretically derived values of the relative flocculating power of cations accurately reflect their effects on soil stability and hydraulic properties jayawardane et al 2011 considering that the two numerical coefficients in cross are likely to be soil specific suggested generalizing its definition by replacing these coefficients with the variable parameters a and b representing the coefficients of k concentration and mg concentration respectively soil specific values of a and b have been calculated by zhu et al 2019 based on cfc values for clay fractions separated from 17 contrasting soils and chemically treated to produce na k mg and ca clays the soils investigated differed in clay mineralogy clay content ph and ec the mean cfc values mmolc l for the four homoionic soil clays were found to be na 28 38 k 15 24 mg 1 29 ca 0 85 however cfc values varied significantly among the soils particularly those for na clay which ranged from 5 66 to 98 1 mmolc l with a standard deviation of 26 9 mmolc l moreover the na k mg and ca saturated montmorillonite dominant soil clays appeared to require lower electrolyte concentrations to achieve flocculation than did the homoionic illite dominant soil clays the resulting average numerical coefficient for the mg concentration in cross was 0 677 ranging from 0 488 to 0 855 with a standard deviation of 0 097 this average value for the mg coefficient is consistent with the value 0 60 utilized by rengasamy and sumner 1998 zhu et al 2019 found that the numerical coefficient for the k concentration in cross was in the range of 0 309 0 777 with an average value of 0 605 and a standard deviation of 0 140 which is also consistent with the value in eq 2 smith et al 2015 have made the case that the a and b coefficients in cross should be evaluated based on electrolyte concentrations that cause soil clay dispersion not those that cause soil clay flocculation because clay dispersion is the process underlying soil permeability reduction levy 2012 they accordingly calculated a and b by adjusting their values to optimize a linear correlation between cross and a set of threshold electrolyte concentrations tec that resulted in a 15 reduction in the saturated hydraulic conductivity of a sodosol from the riverina region of australia arienzo et al 2012 as such a reduction in the saturated hydraulic conductivity is related to clay swelling and dispersion the electrolyte concentrations at which it would occur will be lower than the electrolyte concentrations required to cause soil clay flocculation quirk 2001 dang et al 2018 the resulting values for a and b were 0 335 0 038 and 0 0758 0 012 respectively which produced an r2 value of 0 95 for linear correlation between cross and tec by contrast an r2 value of only 0 64 was obtained when cross defined by eq 2 was linearly correlated with the tec data the optimized cross proposed by smith et al 2015 and designated as crossopt is thus 3 cross opt c na 0 335 c k c ca 0 0758 c mg 2 0 5 the coefficient of the k concentration in eq 3 indicates that the dispersing power of k is only about one third that of na however this value is consistent with the range of a values derived from cfc data reported by zhu et al 2019 in that 0 335 was not a statistical outlier when tested against those a values which ranged as low as 0 309 the optimized value of b in eq 3 on the other hand is not consistent with the range of b values reported by zhu et al 2019 which never fell below 0 488 the value of b determined by smith et al 2015 implies that the concentration of mg in irrigation water would need to be about 13 times larger than that of ca to have the same effect as ca in preventing clay swelling and dispersion in regard to clay flocculation the relative effect of mg when compared to that for ca is an order of magnitude smaller the average value of b determined by zhu et al 2019 implies that the mg concentration would need to be only 1 4 times larger than that for ca to cause flocculation thus eqs 2 and 3 offer different interpretations of the concept of cross in recognition of this difference cross defined by eq 2 will be henceforth designated crossf smith et al 2015 while cross with undesignated values of the coefficients a and b will be termed cross jayawardane et al 2011 2 2 reassessing the roles of potassium and magnesium 2 2 1 potassium despite the potential utility of cross in assessing soil permeability hazard recent experimental evidence suggests that exchangeable k in soils does not always reduce soil permeability and that the impact of k likely depends on soil clay mineralogy laurenson et al 2012 buelow et al 2015 smith et al 2015 in addition since cross is not related to cation exchange theory and therefore does not account for competition between k and na for exchange sites its indiscriminate use can lead to overestimating soil permeability hazard in situations where soils are irrigated with waters of high par and sar for example in soils irrigated with high k waters such as winery wastewaters k concentration 10 mmolc l the relationship between na concentration and exchangeable na is modified less adsorption of na on cation exchange sites and consequently lower sodicity hazard as compared to irrigation waters with comparable na concentrations but with little or no k laurenson et al 2012 liang et al 2021 although not related to the impacts on soil permeability irrigation of grapes with high k waters also has a negative impact on wine quality and thus the translocation of k in vines irrigated with winery wastewater investigating three vineyard soils of differing clay mineralogy from the napa and lodi regions of california buelow et al 2015 found that low par solutions had no negative effect on hydraulic conductivity while the effects of increasing par were different for each soil hydraulic conductivity was reduced in soils dominated by 2 1 clay mineralogy montmorillonite and vermiculite for all sar treatments sar 3 6 and 9 but vermiculite rich and kaolinite rich soils exhibited equal or greater reductions in hydraulic conductivity for the par treatments par 1 2 4 and 9 when compared with the sar treatments such interactions of na and k in soils with differing clay mineralogy led the authors to conclude that the reuse of winery wastewater with increasing par is least problematic for montmorillonite dominated soils and most detrimental to soils dominated by vermiculite other studies have demonstrated the dispersive effects of k in addition to na on soil structure and hydraulic conductivity assouline et al 2015 at low sar values 5 there is apparently little adverse effect whereas at higher sar values both na and k can cause a decrease in hydraulic conductivity with a reduction in the salinity of the applied water but the decrease with k is much less arienzo et al 2012 the long term use of irrigation water with elevated k concentrations is therefore expected in general to pose significant challenges to maintaining good soil structure and adequate infiltration rates smiles and smith 2004 laurenson et al 2011 buelow et al 2015 sposito et al 2016 liang et al 2021 examples of k rich waters include but are not limited to wastewater generated by dairies piggeries wineries and olive or tomato processing plants such high k concentrations result from the use of k based cleaning products and or shifting animal diets to k rich constituents which usually has been done intentionally to avoid or minimize the negative effect of otherwise na rich wastewater on soil permeability 2 2 2 magnesium deleterious effects on soil permeability attributable to high exchangeable mg have been documented over the past six decades sposito et al 2016 and attributed to specific effects of mg on soil physical properties although it has long been appreciated that mg is less efficient than ca in flocculating clays mcneal et al 1968 shainberg and letey 1984 it is also true that ca concentrations are usually much higher than mg concentrations in most agricultural soils and irrigation waters thus ca plays a dominant role maintaining soil structure and improving other physical properties of soils including salt affected soils smith et al 2015 oster et al 2016 if present at elevated levels on the other hand mg may cause deleterious effects on soil structure like those caused by na and this is particularly important under conditions in which irrigation waters have mg concentrations higher than ca concentrations vyshpolsky et al 2008 using four calcareous soils from arid and semiarid regions of iran abdollahpour et al 2020 found that the use of mg enriched irrigation water caused a gradual increase in mg concentration in the soil solution and an increase in the exchangeable magnesium percentage emp from 23 to 90 when the ca to mg ratio was decreased from 4 1 1 10 comparing the effects of mg and ca on three non calcareous soils exchangeable sodium percentage esp 5 20 alperovitch et al 1981 found that exchangeable mg resulted in structural degradation and greater reduction in soil hydraulic properties than ca in experiments conducted on two soils blount loam fine illitic mesic aeric epiaqualfs and catlin silt loam fine silty mixed mesic superactive oxyaquic argiudolls from the corn belt of the united states dontsova and norton 2002 reported that higher soil mg concentrations than ca concentrations resulted in increased surface sealing and triggered soil erosion during and after the rainfall events magnesium treated soils had half the long term infiltration rate as ca treated soils an important aspect of the effect of exchangeable mg on soil hydraulic properties which poses a soil and irrigation water management challenge is that this effect can be masked by the negative effect of exchangeable na mcneal et al 1968 yousaf et al 1987 sposito et al 2016 thus mg effects may remain hidden or unnoticed causing a gradual degradation of irrigated soils and a delay in implementing remedial soil and irrigation management strategies soil clay mineralogy plays an important role in showcasing the negative effects of mg on soil structure and permeability for example the negative effects of mg are more easily detectable in soils with clay mineralogy dominated by smectite and illite type clay minerals rahman and rowell 1979 smectite and mica curtin et al 1994 or interstratified montmorillonite and kaolinite sposito et al 2016 while assessing the impacts of exchangeable ca mg and na on the dispersive behavior of illites in water emerson and chi 1977 found that for a given degree of soil clay dispersion the emp value responsible was an order of magnitude larger than the corresponding esp value mcneal et al 1968 reported that the decrease in saturated hydraulic conductivity caused by emp was insignificant compared to esp at the same value rahman and rowell 1979 reported similar results for soils with clay mineralogy dominated by vermiculite illite and mixed illite montmorillonite clay minerals rengasamy et al 1986 also concluded that illitic soils are more sensitive to exchangeable mg than those soils in which smectite or kaolinite are dominant in the clay fraction 3 water quality data analysis and synthesis to obtain a sense of the comparative impact of the use of crossf or crossopt instead of sar to assess soil permeability hazard we analyzed water quality data for 600 samples originating from nearly 50 countries afghanistan algeria argentina australia bahrain bolivia botswana chad chile cyprus egypt el salvador ethiopia germany greece guyana haiti india indonesia iran iraq jamaica jordan kazakhstan libya madagascar malawi mauritius mexico nicaragua nigeria oman pakistan peru philippines qatar senegal south korea swaziland syria turkey turkmenistan uae usa uzbekistan yemen and zimbabwe these water quality data some of which have been reported in earlier publications ayers and westcot 1985 oster et al 2016 qadir et al 2018 represent a range of water resources including freshwater municipal wastewater agricultural drainage water and groundwater although some samples may be a mix of these waters mixing of different types of marginal quality water resources with freshwater is becoming an increasing practice as an approach to mitigate the adverse impacts of effluent irrigation on soil properties minhas et al 2019 assouline et al 2020 the water quality data for the 600 samples include electrical conductivity ec ds m and the charge concentrations of ca mg na and k mmolc l which in turn were used to calculate sar eq 1 crossf eq 2 and crossopt eq 3 following the approach recommended by oster et al 2016 soil permeability hazard was assessed with each of the three water quality parameters by incorporating it into the well known interpretive guidelines proposed by ayers and westcot 1985 the use of either crossf or crossopt in these guidelines replacing sar is expected to result in a more conservative assessment of soil permeability hazard oster et al 2016 although the ca concentration used in our calculations was from the water quality data it is straightforward to replace this concentration with that in equilibrium with calcite following the approach described in the introduction to calculate an adjusted cross which offers an even more conservative assessment of soil permeability hazard oster et al 2016 3 1 characteristics of the water samples there was a wide range of ec values in the data set varying from as low as 0 03 ds m to as high as 35 51 ds m with a median value of 2 72 ds m median values are used instead of mean values because the data set displayed a skewed distribution for which the median is a more accurate measure of central tendency than the mean the concentration of ca ranged from 0 10 to 42 58 mmolc l with a median value of 5 47 mmolc l magnesium concentrations in general were higher than those of ca and ranged from 0 10 to 107 67 mmolc l with a median value of 5 60 mmolc l sodium concentrations were the highest among all cations ranging from 0 04 mmolc l to 221 33 mmolc l with the median value being 12 69 mmolc l by contrast k concentrations were the lowest among all cations and even undetectable in a number of samples ranging from 0 00 to 4 86 mmolc l with a median value of 0 01 mmolc l the ordering of concentrations among the four cations is thus na 12 69 mmolc l mg 5 60 ca 5 47 k 0 01 it is evident from this comparison that k was essentially an unimportant constituent of the water samples the sar values calculated for the water samples ranged from 0 03 to 28 14 with a median value of 4 97 while the corresponding crossf values despite the negligibly low sample concentrations of k were somewhat higher than the sar values lying in the range 0 04 34 05 with a median value of 5 65 the percentage increase in crossf over sar ranged from 1 96 to 49 37 with that based on median values being 13 70 reflecting its smaller coefficient for the mg concentration crossopt was higher than both sar and crossf and ranged between 0 05 and 54 75 with a median value of 7 73 the percentage increase in cross opt over sar ranged from 4 56 to 261 45 with an increase of 47 34 based on median values the percentage increase in crossopt over crossf ranged from 0 05 to 165 09 with an increase of 29 59 based on median values the ordering crossopt crossf sar is as expected oster et al 2016 3 2 potential impacts on soil permeability based on the calculated values of sar crossf and crossopt along with the corresponding values of ec incorporated into the modified guidelines of ayers and westcot 1985 the quality of at least 390 water samples 65 of all water samples was judged suitable for irrigation without potential soil permeability hazard for these water samples ec varied from as low as 0 72 ds m to as high as 35 51 ds m with a median value of 4 37 ds m table 1 the concentration of ca in these samples was between 0 4 and 42 6 mmolc l with a median value of 9 1 mmolc l magnesium concentrations were higher and ranged between 0 1 and 107 7 mmolc l with a median value of 11 2 mmolc l sodium concentrations ranged between 0 2 mmolc l and 221 3 mmolc l the median value being 24 0 mmolc l the k concentrations were between 0 0 and 4 9 mmolc l with a median value of 0 0 mmolc l a strong indicator that k was not an important constituent of these samples the ordering of median cation concentrations in the 390 water samples was thus na 24 0 mmolc l mg 11 2 ca 9 1 with a median value of 7 8 the sar values ranged from 0 1 to 28 1 while the corresponding crossf values were in the range of 0 1 34 1 median value 8 8 the values of crossopt ranged between 0 2 and 54 8 median value 11 4 these median values are higher than the corresponding values for all 600 water samples suggesting that despite the higher sar crossf and crossopt sufficiently high concentrations of salts ec were present to prevent these waters from posing a potential soil permeability hazard according to the modified ayers westcot guidelines the remaining 210 water samples were deemed by the modified ayers westcot guidelines to fall into either slight to moderate or severe categories of soil permeability hazard the ec values of these water samples indicated they were non saline varying from 0 03 ds m to 3 97 ds m with a very low median value of 0 67 ds m the concentration of ca ranged between 0 1 and 5 0 mmolc l with a median value of 1 9 mmolc l magnesium concentrations were comparable to those of ca and ranged from 0 1 to 6 6 mmolc l with a median value of 1 6 mmolc l which is only one third of the median value of the mg concentration in all 600 samples 5 6 mmolc l sodium concentrations ranged between 0 04 mmolc l and 31 7 mmolc l the median value being 3 4 mmolc l which is about one fourth of the median value of na in all 600 samples 12 7 mmolc l the k concentrations ranged between 0 0 and 0 7 mmolc l with a median value of 0 1 mmolc l the ordering of cation concentrations in these water samples was thus na 3 4 mmolc l ca 1 9 mg 1 6 k 0 1 the sar values of the 210 water samples ranged from 0 03 to 22 5 median value 2 6 crossf values ranged between 0 04 and 27 9 median value 2 9 and crossopt ranged between 0 05 and 49 0 median value 3 6 by comparison the median values of sar crossf and cross opt in the 390 water samples suitable for unrestricted use were almost triple the corresponding median values of sar crossf and cross opt in the 210 problematic water samples these results suggest that the very low median values of sar crossf and crossopt in the 210 water samples were nonetheless sufficient to pose a potential soil permeability hazard because the ec median value 0 67 ds m was very low according to the modified ayers westcot guidelines among the 210 water samples there was no change in soil permeability hazard category for 154 samples 73 when either crossf or crossopt was used instead of sar while the remaining 56 210 154 56 water samples 27 moved to a higher category table 1 similar results were found by oster et al 2016 for california water samples these changes were driven by the mg concentration the median charge concentration of mg 2 9 mmolc l being higher than that of ca 2 7 mmolc l in the 56 water samples whereas the median charge concentration of mg 1 2 mmolc l was lower than that of ca 1 6 mmolc l in the 154 samples 4 irrigation water quality guidelines current irrigation water quality guidelines refer to infiltration problems related to unfavorable changes in soil permeability induced by the quality of irrigation water applied ayers and westcot 1985 these problems involve both salinity and sodicity hazard as assessed by sar of the applied water but they do not consider either the role of k as a dispersive cation similar to na or the possibility that mg does not impact soil hydraulic properties as positively as ca following the approach taken by oster et al 2016 for california we propose global irrigation water quality guidelines which generalize those proposed by ayers and westcot by replacing sar with cross fig 1 for whatever combination of a and b coefficients are used to calculate cross in a graphical representation we plot the centroid of the slight to moderate soil permeability hazard range for ec and sar ayers and westcot 1985 replacing sar with cross in a graph of ec vs cross with error bars representing the full slight to moderate ranges of the two variables see also table 1 in oster et al 2016 thus in fig 1 the region above the error bars indicates combinations of ec and cross for which it is safe to use a candidate irrigation water while the region below the error bars indicates combinations for which it is not safe these broad revised guidelines are intended to cover a wide range of water quality conditions encountered in irrigated agriculture the changes in the permeability of irrigated soils depend on a range of factors such as soil texture clay mineralogy soil depth presence of compacted layer s in the subsoil crop s to be grown depth and quality of groundwater methods and timing of irrigation provision of a drainage system and its efficiency rainfall pattern and ambient climatic conditions 5 conclusions the results of the present study indicate that replacing sar with cross in 91 of the 600 water samples investigated and 27 of the 210 water samples deemed to pose a permeability hazard did not make a difference in the assessment of that hazard however the results also indicate that the use of cross in place of sar is advisable for waters with ec 4 ds m and mg concentration ca concentration because doing so led to a more conservative assessment of soil permeability hazard these waters occur widely in irrigation schemes such as those in the aral sea basin in central asian countries the indus basin in pakistan the central plateau basin in iran the indo gangetic plains in india the cauca river valley in colombia and the murray darling basin in australia garcia ocampo 2003 vyshpolsky et al 2010 qadir et al 2018 in addition more wastewaters with high k concentrations such as those generated by dairies piggeries wineries and olive or tomato processing plants laurenson et al 2011 buelow et al 2015 liang et al 2021 are expected in years to come to be used for irrigation either directly or indirectly after mixing with freshwater resources assouline et al 2020 unlike sar the input data for the estimation of cross require that ca and mg as well as na and k be determined separately in irrigation water samples most district level water testing facilities in developing countries have determined only the combined ca and mg concentration in water samples by titration with ethylenediaminetetraacetate u s salinity laboratory staff 1954 although simple to adopt laboratory methods to determine ca and mg separately need specific steps taken by and support from relevant institutions in low income and low to middle income countries in addition standard equipment for the direct determination of na and k in most district level laboratories in developing countries is not available or not functional due to lack of maintenance and insufficient technical support because district and local level laboratories in developing countries work with growers to advise them on the suitability of an irrigation water based on its quality it is vital to ensure that water testing facilities are provided with resources to enable ca and mg as well as na and k concentrations to be determined separately finally districts may choose to optimize cross for a specific set of soils and water quality data smith et al 2015 zhu et al 2019 this kind of fine tuning will help guide fit for
