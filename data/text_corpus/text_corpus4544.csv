22720,the submerged horizontal plate shp has been extensively studied as an open type breakwater and some research explored its potential as a wave energy converter however these two functionalities were seldom combined in the literature in this study a 2d numerical model solving the wave shp interaction was built by using the weakly compressible smoothed particle hydrodynamics wcsph method the thin walled boundary condition was verified through a dam break impact case the accuracy of wave profile and flow velocity calculations was validated by comparing with available experiments of solitary and regular waves interactions with shps comparison of the wave dynamic and flow dynamic between shp and submerged step were made which showed the advantages and disadvantages of the shp then a parametric study of regular waves fixed shp interaction was conducted empirical formulas for the wave transmission coefficient and energy conversion efficiency were obtained by regressing numerical results using the levenberg marquardt algorithm finally a mathematical programming problem concerning the combined functionalities of shp was established using the complex method the optimal length and submergence of shp regarding different emphases taken on the regular wave attenuation and energy utilization were solved the results preliminarily demonstrated the potential application of shp as a wave energy breakwater and provided reference on its parameter design although this work was carried out in 2d and ignored the effects of energy convertor and piles on wave and flow patterns keywords breakwater wave energy converter submerged horizontal plate smoothed particle hydrodynamics 1 introduction the so called wave energy breakwater web refers to a kind of marine structure that can simultaneously attenuate wave and generate electricity during the last decades various types of webs have been designed such as the integration of oscillating water column technique into bottom mounted or floating breakwaters he et al 2013 crespo et al 2017 mendonça et al 2018 the incorporation of overtopping wave energy converter wec device into a rubble mound breakwater vicinanza et al 2014 the combination of power take off device and a flexible floating breakwater michailides and angelides 2012 here another potential web will be discussed namely the submerged horizontal plate shp the pile supported shp has long been familiar to the coastal and ocean engineering communities as a cost effective and environmentally friendly breakwater yu 2002 in recent years some studies also explored its potential application as a wec hayatdavoodi et al 2017a or investigated its functionality of altering flow pattern so as to create favorable condition for other energy converters orer and ozdamar 2007 although the shp attenuates wave and meanwhile assists energy acquisition little effort has been paid on combining these two functionalities this work makes a preliminary attempt to compensate for the drawback it is hoped that by doing so the overall value of shp can be increased and consequently accelerating its engineering application research on the wave attenuation functionality of shp can be traced back to the work of heins 1950 by means of the wiener hopf technique explicit solution of the transmission coefficient c t of a semi infinite shp in finite water depth was obtained later the boundary value problem was extended to infinite water depth by greene and heins 1953 and to a finite plate by burke 1964 based on the long wave assumption siew and hurley 1977 derived the first explicit formula for c t by using the matched asymptotic expansions mae technique the mae technique was also applied by patarapanich 1984 to analyze the variation of reflection coefficient c r versus the length of the plate as a more versatile analytical solution the eigen function expansion method was widely employed to evaluate the wave scattering by various kinds of plate such as elastic plate mohapatra and sahoo 2014 porous plate liu and li 2011 multi layer plate wang and shen 1999 and their combinations fang et al 2017 recently hayatdavoodi et al 2017b used the shallow water green naghdi equations to characterize the nonlinear wave scattering by a plate besides analytical solutions lalli et al 2012 conducted boundary element method bem calculations to investigate the effects of thickness length and submergence of shp on c t lin et al 2014 applied the time domain higher order bem method to evaluate the current effects on fundamental and high order transmitted waves using the de singularized boundary integral equation method liu et al 2009 and liu et al 2017 studied the energy transfer from the fundamental mode towards higher order transmitted waves above fixed and heaving plates respectively it was also found that the down streamed radiated wave induced by the heave response of plate is likely to neutralize the transmitted wave yu and chwang 1994 analyzed the porosity effect on c t by introducing the darcy s law into a finite element model jin et al 2014 examined the effect of plate thickness on c t by solving the reynolds averaged navier stokes equations using the openfoam using the smoothed particle hydrodynamics sph method he et al 2018b and he et al 2018c investigated the variation of c t due to sea level change and heave motion of the plate respectively existing wecs can be classified into two broad categories one set first converts wave energy into heave shadman et al 2018 or pitch motions yemm et al 2012 of structures then the motions drive power take off systems to produce electric power waters et al 2007 the other set alters wave energy distribution by careful design of the structure geometry yielding pressure difference of air falcão and henriques 2016 or fluid kofoed et al 2006 air or hydraulic turbines are accordingly used for electricity generation within both categories a piled supported shp can be regarded as a potential wec shp is subjected to large vertical wave force so it heaves dramatically without vertical restraint by connecting with a linear electrical generator kinetic energy of the heave motion will be directly converted into electrical energy hayatdavoodi et al 2017a as for a fixed shp as depicted in fig 1 the unequal water surface elevations above the two ends of the plate produce hydrodynamic pressure difference across and beneath the plate hence the fluid mass beneath the plate moves horizontally supposing an energy convertor like hydraulic turbine is placed beneath the plate the flow kinetic energy can be converted into electrical energy the shp type wec mentioned hereinafter refers to the latter category perhaps dick 1968 conducted the earliest investigation on the flow pattern beneath the shp nested tubes with different internal diameters were placed beneath the plate to model permeable breakwater of various porosities although the fluid motion was restricted by the tubes his experiment still reflected the general tendency of fluid mass transport without tubes graw et al 1989 and graw 1992 investigated the flow characteristics around the plate using the laser beam deflection method and ultrasonic 3d probe technique respectively oscillatory and time averaged reversed flow characters were observed carter et al 2006 compared the wave shp interactions based on the potential and viscous flow theories respectively the result indicated that the pulsating flow was the product of the hydrodynamic pressure difference beneath the ends of the plate and from the root was controlled by the relative phasing of surface waves moreover they found that the amplitude of the mean reverse flow was dominated by the wave nonlinearity carmigniani et al 2019 evaluated the wave mass transport above the plate and demonstrated its relationship with the reverse flow phenomenon beneath the plate inspired by this pulsating flow graw 1993 suggested installing water turbines beneath the shp to convert kinetic energy to electric power orer and ozdamar 2007 experimentally found that the maximum energy conversion efficiency η the ratio of the power of water flow beneath the plate to the wave energy flux was only 5 then they enhanced the pulsating flow by placing structures of different shapes and sizes below the plate and to the greatest extent η reached up to 60 with a triangular obstruction on the sea bottom kharati koopaee and kiali kooshkghazi 2019 assessed the effects of opening area and plate length on the flow magnitude beneath the plate however hybrid structure consisting of upper shp and lower obstruction is more like a submerged step rather than a plate and thus beyond the scope of the present study seibt et al 2014 calculated the flow power by incorporating the kinetic energy of fluid flow and the potential energy of hydrostatic pressure as a result η was significantly increased from less than 5 to 64 without help from additional structures electric machine produces power through the relative movement between rotor and stator but the hydrostatic pressure may not be possible to drive this relative movement from all points a single shp is not really an efficient wec it should be principally valued as a breakwater and energy utilization functionality is combined to promote its additional value in this way the shp could be more competitive than other single functional breakwaters or wecs a literature survey indicates that existing research seldom combined these two functionalities and thus unable to maximize the value of shp in addition only scattered data on c t and η can be found in the literature a systematic study and relevant empirical formulas for engineering application are still lacking the two shortcomings constitute the focus of this study this study first makes effort to develop empirical formulas for c t and η to achieve this goal abundant data covering wide ranges of wave conditions and plate parameters are necessary it is possible to gather some data from the literature however subjected to their quantities or the linear or inviscid assumptions taken in those studies new calculations covering wider ranges of ratios of wave height to water depth h d plate length to wavelength l λ and plate submergence to water depth d p d need to be carried out by exploring the laws of the calculated results the forms of the empirical formulas can be determined then the levenberg marquardt algorithm moré 1978 is used to optimize the unknown coefficients secondly efforts are also oriented towards optimizing the configuration of shp to obtain the best comprehensive performance in terms of the wave attenuation and wave energy utilization for this purpose a mathematical programming problem is built taking the comprehensive performance of the shp as the objective function and taking h d l λ and d p d as the constraint conditions the complex method is used to solve the problem the wave shp interaction simulations are performed based on the open source code dualsphysics v4 0 https dual sphysics org which has been developing within the framework of the sph method by researchers of universidade de vigo spain the university of manchester u k ephytech sl spain science technology facilities council u k instituto superior técnico portugal università degli studi di parma italy and universiteit gent flanders hydraulics research belgium it is both convenient and efficient to perform 3d simulations using the dualsphysics but the present wave shp simulations are made in the 2d space due to three reasons first to be a good shield for inshore water the shp type breakwater is generally constructed up to several kilometers yet its length paralleled to the wave ray direction is only tens of meters such a high dimension ratio completely fulfils the requirement of 2d simplification second the multidirectional deep water wave tends to shore normal due to the wave refraction over shallowing bathymetry consequently the shp is commonly subjected to normal wave action third numerous cases are simulated in this work to obtain empirical formulas as accurate as possible although 3d simulations are more rigorous due to the possible consideration of hydraulic turbine and mooring piles it would not be very cost effective on balance of accuracy improvement and computational consumption the sph method is a lagrangian mesh free numerical discretization technique which was first invented to solve astrophysical problems gingold and monaghan 1977 and later introduced into elastic dynamics gray et al 2001 hydrodynamics monaghan and kos 1999 explosion calculations ming et al 2016 and many other fields for free surface flow problems it can be further categorized into weakly compressible and incompressible modes the weakly compressible sph wcsph solves the governing equations of the fluid explicitly by introducing an equation of state eos teams from universidade de vigo spain cnr insean italy école centrale de nantes france etc are committed to its cutting edge development in the context of incompressible sph isph the particle pressure is implicitly calculated by solving the pressure poisson equation based on projection method chorin 1968 hence the isph is also called projection based sph teams from kyoto university japan the university of manchester u k etc contribute most to its development for the latest achievements of isph the reader is referred to the review work of gotoh and khayyer 2016 generally the sph method has several advantages over mesh based numerical methods frist the free surface can be easily captured due the its lagrangian nature thus it is good at handling highly nonlinear fluid motion and the fragmentation and coalescence of free surface second there is no topological connection among neighboring particles so it gets rid of mesh distortion that may occur in the cases of rapidly moving or rotating solid boundaries third since each particle carries material properties no special variables are needed to detect the multi phase interfaces because of the above advantages there was growing interest in applying the sph method for coastal and ocean engineering research gotoh and khayyer 2018 examples include simulations concerning violent sloshing delorme et al 2009 gotoh et al 2014 oil spilling shi et al 2018a 2018b wave breaking dalrymple and rogers 2006 khayyer et al 2008 porous flow gui et al 2015 khayyer et al 2018b wave impact gomez gesteira and dalrymple 2004 altomare et al 2015 fluid structure interaction khayyer et al 2018a ming et al 2018 zheng et al 2018 using the sph method to study the wave shp interaction is decided by the physical problem itself there is a sudden drop in water depth when a wave train propagates onto the plate the shoaling effect increases the wave nonlinearity and even leads to wave breaking furthermore the plate switches status between submerged and exposed under the alternate action of wave crest and trough and meanwhile vortices are generated at both ends of the plate the viscous fluid motion with complex free surface is what the sph method most excels there are already some sph studies on the wave plate interaction cherfils et al 2008 simulated the regular wave reflection by a shp the plate was modelled using the ghost particles and a modified neighbor search algorithm was introduced to avoid undesired interactions between ghost particles and fluid particles dong et al 2016 compared the solitary wave loads on a thick shp over flat and sloping bottoms the plate was implemented using a stack of dynamic boundary particles dbps carmigniani et al 2019 discussed the origin of the reverse flow beneath shp by evaluating the wave mass transport above the plate in their simulation the so called unified semi analytical wall boundary condition was applied because water level fluctuates with the tide so shp sometimes emerges and becomes a horizontal deck gómez gesteira et al 2005 and shao et al 2006 reproduced cox and scott 2001 s experiment of green wave overtopping using the wcsph and isph methods respectively without matching the thickness of the physical deck intentionally their numerical decks were constructed of two or one lines of wall particles combining the corrected smoothed particle method and riemann solution gao et al 2012 studied the wave slamming on a rigid platform the fluid motion near the platform was interfered artificially to prevent fluid particles penetration by reviewing the above wave plate interaction it is found that the difficultly of simulating the wave shp interaction lies in the approach to implement the thin plate unlike the conventional mesh based methods that have the constant mesh topology an sph particle can interact with any other particles within its spherical supporting domain if the plate is very thin the fluid of a given side of the thin wall structure will unphysically interact with the fluid of the opposite side to overcome this drawback meringolo et al 2015 ren et al 2018 and he et al 2018b proposed the multi node fixed ghost particles multi layer dbps and color domain particle methods respectively among them the multi layer dbps method is adopted herein because it is developed based on the dynamic boundary condition dbc that is used as the solid boundary condition in this work the rest of the paper is organized as follows section 2 briefly introduces the sph model the model is then verified and validated in section 3 section 4 compares the hydrodynamics of the shp and submerged step from which the advantages and disadvantages of shp are analyzed section 5 derives empirical formulas for the wave transmission coefficient and energy conversion efficiency of shp by regressing the calculation results covering wide ranges of regular wave and plate parameters section 6 combines functionalities of wave attenuation and energy utilization of shp and discusses the optimal configuration of shp conclusions are finally drawn in section 7 together with our opinions upon the future work 2 sph model 2 1 equations of fluid motion the motion of the fluid is governed by the continuity equation and the navier stokes n s equations which have the differential forms of 1 d ρ d t ρ u 2 d u d t 1 ρ p g υ 0 2 u 1 ρ τ where t is the time ρ it the density p is the pressure u is the velocity g is the gravitational acceleration υ 0 is the laminar kinematic viscosity and τ is the turbulent stress tensor following the sph notation of crespo et al 2015 eqs 1 and 2 are discreted as 3 d ρ i d t j m j u i j i w i j 4 d u i d t j m j p i ρ i 2 p j ρ j 2 i w i j g j m j 4 υ 0 r i j i w i j ρ i ρ j δ r i j 2 η 2 u i j j m j τ i j ρ i 2 τ j i ρ j 2 i w i j here subscripts i and j denote the target and neighboring particles respectively m is the mass r is the position and δr ij is the distance between particles i and j r ij r i r j and likewise u ij u i u j η 0 01h 2 h 1 5δp is the smoothing length with δp being the initial particle pacing τ is approximated using the sub particle scale sps turbulence model of lo and shao 2002 it is known that the large eddy simulation les technique is not recommended in 2d turbulence simulation mainly because it generates bucket shape vortex that differs from the reality however although derived from the les technique the 2d sps turbulence model has been widely accepted ever since it was introduced into the particle method community plenty of applications of the sps method on 2d turbulence simulations have been made such as shao and gotoh 2005 and dalrymple and rogers 2006 w ij w r ij h is the kernel function and the wendland 1995 type is chosen 5 w i j 7 4 π h 2 1 δ r i j 2 h 4 2 δ r i j h 1 0 δ r i j 2 h the fluid in this work is assumed to be weakly compressible thus the tait s eos monaghan 1994 relating the pressure and density is supplemented to close eqs 3 and 4 6 p i ρ 0 c 0 2 γ ρ i ρ 0 γ 1 where γ 7 is a constant ρ 0 1000 kg m3 is the reference density c 0 ξ gd 1 2 is the numerical speed of sound with coefficient ξ commonly ranging from 10 to 40 and d being the water depth of computational domain as will be shown in subsection 3 2 ξ 10 is an proper choice in terms of the wave shp interaction simulation the lagrangian particles are moved according to 7 d r i d t u i the well known xsph variant monaghan 1989 is not applied herein because the wendland 1995 kernel already improves the orderliness of particle flow dehnen and aly 2012 yan and monaghan 2017 an additional use of the xsph variant makes little difference but introduces extra numerical diffusion that is undesirable gómez gesteira et al 2012 the wcsph method is characterized with high frequency pressure noise therefore a series of excellent algorithms have been proposed for example the density filter colagrossi and landrini 2003 the riemann solver vila 1999 inutsuka 2002 and the δ sph or δ sph method antuono et al 2012 sun et al 2018 among them the shepard filter is adopted in this work particle densities are reassigned according to the following equation every 30 time steps 8 ρ i n e w j m j w i j j m j ρ j w i j being an earlier de nosing method the shepard filter is inferior to the δ sph method regarding the conservation of mass and stability of pressure field nonetheless the calculated physical quantities with the shepard filter are as accurate as those obtained using the δ sph method in the simulation of wave shp interaction moreover the shepard filter is more efficient since it is performed every 20 40 times steps as for the δ sph method a renormalization density gradient has to be executed at every time step leading to considerable computational cost 2 2 time stepping the 2nd order predictor corrector integration scheme monaghan 1989 is used to integrate eqs 3 4 and 7 during the first stage field variables ϕ ρ u and r of every particle are predicted according to 9 ϕ i n 1 2 ϕ i n δ t 2 d ϕ i n d t where superscript n denotes the sequence number of time step n 1 2 denotes the half step δt is the time step increment then during the second stage the predicted variables are corrected by 10 ϕ i n 1 2 ϕ i n δ t 2 d ϕ i n 1 2 d t finally ϕ is recalculated by 11 ϕ i n 1 2 ϕ i n 1 2 ϕ i n a variable time step is taken to ensure the stability of the numerical calculation first the cfl condition must be satisfied as most explicit numerical methods in the wcsph framework h and c i c 0 ρ i ρ 0 3 is the speed of sound at the particle position are chosen as the interval length and perturbation velocity respectively second the travel distance of any lagrangian particle in one time step should less than h 4 third the viscous condition usually used in the finite difference method is brought in morris et al 1997 mathematically the time step criterion reads 12 δ t min 0 25 h max i c i 0 25 h max i d u i d t 0 125 h 2 ν 0 2 3 ordinary solid boundary condition the word ordinary refers to a class of solid boundaries that only contact with the fluid at one side in this work it is implemented using the dbc which is originally proposed by dalrymple and knio 2001 and mathematically interpreted by crespo et al 2007 in simple terms two lines of dbps are fixed on the frame of solid structure they share the same equations of continuity and state as fluid particles but their positions and velocities keep unchanged referring to those dbps constituting the water tank or are externally imposed referring to those dbps constituting the wavemaker the major disadvantage of dbc lies in the abnormal density gradient near the solid boundary to minimize this negative effect gómez gesteira et al 2005 buffered the calculated dbps densities using the reference density ρ 0 abandoning the values from eq 3 ni et al 2014 recalculated the dbps densities every time step following the shepard filter approach an artificial boundary layer was also set in their work to prevent unphysical penetration of fluid particles gong et al 2016 divided rectangular regions along the solid boundary and assigned the averaged pressure of inner fluid particles to the dbps retaining a small proportion of dbps densities calculated by eq 3 ren et al 2015 brought in the average densities of fluid particles within the kernel support of dbps to lower the density gradient near the solid boundary the mathematic expression is 13 ρ i χ ρ i 1 χ ρ j here ρ i and ρ i are dbp densities before and after correction χ is a weight coefficient in a range between 0 and 1 it needs to be tuned regarding the problem to be concerned and in the present calculations χ 0 2 is adopted ρ j is the average density of a total of n fluid particles within the support domain of dbps 14 ρ j 1 n j 1 n ρ j ρ j r i j the correction term ρ j r i j in eq 14 has the functionality of compensating the effects of truncated compact support our previous numerical studies li et al 2017 ren et al 2017 gao et al 2018 all confirmed that ren et al 2015 s modification can effectively smooth out the pressure fluctuation near the solid boundary as well as prevent the fluid particle penetration we therefore continue to use this modification in the present study 2 4 thin walled boundary condition for structures surrounded by the fluid dbps are arranged along the framework as illustrated in fig 2 a when simulating thin walled structures upper and lower dbps should be as close as possible however a critical separation equaling δp depending on the value of h needs to be preserved as shown in fig 2 b otherwise donor fluid particles of a given side of the thin walled structure will spuriously influence the acceptor fluid particles of the opposite side via the densities variations of the medium dbps therefore the minimum thickness of a structure implementing using ordinary dbps is 4δp to further decrease the thickness and meanwhile to block the unphysical inter particle interaction he et al 2018b proposed the multi layer dbps method as shown in fig 3 the thin walled structure consists of three layers of dbps and its surrounding fluid domain is divided into four regions in fig 3 a dbps symbolized as triangles only interact with fluid particles symbolized as small circles with the same colors in this way near boundary fluid particles will not be excessively repelled by dbps overlapped at the same position on the other hand fluid particle interactions occur within the truncated support domains symbolized as translucent big circles the fluid fluid interaction from the two lateral sides of thin wall is forbidden fig 3 b gives a different angle of view dbps in layers i and ii only interact with fluid particles in regions i and ii respectively dbps in layer iii only interact with fluid particles in regions iii and iv interactions between fluid particles in region i and ii are forbidden and all the rest is permitted it is obvious that using the multi layer dbps method the thin walled structure to be described is 2δp thick it means that two times larger δp can be adopted to implement a thickness specified thin wall than applying the implementation shown in fig 2 b consequently 75 particles are saved it is worth noting that the thin wall boundary condition is oriented to 2d problems it needs to be further developed before applying to 3d thin walled structures like the blades of turbine partly due to this limitation the energy converter beneath the shp is ignored in the present simulations 3 verification and validation 3 1 verification of multi layer dbps method a dam break impact problem was simulated to check the performance of the multi layer dbps method moreover the importance of ren et al 2015 s modification on the dbc and the applicability of the shepard filter in this study were checked the geometry the problem is given in fig 4 a water column of length 0 5 m and height 1 0 m was initially static on the left hand side lhs of a rectangular tank on the right hand side rhs of the tank there was another water column of length 0 1 m and height 0 25 m it was shielded from the dam break flow by a thin wall the particle spacing δp adopted was 0 005 m three computational settings were considered a using ren et al 2015 s modification on dbc and employing the multi layer dbps method to implement the thin wall b using the multi layer dbps method but the conventional dbc c using the modified dbc but one layer two lines of dbps because the thin wall only contacts with the fluid from its lhs and rhs only two layers of dbps are needed excluding those red triangles in fig 3 a or those terminal dbps in layer iii of fig 3 b fig 5 shows the particle configuration and pressure field when the thin wall is subjecting to the dam break flow impact with setting a fluid particles in region ii keep static disregarding the dam break flow impact from region i which is consistent with the physical fact with setting b the usage of multi layer dbps method still prevents the dam break flow acting on the small water column however the density field near the solid boundary in layer i is discontinuous meanwhile unphysical boundary layer can be observed this is because the relative velocity between fluid and solid particles is much larger than that between fluid particles leading the density derivation calculated by eq 3 tremendous ni et al 2014 as for the solid boundary in layer ii no such abnormality can be observed because there is no velocity difference between fluid and solid particles with setting c the dam break flow impact increases the densities of the single layer dbps meanwhile these dbps interact with the fluid particles in region ii causing their densities to increase governed by eq 4 the fluid particles in region ii are repelled from the thin wall it is therefore concluded that both ren et al 2015 s modification on dbc and multi layer dbps method are significant for modeling the fluid thin wall interaction in addition although the simple shepard filter was used the stability of the pressure field can be still guaranteed even for the unfavorable flow impact problem 3 2 validation of wave profile lo and liu 2014 conducted experiment on solitary wave propagation over a shp and measured the wave profile evolution hydrodynamic pressure and wave force on the plate we has modelled their experiment using the same sph model as in this work he et al 2018b all those physical quantities were reproduced accurately demonstrating the reliability of the sph model here the wave profile comparison is revisited aiming to convince the wave transmission analysis in section 4 in addition a convergence analysis is conducted to identify the optimal particle resolution h δp along with a sensitivity analysis on the numerical speed of sound c 0 it should be noted that the solitary wave shp interaction is modelled in this subsection as explained by lo and liu 2014 by using an impulse wave the transient effects of the plate on a single wave can be identified easily whereas only quasi steady state behavior can be observed if periodic waves are considered yet the multi function use of shp discussed in this work is oriented to the regular wave fig 6 illustrates the numerical wave tank nwt which is 11 656 m long and 0 3 m high with water depth d 0 2 m a fixed shp of length l 1 156 m and submergence d p 0 05 m was placed inside four wave gauges w 1 w 4 were mounted to measure the wave profiles on the upstream a solitary wave of height h 0 04 m was generated using a piston type wavemaker that moved according to goring 1978 s approach on the downstream a sponge layer of length l s approximately equals 1 5λ was placed to absorb the outgoing wave λ is the effect wavelength of solitary wave that can be defined by 15 λ 16 π 2 d 3 3 h following ren et al 2015 the sponge layer can be set up by adding an artificial damping term μ x u i to eq 4 μ x has following expression 16 μ x α d x i x s l s for x s x i x s l s where α d is a coefficient x i is the horizontal position of fluid particle i x s is the horizontal position when the wave initially enter the sponge layer to determine the value of α d the plate was temporarily removed from the nwt and time histories of wave profiles η at gauge w 4 with coefficient α d varying from 1 to 6 were recorded as can be seen from fig 7 the solitary wave reflection consists of two parts one comes from the sponge layer when α d 3 in this condition the velocity decay in the damping zone is too rapid that the sponge layer behaves a bit stiff the other one comes from the back wall behind the sponge layer when α d 1 the sponge layer in this situation fails to damp the outgoing wave thoroughly therefore α d 2 is the optimal choice for absorbing the solitary wave still excluding the plate fig 8 gives the calculated wave profiles η h at gauges w 1 w 4 with increasing resolution h δp 2 4 8 and 16 and their comparison with the experimental data of lo and liu 2014 c 0 10 gd 1 2 is adopted this will be justified later it is observed that the sph model can predicted the height and length of the solitary wave reliably the numerical waveform is nearly invariant during wave propagation implying that the numerical dissipation covering the spatial range of wave plate interaction is negligible in addition fig 8 shows that the sph results converge toward the experimental data the convergence can be quantified with the root mean square deviation rmsd that is defined by 17 rmsd 1 n d i 1 n d η h i sph η h i exp 2 where i is the sequence number of sample n d is the total number of samples within the concerned time duration the rmsds of the sph results with respect to the experimental data are given in fig 9 from figs 8 and 9 a remarkable decrease of rmsd is observed as h δp increases from 2 to 4 this is not hard to understand because using two particles to describe the waveform is far from enough doubling h δp from 4 to 8 slightly improves the accuracy of wave profile calculation manifesting as a 0 0034 i e 7 9 decrement of the average rmsd however further doubling h δp from 8 to 16 hardly reduces the rmsd even slightly increases the rmsd at gauges w 2 and w 4 including the plate the calculated η h at w 1 w 4 for different h δp are given in fig 10 and compared with the experimental data of lo and liu 2014 the corresponding rmsds are given in fig 11 for h δp 2 4 and 8 the numerical plate was treated using the multi layer dbps method consequently its thicknesses are 0 04 0 02 and 0 01 m respectively obviously the former two values are larger than the thickness of physical plate which is 0 01 m as for h δp 16 the numerical plate was implemented with four lines of single layer dbps as illustrated in fig 2 b thus it is as thick as the physical one from figs 10 and 11 it is found that when h δp 2 the calculated wave phase is ahead of the physical one and the waveform fluctuates spuriously as explained before this is mainly due to the discretization error causing by inadequate particle resolution moreover it should also be relevant to the inconsistent thickness between the numerical and physical plates as h δp increases from 2 to 4 the accuracy of wave profile calculation is significantly improved manifesting as a 0 089 i e 55 3 decrement of the average rmsd doubling h δp from 4 to 8 only results in a 0 008 i e 10 2 decrement of the average rmsd nonetheless the wave tail at gauge w 4 can be better reproduced hardly any improvements are achieved with larger h δp therefore h δp 8 can be regarded as the optimal particle resolution on balance of the computational accuracy and runtime a sensitivity analysis on the numerical speed of sound c 0 is made by comparing the calculated η h using different coefficients ξ with the experimental data of lo and liu 2014 figs 12 and 13 indicate that varying ξ within the range of 10 40 makes little difference on the calculated η h on the other hand δt decreases almost in proportion to the increase of ξ according to eq 12 therefore ξ 10 could be a proper choice in determining c 0 on balance of the numerical stability and computational consumption 3 3 validation of velocity field poupardin et al 2012 carried out experiment on regular wave incidents on a shp and investigated the vortex dynamics around the plate using the particle image velocimetry piv technique as a continuation pinon et al 2017 provided the measured velocities around the plate here these velocities are numerically reproduced to check the accuracy of flow velocity calculation and thus to convince the energy conversion analysis in section 5 as illustrated in fig 14 the nwt was 2 65 1 5λ m long and 0 3 m high with water depth d 0 2 m it is equipped with an active absorbing wavemaker hirakuchi et al 1990 and a sponge layer described in subsection 3 2 the length and submergence of the fixed shp were 0 25 m and 0 07 m respectively a wave gauge w 1 was mounted at the leading edge of the plate to calibrate the incident wave two other wave gauges w 2 and w 3 spaced at 0 3λ part were placed in front of the sponge layer to separate the incident and reflected waves via the two points method of goda and suzuki 1976 following pinon et al 2017 ten velocity probes v 1 v 10 were distributed around the plate and their locations are listed in table 1 the physical plate in the experiment of poupardin et al 2012 is 0 003 m thick hence with the multi layer dbps method the particle resolution δp was taken as 0 0015 m the dimensionless parameter h δp equals 13 3 satisfying the resolution requirement h δp 8 determined in subsection 3 2 again the plate was temporarily removed from the nwt and damping performance of the sponge layer with respect to regular waves was checked the adopted wave parameters were within the ranges of 0 1 h d 0 4 and 0 1 d l 0 35 h d represents the intensity of wave fluctuation and d l reflects the wave penetrability the reflection coefficient c r is used to characterize the absorbing capacity of the sponge layer 18 c r h r h where h r is the height of reflected wave contour maps of c r with different α d are given in fig 15 it is found that α d 4 5 and 6 are all good choices for regular wave absorption c r can be limited to less than 10 even less than 3 under certain wave conditions among those values α d 4 was finally adopted because in this condition the wave absorbing performance of sponge layer is most stable taking the experiment wave condition i e h 0 02 m and t 1 0 s as input wave signal fig 16 a compares the calculated wave profile at gauge w 1 with the 2nd order stokes wave theory it can be seen that when regular wave reaches a steady state both its height and period are in good agreement with the analytical solution especially the sph model reproduces the steep crest and flat trough of the weakly nonlinear wave despite the employment of a 1st order wave making theory fig 16 b shows the multi frame snapshots of the numerical wave with a time interval of 0 25t it is observed that the waveform is nearly invariant during wave propagation and its height decays once the wave enters the sponge layer at the end of the sponge layer the surface fluctuation is relatively weak it demonstrates again the effectiveness of the sponge layer fig 17 gives the calculated horizontal flow velocities v x at probes v 1 v 10 and their comparison with the experimental data of pinon et al 2017 a group of five red curves is drawn in each subfigure they represent the numerical results of five successive wave periods within the steady stage of wave plate interaction their consistency well confirms the stability of the sph model the left panel of fig 17 shows that the calculated v x at probes v 1 v 5 satisfactorily agree with the measured data it is known that a wave train propagates onto a submerged structure with its nonlinearity increasing under the shoaling effect pinon et al 2017 speculated that this wave nonlinearity accounts for the asymmetry of v x curves at probes v 4 and v 5 and thereby explained why their linear free surface numerical model failed to reproduce the velocity asymmetry the sph model however was born to be a nonlinear fluid motion solver on the one hand the fluid motion is governed by the fully nonlinear n s equations on the other hand the free surface boundary condition is automatically satisfied due to the lagrangian nature of sph method and the usage of the eos hence no linearized free surface simplification is made therefore the asymmetry of v x curves at probes v 4 and v 5 can be well reproduced by the sph model the right panel of fig 17 shows that the sph model can well predict v x beneath the weather end at probes v 6 and v 7 and middle part at probe v 8 of the plate however the measured v x curves at probes v 9 and v 10 significantly diverge from zero whereas the deviations of the calculated v x curves are comparatively small the discrepancy is possibly related to the following two aspects first poupardin et al 2012 s experiment was performed in a 10 m long wave flume equipped with an ordinary flap type wavemaker since experimental v x was obtained by averaging piv measurements over 300 wave periods it must be heavily affected by the multiple reflected waves between the wavemaker and plate however there is no such problem in the numerical simulation second the solid boundary of the physical plate is either non slipped or partial slipped while a free slip solid boundary condition was implemented in this sph simulation therefore the vortex dynamics at the trailing ends of numerical and physical plates could be different v x at probes v 9 and v 10 are affected the most incidentally a uniform resolution sph model is very inefficient to enforce a no slip boundary condition because dense particles need to be disposed everywhere in the computational domain merely for describing the very thin boundary layer a multi resolution sph scheme is of vital importance and it should be adopted in the future work moreover a multi resolution sph will be more meaningful in 3d simulations 4 comparison of the shp and submerged step 4 1 numerical setup using the validated sph model interactions between waves and shp as well as submerged step under various regular wave conditions and structure configurations were simulated fig 18 illustrates the numerical setup a wave gauge w 1 was mounted one wavelength downstream from the structure to record the transmitted wave six velocity probes v 1 v 6 were distributed below the plate to quantify the velocity field in horizontal direction they quartered the space beneath the plate while they trisected that space in vertical direction two pressure sensors p 1 and p 2 were placed below the ends of the plate to measure the dynamic pressure parameters used in the simulations are listed in table 2 there were 192 runs in total each run consisted of 15 wave periods among which the last 5 periods were chosen for data analysis to avoid unstable result at the beginning of simulation δp 0 125 m was chosen therefore convergence conditions h δp 8 can be guaranteed even for the smallest wave height h 1 m adopted approximate 62 000 to 214 000 particles were used in the simulations depending on the wave period note that in case of 3d simulations of unit width approximately 558 000 to 1 926 000 particles have to be employed the cost effective will be somewhat low in consideration of as many as 192 runs especially for the wave shp interaction that has a strong 2d characteristic 4 2 wave dynamics it is know that a portion of wave energy transfers to higher harmonics when a wave train propagates over a submerged structure grue 1992 brossard et al 2009 thus periodic signals recorded at gauge w 2 in fig 18 were expanded into fourier series and the height of each order transmitted wave h t n where n being a positive integer stands for the number of order was determined using the fourier coefficients the corresponding wave transmission coefficients are defined by 19 c t n h t n h n 1 2 fig 19 gives the comparison of c t 1 between the two submerged structures for specified d p d and h d c t 1 of the submerged step is almost independent of l λ whereas c t 1 of the shp fluctuates with l λ substantially owing to the different variation trends c t 1 of the plate can be smaller than that of the step when c t 1 curve of the plate falls into a valley while an opposite relation appears when c t 1 curve of the plate climbs to a peak in engineering practice an optimal ratio l λ can be obtained by adjusting the length of structure according to the known wave period thus in regular wave field a shp is likely to have a minimum c t 1 then a submerged step on the other hand since c t 1 of the shp has a larger variation range in a random wave field the wave attenuation performance of the submerged step is more stable if further considering the economic and environmental factors the shp type breakwater should be more recommended fig 20 compares c t 2 of the two submerged structures in general c t 2 of the shp is larger than or equal to that of the submerged step this is because the interaction between the shallow water wave above the plate and the trailing vortex is more violent and as brossard and chagdali 2001 indicated that this interaction contributed to higher order waves generation the reason why this interaction is more violent for a shp may be twofold first the sharp edges of the plate favor the development of trailing vortex second the u turn flow surround the trailing end of the plate yu 2002 lifts the trailing vortex toward the free surface intermittently by comparing of figs 19 and 20 it is found that c t 2 is smaller than c t 1 for both structures it is further aware that a higher order wave corresponds to a lower frequency thus the 2nd order transmitted wave accounts for much less proportion of the transmitted wave energy than the 1st order one and only formula of the 1st order wave transmission coefficient is given in subsection 5 1 4 3 flow dynamics as an example fig 21 compares the pressure and velocity fields near the submerged plate and step under h d 0 25 l λ 0 4 and d p d 0 15 the vorticity of each fluid particle is defined as the curl of the local velocity field monaghan 1992 20 ω i u i j m j ρ i u i u j i w i j according to the above equation a clockwise resp anticlockwise circulation corresponds to a negative resp positive value of vorticity from fig 21 it can be seen that there is little difference in the wave evolution over the two submerged structures however the trailing vortices behind the two submerged structures and their interactions with shallow water waves are different on the downstream of the shp two adjacent and clockwise vortices are formed at t 8 35t then they merge to form a bigger vortex at t 8 60t that collides with the water flow plunging off the plate this collision favors the development of higher order wave and on the other hand pushes the trailing vortex away from the plate lots of energy is dissipated with the gradual decomposition of the vortex behind the submerged step two clockwise vortices of similar intensity and length scale are identified because they are far apart from each other the inter attraction fails to pull them together in this way only the vortex closer to the step interacts with the shallow water wave yielding a smaller c t 2 of the submerged step as for the velocity field beneath the plate a uniform and time varying water flow is observed at t 8 35t and 9 10t the water flow is parallel and opposite to the wave direction while this reverse flow almost disappears at t 8 60t and 8 85t the net energy transport within the entire wave period is upstream which should be partly responsible for the smaller c t 1 of the shp fig 22 gives time histories of flow velocities at probes v 1 v 6 obviously the amplitude of the horizontal velocity v x is much larger than that of the vertical velocity v y and the six v x curves are of good consistency the horizontality and uniformity of the velocity field beneath the plate are therefore confirmed in addition fig 22 a shows that the velocity field beneath the shp reaches a steady state after about eight wave periods from the beginning of simulation the maximum dimensionless velocity of the reverse flow is 0 055 while the maximum positive velocity is only 0 015 so the flow beneath the plate can be characterized by pulsating reversed the mechanism of the pulsating flow beneath the shp has been roughly explained in the introduction here we further convince the reader by examining the time histories of dynamic pressure p d at sensors p 1 and p 2 and horizontal flow velocity v x at probe v 2 it is noted that flow velocity at any probe v 1 v 6 can be used for analysis because velocity field beneath the plate has been proved uniform five equidistant instants t 1 t 5 are selected in fig 23 at t 1 dynamic pressure at sensors p 1 and p 2 is nearly equal and a maximum reverse flow is observed beneath the plate from t 1 to t 2 pressure at sensor p 1 increases while that at sensor p 2 varies little thus a pressure drop from the leading to trailing ends of the plate is formed slowing down the velocity of the reverse flow from t 2 to t 3 the pressure difference between sensors p 1 and p 2 decreases but the direction of descent gradient remains unchanged consequently the reverse flow continues to weaken and it turns round when the time is close to t 3 from t 3 to t 4 the pressure at sensor p 1 is negative while that at sensor p 2 is close to zero subjecting to this pressure difference the fluid flow accelerates toward the upstream direction turning velocity direction from positive to negative this acceleration process continues until the instant t 5 in a word the pulsating flow beneath the shp is driven by the direction alternated pressure gradient beneath and across the plate 5 empirical formulas for shp 5 1 wave transmission coefficient from an engineering perspective it is meaningful to develop an empirical formula for estimating the wave transmission coefficient of the shp although siew and hurley 1977 has long derived an explicit formula based on the long wave approximation and potential flow theory there remains no available formula oriented to the viscous flow due to the fluctuation feature of c t 1 exhibited in fig 19 a polynomial relation between c t 1 and l λ is first established 21 c t 1 a 1 m 1 m b m l λ c m m 1 2 where a 1 b m and c m are unknown coefficients m is the number of expansion terms fig 19 also indicates that h d affects both the magnitude of c t 1 and the characteristic length of c t 1 fluctuation referring to the range of l λ within which c t 1 completes a cycle of increase and decrease more specifically c t 1 generally increases with h d when l λ 0 4 while for l λ 0 4 a larger h d corresponds to a smaller c t 1 c t 1 undergoes three trend varying intervals when h d 0 125 while for h d 0 125 the number of intervals decreases to two or one as for d p d it has little influence on the characteristic length of c t 1 fluctuation but it is overall positively correlated with c t 1 since parameters h d and d p d has no regular affection on c t 1 eq 21 is expanded to a combination of all the possibilities 22 c t 1 a 1 a 2 d p d a 3 a 4 h d a 5 m 1 m b 1 m l λ c 1 m c 2 m d p d c 3 m h d m 1 m b 2 m b 3 m d p d b 4 m b 5 m h d b 6 m l λ c 4 m m 1 2 where a a k 1 k 5 b b km 1 k 6 1 m m and c c km 1 k 4 1 m m are three sets of coefficients to be determined targeting at the symbols in fig 24 the levenberg marquardt lm algorithm moré 1978 is used to optimize the unknown coefficients in eq 22 the results are listed in table 3 as intuitively expected eq 22 becomes more and more accurate as m increases coefficient of determination r 2 is 0 752 0 847 and 0 868 respectively when m equals 1 2 and 3 thus m 3 seems to yield a convergent regression the regression results of c t 1 are compared with the sph results in fig 23 satisfactory agreement is observed 5 2 energy conversion efficiency the energy conversion efficiency of shp can be defined as 23 σ p flow p wave here p wave is the wave energy flux given by 24 p wave 1 16 ρ 0 g h 2 λ t 1 4 π d λ sinh 4 π d λ p flow is the power of water flow beneath the plate calculated by 25 p flow 1 t t t t d d d p 1 2 ρ 0 v x 3 d y d t fig 25 gives the variation of σ with relative length of the plate l λ for different submergence d p d and wave heights h d a first observation indicates that σ tends to infinitesimal as l λ increases while it increases sharply with the decrease of l λ thus the following foundation is built 26 σ d 1 d 2 l λ d 3 where d d k 1 k 3 is a set of unknown coefficients σ is in percentage a second observation of fig 25 shows that σ is positively correlated with h d as for d p d its alters the magnitude of σ but no clear correlation between them can be found then a correction term consists of h d and d p d is incorporated into eq 26 yielding 27 σ e 1 d p d e 2 h d e 3 d 1 d 2 l λ d 3 where e e k 1 k 3 is another set of unknown coefficients it is also noted that an h d related term should be added in eq 27 because σ converges to non zero constants as h d increases in addition a restrictive condition σ 0 when d p d 1 should be supplemented finally eq 27 becomes 28 σ e 1 d p d e 2 h d e 3 d 1 d 2 l λ d 3 f 1 h d f 2 1 d p d g 1 where f f k 1 k 2 and g g k k 1 are two sets of coefficients to be determined targeting at the symbols in fig 25 the lm algorithm is used again to determine the unknown coefficients in eq 28 the results are listed in table 4 and the regression results of σ by using eq 28 are plotted in fig 24 it is glad to see that the regression results can satisfactorily replicate the sph outcome r 2 reaches as high as 0 959 excluding the uncertain errors in the numerical calculation and data processing the fitting can be regarded as a success researchers paying attention on the wave energy utilization may disapprove of the value of shp because the maximum σ shown in fig 25 is less than 8 if further considering the energy loss in the processes of the secondary and tertiary energy conversions the actual efficiency of shp will be even less we acknowledge this fact but as has been emphasized in the introduction a shp should be principally valued as a breakwater then by combining the energy utilization functionality it could be more competitive than other single functional breakwaters or wecs in addition although the electrical power produced per unit width of the plate is low the shp breakwater is commonly designed to be continuous and wide a rough evaluation indicates that the ideal rated power generated by a 1 km wide shp under h 2 m can up to 1500 kw ideally it simultaneously meets the electricity demand for 500 peoples in moderately developed countries as a side note orer and ozdamar 2007 significantly increases σ by placing structures below the shp intuitively the wave attenuation performance of the hybrid structure could also be enhanced because it has larger areas projected in the wave direction taken together a more efficient wave energy breakwater can be invented but it needs to be further investigated 6 comprehensive performance of shp investigating the comprehensive performance of a shp is essentially to solve a mathematical programming problem let ψ be the score of the comprehensive performance it is related to the wave transmission coefficient c t 1 and energy conversion efficiency σ thus the objective function is defined as 29 ψ ω f c t 1 1 ω g 1 σ where f and g are the constraint functions ω is the weighting factor a smaller c t 1 corresponds to a better wave attenuation performance whereas a larger σ yields more wave energy conversion in this reason σ in the function g is expressed as the reciprocal form the mathematical programming problem then translates into finding the minimum value of ψ in addition since c t 1 and 1 σ vary in different ranges the feature scaling is performed to rescale their ranges to 0 1 the transformations are written as 30 f c t 1 c t 1 min c t 1 max c t 1 min c t 1 g 1 σ 1 σ min 1 σ max 1 σ min 1 σ in the above equation max c t 1 1 and min c t 1 0 are theoretical upper and lower bounds of c t 1 respectively min 1 σ 0 is the theoretical lower bound of 1 σ because σ min 0 invalidates 1 σ min the calculated minimum value σ min 0 33 is taken hence max 1 σ 300 apart from the above bounds of c t 1 and σ there are also constraints from the wave and structure parameters including l λ d p d and h d they are subject to 31 l λ 0 0 d p d 1 h d 0 125 0 250 0 375 it is noted that in eq 31 an equality constraint rather than a range is enforced to h d this is because h d is an external wave condition but not a plate parameter to be optimized the complex method of box 1965 was used to solve eq 29 subject to eqs 30 and 31 the calculated c t 1 and σ with respect to the minimum ψ is given in fig 26 to be expected c t 1 decreases monotonically with the increase of ω it confirms that a smaller c t 1 can be obtained if increasing the emphasis on the wave attenuation functionality of the shp in the cases of h d 0 125 0 250 and 0 375 c t 1 reaches as small as 0 27 0 21 and 0 06 respectively no doubt an optimized shp is an efficient breakwater on the other hand σ increases monotonously with the decrease of ω in other words more wave energy can indeed be converted if putting more emphasis on the energy utilization functionality in the cases of h d 0 125 0 250 and 0 375 the maximum σ are 2 3 4 5 and 7 8 respectively substituting h d as well as the optimal c t 1 and η of fig 26 into eqs 22 and 28 the optimal plate parameters l λ and d p d can be obtained their variations with ω are given in fig 27 it can be seen that d p d decreases and l λ increases with the increase of ω that is to say if putting more emphasis on the wave attenuation functionality the shp should have a shallower submergence and a larger length this is not difficult to understand because the shallower the submergence is the easier the wave breaking happens moreover it takes a longer duration for the breaking wave to pass over a longer plate resulting in more wave energy dissipated on the contrary if putting more attention on the energy attenuation utilization the shp should be shorter and deeply immersed the mechanism is twofold first a shorter and deeply immersed plate dissipates less wave energy second the water quantity beneath a deeply immersed plate is less allowing earlier formation of pulsating flow driven by the pressure difference beneath and across the plate in addition it is found that for a specified ω a larger h d leads to a larger l λ but yields a smaller d p d it means that the shp should be designed slightly longer and shallower in severe wave condition 7 conclusions and future work the open source code dualsphysics v4 0 https dual sphysics org was applied to calculate wave fixed shp interactions covering extensive ranges of wave conditions and plate parameters in 2d ren et al 2015 s modification was taken to enhance the stability of density field near the solid boundary the multi layer dbps method of he et al 2018b was inserted in the original code to implement the thin walled boundary of plate efficiently by regressing the calculation results polynomial and exponential formulas for regular wave transmission coefficient c t 1 and energy conversion efficiency η of the shp were derived their coefficients of determination r 2 reach 0 868 and 0 959 demonstrating their reliability then by trading off c t 1 and η the optimal configuration of the shp was investigated the results indicate that with l λ and d p d being in the ranges of 0 38 0 85 and 0 05 0 11 a shp has the minimum c t 1 between 0 06 and 0 27 depending on the incident wave height it can therefore be considered as an efficient breakwater on the other hand a properly designed shp holds a maximum η between 2 3 and 7 8 the corresponding ranges of l λ and d p d are 0 24 0 25 and 0 13 0 17 respectively although this efficiency looks unappealing a 1 km wide shp is expected to supply electricity to a maximum of 500 peoples in moderately developed countries it is aware that the present work still has some limitations on the one hand the regular wave assumption is somewhat idealized it would be better to study the wave shp interaction under random wave and wave current conditions required techniques have been proposed by altomare et al 2017 and he et al 2018a however for long time simulation wave surface unphysically lifts if continue using the shepard filter the δ sph method antuono et al 2012 will be a good choice to fix this problem on the other hand the shp is generally supported by piles and turbines are assumed to be mounted beneath the plate but their effects on wave and flow fields are ignored to consider their influence 3d simulations have to be performed it relies on an advanced multi resolution sph scheme like the algorithm proposed by khayyer et al 2019 acknowledgements this work was supported by the national natural science foundation of china grant numbers 51709201 51679167 the china postdoctoral

22720,the submerged horizontal plate shp has been extensively studied as an open type breakwater and some research explored its potential as a wave energy converter however these two functionalities were seldom combined in the literature in this study a 2d numerical model solving the wave shp interaction was built by using the weakly compressible smoothed particle hydrodynamics wcsph method the thin walled boundary condition was verified through a dam break impact case the accuracy of wave profile and flow velocity calculations was validated by comparing with available experiments of solitary and regular waves interactions with shps comparison of the wave dynamic and flow dynamic between shp and submerged step were made which showed the advantages and disadvantages of the shp then a parametric study of regular waves fixed shp interaction was conducted empirical formulas for the wave transmission coefficient and energy conversion efficiency were obtained by regressing numerical results using the levenberg marquardt algorithm finally a mathematical programming problem concerning the combined functionalities of shp was established using the complex method the optimal length and submergence of shp regarding different emphases taken on the regular wave attenuation and energy utilization were solved the results preliminarily demonstrated the potential application of shp as a wave energy breakwater and provided reference on its parameter design although this work was carried out in 2d and ignored the effects of energy convertor and piles on wave and flow patterns keywords breakwater wave energy converter submerged horizontal plate smoothed particle hydrodynamics 1 introduction the so called wave energy breakwater web refers to a kind of marine structure that can simultaneously attenuate wave and generate electricity during the last decades various types of webs have been designed such as the integration of oscillating water column technique into bottom mounted or floating breakwaters he et al 2013 crespo et al 2017 mendonça et al 2018 the incorporation of overtopping wave energy converter wec device into a rubble mound breakwater vicinanza et al 2014 the combination of power take off device and a flexible floating breakwater michailides and angelides 2012 here another potential web will be discussed namely the submerged horizontal plate shp the pile supported shp has long been familiar to the coastal and ocean engineering communities as a cost effective and environmentally friendly breakwater yu 2002 in recent years some studies also explored its potential application as a wec hayatdavoodi et al 2017a or investigated its functionality of altering flow pattern so as to create favorable condition for other energy converters orer and ozdamar 2007 although the shp attenuates wave and meanwhile assists energy acquisition little effort has been paid on combining these two functionalities this work makes a preliminary attempt to compensate for the drawback it is hoped that by doing so the overall value of shp can be increased and consequently accelerating its engineering application research on the wave attenuation functionality of shp can be traced back to the work of heins 1950 by means of the wiener hopf technique explicit solution of the transmission coefficient c t of a semi infinite shp in finite water depth was obtained later the boundary value problem was extended to infinite water depth by greene and heins 1953 and to a finite plate by burke 1964 based on the long wave assumption siew and hurley 1977 derived the first explicit formula for c t by using the matched asymptotic expansions mae technique the mae technique was also applied by patarapanich 1984 to analyze the variation of reflection coefficient c r versus the length of the plate as a more versatile analytical solution the eigen function expansion method was widely employed to evaluate the wave scattering by various kinds of plate such as elastic plate mohapatra and sahoo 2014 porous plate liu and li 2011 multi layer plate wang and shen 1999 and their combinations fang et al 2017 recently hayatdavoodi et al 2017b used the shallow water green naghdi equations to characterize the nonlinear wave scattering by a plate besides analytical solutions lalli et al 2012 conducted boundary element method bem calculations to investigate the effects of thickness length and submergence of shp on c t lin et al 2014 applied the time domain higher order bem method to evaluate the current effects on fundamental and high order transmitted waves using the de singularized boundary integral equation method liu et al 2009 and liu et al 2017 studied the energy transfer from the fundamental mode towards higher order transmitted waves above fixed and heaving plates respectively it was also found that the down streamed radiated wave induced by the heave response of plate is likely to neutralize the transmitted wave yu and chwang 1994 analyzed the porosity effect on c t by introducing the darcy s law into a finite element model jin et al 2014 examined the effect of plate thickness on c t by solving the reynolds averaged navier stokes equations using the openfoam using the smoothed particle hydrodynamics sph method he et al 2018b and he et al 2018c investigated the variation of c t due to sea level change and heave motion of the plate respectively existing wecs can be classified into two broad categories one set first converts wave energy into heave shadman et al 2018 or pitch motions yemm et al 2012 of structures then the motions drive power take off systems to produce electric power waters et al 2007 the other set alters wave energy distribution by careful design of the structure geometry yielding pressure difference of air falcão and henriques 2016 or fluid kofoed et al 2006 air or hydraulic turbines are accordingly used for electricity generation within both categories a piled supported shp can be regarded as a potential wec shp is subjected to large vertical wave force so it heaves dramatically without vertical restraint by connecting with a linear electrical generator kinetic energy of the heave motion will be directly converted into electrical energy hayatdavoodi et al 2017a as for a fixed shp as depicted in fig 1 the unequal water surface elevations above the two ends of the plate produce hydrodynamic pressure difference across and beneath the plate hence the fluid mass beneath the plate moves horizontally supposing an energy convertor like hydraulic turbine is placed beneath the plate the flow kinetic energy can be converted into electrical energy the shp type wec mentioned hereinafter refers to the latter category perhaps dick 1968 conducted the earliest investigation on the flow pattern beneath the shp nested tubes with different internal diameters were placed beneath the plate to model permeable breakwater of various porosities although the fluid motion was restricted by the tubes his experiment still reflected the general tendency of fluid mass transport without tubes graw et al 1989 and graw 1992 investigated the flow characteristics around the plate using the laser beam deflection method and ultrasonic 3d probe technique respectively oscillatory and time averaged reversed flow characters were observed carter et al 2006 compared the wave shp interactions based on the potential and viscous flow theories respectively the result indicated that the pulsating flow was the product of the hydrodynamic pressure difference beneath the ends of the plate and from the root was controlled by the relative phasing of surface waves moreover they found that the amplitude of the mean reverse flow was dominated by the wave nonlinearity carmigniani et al 2019 evaluated the wave mass transport above the plate and demonstrated its relationship with the reverse flow phenomenon beneath the plate inspired by this pulsating flow graw 1993 suggested installing water turbines beneath the shp to convert kinetic energy to electric power orer and ozdamar 2007 experimentally found that the maximum energy conversion efficiency η the ratio of the power of water flow beneath the plate to the wave energy flux was only 5 then they enhanced the pulsating flow by placing structures of different shapes and sizes below the plate and to the greatest extent η reached up to 60 with a triangular obstruction on the sea bottom kharati koopaee and kiali kooshkghazi 2019 assessed the effects of opening area and plate length on the flow magnitude beneath the plate however hybrid structure consisting of upper shp and lower obstruction is more like a submerged step rather than a plate and thus beyond the scope of the present study seibt et al 2014 calculated the flow power by incorporating the kinetic energy of fluid flow and the potential energy of hydrostatic pressure as a result η was significantly increased from less than 5 to 64 without help from additional structures electric machine produces power through the relative movement between rotor and stator but the hydrostatic pressure may not be possible to drive this relative movement from all points a single shp is not really an efficient wec it should be principally valued as a breakwater and energy utilization functionality is combined to promote its additional value in this way the shp could be more competitive than other single functional breakwaters or wecs a literature survey indicates that existing research seldom combined these two functionalities and thus unable to maximize the value of shp in addition only scattered data on c t and η can be found in the literature a systematic study and relevant empirical formulas for engineering application are still lacking the two shortcomings constitute the focus of this study this study first makes effort to develop empirical formulas for c t and η to achieve this goal abundant data covering wide ranges of wave conditions and plate parameters are necessary it is possible to gather some data from the literature however subjected to their quantities or the linear or inviscid assumptions taken in those studies new calculations covering wider ranges of ratios of wave height to water depth h d plate length to wavelength l λ and plate submergence to water depth d p d need to be carried out by exploring the laws of the calculated results the forms of the empirical formulas can be determined then the levenberg marquardt algorithm moré 1978 is used to optimize the unknown coefficients secondly efforts are also oriented towards optimizing the configuration of shp to obtain the best comprehensive performance in terms of the wave attenuation and wave energy utilization for this purpose a mathematical programming problem is built taking the comprehensive performance of the shp as the objective function and taking h d l λ and d p d as the constraint conditions the complex method is used to solve the problem the wave shp interaction simulations are performed based on the open source code dualsphysics v4 0 https dual sphysics org which has been developing within the framework of the sph method by researchers of universidade de vigo spain the university of manchester u k ephytech sl spain science technology facilities council u k instituto superior técnico portugal università degli studi di parma italy and universiteit gent flanders hydraulics research belgium it is both convenient and efficient to perform 3d simulations using the dualsphysics but the present wave shp simulations are made in the 2d space due to three reasons first to be a good shield for inshore water the shp type breakwater is generally constructed up to several kilometers yet its length paralleled to the wave ray direction is only tens of meters such a high dimension ratio completely fulfils the requirement of 2d simplification second the multidirectional deep water wave tends to shore normal due to the wave refraction over shallowing bathymetry consequently the shp is commonly subjected to normal wave action third numerous cases are simulated in this work to obtain empirical formulas as accurate as possible although 3d simulations are more rigorous due to the possible consideration of hydraulic turbine and mooring piles it would not be very cost effective on balance of accuracy improvement and computational consumption the sph method is a lagrangian mesh free numerical discretization technique which was first invented to solve astrophysical problems gingold and monaghan 1977 and later introduced into elastic dynamics gray et al 2001 hydrodynamics monaghan and kos 1999 explosion calculations ming et al 2016 and many other fields for free surface flow problems it can be further categorized into weakly compressible and incompressible modes the weakly compressible sph wcsph solves the governing equations of the fluid explicitly by introducing an equation of state eos teams from universidade de vigo spain cnr insean italy école centrale de nantes france etc are committed to its cutting edge development in the context of incompressible sph isph the particle pressure is implicitly calculated by solving the pressure poisson equation based on projection method chorin 1968 hence the isph is also called projection based sph teams from kyoto university japan the university of manchester u k etc contribute most to its development for the latest achievements of isph the reader is referred to the review work of gotoh and khayyer 2016 generally the sph method has several advantages over mesh based numerical methods frist the free surface can be easily captured due the its lagrangian nature thus it is good at handling highly nonlinear fluid motion and the fragmentation and coalescence of free surface second there is no topological connection among neighboring particles so it gets rid of mesh distortion that may occur in the cases of rapidly moving or rotating solid boundaries third since each particle carries material properties no special variables are needed to detect the multi phase interfaces because of the above advantages there was growing interest in applying the sph method for coastal and ocean engineering research gotoh and khayyer 2018 examples include simulations concerning violent sloshing delorme et al 2009 gotoh et al 2014 oil spilling shi et al 2018a 2018b wave breaking dalrymple and rogers 2006 khayyer et al 2008 porous flow gui et al 2015 khayyer et al 2018b wave impact gomez gesteira and dalrymple 2004 altomare et al 2015 fluid structure interaction khayyer et al 2018a ming et al 2018 zheng et al 2018 using the sph method to study the wave shp interaction is decided by the physical problem itself there is a sudden drop in water depth when a wave train propagates onto the plate the shoaling effect increases the wave nonlinearity and even leads to wave breaking furthermore the plate switches status between submerged and exposed under the alternate action of wave crest and trough and meanwhile vortices are generated at both ends of the plate the viscous fluid motion with complex free surface is what the sph method most excels there are already some sph studies on the wave plate interaction cherfils et al 2008 simulated the regular wave reflection by a shp the plate was modelled using the ghost particles and a modified neighbor search algorithm was introduced to avoid undesired interactions between ghost particles and fluid particles dong et al 2016 compared the solitary wave loads on a thick shp over flat and sloping bottoms the plate was implemented using a stack of dynamic boundary particles dbps carmigniani et al 2019 discussed the origin of the reverse flow beneath shp by evaluating the wave mass transport above the plate in their simulation the so called unified semi analytical wall boundary condition was applied because water level fluctuates with the tide so shp sometimes emerges and becomes a horizontal deck gómez gesteira et al 2005 and shao et al 2006 reproduced cox and scott 2001 s experiment of green wave overtopping using the wcsph and isph methods respectively without matching the thickness of the physical deck intentionally their numerical decks were constructed of two or one lines of wall particles combining the corrected smoothed particle method and riemann solution gao et al 2012 studied the wave slamming on a rigid platform the fluid motion near the platform was interfered artificially to prevent fluid particles penetration by reviewing the above wave plate interaction it is found that the difficultly of simulating the wave shp interaction lies in the approach to implement the thin plate unlike the conventional mesh based methods that have the constant mesh topology an sph particle can interact with any other particles within its spherical supporting domain if the plate is very thin the fluid of a given side of the thin wall structure will unphysically interact with the fluid of the opposite side to overcome this drawback meringolo et al 2015 ren et al 2018 and he et al 2018b proposed the multi node fixed ghost particles multi layer dbps and color domain particle methods respectively among them the multi layer dbps method is adopted herein because it is developed based on the dynamic boundary condition dbc that is used as the solid boundary condition in this work the rest of the paper is organized as follows section 2 briefly introduces the sph model the model is then verified and validated in section 3 section 4 compares the hydrodynamics of the shp and submerged step from which the advantages and disadvantages of shp are analyzed section 5 derives empirical formulas for the wave transmission coefficient and energy conversion efficiency of shp by regressing the calculation results covering wide ranges of regular wave and plate parameters section 6 combines functionalities of wave attenuation and energy utilization of shp and discusses the optimal configuration of shp conclusions are finally drawn in section 7 together with our opinions upon the future work 2 sph model 2 1 equations of fluid motion the motion of the fluid is governed by the continuity equation and the navier stokes n s equations which have the differential forms of 1 d ρ d t ρ u 2 d u d t 1 ρ p g υ 0 2 u 1 ρ τ where t is the time ρ it the density p is the pressure u is the velocity g is the gravitational acceleration υ 0 is the laminar kinematic viscosity and τ is the turbulent stress tensor following the sph notation of crespo et al 2015 eqs 1 and 2 are discreted as 3 d ρ i d t j m j u i j i w i j 4 d u i d t j m j p i ρ i 2 p j ρ j 2 i w i j g j m j 4 υ 0 r i j i w i j ρ i ρ j δ r i j 2 η 2 u i j j m j τ i j ρ i 2 τ j i ρ j 2 i w i j here subscripts i and j denote the target and neighboring particles respectively m is the mass r is the position and δr ij is the distance between particles i and j r ij r i r j and likewise u ij u i u j η 0 01h 2 h 1 5δp is the smoothing length with δp being the initial particle pacing τ is approximated using the sub particle scale sps turbulence model of lo and shao 2002 it is known that the large eddy simulation les technique is not recommended in 2d turbulence simulation mainly because it generates bucket shape vortex that differs from the reality however although derived from the les technique the 2d sps turbulence model has been widely accepted ever since it was introduced into the particle method community plenty of applications of the sps method on 2d turbulence simulations have been made such as shao and gotoh 2005 and dalrymple and rogers 2006 w ij w r ij h is the kernel function and the wendland 1995 type is chosen 5 w i j 7 4 π h 2 1 δ r i j 2 h 4 2 δ r i j h 1 0 δ r i j 2 h the fluid in this work is assumed to be weakly compressible thus the tait s eos monaghan 1994 relating the pressure and density is supplemented to close eqs 3 and 4 6 p i ρ 0 c 0 2 γ ρ i ρ 0 γ 1 where γ 7 is a constant ρ 0 1000 kg m3 is the reference density c 0 ξ gd 1 2 is the numerical speed of sound with coefficient ξ commonly ranging from 10 to 40 and d being the water depth of computational domain as will be shown in subsection 3 2 ξ 10 is an proper choice in terms of the wave shp interaction simulation the lagrangian particles are moved according to 7 d r i d t u i the well known xsph variant monaghan 1989 is not applied herein because the wendland 1995 kernel already improves the orderliness of particle flow dehnen and aly 2012 yan and monaghan 2017 an additional use of the xsph variant makes little difference but introduces extra numerical diffusion that is undesirable gómez gesteira et al 2012 the wcsph method is characterized with high frequency pressure noise therefore a series of excellent algorithms have been proposed for example the density filter colagrossi and landrini 2003 the riemann solver vila 1999 inutsuka 2002 and the δ sph or δ sph method antuono et al 2012 sun et al 2018 among them the shepard filter is adopted in this work particle densities are reassigned according to the following equation every 30 time steps 8 ρ i n e w j m j w i j j m j ρ j w i j being an earlier de nosing method the shepard filter is inferior to the δ sph method regarding the conservation of mass and stability of pressure field nonetheless the calculated physical quantities with the shepard filter are as accurate as those obtained using the δ sph method in the simulation of wave shp interaction moreover the shepard filter is more efficient since it is performed every 20 40 times steps as for the δ sph method a renormalization density gradient has to be executed at every time step leading to considerable computational cost 2 2 time stepping the 2nd order predictor corrector integration scheme monaghan 1989 is used to integrate eqs 3 4 and 7 during the first stage field variables ϕ ρ u and r of every particle are predicted according to 9 ϕ i n 1 2 ϕ i n δ t 2 d ϕ i n d t where superscript n denotes the sequence number of time step n 1 2 denotes the half step δt is the time step increment then during the second stage the predicted variables are corrected by 10 ϕ i n 1 2 ϕ i n δ t 2 d ϕ i n 1 2 d t finally ϕ is recalculated by 11 ϕ i n 1 2 ϕ i n 1 2 ϕ i n a variable time step is taken to ensure the stability of the numerical calculation first the cfl condition must be satisfied as most explicit numerical methods in the wcsph framework h and c i c 0 ρ i ρ 0 3 is the speed of sound at the particle position are chosen as the interval length and perturbation velocity respectively second the travel distance of any lagrangian particle in one time step should less than h 4 third the viscous condition usually used in the finite difference method is brought in morris et al 1997 mathematically the time step criterion reads 12 δ t min 0 25 h max i c i 0 25 h max i d u i d t 0 125 h 2 ν 0 2 3 ordinary solid boundary condition the word ordinary refers to a class of solid boundaries that only contact with the fluid at one side in this work it is implemented using the dbc which is originally proposed by dalrymple and knio 2001 and mathematically interpreted by crespo et al 2007 in simple terms two lines of dbps are fixed on the frame of solid structure they share the same equations of continuity and state as fluid particles but their positions and velocities keep unchanged referring to those dbps constituting the water tank or are externally imposed referring to those dbps constituting the wavemaker the major disadvantage of dbc lies in the abnormal density gradient near the solid boundary to minimize this negative effect gómez gesteira et al 2005 buffered the calculated dbps densities using the reference density ρ 0 abandoning the values from eq 3 ni et al 2014 recalculated the dbps densities every time step following the shepard filter approach an artificial boundary layer was also set in their work to prevent unphysical penetration of fluid particles gong et al 2016 divided rectangular regions along the solid boundary and assigned the averaged pressure of inner fluid particles to the dbps retaining a small proportion of dbps densities calculated by eq 3 ren et al 2015 brought in the average densities of fluid particles within the kernel support of dbps to lower the density gradient near the solid boundary the mathematic expression is 13 ρ i χ ρ i 1 χ ρ j here ρ i and ρ i are dbp densities before and after correction χ is a weight coefficient in a range between 0 and 1 it needs to be tuned regarding the problem to be concerned and in the present calculations χ 0 2 is adopted ρ j is the average density of a total of n fluid particles within the support domain of dbps 14 ρ j 1 n j 1 n ρ j ρ j r i j the correction term ρ j r i j in eq 14 has the functionality of compensating the effects of truncated compact support our previous numerical studies li et al 2017 ren et al 2017 gao et al 2018 all confirmed that ren et al 2015 s modification can effectively smooth out the pressure fluctuation near the solid boundary as well as prevent the fluid particle penetration we therefore continue to use this modification in the present study 2 4 thin walled boundary condition for structures surrounded by the fluid dbps are arranged along the framework as illustrated in fig 2 a when simulating thin walled structures upper and lower dbps should be as close as possible however a critical separation equaling δp depending on the value of h needs to be preserved as shown in fig 2 b otherwise donor fluid particles of a given side of the thin walled structure will spuriously influence the acceptor fluid particles of the opposite side via the densities variations of the medium dbps therefore the minimum thickness of a structure implementing using ordinary dbps is 4δp to further decrease the thickness and meanwhile to block the unphysical inter particle interaction he et al 2018b proposed the multi layer dbps method as shown in fig 3 the thin walled structure consists of three layers of dbps and its surrounding fluid domain is divided into four regions in fig 3 a dbps symbolized as triangles only interact with fluid particles symbolized as small circles with the same colors in this way near boundary fluid particles will not be excessively repelled by dbps overlapped at the same position on the other hand fluid particle interactions occur within the truncated support domains symbolized as translucent big circles the fluid fluid interaction from the two lateral sides of thin wall is forbidden fig 3 b gives a different angle of view dbps in layers i and ii only interact with fluid particles in regions i and ii respectively dbps in layer iii only interact with fluid particles in regions iii and iv interactions between fluid particles in region i and ii are forbidden and all the rest is permitted it is obvious that using the multi layer dbps method the thin walled structure to be described is 2δp thick it means that two times larger δp can be adopted to implement a thickness specified thin wall than applying the implementation shown in fig 2 b consequently 75 particles are saved it is worth noting that the thin wall boundary condition is oriented to 2d problems it needs to be further developed before applying to 3d thin walled structures like the blades of turbine partly due to this limitation the energy converter beneath the shp is ignored in the present simulations 3 verification and validation 3 1 verification of multi layer dbps method a dam break impact problem was simulated to check the performance of the multi layer dbps method moreover the importance of ren et al 2015 s modification on the dbc and the applicability of the shepard filter in this study were checked the geometry the problem is given in fig 4 a water column of length 0 5 m and height 1 0 m was initially static on the left hand side lhs of a rectangular tank on the right hand side rhs of the tank there was another water column of length 0 1 m and height 0 25 m it was shielded from the dam break flow by a thin wall the particle spacing δp adopted was 0 005 m three computational settings were considered a using ren et al 2015 s modification on dbc and employing the multi layer dbps method to implement the thin wall b using the multi layer dbps method but the conventional dbc c using the modified dbc but one layer two lines of dbps because the thin wall only contacts with the fluid from its lhs and rhs only two layers of dbps are needed excluding those red triangles in fig 3 a or those terminal dbps in layer iii of fig 3 b fig 5 shows the particle configuration and pressure field when the thin wall is subjecting to the dam break flow impact with setting a fluid particles in region ii keep static disregarding the dam break flow impact from region i which is consistent with the physical fact with setting b the usage of multi layer dbps method still prevents the dam break flow acting on the small water column however the density field near the solid boundary in layer i is discontinuous meanwhile unphysical boundary layer can be observed this is because the relative velocity between fluid and solid particles is much larger than that between fluid particles leading the density derivation calculated by eq 3 tremendous ni et al 2014 as for the solid boundary in layer ii no such abnormality can be observed because there is no velocity difference between fluid and solid particles with setting c the dam break flow impact increases the densities of the single layer dbps meanwhile these dbps interact with the fluid particles in region ii causing their densities to increase governed by eq 4 the fluid particles in region ii are repelled from the thin wall it is therefore concluded that both ren et al 2015 s modification on dbc and multi layer dbps method are significant for modeling the fluid thin wall interaction in addition although the simple shepard filter was used the stability of the pressure field can be still guaranteed even for the unfavorable flow impact problem 3 2 validation of wave profile lo and liu 2014 conducted experiment on solitary wave propagation over a shp and measured the wave profile evolution hydrodynamic pressure and wave force on the plate we has modelled their experiment using the same sph model as in this work he et al 2018b all those physical quantities were reproduced accurately demonstrating the reliability of the sph model here the wave profile comparison is revisited aiming to convince the wave transmission analysis in section 4 in addition a convergence analysis is conducted to identify the optimal particle resolution h δp along with a sensitivity analysis on the numerical speed of sound c 0 it should be noted that the solitary wave shp interaction is modelled in this subsection as explained by lo and liu 2014 by using an impulse wave the transient effects of the plate on a single wave can be identified easily whereas only quasi steady state behavior can be observed if periodic waves are considered yet the multi function use of shp discussed in this work is oriented to the regular wave fig 6 illustrates the numerical wave tank nwt which is 11 656 m long and 0 3 m high with water depth d 0 2 m a fixed shp of length l 1 156 m and submergence d p 0 05 m was placed inside four wave gauges w 1 w 4 were mounted to measure the wave profiles on the upstream a solitary wave of height h 0 04 m was generated using a piston type wavemaker that moved according to goring 1978 s approach on the downstream a sponge layer of length l s approximately equals 1 5λ was placed to absorb the outgoing wave λ is the effect wavelength of solitary wave that can be defined by 15 λ 16 π 2 d 3 3 h following ren et al 2015 the sponge layer can be set up by adding an artificial damping term μ x u i to eq 4 μ x has following expression 16 μ x α d x i x s l s for x s x i x s l s where α d is a coefficient x i is the horizontal position of fluid particle i x s is the horizontal position when the wave initially enter the sponge layer to determine the value of α d the plate was temporarily removed from the nwt and time histories of wave profiles η at gauge w 4 with coefficient α d varying from 1 to 6 were recorded as can be seen from fig 7 the solitary wave reflection consists of two parts one comes from the sponge layer when α d 3 in this condition the velocity decay in the damping zone is too rapid that the sponge layer behaves a bit stiff the other one comes from the back wall behind the sponge layer when α d 1 the sponge layer in this situation fails to damp the outgoing wave thoroughly therefore α d 2 is the optimal choice for absorbing the solitary wave still excluding the plate fig 8 gives the calculated wave profiles η h at gauges w 1 w 4 with increasing resolution h δp 2 4 8 and 16 and their comparison with the experimental data of lo and liu 2014 c 0 10 gd 1 2 is adopted this will be justified later it is observed that the sph model can predicted the height and length of the solitary wave reliably the numerical waveform is nearly invariant during wave propagation implying that the numerical dissipation covering the spatial range of wave plate interaction is negligible in addition fig 8 shows that the sph results converge toward the experimental data the convergence can be quantified with the root mean square deviation rmsd that is defined by 17 rmsd 1 n d i 1 n d η h i sph η h i exp 2 where i is the sequence number of sample n d is the total number of samples within the concerned time duration the rmsds of the sph results with respect to the experimental data are given in fig 9 from figs 8 and 9 a remarkable decrease of rmsd is observed as h δp increases from 2 to 4 this is not hard to understand because using two particles to describe the waveform is far from enough doubling h δp from 4 to 8 slightly improves the accuracy of wave profile calculation manifesting as a 0 0034 i e 7 9 decrement of the average rmsd however further doubling h δp from 8 to 16 hardly reduces the rmsd even slightly increases the rmsd at gauges w 2 and w 4 including the plate the calculated η h at w 1 w 4 for different h δp are given in fig 10 and compared with the experimental data of lo and liu 2014 the corresponding rmsds are given in fig 11 for h δp 2 4 and 8 the numerical plate was treated using the multi layer dbps method consequently its thicknesses are 0 04 0 02 and 0 01 m respectively obviously the former two values are larger than the thickness of physical plate which is 0 01 m as for h δp 16 the numerical plate was implemented with four lines of single layer dbps as illustrated in fig 2 b thus it is as thick as the physical one from figs 10 and 11 it is found that when h δp 2 the calculated wave phase is ahead of the physical one and the waveform fluctuates spuriously as explained before this is mainly due to the discretization error causing by inadequate particle resolution moreover it should also be relevant to the inconsistent thickness between the numerical and physical plates as h δp increases from 2 to 4 the accuracy of wave profile calculation is significantly improved manifesting as a 0 089 i e 55 3 decrement of the average rmsd doubling h δp from 4 to 8 only results in a 0 008 i e 10 2 decrement of the average rmsd nonetheless the wave tail at gauge w 4 can be better reproduced hardly any improvements are achieved with larger h δp therefore h δp 8 can be regarded as the optimal particle resolution on balance of the computational accuracy and runtime a sensitivity analysis on the numerical speed of sound c 0 is made by comparing the calculated η h using different coefficients ξ with the experimental data of lo and liu 2014 figs 12 and 13 indicate that varying ξ within the range of 10 40 makes little difference on the calculated η h on the other hand δt decreases almost in proportion to the increase of ξ according to eq 12 therefore ξ 10 could be a proper choice in determining c 0 on balance of the numerical stability and computational consumption 3 3 validation of velocity field poupardin et al 2012 carried out experiment on regular wave incidents on a shp and investigated the vortex dynamics around the plate using the particle image velocimetry piv technique as a continuation pinon et al 2017 provided the measured velocities around the plate here these velocities are numerically reproduced to check the accuracy of flow velocity calculation and thus to convince the energy conversion analysis in section 5 as illustrated in fig 14 the nwt was 2 65 1 5λ m long and 0 3 m high with water depth d 0 2 m it is equipped with an active absorbing wavemaker hirakuchi et al 1990 and a sponge layer described in subsection 3 2 the length and submergence of the fixed shp were 0 25 m and 0 07 m respectively a wave gauge w 1 was mounted at the leading edge of the plate to calibrate the incident wave two other wave gauges w 2 and w 3 spaced at 0 3λ part were placed in front of the sponge layer to separate the incident and reflected waves via the two points method of goda and suzuki 1976 following pinon et al 2017 ten velocity probes v 1 v 10 were distributed around the plate and their locations are listed in table 1 the physical plate in the experiment of poupardin et al 2012 is 0 003 m thick hence with the multi layer dbps method the particle resolution δp was taken as 0 0015 m the dimensionless parameter h δp equals 13 3 satisfying the resolution requirement h δp 8 determined in subsection 3 2 again the plate was temporarily removed from the nwt and damping performance of the sponge layer with respect to regular waves was checked the adopted wave parameters were within the ranges of 0 1 h d 0 4 and 0 1 d l 0 35 h d represents the intensity of wave fluctuation and d l reflects the wave penetrability the reflection coefficient c r is used to characterize the absorbing capacity of the sponge layer 18 c r h r h where h r is the height of reflected wave contour maps of c r with different α d are given in fig 15 it is found that α d 4 5 and 6 are all good choices for regular wave absorption c r can be limited to less than 10 even less than 3 under certain wave conditions among those values α d 4 was finally adopted because in this condition the wave absorbing performance of sponge layer is most stable taking the experiment wave condition i e h 0 02 m and t 1 0 s as input wave signal fig 16 a compares the calculated wave profile at gauge w 1 with the 2nd order stokes wave theory it can be seen that when regular wave reaches a steady state both its height and period are in good agreement with the analytical solution especially the sph model reproduces the steep crest and flat trough of the weakly nonlinear wave despite the employment of a 1st order wave making theory fig 16 b shows the multi frame snapshots of the numerical wave with a time interval of 0 25t it is observed that the waveform is nearly invariant during wave propagation and its height decays once the wave enters the sponge layer at the end of the sponge layer the surface fluctuation is relatively weak it demonstrates again the effectiveness of the sponge layer fig 17 gives the calculated horizontal flow velocities v x at probes v 1 v 10 and their comparison with the experimental data of pinon et al 2017 a group of five red curves is drawn in each subfigure they represent the numerical results of five successive wave periods within the steady stage of wave plate interaction their consistency well confirms the stability of the sph model the left panel of fig 17 shows that the calculated v x at probes v 1 v 5 satisfactorily agree with the measured data it is known that a wave train propagates onto a submerged structure with its nonlinearity increasing under the shoaling effect pinon et al 2017 speculated that this wave nonlinearity accounts for the asymmetry of v x curves at probes v 4 and v 5 and thereby explained why their linear free surface numerical model failed to reproduce the velocity asymmetry the sph model however was born to be a nonlinear fluid motion solver on the one hand the fluid motion is governed by the fully nonlinear n s equations on the other hand the free surface boundary condition is automatically satisfied due to the lagrangian nature of sph method and the usage of the eos hence no linearized free surface simplification is made therefore the asymmetry of v x curves at probes v 4 and v 5 can be well reproduced by the sph model the right panel of fig 17 shows that the sph model can well predict v x beneath the weather end at probes v 6 and v 7 and middle part at probe v 8 of the plate however the measured v x curves at probes v 9 and v 10 significantly diverge from zero whereas the deviations of the calculated v x curves are comparatively small the discrepancy is possibly related to the following two aspects first poupardin et al 2012 s experiment was performed in a 10 m long wave flume equipped with an ordinary flap type wavemaker since experimental v x was obtained by averaging piv measurements over 300 wave periods it must be heavily affected by the multiple reflected waves between the wavemaker and plate however there is no such problem in the numerical simulation second the solid boundary of the physical plate is either non slipped or partial slipped while a free slip solid boundary condition was implemented in this sph simulation therefore the vortex dynamics at the trailing ends of numerical and physical plates could be different v x at probes v 9 and v 10 are affected the most incidentally a uniform resolution sph model is very inefficient to enforce a no slip boundary condition because dense particles need to be disposed everywhere in the computational domain merely for describing the very thin boundary layer a multi resolution sph scheme is of vital importance and it should be adopted in the future work moreover a multi resolution sph will be more meaningful in 3d simulations 4 comparison of the shp and submerged step 4 1 numerical setup using the validated sph model interactions between waves and shp as well as submerged step under various regular wave conditions and structure configurations were simulated fig 18 illustrates the numerical setup a wave gauge w 1 was mounted one wavelength downstream from the structure to record the transmitted wave six velocity probes v 1 v 6 were distributed below the plate to quantify the velocity field in horizontal direction they quartered the space beneath the plate while they trisected that space in vertical direction two pressure sensors p 1 and p 2 were placed below the ends of the plate to measure the dynamic pressure parameters used in the simulations are listed in table 2 there were 192 runs in total each run consisted of 15 wave periods among which the last 5 periods were chosen for data analysis to avoid unstable result at the beginning of simulation δp 0 125 m was chosen therefore convergence conditions h δp 8 can be guaranteed even for the smallest wave height h 1 m adopted approximate 62 000 to 214 000 particles were used in the simulations depending on the wave period note that in case of 3d simulations of unit width approximately 558 000 to 1 926 000 particles have to be employed the cost effective will be somewhat low in consideration of as many as 192 runs especially for the wave shp interaction that has a strong 2d characteristic 4 2 wave dynamics it is know that a portion of wave energy transfers to higher harmonics when a wave train propagates over a submerged structure grue 1992 brossard et al 2009 thus periodic signals recorded at gauge w 2 in fig 18 were expanded into fourier series and the height of each order transmitted wave h t n where n being a positive integer stands for the number of order was determined using the fourier coefficients the corresponding wave transmission coefficients are defined by 19 c t n h t n h n 1 2 fig 19 gives the comparison of c t 1 between the two submerged structures for specified d p d and h d c t 1 of the submerged step is almost independent of l λ whereas c t 1 of the shp fluctuates with l λ substantially owing to the different variation trends c t 1 of the plate can be smaller than that of the step when c t 1 curve of the plate falls into a valley while an opposite relation appears when c t 1 curve of the plate climbs to a peak in engineering practice an optimal ratio l λ can be obtained by adjusting the length of structure according to the known wave period thus in regular wave field a shp is likely to have a minimum c t 1 then a submerged step on the other hand since c t 1 of the shp has a larger variation range in a random wave field the wave attenuation performance of the submerged step is more stable if further considering the economic and environmental factors the shp type breakwater should be more recommended fig 20 compares c t 2 of the two submerged structures in general c t 2 of the shp is larger than or equal to that of the submerged step this is because the interaction between the shallow water wave above the plate and the trailing vortex is more violent and as brossard and chagdali 2001 indicated that this interaction contributed to higher order waves generation the reason why this interaction is more violent for a shp may be twofold first the sharp edges of the plate favor the development of trailing vortex second the u turn flow surround the trailing end of the plate yu 2002 lifts the trailing vortex toward the free surface intermittently by comparing of figs 19 and 20 it is found that c t 2 is smaller than c t 1 for both structures it is further aware that a higher order wave corresponds to a lower frequency thus the 2nd order transmitted wave accounts for much less proportion of the transmitted wave energy than the 1st order one and only formula of the 1st order wave transmission coefficient is given in subsection 5 1 4 3 flow dynamics as an example fig 21 compares the pressure and velocity fields near the submerged plate and step under h d 0 25 l λ 0 4 and d p d 0 15 the vorticity of each fluid particle is defined as the curl of the local velocity field monaghan 1992 20 ω i u i j m j ρ i u i u j i w i j according to the above equation a clockwise resp anticlockwise circulation corresponds to a negative resp positive value of vorticity from fig 21 it can be seen that there is little difference in the wave evolution over the two submerged structures however the trailing vortices behind the two submerged structures and their interactions with shallow water waves are different on the downstream of the shp two adjacent and clockwise vortices are formed at t 8 35t then they merge to form a bigger vortex at t 8 60t that collides with the water flow plunging off the plate this collision favors the development of higher order wave and on the other hand pushes the trailing vortex away from the plate lots of energy is dissipated with the gradual decomposition of the vortex behind the submerged step two clockwise vortices of similar intensity and length scale are identified because they are far apart from each other the inter attraction fails to pull them together in this way only the vortex closer to the step interacts with the shallow water wave yielding a smaller c t 2 of the submerged step as for the velocity field beneath the plate a uniform and time varying water flow is observed at t 8 35t and 9 10t the water flow is parallel and opposite to the wave direction while this reverse flow almost disappears at t 8 60t and 8 85t the net energy transport within the entire wave period is upstream which should be partly responsible for the smaller c t 1 of the shp fig 22 gives time histories of flow velocities at probes v 1 v 6 obviously the amplitude of the horizontal velocity v x is much larger than that of the vertical velocity v y and the six v x curves are of good consistency the horizontality and uniformity of the velocity field beneath the plate are therefore confirmed in addition fig 22 a shows that the velocity field beneath the shp reaches a steady state after about eight wave periods from the beginning of simulation the maximum dimensionless velocity of the reverse flow is 0 055 while the maximum positive velocity is only 0 015 so the flow beneath the plate can be characterized by pulsating reversed the mechanism of the pulsating flow beneath the shp has been roughly explained in the introduction here we further convince the reader by examining the time histories of dynamic pressure p d at sensors p 1 and p 2 and horizontal flow velocity v x at probe v 2 it is noted that flow velocity at any probe v 1 v 6 can be used for analysis because velocity field beneath the plate has been proved uniform five equidistant instants t 1 t 5 are selected in fig 23 at t 1 dynamic pressure at sensors p 1 and p 2 is nearly equal and a maximum reverse flow is observed beneath the plate from t 1 to t 2 pressure at sensor p 1 increases while that at sensor p 2 varies little thus a pressure drop from the leading to trailing ends of the plate is formed slowing down the velocity of the reverse flow from t 2 to t 3 the pressure difference between sensors p 1 and p 2 decreases but the direction of descent gradient remains unchanged consequently the reverse flow continues to weaken and it turns round when the time is close to t 3 from t 3 to t 4 the pressure at sensor p 1 is negative while that at sensor p 2 is close to zero subjecting to this pressure difference the fluid flow accelerates toward the upstream direction turning velocity direction from positive to negative this acceleration process continues until the instant t 5 in a word the pulsating flow beneath the shp is driven by the direction alternated pressure gradient beneath and across the plate 5 empirical formulas for shp 5 1 wave transmission coefficient from an engineering perspective it is meaningful to develop an empirical formula for estimating the wave transmission coefficient of the shp although siew and hurley 1977 has long derived an explicit formula based on the long wave approximation and potential flow theory there remains no available formula oriented to the viscous flow due to the fluctuation feature of c t 1 exhibited in fig 19 a polynomial relation between c t 1 and l λ is first established 21 c t 1 a 1 m 1 m b m l λ c m m 1 2 where a 1 b m and c m are unknown coefficients m is the number of expansion terms fig 19 also indicates that h d affects both the magnitude of c t 1 and the characteristic length of c t 1 fluctuation referring to the range of l λ within which c t 1 completes a cycle of increase and decrease more specifically c t 1 generally increases with h d when l λ 0 4 while for l λ 0 4 a larger h d corresponds to a smaller c t 1 c t 1 undergoes three trend varying intervals when h d 0 125 while for h d 0 125 the number of intervals decreases to two or one as for d p d it has little influence on the characteristic length of c t 1 fluctuation but it is overall positively correlated with c t 1 since parameters h d and d p d has no regular affection on c t 1 eq 21 is expanded to a combination of all the possibilities 22 c t 1 a 1 a 2 d p d a 3 a 4 h d a 5 m 1 m b 1 m l λ c 1 m c 2 m d p d c 3 m h d m 1 m b 2 m b 3 m d p d b 4 m b 5 m h d b 6 m l λ c 4 m m 1 2 where a a k 1 k 5 b b km 1 k 6 1 m m and c c km 1 k 4 1 m m are three sets of coefficients to be determined targeting at the symbols in fig 24 the levenberg marquardt lm algorithm moré 1978 is used to optimize the unknown coefficients in eq 22 the results are listed in table 3 as intuitively expected eq 22 becomes more and more accurate as m increases coefficient of determination r 2 is 0 752 0 847 and 0 868 respectively when m equals 1 2 and 3 thus m 3 seems to yield a convergent regression the regression results of c t 1 are compared with the sph results in fig 23 satisfactory agreement is observed 5 2 energy conversion efficiency the energy conversion efficiency of shp can be defined as 23 σ p flow p wave here p wave is the wave energy flux given by 24 p wave 1 16 ρ 0 g h 2 λ t 1 4 π d λ sinh 4 π d λ p flow is the power of water flow beneath the plate calculated by 25 p flow 1 t t t t d d d p 1 2 ρ 0 v x 3 d y d t fig 25 gives the variation of σ with relative length of the plate l λ for different submergence d p d and wave heights h d a first observation indicates that σ tends to infinitesimal as l λ increases while it increases sharply with the decrease of l λ thus the following foundation is built 26 σ d 1 d 2 l λ d 3 where d d k 1 k 3 is a set of unknown coefficients σ is in percentage a second observation of fig 25 shows that σ is positively correlated with h d as for d p d its alters the magnitude of σ but no clear correlation between them can be found then a correction term consists of h d and d p d is incorporated into eq 26 yielding 27 σ e 1 d p d e 2 h d e 3 d 1 d 2 l λ d 3 where e e k 1 k 3 is another set of unknown coefficients it is also noted that an h d related term should be added in eq 27 because σ converges to non zero constants as h d increases in addition a restrictive condition σ 0 when d p d 1 should be supplemented finally eq 27 becomes 28 σ e 1 d p d e 2 h d e 3 d 1 d 2 l λ d 3 f 1 h d f 2 1 d p d g 1 where f f k 1 k 2 and g g k k 1 are two sets of coefficients to be determined targeting at the symbols in fig 25 the lm algorithm is used again to determine the unknown coefficients in eq 28 the results are listed in table 4 and the regression results of σ by using eq 28 are plotted in fig 24 it is glad to see that the regression results can satisfactorily replicate the sph outcome r 2 reaches as high as 0 959 excluding the uncertain errors in the numerical calculation and data processing the fitting can be regarded as a success researchers paying attention on the wave energy utilization may disapprove of the value of shp because the maximum σ shown in fig 25 is less than 8 if further considering the energy loss in the processes of the secondary and tertiary energy conversions the actual efficiency of shp will be even less we acknowledge this fact but as has been emphasized in the introduction a shp should be principally valued as a breakwater then by combining the energy utilization functionality it could be more competitive than other single functional breakwaters or wecs in addition although the electrical power produced per unit width of the plate is low the shp breakwater is commonly designed to be continuous and wide a rough evaluation indicates that the ideal rated power generated by a 1 km wide shp under h 2 m can up to 1500 kw ideally it simultaneously meets the electricity demand for 500 peoples in moderately developed countries as a side note orer and ozdamar 2007 significantly increases σ by placing structures below the shp intuitively the wave attenuation performance of the hybrid structure could also be enhanced because it has larger areas projected in the wave direction taken together a more efficient wave energy breakwater can be invented but it needs to be further investigated 6 comprehensive performance of shp investigating the comprehensive performance of a shp is essentially to solve a mathematical programming problem let ψ be the score of the comprehensive performance it is related to the wave transmission coefficient c t 1 and energy conversion efficiency σ thus the objective function is defined as 29 ψ ω f c t 1 1 ω g 1 σ where f and g are the constraint functions ω is the weighting factor a smaller c t 1 corresponds to a better wave attenuation performance whereas a larger σ yields more wave energy conversion in this reason σ in the function g is expressed as the reciprocal form the mathematical programming problem then translates into finding the minimum value of ψ in addition since c t 1 and 1 σ vary in different ranges the feature scaling is performed to rescale their ranges to 0 1 the transformations are written as 30 f c t 1 c t 1 min c t 1 max c t 1 min c t 1 g 1 σ 1 σ min 1 σ max 1 σ min 1 σ in the above equation max c t 1 1 and min c t 1 0 are theoretical upper and lower bounds of c t 1 respectively min 1 σ 0 is the theoretical lower bound of 1 σ because σ min 0 invalidates 1 σ min the calculated minimum value σ min 0 33 is taken hence max 1 σ 300 apart from the above bounds of c t 1 and σ there are also constraints from the wave and structure parameters including l λ d p d and h d they are subject to 31 l λ 0 0 d p d 1 h d 0 125 0 250 0 375 it is noted that in eq 31 an equality constraint rather than a range is enforced to h d this is because h d is an external wave condition but not a plate parameter to be optimized the complex method of box 1965 was used to solve eq 29 subject to eqs 30 and 31 the calculated c t 1 and σ with respect to the minimum ψ is given in fig 26 to be expected c t 1 decreases monotonically with the increase of ω it confirms that a smaller c t 1 can be obtained if increasing the emphasis on the wave attenuation functionality of the shp in the cases of h d 0 125 0 250 and 0 375 c t 1 reaches as small as 0 27 0 21 and 0 06 respectively no doubt an optimized shp is an efficient breakwater on the other hand σ increases monotonously with the decrease of ω in other words more wave energy can indeed be converted if putting more emphasis on the energy utilization functionality in the cases of h d 0 125 0 250 and 0 375 the maximum σ are 2 3 4 5 and 7 8 respectively substituting h d as well as the optimal c t 1 and η of fig 26 into eqs 22 and 28 the optimal plate parameters l λ and d p d can be obtained their variations with ω are given in fig 27 it can be seen that d p d decreases and l λ increases with the increase of ω that is to say if putting more emphasis on the wave attenuation functionality the shp should have a shallower submergence and a larger length this is not difficult to understand because the shallower the submergence is the easier the wave breaking happens moreover it takes a longer duration for the breaking wave to pass over a longer plate resulting in more wave energy dissipated on the contrary if putting more attention on the energy attenuation utilization the shp should be shorter and deeply immersed the mechanism is twofold first a shorter and deeply immersed plate dissipates less wave energy second the water quantity beneath a deeply immersed plate is less allowing earlier formation of pulsating flow driven by the pressure difference beneath and across the plate in addition it is found that for a specified ω a larger h d leads to a larger l λ but yields a smaller d p d it means that the shp should be designed slightly longer and shallower in severe wave condition 7 conclusions and future work the open source code dualsphysics v4 0 https dual sphysics org was applied to calculate wave fixed shp interactions covering extensive ranges of wave conditions and plate parameters in 2d ren et al 2015 s modification was taken to enhance the stability of density field near the solid boundary the multi layer dbps method of he et al 2018b was inserted in the original code to implement the thin walled boundary of plate efficiently by regressing the calculation results polynomial and exponential formulas for regular wave transmission coefficient c t 1 and energy conversion efficiency η of the shp were derived their coefficients of determination r 2 reach 0 868 and 0 959 demonstrating their reliability then by trading off c t 1 and η the optimal configuration of the shp was investigated the results indicate that with l λ and d p d being in the ranges of 0 38 0 85 and 0 05 0 11 a shp has the minimum c t 1 between 0 06 and 0 27 depending on the incident wave height it can therefore be considered as an efficient breakwater on the other hand a properly designed shp holds a maximum η between 2 3 and 7 8 the corresponding ranges of l λ and d p d are 0 24 0 25 and 0 13 0 17 respectively although this efficiency looks unappealing a 1 km wide shp is expected to supply electricity to a maximum of 500 peoples in moderately developed countries it is aware that the present work still has some limitations on the one hand the regular wave assumption is somewhat idealized it would be better to study the wave shp interaction under random wave and wave current conditions required techniques have been proposed by altomare et al 2017 and he et al 2018a however for long time simulation wave surface unphysically lifts if continue using the shepard filter the δ sph method antuono et al 2012 will be a good choice to fix this problem on the other hand the shp is generally supported by piles and turbines are assumed to be mounted beneath the plate but their effects on wave and flow fields are ignored to consider their influence 3d simulations have to be performed it relies on an advanced multi resolution sph scheme

22721,in this paper wave induced motions and loads of a bow flare ship advancing in harsh irregular waves are investigated both numerically and experimentally a 3d time domain hydroelasticity theory that includes memory effect function considering froude krylov nonlinearity is developed to predict ship motions wave loads and slamming loads in long crested irregular waves in the hydroelasticity algorithm the wave memory effects and forward speed effects are addressed by retardation function method to improve the computing efficiency and provide opportunity for short term statistical analysis

numerical results and experimental results are systemically analyzed and compared using time series spectral and probability statistical analysis methods keywords ship hydroelasticity theory wave loads slamming and whipping irregular waves segmented model test 1 introduction predictions of wave induced ship global motions and load responses are of great importance in design and evaluation of structural strength of seagoing ships the hydroelastic effects such as springing and whipping responses of large flexible ships operating in harsh waves should also be considered in addition to global wave loads hirdaris and temarel 2009 the last five decades have witnessed a major leap in the development of potential flow theories for addressing ship seakeeping problems of both rigid and elastic ships without or with forward speed in regular waves hirdaris et al 2014 these methods include 2d strip theory tasai and takagi 1969 salvesen et al 1970 3d panel theory sen 2002 and 2 5d 2d plus time dependent high speed slender body theory faltinsen and zhao 1991 as a matter of fact the existing capability to accurately estimate ship responses in harsh irregular seaways still needs further development and investigation which remains a major concern for practical engineering applications chen 2017 in the classical random wave theory long crested irregular waves are the linear superposition of a number of regular waves with different amplitudes frequencies and phases the frequency domain spectral analysis method provides obvious advantage and convenience in the prediction of ship responses and statistics in random waves denis and pierson 1953 however the steep irregular waves are associated with strong nonlinearity and randomicity the classical linear frequency domain spectral method becomes invalid for the calculation of nonlinear wave loads acting on ships with large bow flare angle sailing in steep waves meyerhoff and schlachter 1980 used characteristic frequency e g spectral peak frequency in the calculation of hydrodynamic forces acting on ship in irregular waves song et al 1995 used approximate instantaneous wave frequency of the real time sub wave acting on the ship for the time domain calculation of hydrodynamic forces of ship in irregular waves however the so called characteristic frequency approaches cannot comprehensively include the effect of different wave frequencies on ship hydrodynamic responses therefore time domain nonlinear method should be adopted to address the hydrodynamic issues involving large amplitude motions and asymmetric loads in sagging and hogging of ship in steep irregular waves the time domain hydrodynamic methods can generally be classified into four categories sun and sun 2017 retardation function method kim et al 2007 rankine source method kim et al 2011 2014 transient free surface green function method chuang et al 2007 and time domain matching hybrid method duan and dai 1999 liu and papanikolaou 2011 the retardation function method also called indirect time domain method is faster and more stable to implement and provides good accuracy for practical engineering application at ship design stage especially for ship motions and loads prediction in irregular waves to date the wave memory effects have been considered to include the nonlinear effects of ship responses in regular waves due to free surface effects fonseca and guedes soares 2002 presented a nonlinear time domain strip method in which the linear radiation force is calculated by time convolution of memory functions while the nonlinear hydrostatic restoring force and froude krylov force are calculated exactly over the instantaneous wetted surface of hull mikami and shimada 2006 developed a time domain strip method with memory effect function considering body nonlinearity in hydrostatic force and froude krylov forces as well as hydrodynamic forces rajendran et al 2016 developed a time domain strip theory with fully body nonlinearity of hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads to predict extreme motions and loads on a cruise ship tang et al 2013 compared the retardation functions obtained by direct time domain method and frequency domain transformation method and investigated the forward speed effects on the retardation function qiu et al 2001 calculated the memory functions by direct time domain solution scheme instead of fourier transformation of radiation forces in frequency domain the existing retardation function methods in the literature works are mainly focus on addressing rigid body seakeeping issues in this study the wave memory effect for radiation force calculation is extended to 3d hydroelasticity theory of irregular wave case the retardation function is usually estimated by fourier transformation of the damping coefficient however due to the limitation of potential flow theory and substantial computation time the damping coefficients at different high frequencies are difficult to be comprehensively obtained bao and kinoshita 1992 used a perturbation method to obtain asymptotic solution of radiation velocity potential and then the damping coefficients at high frequency were estimated for the sake of simplification the fourier transformation is usually dealt with by integrating the damping coefficient in a finite interval and the truncated error is ignored however xiao and wang 2004 stressed that the high frequency components have an obvious influence on the overall result therefore accurate estimation of damping coefficient at high frequency range is important for the calculation of radiation force a semi analytical method is presented in this study to estimate the damping coefficients at high frequency range for subsequent calculation of time retardation function segmented model tests are widely adopted for the measurement of ship hydroelastic motions and loads responses jiao et al 2017 2018a marón and kapsenberg 2014 designed a segmented ship model equipped with an open u shape backbone for hydroelastic measurement in towing tank wang and guedes soares 2016 analyzed the bow slamming loads on a chemical tanker in irregular waves by tank model measurement and numerical calculation jiao and ren 2016 conducted segmented model tank tests for the investigation of bow flare slamming and hydroelastic vibrations of a ship in severe irregular waves lee et al 2012 investigated the springing and whipping responses of a containership by model tests and nonlinear hydroelastic analyses although many published papers experimentally investigate ship nonlinear responses in moderate and extreme irregular sea states experimental studies that focus on ship responses in 3d realistic extreme sea waves are relatively scarce in the recent years jiao et al 2016a 2018b developed and conducted large scale model tests for ship seakeeping performance and hydroelastic responses in realistic sea conditions which helps get real and accurate motions and wave loads results for ship in 3d short crested waves the time domain statistical analysis of large scale model sea trial data has not been reported yet in this study the large scale model sea trial data are analyzed and compared with small scale model tank measurement results to better understand ship responses in short crested irregular waves this paper aims at presenting a comprehensive study on the motions and bending moments on a large bow flare ship induced by harsh irregular waves a 3d time domain hydroelasticity theory considering froude krylov nonlinearity is developed to predict ship motions and loads in steep long crested irregular waves to fully take into account the effects of different frequencies of irregular waves on ship hydrodynamic responses the convolution method for wave exciting forces calculation is extended to the 3d hydroelasticity theory in addition segmented model measurements including both small scale model towing tank tests and large scale model sea trials were conducted to experimentally investigate the motions and loads of the ship sailing in both long and short crested irregular waves and compare with the numerical results the main novelty of this paper is the provided technical approaches and data analyses for evaluation of ship hydroelastic responses in severe irregular waves 2 hydroelasticity theory of ship in irregular waves the 3d time domain nonlinear hydroelasticity theory in regular waves is extended to predict ship motions and loads in long crested irregular waves the main nonlinear factor considered in this study is twofold i instantaneous body surface condition of froude krylov force and restoring force due to large amplitude motions of ship in steep waves ii local impact loads including bow flare slamming and green water loads the indirect time domain hydroelasticity algorithm is based on the frequency domain transformation principle which means that the radiation and diffraction forces are calculated by frequency domain green function method on the static wetted position at each time step while the ship motion governing equation is solved in time domain 2 1 solution of fluid velocity potential in frequency domain to model the ship seakeeping problem with a steady forward speed u three right hand coordinate systems are introduced i a space fixed system o xyz with its origin o at undisturbed free surface ii a plane movement system o xyz is parallel to the space fixed system and its origin o is fixed on ship at the constant height of the free surface and iii a body fixed system g x b y b z b is fixed on the ship and its origin g coincides with center of gravity cog of hull all the time the boundary conditions of fluid domain for the fluid flexible structure interaction ffsi problem are plotted in fig 1 where ω s b s f s h and s denotes the fluid domain wetted body surface condition free surface condition bottom condition and infinity radiation condition respectively in the potential flow theory the fluid is assumed to be ideal i e incompressible inviscid continuous and irrotational thus the fluid velocity vector can be expressed as the gradient of a velocity potential 1 v φ x y z t the total velocity potential can be decomposed into the following format 2 φ x y z t u x ϕ s x y z re ζ a ϕ

potential ϕ 0 x y z and ϕ d x y z denotes incident and diffraction potential corresponding to unit wave amplitude respectively ϕ r x y z denotes radiation potential corresponding to unit motion amplitude for r 1 6 the motions are rigid body six degree of freedom dof motion while for r 7 m the motions are structural elastic deformation the incident wave potential ϕ 0 is fully determined by the incident wave field which is easy to obtain for infinite water depth and finite water depth h conditions the incident wave potentials are respectively expressed as 3 ϕ 0 x y z i g ω e k z i k x

displacement vector of body surface caused by the rth order motion or deformation the solution of the above boundary value problem bvp for the unknown velocity potentials is formulated by 3d frequency domain free surface green function method the so called hess smith panel element method is used to solve the distributed source strength 2 2 time domain hydroelastic motion governing equation the time domain nonlinear hydroelastic motion governing equation of hull in irregular waves which takes the wave memory effects of radiation force into account is expressed as follows 6 a a p t b b p t t k τ p

generalized infinite frequency added mass damping coefficient and stiffness matrices due to forward speed effects respectively p t is the m dimensional mode principal coordinate column matrix k τ denotes m m dimensional time retardation function matrix τ denotes time interval f i t f s t f d t f slam t and f gw t are m dimensional generalized incident wave froude krylov force hydrostatic restoring force diffraction wave force slamming loads and green water loads column matrices respectively it is noted that the linearized radiation force is included in the left hand side of eq 6 a weakly nonlinear also called froude krylov nonlinear method is used to calculate the hydrostatic and hydrodynamic forces as a compromise between computational efficiency and accuracy requirement the froude krylov force and restoring force are calculated on the instantaneous wetted body surface and the diffraction and radiation forces are calculated on the mean wetted body surface in calm water within certain approximations since the incident wave potentials are easily obtained without solving the green function the nonlinear froude krylov method will not result in any significant computational burden the calculation of fluid force terms are described in detail in section 2 3 after determination of restoring force wave forces and impact loads the hydroelastic differential equation of eq 6 can be solved by an improved half time step fourth order runge kutta method in time domain based on modal superposition principle the time domain results e g displacement w x t bending moment m x t and shearing force v x t at each cross section of ship in irregular waves can be obtained as follows 7 w x t r 1 m p r t w r x m x t r 1 m p r t m r x v x t r 1 m p r t v r x where w r x m r x and v r x is the rth principal mode of displacement bending moment and shearing force respectively 2 3 calculation of fluid forces the real time froude krylov force is calculated on the instantaneous wetted body surface of the elastic hull since the long crested irregular waves can be regarded as the linear superposition of a number of regular waves the froude krylov force of rth order component can be written as 8 f i r t ρ i 1 m ζ a i s b t n u r i ω i u x ϕ 0 i d s r 1 2 m where ζ ai ω i ϕ 0i are the wave amplitude frequency and incident potential of ith sub wave component respectively s b t denotes the instantaneous wetted body surface of the elastic hull in irregular waves the hydrostatic restoring force of rth order component acting on the elastic hull surface in irregular waves is calculated by direct integrating the pressure over the instantaneous wetted hull surface of the elastic hull 9 f s r t ρ g k 1 m p k t s b t n u r w k d s l f g x w r d x r 1 2 m where ρ denotes fluid density g denotes gravity acceleration f g x denotes longitudinal distribution of weight w k denotes the vertical displacement component of u k i e u k v k w k the diffraction and radiation forces are calculated on the mean wetted surface in calm water as in the linear case according to cummins 1962 the time domain wave forces of ship in irregular waves can be derived by convolution theory based on the frequency domain results thus the diffraction force can be written as 10 f d r t 0 t h d r t τ ζ τ d τ r 1 2 m where ζ t is the wave elevation of irregular waves h d r t is impulse response function which can be obtained by applying the fourier transformation using the frequency domain response function i e rao in regular waves 11 h d r t 1 π 0 h d r i ω e i ω t d ω r 1 2 m where h d r iω is the frequency response function induced by the harmonic diffraction wave force under unit amplitude the infinite frequency added mass damping coefficient and stiffness matrices are included in radiation force to consider the forward speed effects moreover the time retardation function and wave memory effect are included to take into account the contribution of different frequencies of irregular waves the radiation force is calculated on the mean wetted position 12 f r t a p t b p t c p t 0 t k τ p t τ d τ where the expression of a b and c can be found in ren et al 2018 and dai and duan 2008 and they are determined by hull geometry and speed the element k rk τ r k 1 2 m in the time retardation function matrix k τ can be obtained by applying the fourier transformation using the frequency domain damping coefficient b rk ω which will be described in detail in section 2 4 the momentum impact theory based von karman model where the water pile up is assumed to be zero is used to estimate the slamming loads when the vertical relative velocity exceeds a critical value 13 f s l a m x t d m x d z d w r e l x t d t 2 where m x is the sectional added mass in heave mode at infinite frequency w rel x t is vertical displacement of the hull relative to the wave surface elevation the vertical relative velocity of ship with respect to the wave surface can be obtained by the derivation the relative displacement 14 v x t w r e l x t r 1 m w r x p r t ζ x t z where w r x denotes the rth mode coordinate of ship surface under the plane movement system the overall slamming loads acting on the whole elastic hull are obtained by integrating the 2d sectional slamming force longitudinally 15 f s l a m r t l f s l a m x t w r x d x the green water loads are calculated based on the momentum theory buchner 1995 the vertical impact force due to the presence of green water is expressed as 16 f g w r x t m g w t w r x g cos p 5 w r t m g w where m gw is the mass of the water on deck then the overall green water loads acting on the whole elastic hull can be obtained by integrating the 2d sectional force longitudinally in a similar manner as eq 15 2 4 calculation of retardation function it is known that the time domain retardation function is derived by applying the fourier transformation using the frequency domain damping coefficient 17 k τ 2 π 0 b ω cos ω τ d ω it can be found that the damping coefficient from zero to infinite frequency should be known for the estimation of time retardation function however only limited hydrodynamic coefficients at finite number of frequency can be calculated due to the limitation of calculate time and cost a semi analytical method is presented hereunder to accurately estimate the time retardation function a critical frequency ω c is used to separate the whole frequency interval 0 into two intervals i e 0 ω c and ω c thus eq 17 can be re written as follows 18 k τ 2 π 0 ω c b ω cos ω τ d ω ω c b ω cos ω τ d ω for the calculation of the first term on the right hand side of eq 18 the trapezoid quadrature method can be used the interval 0 ω c is dispersed into finite sub intervals ω

and p 1 n b ω n 1 b ω n ω n 1 ω n the first term on the right hand side of eq 18 can be re expressed as 20 2 π 0 ω c b ω cos ω t d ω 2 π n 1 n p 0 n ω n ω n 1 cos ω t d ω p 1 n ω n ω n 1 ω cos ω t d ω for the calculation of the second term on the right hand side of eq 18 the following exponentially decay function is adopted to fit the damping coefficient that greater than the critical frequency considering the fact that the damping coefficient tends to zero at infinite frequency 21 b ω α exp β ω ω c where α and β are undetermined coefficients it is noted that β should be positive value so as to ensure that the eq 21 is decrement function the coefficients are determined according to the principle that b ω and its first order derivative are continuous at point ω c thus the coefficients can be obtained as follows 22 α b ω c 23 β 1 b ω c d b ω c d ω where the first order derivative db ω c dω can be estimated by finite differencing 3 numerical and experimental model setup a naval ship with pronounced flare bow is used for illustrative analysis in this study main dimensions of the ship and models are listed in table 1 the numerical calculations are carried out at full scale dimension a small scale model was made and corresponding laboratory tank tests were conducted to validate and compare with the numerical hydroelastic results to further investigate ship responses in realistic short crested sea waves large scale model sea trials were designed and conducted the numerical and experimental model setups are described as follows 3 1 numerical model setup to determine the modal characteristics of ship in vacuum the dry elastic mode in vertical bending mode was estimated by transfer matrix method tmm which treats the hull girder as a non uniform timoshenko beam the ship is numerically modeled using 20 segments for the mode calculation the longitudinal distributions of mass and second moment of inertia in vertical bending mode of full scale ship are shown in fig 2 in this study only the first three orders of vertical bending modes are considered to estimate ship hydroelastic responses in head waves the normalized vertical displacement of dry mode in the first three orders obtained by tmm is shown in fig 3 which is used as generalized coordinate in the subsequent hydroelastic response calculation natural frequencies of the numerical and experimental values are summarized in table 2 the target dry natural frequency is obtained by whole ship structure finite element analysis fea note that the model s natural frequencies that identified by impact hammer test are presented in ship scale for the convenience of comparison in the numerical model the structural damping matrix is assumed to be diagonal which is the linear combination of mass and stiffness matrix and the dimensionless damping coefficient in vertical bending mode is chosen as 0 05 the 3d hydrodynamic grid was generated by cubic spline function method zhang et al 2001 the whole ship and underwater wetted grid systems of the ship are shown in fig 4 a total of 2055 panels of the whole ship grid are used for nonlinear froude krylov force and hydrostatic restoring force calculation and slamming green water judgment a total of 1308 panels of the underwater wetted grid are used for solving the diffraction and radiation potentials the transient elastic whole hull grid for froude krylov force and restoring force calculation can be generated according to the principle mode superposition of distortion based on euler bernoulli beam theory example of the deformed grid corresponding to the first second and third order vertical modal shape is illustrated in fig 5 moreover it is necessary to identify the real time exact wetted hull grid under the instantaneous incident wave envelope for calculation of nonlinear froude krylov force and hydrostatic restoring force since the incident wave potential in eqs 3 and 4 satisfies the linearized free surface boundary condition on the instantaneous mean free surface the exact wetted hull under the incident wave surface should be mapped on the flat water plane the mapping is realized by setting the vertical coordinate of points on the real wave surface as zero and moving the vertices of panels vertically with a same displacement singh and sen 2007 in the numerical simulation the infinite depth of water is assumed to be in accordance with experimental schemes three conditions as listed in table 3 were selected for calculation the significant wave heights 15 m and 9 2 m are the extreme and design wave heights respectively the corresponding characteristic periods were determined to be the most probable value at each wave height according to the scatter diagram for the north atlantic sea states jiao et al 2018c the time series of irregular waves were simulated according to issc target spectrum the wave and ship response data in this paper are presented at full scale it is worth mentioning that only head wave conditions are involved and investigated in the numerical study while the numerical code has capacity of calculating ship hydroelastic responses at any wave headings 3 2 segmented model tank experimental setup a 1 50 geosim small scale segmented model was made of fiberglass reinforced plastics frp to allow the laboratory hydroelasticity experimental measurements as illustrated in fig 6 the model has seven segments and six cuts are provided at the 2nd 4th 6th 8th 10th and 12th stations a steel backbone beam of variable structural characteristics along the hull length is used to connect the segments and transfer loads to reproduce the effects of the deformation modes on the loads the backbone model has the same scaled flexible characteristics of the full scale ship in vertical bending mode a set of self propulsion system is installed at stern area to achieve the testing forward speed the ship model was tested in the towing tank of harbin engineering university heu the tank is 108 m long 7 m wide and 3 5 m deep the equipped computer controlled hydraulic driven wave generator is able to produce both regular waves and long crested irregular waves there is a wave absorbing beach opposite the wave maker at the other side of the tank a towing carriage run along the tank is used to act as the reference of speed and heading angle during model sailing view of the testing model and tank facilities is shown in fig 7 the sectional vertical bending moments vbm of model were measured by full bridge strain gauges placed on the backbone surfaces three accelerometers were mounted on deck of bow amidships and stern areas to measure the vertical accelerations see fig 6 a group of fifteen pressure sensors were mounted on the bow flare area the global motions were measured by an in house developed seakeeping apparatus which is installed on the towing carriage and connected with the model by its two heave sticks the scheme of model setup with the seakeeping apparatus is shown in fig 8 the experimental parameters at model scale are obtained by froude similitude law based on the testing schemes listed in table 3 during the experiments the sampled signals including ship motions accelerations sectional loads and impact pressure were recorded by a data collector each short term irregular wave testing condition was carried out to obtain at least 200 response samples to produce longer records which is realized by combining time series measured in several separate runs 3 3 large scale model sea trial setup a corresponding 1 25 large scale model was constructed according to the same prototype for the comparative investigations model setup and sensor arrangement of the large model are almost the same as the 1 50 small scale model the measurement of vertical acceleration sectional loads includes vbm and horizontal bending moment hbm and impact pressures are the same as these in the small scale model tank tests the motions and navigational information of the large scale model at sea were measured by a global position system inertial navigation system gps ins device view of the large scale model setup is shown in fig 9 the sea trials were carried out in coastal waves of bohai sea china the average water depth of testing area is over 20 m and the shoaling water effect can be ignored a mini size wave buoy of diameter 0 4 m was used to measure the vertical acceleration of coastal waves the model sailing speed and heading angle was controlled by radio submitted from another auxiliary yacht the sea waves ship navigational state ship motions sectional loads and bow flare impact pressure were measured and recorded during the sea trials for post voyage analysis the large scale testing model and recorded sea trial scene are shown in fig 10 4 validation of numerical algorithm by regular wave results due to the fact that the exact real time incident waves acting on the model were not measured during the tank tests thus the wave elevation of the irregular sea state for the numerical simulation is generated using random phases therefore a direct comparison of time series of motions and loads of ship in irregular waves between calculation and measurement would be impossible in this section the numerical algorithm is preliminarily validated by comparing with the experimental results in regular head waves for this purpose two typical testing conditions are selected for time series comparison wave heights h 4 m and 12 m wave length to ship length ratio λ l 0 8 and ship speed v 18 knots the comparative time series for motions and vbm amidships between calculation and measurement are shown in figs 11 and 12 respectively for heave motion positive and negative values present emergence and submergence of ship respectively for pitch motion positive and negative values present trim by bow and stern respectively for vbm positive and negative values present hogging and sagging respectively the low frequency lf wave loads and high frequency hf slamming loads are also separated from total vbm loads by fast fourier transform fft and inverse fft as seen from the comparison the results for regular head waves show fairly good agreement between calculation and measurement however slight deviation is observed mainly due to the fluctuation of experimental peaks to further validate the numerical results at different wave frequencies the motion and load raos for ship sailing in head wave conditions at forward speed 5 knots are compared between calculation and measurement the wave frequency in numerical simulation ranges from 0 02 rad s to 2 rad s with a step of 0 02 rad s the experimental wave frequency are selected at points λ l 0 4 0 6 0 8 0 9 1 0 1 1 1 2 1 5 2 0 and 2 5 the experimental incident wave height is set at 4 m to obtain the linear responses some high frequency loads caused by springing responses at specified frequency points are removed to obtain the linear load responses fig 13 shows the comparison of dimensionless raos for pitch heave and vbm amidships between calculation and measurement the heave motion is non dimensionalized with wave amplitude ζ a the pitch motion is non dimensionalized with product of wave number and wave amplitude kζ a the vbm is non dimensionalized with ρgζ a bl where ρ is the density of water g is the gravity acceleration b is the breadth of ship and l is the waterline length of ship to summarize it is clearly seen that the frequency domain results generally show good agreement between calculation and experiment 5 analysis of ship responses in long crested irregular waves the numerical simulation and experimental measurement results for ship sailing in long crested irregular waves are analyzed and compared in this section the experimental and numerical incident irregular waves are analyzed first then the experimental and numerical time series frequency spectra and statistics of ship vertical motions and loads are analyzed and compared 5 1 incident irregular waves the waves during tank experiments were measured by an in situ resistive wave probe which is fixed at approximately 10 m distance from the wave maker examples of the measured time series within full scale 1000 s under the two wave states see table 3 are shown in fig 14 as seen from the time series of wave surface elevation the experimental waves are associated with nonlinear behavior such as sharp crest and flat trough due to the large steepness however the time domain hydroelasticity theory uses the linear superposition principle to simulate the linear irregular waves the comparison of wave spectra between measurement and the issc target spectra is shown in fig 15 even though the agreement between the measurement and the issc spectra is good small discrepancy is observed in spectral peak value and frequency distribution due to the limitation of tank facility and uncertainty factors the statistical properties of the measured and simulated time series of irregular waves are listed in table 4 the numerical results are obtained using the simulated 1 h irregular wave data the experimental results are obtained using the combined time series by several measurements under equivalent sea state the mean value of the experimental waves is even though not zero negligibly small negative value and less than 0 5 of the significant wave height for all the three cases the variance of the waves represents the area under the wave energy spectrum the difference in the values of the standard deviation between the experimental and the numerical waves are 0 7 1 6 and 0 6 for the three cases respectively which indicates that the significant wave heights are in good accordance between experiment and simulation the skewness and kurtosis are measure parameters of the asymmetry of crest trough distribution and the deviation of wave surface elevation from gaussian distribution toffoli et al 2008 for a standard gaussian distribution the skewness and kurtosis are both zero the experimental waves have larger positive skewness value which reflects the sharper crest and shallower trough behavior of wave surface elevation the larger kurtosis value represents taller peak and longer tail in the probability distribution of the wave elevation compared with the gaussian distribution the kurtosis values of the experimental waves are negative which means that the waves with large amplitude are more frequently occurred to summarize the nonlinear properties mean skewness and kurtosis values of the experimental waves are all more obvious than the linear numerical results additionally probability of exceedance of wave crest and trough peaks of the experimental and the numerical waves are compared in fig 16 as is seen good agreement between measurement and simulation is found at the range of wave peaks lower than 4 m the peaks of crest and trough are almost symmetrically distributed for the linear numerical waves however the experimental wave crest peaks are larger than their trough peaks and this is more pronounced for the extreme sea state case 1 the tail of the numerical distribution is slightly asymmetric with larger crests but the data is scattered therefore longer simulation may better reveal the real nature of the wave peak distribution at the tail 5 2 time series and statistics of ship vertical motions and loads the experimental and numerical time series of ship motions and loads are presented in this section then the statistical values for the experimental and numerical time series are compared and analyzed 5 2 1 time series of experimental results the full scale time series of heave at cog of ship pitch and vbms at stations 2 and 10 within 1000 s for testing case 2 h 1 3 9 2 m tz 11 4 s v 18 knots by tank model measurement are shown in fig 17 as is seen the time series of heave and pitch are stable and smooth all the time the local slamming loads have little effects on heave and pitch motions due to the large global inertia force and moment of hull the ship undergoes severe slamming events and the whipping response is however clearly visible in the total vbm the total vbm is also filtered into low frequency and high frequency components by fourier filtering with a cut off frequency of 0 3 hz the amplitudes of whipping vbm are even much larger than the wave frequency vbm especially at bow area it should be noted that the severe slamming event may result in local structure failure or damage of bow 5 2 2 time series of numerical results examples of the simulated time series of heave at cog of ship pitch and vbms at stations 2 and 10 within 1000 s for case 2 h 1 3 9 2 m tz 11 4 s v 18 knots are shown in fig 18 as is seen the calculation results show similar trends and magnitudes as the experimental results in fig 17 it is noted that the curves will not be the same since the exact surface of incident waves acting on model was not measured from the tests the wave surface of the irregular waves is however generated using random phase for the numerical simulation similar with the experimental results the simulated heave motion is almost in the same phase with the vbm while opposite the phase of pitch the simulated whipping loads also show the same characteristics as the experimental results which turns out that the impact momentum theory are reliable in the estimation of slamming and green water loads even though the momentum impact theory does not consider the water pile up and water exit effects during the slamming process 5 2 3 comparison of statistical results of time series the statistics of the experimental and numerical time series of heave pitch and vbms at station 2 and 10 in the three conditions are listed in table 5 the duration of the available model response experimental data is 4300 s 2400 s and 2600 s for cases 1 2 and 3 respectively the duration of the numerical data is 3600 s for all of the three cases the experimental heave motion has positive mean value of 0 122 m at 5 knots due to the dynamic effects of the severe incoming waves fonseca and guedes soares 2004 however the ship experienced obvious sinkage with the increasing of froude number the mean values of numerical heave motion are slightly positive for all of the three cases and have no obvious regularity the probable reason may be that the numerical method neglects the effect of steady flow on the unsteady flow the standard deviation of heave motion show good agreement between experimental and numerical results with difference less than 3 21 the skewness values of heave are negligible small for both experimental and numerical results which indicates that the crest and trough peaks are almost symmetrically distributed the kurtosis values of heave lie in a narrow range between 0 292 and 0 484 and show good agreement between experimental and numerical results both experimental and numerical pitch motions have small negative mean values indicates trim by stern and show good agreement between each other the standard deviation of pitch show good agreement between experimental and numerical results with difference less than 1 72 the skewness values of pitch are small and show similar trends between experimental and numerical results apart from case 1 probably due to the nonlinearity of severe experimental waves although both the experimental and numerical kurtosis values of pitch are small negative values the experimental values are more notable than numerical values and the difference increases with increasing ship speed the experimental vbms have considerable negative mean values which is partly caused by the steady moment due to the increase in pressure at the bow and stern compared to the middle body when ship sailing in still water with the increasing of sea severity or ship speed the mean sagging value increases due to the dynamic effects of the waves note that the calm water vbm is neither considered in the experimental nor the numerical results although the mean values of calculated vbm are negative and also show the same trend with increase of sea severity or ship speed they are always a little smaller than the experimental values since the numerical method does not include any steady waves in the calculation rajendran et al 2016 obtained similar results on analysis of an ultra large containership in high seas by using 2d nonlinear strip theory the largest difference in the values of the standard deviation between experimental and numerical vbm is 14 58 and 5 08 for vbm at bow and amidships respectively the experimental skewness and kurtosis values of vbm at bow are considerably deviation from the gaussian distribution while the numerical skewness and kurtosis values of vbm at bow have less nonlinearity compared with experimental results thus big difference in the kurtosis value of vbm at bow between experiment and numerical values can be found this is mainly due to the fact that the experimental vbm at bow are associated with strongly nonlinear slamming behavior and highly asymmetry in sagging and hogging loads however the numerical algorithm which is based on linear modal superposition principle cannot fully simulate the strongly nonlinear slamming loads near the free end positions this can be understood by comparing figs 17 and 18 the vbm at amidships are associated with less nonlinearity and their skewness and kurtosis values show good agreement between experimental and numerical results 5 3 frequency spectral analysis of ship motions and loads in this section the experimental and numerical frequency spectra of ship motions and loads are analyzed and compared 5 3 1 comparison of response spectra of motions the experimental and numerical frequency spectra that obtained by applying fourier transformation of the time series in the three testing conditions are presented in figs 19 and 20 for heave and pitch motions respectively in these figures the numerical power spectral density psd of motions is presented in negative in order to compare with the experimental results as is seen the heave and pitch psd distributes in a narrow frequency range of 0 03 0 15 hz generally the psd and its frequency distribution show good agreement between experimental and numerical results however the frequency distribution of the experiment results mainly concentrates on several discrete frequency points while the numerical results reveal relatively continuous distribution over the frequency range the peak frequency increases with increasing speed from 5 knots to 24 knots for both the experimental and numerical results which can be explained by the increase of wave encounter frequency for both heave and pitch motions the peak of psd at 5 knots is the largest due to severe sea state while the second largest is at 24 knots due to high speed which reveals the same tendency as the values of variance in table 5 5 3 2 comparison of response spectra of vbm the experimental frequency spectra of vbm at the six cut the 2nd 4th 6th 8th 10th and 12th stations in the three testing conditions are shown in figs 21 and 22 where the response psd at 24 knots is presented in negative so as to compare with the results at 18 knots the high frequency vibrations in the first three orders can be clearly identified from the spectra at station 2 and they are in good agreement with the natural frequencies obtained by hammer test i e 2 node frequency 0 509 hz 3 node frequency 1 292 hz and 4 node frequency 1 875 hz the 3 node vibration components cannot be clearly observed at stations 10 and 12 due to the fact that these locations are at or near the node of 3 node vibration the peak frequencies of slamming loads corresponding to 2 node and 3 node vibrations in 5 knots condition case 1 are slightly lower than those in 18 or 24 knots conditions cases 2 and 3 one of the probable reasons may be the nonlinear structural damping ratio in severe waves the 2 node and 3 node peak frequencies are very close for the results at 18 knots and 24 knots even though the high speed slightly increases the encounter frequency of wave frequency loads moreover both the wave frequency and slamming load components at 24 knots are larger than those at 18 knots especially at bow area stations the comparisons of experimental and numerical frequency spectra of vbm at bow station 2 and amidships station 10 in the three conditions are shown in fig 23 the numerical psd of vbm is presented in negative in order to compare with the experimental results the experimental and numerical results generally show good agreement in both frequency and amplitude as seen from fig 23 a the first three orders of natural frequency estimated by tmm show good agreement with the experimental values moreover higher order vibrations caused by springing responses can be found in the numerical results in fig 23 b c e and f for example the third and fourth harmonious of 2 node natural frequency 0 509 hz are observed around 1 5 hz and 2 0 hz the numerical springing responses are most pronounced at speed 24 knots since the 2 node natural frequency is near the fourth harmonics of wave encounter peak frequency 0 125 hz a large concentrated peak is observed at approximately 1 733 hz which is near by the 4 node natural frequency however the springing effects are not observed in the experimental results probably due to the nonlinear structural damping ratio of the physical model another probable reason may be the fluctuation of forward speed since the model s surge motion is released during measurement while the surge is zero in the numerical model 5 4 probability distribution of ship motions and loads the probability distribution of crest and trough peaks for experimental and numerical ship motions and loads are analyzed and compared in this section 5 4 1 comparison of probability of exceedance of motions figs 24 and 25 respectively show the comparison of probability of exceedance of heave and pitch peaks between experiment and calculation results the results are derived using the raw experimental time series without removing the mean value as is seen the experimental and numerical peaks of heave motion are generally symmetric at the relatively low heave peak range in case 2 however the tail of the distribution is asymmetric and the asymmetry increases as the sea severity or ship speed increases the experimental crest peaks at the tail of distribution are larger than the corresponding trough peaks in the low speed condition case 1 due to severe waves however opposite phenomenon is found in cases 2 and 3 mainly due to the mean sinkage and dynamic effects of ship caused by high speed the numerical crest peaks are larger than the corresponding trough peaks in all of the three cases the reason is that the numerical method neglects the effect of steady flow and the numerical mean sinkage is very small it can be concluded that the difference between experimental and numerical heave peaks is mainly caused by the difference of mean values the pitch motion results show similar distribution as the heave motion results the experimental and numerical pitch peaks are symmetric distribution at the range of pitch peaks lower than 2 deg asymmetry of pitch peaks are found at the tail of distributions for both experimental and numerical results in all the three cases the numerical method is able to reflect the nonlinearity and follow similar trend in the distribution of the pitch peaks however the numerical method overestimates the pitch peak values at the tail of distribution compared with the experimental values which is probably due to the following reasons i the incident wave profile used in the numerical simulation is linear ii only nonlinearity in the froude krylov and hydrostatic forces are considered while the radiation and diffraction forces are remained as linear iii the radiated and distorted wave field will generate a different wave profile along the body surface which is not considered in the simulation the trough peaks of pitch at the tail of distribution are generally larger than the corresponding crest peaks for both experimental and numerical results in cases 2 and 3 however the large pitch crests at the tail of distribution are higher than the corresponding trough values as found from the experimental results in case 1 due to the nonlinear effects of harsh experimental waves 5 4 2 comparison of probability distribution of vbm figs 26 and 27 respectively show the probability of exceedance of vbm at bow and amidships in the three conditions the low frequency wave induced loads which are obtained through a low pass filter with a cut off frequency of 0 3 hz are also presented and compared with the total vbm distribution in each of the figure it is noted that the hogging and sagging peaks of both low frequency and total vbms are counted in each zero up crossing period of the low frequency vbm time series so the number of peaks are identical between low frequency and total vbm pronounced asymmetry in the distribution of the vbm peaks are observed in both the experimental and numerical results in all of the three cases the highly asymmetric distributions of vbm peaks are mainly caused by the notable negative mean value and high frequency whipping loads the trends and magnitudes of the experimental and numerical results are generally in good agreement apart from that the numerical method evidently underestimates the total sagging vbm at bow in addition the asymmetric distributions of hogging and sagging peaks for both total vbm and low frequency vbm are more obvious in the experimental results than the numerical results due to the fact that some nonlinear factors are ignored in the numerical code for both the experimental and numerical results the ship experiences the largest total sagging vbm at bow in case 3 h 1 3 9 2 m rather than in case 1 h 1 3 15 m due to the severe slamming loads caused by higher speed of the ship in case 3 the largest total sagging vbm amidships occurred in case 1 for both the experimental and numerical results due to the severe waves the largest total sagging vbm at bow are very close between the experimental and numerical values while the numerical method slightly overestimates the largest total sagging vbm amidships in cases 1 and 3 by 11 74 and 20 62 respectively one of the probable reason behind the overestimation of the largest vbm in case 3 is that the experimental duration 2600 s is shorter than the numerical duration 3600 s the statistical scattergrams of low frequency wave induced vbm with respect to the corresponding total vbm in each of zero up crossing wave frequency period are shown in figs 28 and 29 for loads at bow and amidships respectively it is noted that the low frequency sagging vbm are presented in negative values while the total sagging vbm are presented in positive for the convenience of comparison the results generally show good agreement between measurement and calculation however the experimental sagging loads at bow in case 1 reveal strong correlation between total vbm and low frequency vbm while the numerical sagging vbm points at bow in case 1 are scattered it is observed that the slamming loads largely contribute the total sagging vbm compared with total hogging vbm especially for the sectional loads at bow area the large sagging vbm usually occurred in cases 1 and 3 due to the high sea state or high speed the ship forward speed significantly increases the extreme total vbm even under the same wave state which can be found by comparing the results in cases 2 and 3 at speeds 18 knots and 24 knots for both experimental and numerical results 6 analysis of ship hydroelastic responses in realistic sea waves investigation of ship motions and loads in realistic sea waves is highly interesting and insightful in order to carry out such analysis large scale model sea trials were conducted in this section the measured large scale model s motions and loads at sea are analyzed and compared with the tank experimental results under the equivalent sea state level 6 the sea waves during the large scale model tests were measured by an in situ accelerometer based wave buoy see fig 10 a jiao et al 2016b the dominant wave propagation direction was judged by visual observation and referring wind direction the measured significant wave height and mean period are 0 266 m and 1 932 s respectively the sea waves in short term can be approximately regarded as ergodic and stationary random during the whole measurement procedure the selected testing conditions at full scale for comparison between large and small scale model testing results are summarized in table 6 since the surface elevation of sea wave was not measured directly the nonlinearity of sea waves is not analyzed in this study 6 1 time series and frequency spectra of ship responses in sea waves the measured time series of large scale model s motions and loads during the one day s whole sea trial procedure can be found in authors previous work jiao et al 2016b this study mainly focuses on comparing large scale model s responses against small scale model tank measurement results the pitch at cog vbm and hbm at stations 2 and 10 by large scale model measurement are analyzed the heave motion is not included since the heave was not directly measured during the sea trial the time series of pitch vbms and hbms by large scale model measurement within full scale 5000 s for case 4 are illustrated in fig 30 it should be mentioned that the baseline was corrected by 0 02 hz high pass filtering and the mean value was removed to address the zero drift of the signals at sea as is seen the signals are associated with stronger nonlinearity and randomicity compared with the numerical simulation and tank experimental results moreover it is found that the hbm has similar trends and magnitudes as the vbm when ship sailing in bow oblique short crested sea waves an extreme event occurred at approximately 1400 s where the largest instantaneous vbm and hbm appear due to severe wave impact to further investigate the extreme load responses the local views of vbm and hbm time series within 500 s around the extreme event are presented in figs 31 and 32 respectively as is seen the transient whipping loads largely contribute to the total vbm or hbm at bow area the largest instantaneous hbm is even much higher than the vbm at bow section thus special attentions should also be paid to horizontal strength in addition to vertical strength when ship sailing in oblique short crested waves the high frequency loads decay very quickly after the occurrence of slamming due to the structural damping moreover the slamming and green water phenomena recorded by onboard video camera corresponding to this severe slamming event are shown in fig 33 the corresponding frequency spectra of vbm and hbm by large scale model measurement are shown in fig 34 as is seen the first two orders of natural frequency can be clearly identified from the spectral curves at station 2 for both vbm and hbm it is noted that the 2 node natural frequency in vertical bending mode by large scale model test 0 472 hz is slightly 7 27 lower than the small scale model testing result 0 509 hz which is mainly caused by the design error and scale effects however the 3 node natural frequency in vertical bending mode by large scale model test 1 305 hz is in fairly good agreement with the small scale model result 1 292 hz moreover the spectral density by large scale model test is in a broader distribution compared with the numerical and tank experimental results given in figs 21 23 the reason is twofold i the duration of large scale model s time series data is longer than that of tank model test and ii the wind generated realistic short crest sea waves are associated with broader frequency distribution than the artificially generated pseudo random unidirectional tank waves 6 2 comparison of statistics and probability distribution of ship motions and loads the statistical parameters of pitch and vbm by different model measurements in the equivalent sea state level 6 are summarized in table 7 note that the statistics of both the large and small scale model testing results are derived after the zero mean processing of raw time series for the sake of consistency the large scale model s standard deviations of pitch and vbms at stations 2 and 10 in head wave are respectively 3 35 17 45 and 17 72 larger than in starboard bow wave condition however although the sea state level ship speed and wave heading are the same for cases 5 and 6 the large scale model s standard deviations of pitch and vbms at stations 2 and 10 are respectively 29 12 23 48 and 24 73 lower than the small scale model results this indicates that the long crested waves would highly overestimate the statistical standard deviation of ship motions and loads even though sailing in a same sea state level the skewness and kurtosis of pitch motion are generally small apart from that the kurtosis of large scale model in head wave is 0 940 the skewness and kurtosis of large scale model s vbms are obviously deviation from the gaussian distribution due to the strong nonlinearity of ship responses in realistic sea waves especially for the vbm statistical results at bow where the kurtosis is 12 111 when sailing in head waves the comparisons of probability of exceedance for peaks of pitch and vbm between large and small scale model testing results are presented in figs 35 and 36 respectively as is seen the peaks of crest and trough of pitch motion are symmetrically distributed and only a slight asymmetry is observed at the tail of the distribution for all the three cases the largest pitch peaks show similar magnitude between large and small model in head wave conditions by comparing case 5 with 6 however the corresponding occurrence probability is lower for large scale model test the probability of exceedance of large scale model s pitch at low pitch peak value is generally much smaller than the small scale model result which explains the reason that the standard deviation of large scale model s pitch is 29 12 lower than small scale model result similar phenomenon can be also found by comparing the vbm results in cases 5 and 6 although the standard deviations of vbm in realistic sea waves are approximately 24 lower than those in tank waves the extreme vbm values in realistic sea waves are however much larger as found from the tail of vbm distribution especially at station 2 in the head wave case this means that rarely occurring events extreme loads are more frequently occurred in realistic sea waves than in tank waves thus the large scale model sea trial is a potential tool in the reproduction and investigation of rarely occurring events and nonlinear motions and loads of full scale ship sailing in seaways 7 conclusions in this study the vertical motion and load responses of a bow flare ship sailing in irregular waves are analyzed and compared both numerically and experimentally a 3d time domain hydroelasticity theory that includes the memory effect function considering froude krylov nonlinearity is developed for the prediction of hydroelastic responses of the ship in harsh waves small scale model tank tests and large scale model sea trial were successfully carried out to comprehensively understand ship hydroelastic responses in different wave fields based on the numerical and experimental study on ship response in harsh irregular waves the following conclusions are drawn 1 by comparing the results for ship sailing in regular waves the numerical ship vertical motions and vbm coincide well with experimental results for both time series and frequency domain rao results the high frequency impact loads amidships due to slamming and green water are also well estimated by the von karman momentum impact theory even though the water pile up and water exit effects during the slamming process are ignored 2 the retardation function based 3d time domain hydrodynamic method is reliable and demonstrated high efficiency in the calculation of ship hydroelastic responses in long crested irregular waves in general the numerical results in long crested irregular waves are well validated by tank model testing results the springing responses can be better reproduced in the numerical simulation rather than experiments since the model s surge motion is restrained in the numerical model and thus ship forward speed is steady 3 the numerical method overestimates the extreme pitch peak values compared with the tank experimental values which is probably due to the fact that the body surface nonlinearity is not considered in the calculation of radiation and diffraction forces in addition the asymmetric distributions of hogging and sagging peaks for vbm especially at bow are more obvious in the tank experimental results than the numerical results the numerical method evidently underestimates the total sagging vbm at bow which results in big difference in the kurtosis value of vbm at bow between experiment and numerical values 4 as a supplement to the traditional tank test the large scale model sea trial is a potential tool in the reproduction of nonlinear motions and loads acting on full scale ship operating in realistic sea waves although the statistical standard deviations of motion and loads in realistic sea waves are much lower than those in equivalent long crested wave state the extreme vbm values in realistic sea waves are much larger this indicates that some rarely occurring events e g extreme loads can be frequently suffered and observed in realistic sea waves than in artificially generated tank waves

22721,in this paper wave induced motions and loads of a bow flare ship advancing in harsh irregular waves are investigated both numerically and experimentally a 3d time domain hydroelasticity theory that includes memory effect function considering froude krylov nonlinearity is developed to predict ship motions wave loads and slamming loads in long crested irregular waves in the hydroelasticity algorithm the wave memory effects and forward speed effects are addressed by retardation function method to improve the computing efficiency and provide opportunity for short term statistical analysis of ship responses in irregular waves in addition segmented model tank tests are conducted to experimentally investigate the motions and loads of ship sailing in long crested irregular waves and also validate the numerical results to further understand the nonlinear wave loads behavior of ship in short crested waves large scale segmented model sea trials are performed in realistic sea waves the numerical results and experimental results are systemically analyzed and compared using time series spectral and probability statistical analysis methods keywords ship hydroelasticity theory wave loads slamming and whipping irregular waves segmented model test 1 introduction predictions of wave induced ship global motions and load responses are of great importance in design and evaluation of structural strength of seagoing ships the hydroelastic effects such as springing and whipping responses of large flexible ships operating in harsh waves should also be considered in addition to global wave loads hirdaris and temarel 2009 the last five decades have witnessed a major leap in the development of potential flow theories for addressing ship seakeeping problems of both rigid and elastic ships without or with forward speed in regular waves hirdaris et al 2014 these methods include 2d strip theory tasai and takagi 1969 salvesen et al 1970 3d panel theory sen 2002 and 2 5d 2d plus time dependent high speed slender body theory faltinsen and zhao 1991 as a matter of fact the existing capability to accurately estimate ship responses in harsh irregular seaways still needs further development and investigation which remains a major concern for practical engineering applications chen 2017 in the classical random wave theory long crested irregular waves are the linear superposition of a number of regular waves with different amplitudes frequencies and phases the frequency domain spectral analysis method provides obvious advantage and convenience in the prediction of ship responses and statistics in random waves denis and pierson 1953 however the steep irregular waves are associated with strong nonlinearity and randomicity the classical linear frequency domain spectral method becomes invalid for the calculation of nonlinear wave loads acting on ships with large bow flare angle sailing in steep waves meyerhoff and schlachter 1980 used characteristic frequency e g spectral peak frequency in the calculation of hydrodynamic forces acting on ship in irregular waves song et al 1995 used approximate instantaneous wave frequency of the real time sub wave acting on the ship for the time domain calculation of hydrodynamic forces of ship in irregular waves however the so called characteristic frequency approaches cannot comprehensively include the effect of different wave frequencies on ship hydrodynamic responses therefore time domain nonlinear method should be adopted to address the hydrodynamic issues involving large amplitude motions and asymmetric loads in sagging and hogging of ship in steep irregular waves the time domain hydrodynamic methods can generally be classified into four categories sun and sun 2017 retardation function method kim et al 2007 rankine source method kim et al 2011 2014 transient free surface green function method chuang et al 2007 and time domain matching hybrid method duan and dai 1999 liu and papanikolaou 2011 the retardation function method also called indirect time domain method is faster and more stable to implement and provides good accuracy for practical engineering application at ship design stage especially for ship motions and loads prediction in irregular waves to date the wave memory effects have been considered to include the nonlinear effects of ship responses in regular waves due to free surface effects fonseca and guedes soares 2002 presented a nonlinear time domain strip method in which the linear radiation force is calculated by time convolution of memory functions while the nonlinear hydrostatic restoring force and froude krylov force are calculated exactly over the instantaneous wetted surface of hull mikami and shimada 2006 developed a time domain strip method with memory effect function considering body nonlinearity in hydrostatic force and froude krylov forces as well as hydrodynamic forces rajendran et al 2016 developed a time domain strip theory with fully body nonlinearity of hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads to predict extreme motions and loads on a cruise ship tang et al 2013 compared the retardation functions obtained by direct time domain method and frequency domain transformation method and investigated the forward speed effects on the retardation function qiu et al 2001 calculated the memory functions by direct time domain solution scheme instead of fourier transformation of radiation forces in frequency domain the existing retardation function methods in the literature works are mainly focus on addressing rigid body seakeeping issues in this study the wave memory effect for radiation force calculation is extended to 3d hydroelasticity theory of irregular wave case the retardation function is usually estimated by fourier transformation of the damping coefficient however due to the limitation of potential flow theory and substantial computation time the damping coefficients at different high frequencies are difficult to be comprehensively obtained bao and kinoshita 1992 used a perturbation method to obtain asymptotic solution of radiation velocity potential and then the damping coefficients at high frequency were estimated for the sake of simplification the fourier transformation is usually dealt with by integrating the damping coefficient in a finite interval and the truncated error is ignored however xiao and wang 2004 stressed that the high frequency components have an obvious influence on the overall result therefore accurate estimation of damping coefficient at high frequency range is important for the calculation of radiation force a semi analytical method is presented in this study to estimate the damping coefficients at high frequency range for subsequent calculation of time retardation function segmented model tests are widely adopted for the measurement of ship hydroelastic motions and loads responses jiao et al 2017 2018a marón and kapsenberg 2014 designed a segmented ship model equipped with an open u shape backbone for hydroelastic measurement in towing tank wang and guedes soares 2016 analyzed the bow slamming loads on a chemical tanker in irregular waves by tank model measurement and numerical calculation jiao and ren 2016 conducted segmented model tank tests for the investigation of bow flare slamming and hydroelastic vibrations of a ship in severe irregular waves lee et al 2012 investigated the springing and whipping responses of a containership by model tests and nonlinear hydroelastic analyses although many published papers experimentally investigate ship nonlinear responses in moderate and extreme irregular sea states experimental studies that focus on ship responses in 3d realistic extreme sea waves are relatively scarce in the recent years jiao et al 2016a 2018b developed and conducted large scale model tests for ship seakeeping performance and hydroelastic responses in realistic sea conditions which helps get real and accurate motions and wave loads results for ship in 3d short crested waves the time domain statistical analysis of large scale model sea trial data has not been reported yet in this study the large scale model sea trial data are analyzed and compared with small scale model tank measurement results to better understand ship responses in short crested irregular waves this paper aims at presenting a comprehensive study on the motions and bending moments on a large bow flare ship induced by harsh irregular waves a 3d time domain hydroelasticity theory considering froude krylov nonlinearity is developed to predict ship motions and loads in steep long crested irregular waves to fully take into account the effects of different frequencies of irregular waves on ship hydrodynamic responses the convolution method for wave exciting forces calculation is extended to the 3d hydroelasticity theory in addition segmented model measurements including both small scale model towing tank tests and large scale model sea trials were conducted to experimentally investigate the motions and loads of the ship sailing in both long and short crested irregular waves and compare with the numerical results the main novelty of this paper is the provided technical approaches and data analyses for evaluation of ship hydroelastic responses in severe irregular waves 2 hydroelasticity theory of ship in irregular waves the 3d time domain nonlinear hydroelasticity theory in regular waves is extended to predict ship motions and loads in long crested irregular waves the main nonlinear factor considered in this study is twofold i instantaneous body surface condition of froude krylov force and restoring force due to large amplitude motions of ship in steep waves ii local impact loads including bow flare slamming and green water loads the indirect time domain hydroelasticity algorithm is based on the frequency domain transformation principle which means that the radiation and diffraction forces are calculated by frequency domain green function method on the static wetted position at each time step while the ship motion governing equation is solved in time domain 2 1 solution of fluid velocity potential in frequency domain to model the ship seakeeping problem with a steady forward speed u three right hand coordinate systems are introduced i a space fixed system o xyz with its origin o at undisturbed free surface ii a plane movement system o xyz is parallel to the space fixed system and its origin o is fixed on ship at the constant height of the free surface and iii a body fixed system g x b y b z b is fixed on the ship and its origin g coincides with center of gravity cog of hull all the time the boundary conditions of fluid domain for the fluid flexible structure interaction ffsi problem are plotted in fig 1 where ω s b s f s h and s denotes the fluid domain wetted body surface condition free surface condition bottom condition and infinity radiation condition respectively in the potential flow theory the fluid is assumed to be ideal i e incompressible inviscid continuous and irrotational thus the fluid velocity vector can be expressed as the gradient of a velocity potential 1 v φ x y z t the total velocity potential can be decomposed into the following format 2 φ x y z t u x ϕ s x y z re ζ a ϕ 0 x y z ζ a ϕ d x y z r 1 m i ω p r ϕ r x y z e i ω t where u denotes ship forward speed ζ a denotes incident wave amplitude of regular wave ω denotes wave encounter frequency ϕ s x y z denotes steady potential ϕ 0 x y z and ϕ d x y z denotes incident and diffraction potential corresponding to unit wave amplitude respectively ϕ r x y z denotes radiation potential corresponding to unit motion amplitude for r 1 6 the motions are rigid body six degree of freedom dof motion while for r 7 m the motions are structural elastic deformation the incident wave potential ϕ 0 is fully determined by the incident wave field which is easy to obtain for infinite water depth and finite water depth h conditions the incident wave potentials are respectively expressed as 3 ϕ 0 x y z i g ω e k z i k x cos β y sin β 4 ϕ 0 x y z i g cosh k z h ω cosh k h e i k x cos β y sin β where k denotes wave number the boundary conditions for solving the perturbation potentials ϕ r x y z r 1 m 1 i e radiation and diffraction potentials around the elastic hull can be expressed in eq 5 where the first equation is the laplace equation the second is linear free surface condition the third is body impermeability condition the fourth is the infinity radiation condition the fifth is the bottom condition for finite water depth h and infinite water depth conditions 5 2 ϕ r 0 i n ω ω 2 ϕ r g z ϕ r 0

displacement vector of body surface caused by the rth order motion or deformation the solution of the above boundary value problem bvp for the unknown velocity potentials is formulated by 3d frequency domain free surface green function method the so called hess smith panel element method is used to solve the distributed source strength 2 2 time domain hydroelastic motion governing equation the time domain nonlinear hydroelastic motion governing equation of hull in irregular waves which takes the wave memory effects of radiation force into account is expressed as follows 6 a a p t b b p t t k τ p t τ d τ c c p t f i t f s t f d t f s l a m t f g w t where a b and c are m m dimensional generalized structural mass damping and stiffness matrices respectively a b and c denotes m m dimensional generalized infinite frequency added mass damping coefficient and stiffness matrices due to forward speed effects respectively p t is the m dimensional mode principal coordinate column matrix k τ denotes m m dimensional time retardation function matrix τ denotes time interval f i t f s t f d t f slam t and f gw t are m dimensional generalized incident wave froude krylov force hydrostatic restoring force diffraction wave force slamming loads and green water loads column matrices respectively it is noted that the linearized radiation force is included in the left hand side of eq 6 a weakly nonlinear also called froude krylov nonlinear method is used to calculate the hydrostatic and hydrodynamic forces as a compromise between computational efficiency and accuracy requirement the froude krylov force and restoring force are calculated on the instantaneous wetted body surface and the diffraction and radiation forces are calculated on the mean wetted body surface in calm water within certain approximations since the incident wave potentials are easily obtained without solving the green function the nonlinear froude krylov method will not result in any significant computational burden the calculation of fluid force terms are described in detail in section 2 3 after determination of restoring force wave forces and impact loads the hydroelastic differential equation of eq 6 can be solved by an improved half time step fourth order runge kutta method in time domain based on modal superposition principle the time domain results e g displacement w x t bending moment m x t and shearing force v x t at each cross section of ship in irregular waves can be obtained as follows 7 w x t r 1 m p r t w r x m x t r 1 m p r t m r x v x t r 1 m p r t v r x where w r x m r x and v r x is the rth principal mode of displacement bending moment and shearing force respectively 2 3 calculation of fluid forces the real time froude krylov force is calculated on the instantaneous wetted body surface of the elastic hull since the long crested irregular waves can be regarded as the linear superposition of a number of regular waves the froude krylov force of rth order component can be written as 8 f i r t ρ i 1 m ζ a i s b t n u r i ω i u x ϕ 0 i d s r 1 2 m where ζ ai ω i ϕ 0i are the wave amplitude frequency and incident potential of ith sub wave component respectively s b t denotes the instantaneous wetted body surface of the elastic hull in irregular waves the hydrostatic restoring force of rth order component acting on the elastic hull surface in irregular waves is calculated by direct integrating the pressure over the instantaneous wetted hull surface of the elastic hull 9 f s r t ρ g k 1 m p k t s b t n u r w k d s l f g x w r d x r 1 2 m where ρ denotes fluid density g denotes gravity acceleration f g x denotes longitudinal distribution of weight w k denotes the vertical displacement component of u k i e u k v k w k the diffraction and radiation forces are calculated on the mean wetted surface in calm water as in the linear case according to cummins 1962 the time domain wave forces of ship in irregular waves can be derived by convolution theory based on the frequency domain results thus the diffraction force can be written as 10 f d r t 0 t h d r t τ ζ τ d τ r 1 2 m where ζ t is the wave elevation of irregular waves h d r t is impulse response function which can be obtained by applying the fourier transformation using the frequency domain response function i e rao in regular waves 11 h d r t 1 π 0 h d r i ω e i ω t d ω r 1 2 m where h d r iω is the frequency response function induced by the harmonic diffraction wave force under unit amplitude the infinite frequency added mass damping coefficient and stiffness matrices are included in radiation force to consider the forward speed effects moreover the time retardation function and wave memory effect are included to take into account the contribution of different frequencies of irregular waves the radiation force is calculated on the mean wetted position 12 f r t a p t b p t c p t 0 t k τ p t τ d τ where the expression of a b and c can be found in ren et al 2018 and dai and duan 2008 and they are determined by hull geometry and speed the element k rk τ r k 1 2 m in the time retardation function matrix k τ can be obtained by applying the fourier transformation using the frequency domain damping coefficient b rk ω which will be described in detail in section 2 4 the momentum impact theory based von karman model where the water pile up is assumed to be zero is used to estimate the slamming loads when the vertical relative velocity exceeds a critical value 13 f s l a m x t d m x d z d w r e l x t d t 2 where m x is the sectional added mass in heave mode at infinite frequency w rel x t is vertical displacement of the hull relative to the wave surface elevation the vertical relative velocity of ship with respect to the wave surface can be obtained by the derivation the relative displacement 14 v x t w r e l x t r 1 m w r x p r t ζ x t z where w r x denotes the rth mode coordinate of ship surface under the plane movement system the overall slamming loads acting on the whole elastic hull are obtained by integrating the 2d sectional slamming force longitudinally 15 f s l a m r t l f s l a m x t w r x d x the green water loads are calculated based on the momentum theory buchner 1995 the vertical impact force due to the presence of green water is expressed as 16 f g w r x t m g w t w r x g cos p 5 w r t m g w where m gw is the mass of the water on deck then the overall green water loads acting on the whole elastic hull can be obtained by integrating the 2d sectional force longitudinally in a similar manner as eq 15 2 4 calculation of retardation function it is known that the time domain retardation function is derived by applying the fourier transformation using the frequency domain damping coefficient 17 k τ 2 π 0 b ω cos ω τ d ω it can be found that the damping coefficient from zero to infinite frequency should be known for the estimation of time retardation function however only limited hydrodynamic coefficients at finite number of frequency can be calculated due to the limitation of calculate time and cost a semi analytical method is presented hereunder to accurately estimate the time retardation function a critical frequency ω c is used to separate the whole frequency interval 0 into two intervals i e 0 ω c and ω c thus eq 17 can be re written as follows 18 k τ 2 π 0 ω c b ω cos ω τ d ω ω c b ω cos ω τ d ω for the calculation of the first term on the right hand side of eq 18 the trapezoid quadrature method can be used the interval 0 ω c is dispersed into finite sub intervals ω n ω n 1 n 1 2 n the damping coefficient is assumed to be linear with frequency at each sub interval 19 b ω p 0 n p 1 n ω where the coefficients are expressed as p 0 n b ω n ω n 1 b ω n 1 ω n ω n 1 ω n and p 1 n b ω n 1 b ω n ω n 1 ω n the first term on the right hand side of eq 18 can be re expressed as 20 2 π 0 ω c b ω cos ω t d ω 2 π n 1 n p 0 n ω n ω n 1 cos ω t d ω p 1 n ω n ω n 1 ω cos ω t d ω for the calculation of the second term on the right hand side of eq 18 the following exponentially decay function is adopted to fit the damping coefficient that greater than the critical frequency considering the fact that the damping coefficient tends to zero at infinite frequency 21 b ω α exp β ω ω c where α and β are undetermined coefficients it is noted that β should be positive value so as to ensure that the eq 21 is decrement function the coefficients are determined according to the principle that b ω and its first order derivative are continuous at point ω c thus the coefficients can be obtained as follows 22 α b ω c 23 β 1 b ω c d b ω c d ω where the first order derivative db ω c dω can be estimated by finite differencing 3 numerical and experimental model setup a naval ship with pronounced flare bow is used for illustrative analysis in this study main dimensions of the ship and models are listed in table 1 the numerical calculations are carried out at full scale dimension a small scale model was made and corresponding laboratory tank tests were conducted to validate and compare with the numerical hydroelastic results to further investigate ship responses in realistic short crested sea waves large scale model sea trials were designed and conducted the numerical and experimental model setups are described as follows 3 1 numerical model setup to determine the modal characteristics of ship in vacuum the dry elastic mode in vertical bending mode was estimated by transfer matrix method tmm which treats the hull girder as a non uniform timoshenko beam the ship is numerically modeled using 20 segments for the mode calculation the longitudinal distributions of mass and second moment of inertia in vertical bending mode of full scale ship are shown in fig 2 in this study only the first three orders of vertical bending modes are considered to estimate ship hydroelastic responses in head waves the normalized vertical displacement of dry mode in the first three orders obtained by tmm is shown in fig 3 which is used as generalized coordinate in the subsequent hydroelastic response calculation natural frequencies of the numerical and experimental values are summarized in table 2 the target dry natural frequency is obtained by whole ship structure finite element analysis fea note that the model s natural frequencies that identified by impact hammer test are presented in ship scale for the convenience of comparison in the numerical model the structural damping matrix is assumed to be diagonal which is the linear combination of mass and stiffness matrix and the dimensionless damping coefficient in vertical bending mode is chosen as 0 05 the 3d hydrodynamic grid was generated by cubic spline function method zhang et al 2001 the whole ship and underwater wetted grid systems of the ship are shown in fig 4 a total of 2055 panels of the whole ship grid are used for nonlinear froude krylov force and hydrostatic restoring force calculation and slamming green water judgment a total of 1308 panels of the underwater wetted grid are used for solving the diffraction and radiation potentials the transient elastic whole hull grid for froude krylov force and restoring force calculation can be generated according to the principle mode superposition of distortion based on euler bernoulli beam theory example of the deformed grid corresponding to the first second and third order vertical modal shape is illustrated in fig 5 moreover it is necessary to identify the real time exact wetted hull grid under the instantaneous incident wave envelope for calculation of nonlinear froude krylov force and hydrostatic restoring force since the incident wave potential in eqs 3 and 4 satisfies the linearized free surface boundary condition on the instantaneous mean free surface the exact wetted hull under the incident wave surface should be mapped on the flat water plane the mapping is realized by setting the vertical coordinate of points on the real wave surface as zero and moving the vertices of panels vertically with a same displacement singh and sen 2007 in the numerical simulation the infinite depth of water is assumed to be in accordance with experimental schemes three conditions as listed in table 3 were selected for calculation the significant wave heights 15 m and 9 2 m are the extreme and design wave heights respectively the corresponding characteristic periods were determined to be the most probable value at each wave height according to the scatter diagram for the north atlantic sea states jiao et al 2018c the time series of irregular waves were simulated according to issc target spectrum the wave and ship response data in this paper are presented at full scale it is worth mentioning that only head wave conditions are involved and investigated in the numerical study while the numerical code has capacity of calculating ship hydroelastic responses at any wave headings 3 2 segmented model tank experimental setup a 1 50 geosim small scale segmented model was made of fiberglass reinforced plastics frp to allow the laboratory hydroelasticity experimental measurements as illustrated in fig 6 the model has seven segments and six cuts are provided at the 2nd 4th 6th 8th 10th and 12th stations a steel backbone beam of variable structural characteristics along the hull length is used to connect the segments and transfer loads to reproduce the effects of the deformation modes on the loads the backbone model has the same scaled flexible characteristics of the full scale ship in vertical bending mode a set of self propulsion system is installed at stern area to achieve the testing forward speed the ship model was tested in the towing tank of harbin engineering university heu the tank is 108 m long 7 m wide and 3 5 m deep the equipped computer controlled hydraulic driven wave generator is able to produce both regular waves and long crested irregular waves there is a wave absorbing beach opposite the wave maker at the other side of the tank a towing carriage run along the tank is used to act as the reference of speed and heading angle during model sailing view of the testing model and tank facilities is shown in fig 7 the sectional vertical bending moments vbm of model were measured by full bridge strain gauges placed on the backbone surfaces three accelerometers were mounted on deck of bow amidships and stern areas to measure the vertical accelerations see fig 6 a group of fifteen pressure sensors were mounted on the bow flare area the global motions were measured by an in house developed seakeeping apparatus which is installed on the towing carriage and connected with the model by its two heave sticks the scheme of model setup with the seakeeping apparatus is shown in fig 8 the experimental parameters at model scale are obtained by froude similitude law based on the testing schemes listed in table 3 during the experiments the sampled signals including ship motions accelerations sectional loads and impact pressure were recorded by a data collector each short term irregular wave testing condition was carried out to obtain at least 200 response samples to produce longer records which is realized by combining time series measured in several separate runs 3 3 large scale model sea trial setup a corresponding 1 25 large scale model was constructed according to the same prototype for the comparative investigations model setup and sensor arrangement of the large model are almost the same as the 1 50 small scale model the measurement of vertical acceleration sectional loads includes vbm and horizontal bending moment hbm and impact pressures are the same as these in the small scale model tank tests the motions and navigational information of the large scale model at sea were measured by a global position system inertial navigation system gps ins device view of the large scale model setup is shown in fig 9 the sea trials were carried out in coastal waves of bohai sea china the average water depth of testing area is over 20 m and the shoaling water effect can be ignored a mini size wave buoy of diameter 0 4 m was used to measure the vertical acceleration of coastal waves the model sailing speed and heading angle was controlled by radio submitted from another auxiliary yacht the sea waves ship navigational state ship motions sectional loads and bow flare impact pressure were measured and recorded during the sea trials for post voyage analysis the large scale testing model and recorded sea trial scene are shown in fig 10 4 validation of numerical algorithm by regular wave results due to the fact that the exact real time incident waves acting on the model were not measured during the tank tests thus the wave elevation of the irregular sea state for the numerical simulation is generated using random phases therefore a direct comparison of time series of motions and loads of ship in irregular waves between calculation and measurement would be impossible in this section the numerical algorithm is preliminarily validated by comparing with the experimental results in regular head waves for this purpose two typical testing conditions are selected for time series comparison wave heights h 4 m and 12 m wave length to ship length ratio λ l 0 8 and ship speed v 18 knots the comparative time series for motions and vbm amidships between calculation and measurement are shown in figs 11 and 12 respectively for heave motion positive and negative values present emergence and submergence of ship respectively for pitch motion positive and negative values present trim by bow and stern respectively for vbm positive and negative values present hogging and sagging respectively the low frequency lf wave loads and high frequency hf slamming loads are also separated from total vbm loads by fast fourier transform fft and inverse fft as seen from the comparison the results for regular head waves show fairly good agreement between calculation and measurement however slight deviation is observed mainly due to the fluctuation of experimental peaks to further validate the numerical results at different wave frequencies the motion and load raos for ship sailing in head wave conditions at forward speed 5 knots are compared between calculation and measurement the wave frequency in numerical simulation ranges from 0 02 rad s to 2 rad s with a step of 0 02 rad s the experimental wave frequency are selected at points λ l 0 4 0 6 0 8 0 9 1 0 1 1 1 2 1 5 2 0 and 2 5 the experimental incident wave height is set at 4 m to obtain the linear responses some high frequency loads caused by springing responses at specified frequency points are removed to obtain the linear load responses fig 13 shows the comparison of dimensionless raos for pitch heave and vbm amidships between calculation and measurement the heave motion is non dimensionalized with wave amplitude ζ a the pitch motion is non dimensionalized with product of wave number and wave amplitude kζ a the vbm is non dimensionalized with ρgζ a bl where ρ is the density of water g is the gravity acceleration b is the breadth of ship and l is the waterline length of ship to summarize it is clearly seen that the frequency domain results generally show good agreement between calculation and experiment 5 analysis of ship responses in long crested irregular waves the numerical simulation and experimental measurement results for ship sailing in long crested irregular waves are analyzed and compared in this section the experimental and numerical incident irregular waves are analyzed first then the experimental and numerical time series frequency spectra and statistics of ship vertical motions and loads are analyzed and compared 5 1 incident irregular waves the waves during tank experiments were measured by an in situ resistive wave probe which is fixed at approximately 10 m distance from the wave maker examples of the measured time series within full scale 1000 s under the two wave states see table 3 are shown in fig 14 as seen from the time series of wave surface elevation the experimental waves are associated with nonlinear behavior such as sharp crest and flat trough due to the large steepness however the time domain hydroelasticity theory uses the linear superposition principle to simulate the linear irregular waves the comparison of wave spectra between measurement and the issc target spectra is shown in fig 15 even though the agreement between the measurement and the issc spectra is good small discrepancy is observed in spectral peak value and frequency distribution due to the limitation of tank facility and uncertainty factors the statistical properties of the measured and simulated time series of irregular waves are listed in table 4 the numerical results are obtained using the simulated 1 h irregular wave data the experimental results are obtained using the combined time series by several measurements under equivalent sea state the mean value of the experimental waves is even though not zero negligibly small negative value and less than 0 5 of the significant wave height for all the three cases the variance of the waves represents the area under the wave energy spectrum the difference in the values of the standard deviation between the experimental and the numerical waves are 0 7 1 6 and 0 6 for the three cases respectively which indicates that the significant wave heights are in good accordance between experiment and simulation the skewness and kurtosis are measure parameters of the asymmetry of crest trough distribution and the deviation of wave surface elevation from gaussian distribution toffoli et al 2008 for a standard gaussian distribution the skewness and kurtosis are both zero the experimental waves have larger positive skewness value which reflects the sharper crest and shallower trough behavior of wave surface elevation the larger kurtosis value represents taller peak and longer tail in the probability distribution of the wave elevation compared with the gaussian distribution the kurtosis values of the experimental waves are negative which means that the waves with large amplitude are more frequently occurred to summarize the nonlinear properties mean skewness and kurtosis values of the experimental waves are all more obvious than the linear numerical results additionally probability of exceedance of wave crest and trough peaks of the experimental and the numerical waves are compared in fig 16 as is seen good agreement between measurement and simulation is found at the range of wave peaks lower than 4 m the peaks of crest and trough are almost symmetrically distributed for the linear numerical waves however the experimental wave crest peaks are larger than their trough peaks and this is more pronounced for the extreme sea state case 1 the tail of the numerical distribution is slightly asymmetric with larger crests but the data is scattered therefore longer simulation may better reveal the real nature of the wave peak distribution at the tail 5 2 time series and statistics of ship vertical motions and loads the experimental and numerical time series of ship motions and loads are presented in this section then the statistical values for the experimental and numerical time series are compared and analyzed 5 2 1 time series of experimental results the full scale time series of heave at cog of ship pitch and vbms at stations 2 and 10 within 1000 s for testing case 2 h 1 3 9 2 m tz 11 4 s v 18 knots by tank model measurement are shown in fig 17 as is seen the time series of heave and pitch are stable and smooth all the time the local slamming loads have little effects on heave and pitch motions due to the large global inertia force and moment of hull the ship undergoes severe slamming events and the whipping response is however clearly visible in the total vbm the total vbm is also filtered into low frequency and high frequency components by fourier filtering with a cut off frequency of 0 3 hz the amplitudes of whipping vbm are even much larger than the wave frequency vbm especially at bow area it should be noted that the severe slamming event may result in local structure failure or damage of bow 5 2 2 time series of numerical results examples of the simulated time series of heave at cog of ship pitch and vbms at stations 2 and 10 within 1000 s for case 2 h 1 3 9 2 m tz 11 4 s v 18 knots are shown in fig 18 as is seen the calculation results show similar trends and magnitudes as the experimental results in fig 17 it is noted that the curves will not be the same since the exact surface of incident waves acting on model was not measured from the tests the wave surface of the irregular waves is however generated using random phase for the numerical simulation similar with the experimental results the simulated heave motion is almost in the same phase with the vbm while opposite the phase of pitch the simulated whipping loads also show the same characteristics as the experimental results which turns out that the impact momentum theory are reliable in the estimation of slamming and green water loads even though the momentum impact theory does not consider the water pile up and water exit effects during the slamming process 5 2 3 comparison of statistical results of time series the statistics of the experimental and numerical time series of heave pitch and vbms at station 2 and 10 in the three conditions are listed in table 5 the duration of the available model response experimental data is 4300 s 2400 s and 2600 s for cases 1 2 and 3 respectively the duration of the numerical data is 3600 s for all of the three cases the experimental heave motion has positive mean value of 0 122 m at 5 knots due to the dynamic effects of the severe incoming waves fonseca and guedes soares 2004 however the ship experienced obvious sinkage with the increasing of froude number the mean values of numerical heave motion are slightly positive for all of the three cases and have no obvious regularity the probable reason may be that the numerical method neglects the effect of steady flow on the unsteady flow the standard deviation of heave motion show good agreement between experimental and numerical results with difference less than 3 21 the skewness values of heave are negligible small for both experimental and numerical results which indicates that the crest and trough peaks are almost symmetrically distributed the kurtosis values of heave lie in a narrow range between 0 292 and 0 484 and show good agreement between experimental and numerical results both experimental and numerical pitch motions have small negative mean values indicates trim by stern and show good agreement between each other the standard deviation of pitch show good agreement between experimental and numerical results with difference less than 1 72 the skewness values of pitch are small and show similar trends between experimental and numerical results apart from case 1 probably due to the nonlinearity of severe experimental waves although both the experimental and numerical kurtosis values of pitch are small negative values the experimental values are more notable than numerical values and the difference increases with increasing ship speed the experimental vbms have considerable negative mean values which is partly caused by the steady moment due to the increase in pressure at the bow and stern compared to the middle body when ship sailing in still water with the increasing of sea severity or ship speed the mean sagging value increases due to the dynamic effects of the waves note that the calm water vbm is neither considered in the experimental nor the numerical results although the mean values of calculated vbm are negative and also show the same trend with increase of sea severity or ship speed they are always a little smaller than the experimental values since the numerical method does not include any steady waves in the calculation rajendran et al 2016 obtained similar results on analysis of an ultra large containership in high seas by using 2d nonlinear strip theory the largest difference in the values of the standard deviation between experimental and numerical vbm is 14 58 and 5 08 for vbm at bow and amidships respectively the experimental skewness and kurtosis values of vbm at bow are considerably deviation from the gaussian distribution while the numerical skewness and kurtosis values of vbm at bow have less nonlinearity compared with experimental results thus big difference in the kurtosis value of vbm at bow between experiment and numerical values can be found this is mainly due to the fact that the experimental vbm at bow are associated with strongly nonlinear slamming behavior and highly asymmetry in sagging and hogging loads however the numerical algorithm which is based on linear modal superposition principle cannot fully simulate the strongly nonlinear slamming loads near the free end positions this can be understood by comparing figs 17 and 18 the vbm at amidships are associated with less nonlinearity and their skewness and kurtosis values show good agreement between experimental and numerical results 5 3 frequency spectral analysis of ship motions and loads in this section the experimental and numerical frequency spectra of ship motions and loads are analyzed and compared 5 3 1 comparison of response spectra of motions the experimental and numerical frequency spectra that obtained by applying fourier transformation of the time series in the three testing conditions are presented in figs 19 and 20 for heave and pitch motions respectively in these figures the numerical power spectral density psd of motions is presented in negative in order to compare with the experimental results as is seen the heave and pitch psd distributes in a narrow frequency range of 0 03 0 15 hz generally the psd and its frequency distribution show good agreement between experimental and numerical results however the frequency distribution of the experiment results mainly concentrates on several discrete frequency points while the numerical results reveal relatively continuous distribution over the frequency range the peak frequency increases with increasing speed from 5 knots to 24 knots for both the experimental and numerical results which can be explained by the increase of wave encounter frequency for both heave and pitch motions the peak of psd at 5 knots is the largest due to severe sea state while the second largest is at 24 knots due to high speed which reveals the same tendency as the values of variance in table 5 5 3 2 comparison of response spectra of vbm the experimental frequency spectra of vbm at the six cut the 2nd 4th 6th 8th 10th and 12th stations in the three testing conditions are shown in figs 21 and 22 where the response psd at 24 knots is presented in negative so as to compare with the results at 18 knots the high frequency vibrations in the first three orders can be clearly identified from the spectra at station 2 and they are in good agreement with the natural frequencies obtained by hammer test i e 2 node frequency 0 509 hz 3 node frequency 1 292 hz and 4 node frequency 1 875 hz the 3 node vibration components cannot be clearly observed at stations 10 and 12 due to the fact that these locations are at or near the node of 3 node vibration the peak frequencies of slamming loads corresponding to 2 node and 3 node vibrations in 5 knots condition case 1 are slightly lower than those in 18 or 24 knots conditions cases 2 and 3 one of the probable reasons may be the nonlinear structural damping ratio in severe waves the 2 node and 3 node peak frequencies are very close for the results at 18 knots and 24 knots even though the high speed slightly increases the encounter frequency of wave frequency loads moreover both the wave frequency and slamming load components at 24 knots are larger than those at 18 knots especially at bow area stations the comparisons of experimental and numerical frequency spectra of vbm at bow station 2 and amidships station 10 in the three conditions are shown in fig 23 the numerical psd of vbm is presented in negative in order to compare with the experimental results the experimental and numerical results generally show good agreement in both frequency and amplitude as seen from fig 23 a the first three orders of natural frequency estimated by tmm show good agreement with the experimental values moreover higher order vibrations caused by springing responses can be found in the numerical results in fig 23 b c e and f for example the third and fourth harmonious of 2 node natural frequency 0 509 hz are observed around 1 5 hz and 2 0 hz the numerical springing responses are most pronounced at speed 24 knots since the 2 node natural frequency is near the fourth harmonics of wave encounter peak frequency 0 125 hz a large concentrated peak is observed at approximately 1 733 hz which is near by the 4 node natural frequency however the springing effects are not observed in the experimental results probably due to the nonlinear structural damping ratio of the physical model another probable reason may be the fluctuation of forward speed since the model s surge motion is released during measurement while the surge is zero in the numerical model 5 4 probability distribution of ship motions and loads the probability distribution of crest and trough peaks for experimental and numerical ship motions and loads are analyzed and compared in this section 5 4 1 comparison of probability of exceedance of motions figs 24 and 25 respectively show the comparison of probability of exceedance of heave and pitch peaks between experiment and calculation results the results are derived using the raw experimental time series without removing the mean value as is seen the experimental and numerical peaks of heave motion are generally symmetric at the relatively low heave peak range in case 2 however the tail of the distribution is asymmetric and the asymmetry increases as the sea severity or ship speed increases the experimental crest peaks at the tail of distribution are larger than the corresponding trough peaks in the low speed condition case 1 due to severe waves however opposite phenomenon is found in cases 2 and 3 mainly due to the mean sinkage and dynamic effects of ship caused by high speed the numerical crest peaks are larger than the corresponding trough peaks in all of the three cases the reason is that the numerical method neglects the effect of steady flow and the numerical mean sinkage is very small it can be concluded that the difference between experimental and numerical heave peaks is mainly caused by the difference of mean values the pitch motion results show similar distribution as the heave motion results the experimental and numerical pitch peaks are symmetric distribution at the range of pitch peaks lower than 2 deg asymmetry of pitch peaks are found at the tail of distributions for both experimental and numerical results in all the three cases the numerical method is able to reflect the nonlinearity and follow similar trend in the distribution of the pitch peaks however the numerical method overestimates the pitch peak values at the tail of distribution compared with the experimental values which is probably due to the following reasons i the incident wave profile used in the numerical simulation is linear ii only nonlinearity in the froude krylov and hydrostatic forces are considered while the radiation and diffraction forces are remained as linear iii the radiated and distorted wave field will generate a different wave profile along the body surface which is not considered in the simulation the trough peaks of pitch at the tail of distribution are generally larger than the corresponding crest peaks for both experimental and numerical results in cases 2 and 3 however the large pitch crests at the tail of distribution are higher than the corresponding trough values as found from the experimental results in case 1 due to the nonlinear effects of harsh experimental waves 5 4 2 comparison of probability distribution of vbm figs 26 and 27 respectively show the probability of exceedance of vbm at bow and amidships in the three conditions the low frequency wave induced loads which are obtained through a low pass filter with a cut off frequency of 0 3 hz are also presented and compared with the total vbm distribution in each of the figure it is noted that the hogging and sagging peaks of both low frequency and total vbms are counted in each zero up crossing period of the low frequency vbm time series so the number of peaks are identical between low frequency and total vbm pronounced asymmetry in the distribution of the vbm peaks are observed in both the experimental and numerical results in all of the three cases the highly asymmetric distributions of vbm peaks are mainly caused by the notable negative mean value and high frequency whipping loads the trends and magnitudes of the experimental and numerical results are generally in good agreement apart from that the numerical method evidently underestimates the total sagging vbm at bow in addition the asymmetric distributions of hogging and sagging peaks for both total vbm and low frequency vbm are more obvious in the experimental results than the numerical results due to the fact that some nonlinear factors are ignored in the numerical code for both the experimental and numerical results the ship experiences the largest total sagging vbm at bow in case 3 h 1 3 9 2 m rather than in case 1 h 1 3 15 m due to the severe slamming loads caused by higher speed of the ship in case 3 the largest total sagging vbm amidships occurred in case 1 for both the experimental and numerical results due to the severe waves the largest total sagging vbm at bow are very close between the experimental and numerical values while the numerical method slightly overestimates the largest total sagging vbm amidships in cases 1 and 3 by 11 74 and 20 62 respectively one of the probable reason behind the overestimation of the largest vbm in case 3 is that the experimental duration 2600 s is shorter than the numerical duration 3600 s the statistical scattergrams of low frequency wave induced vbm with respect to the corresponding total vbm in each of zero up crossing wave frequency period are shown in figs 28 and 29 for loads at bow and amidships respectively it is noted that the low frequency sagging vbm are presented in negative values while the total sagging vbm are presented in positive for the convenience of comparison the results generally show good agreement between measurement and calculation however the experimental sagging loads at bow in case 1 reveal strong correlation between total vbm and low frequency vbm while the numerical sagging vbm points at bow in case 1 are scattered it is observed that the slamming loads largely contribute the total sagging vbm compared with total hogging vbm especially for the sectional loads at bow area the large sagging vbm usually occurred in cases 1 and 3 due to the high sea state or high speed the ship forward speed significantly increases the extreme total vbm even under the same wave state which can be found by comparing the results in cases 2 and 3 at speeds 18 knots and 24 knots for both experimental and numerical results 6 analysis of ship hydroelastic responses in realistic sea waves investigation of ship motions and loads in realistic sea waves is highly interesting and insightful in order to carry out such analysis large scale model sea trials were conducted in this section the measured large scale model s motions and loads at sea are analyzed and compared with the tank experimental results under the equivalent sea state level 6 the sea waves during the large scale model tests were measured by an in situ accelerometer based wave buoy see fig 10 a jiao et al 2016b the dominant wave propagation direction was judged by visual observation and referring wind direction the measured significant wave height and mean period are 0 266 m and 1 932 s respectively the sea waves in short term can be approximately regarded as ergodic and stationary random during the whole measurement procedure the selected testing conditions at full scale for comparison between large and small scale model testing results are summarized in table 6 since the surface elevation of sea wave was not measured directly the nonlinearity of sea waves is not analyzed in this study 6 1 time series and frequency spectra of ship responses in sea waves the measured time series of large scale model s motions and loads during the one day s whole sea trial procedure can be found in authors previous work jiao et al 2016b this study mainly focuses on comparing large scale model s responses against small scale model tank measurement results the pitch at cog vbm and hbm at stations 2 and 10 by large scale model measurement are analyzed the heave motion is not included since the heave was not directly measured during the sea trial the time series of pitch vbms and hbms by large scale model measurement within full scale 5000 s for case 4 are illustrated in fig 30 it should be mentioned that the baseline was corrected by 0 02 hz high pass filtering and the mean value was removed to address the zero drift of the signals at sea as is seen the signals are associated with stronger nonlinearity and randomicity compared with the numerical simulation and tank experimental results moreover it is found that the hbm has similar trends and magnitudes as the vbm when ship sailing in bow oblique short crested sea waves an extreme event occurred at approximately 1400 s where the largest instantaneous vbm and hbm appear due to severe wave impact to further investigate the extreme load responses the local views of vbm and hbm time series within 500 s around the extreme event are presented in figs 31 and 32 respectively as is seen the transient whipping loads largely contribute to the total vbm or hbm at bow area the largest instantaneous hbm is even much higher than the vbm at bow section thus special attentions should also be paid to horizontal strength in addition to vertical strength when ship sailing in oblique short crested waves the high frequency loads decay very quickly after the occurrence of slamming due to the structural damping moreover the slamming and green water phenomena recorded by onboard video camera corresponding to this severe slamming event are shown in fig 33 the corresponding frequency spectra of vbm and hbm by large scale model measurement are shown in fig 34 as is seen the first two orders of natural frequency can be clearly identified from the spectral curves at station 2 for both vbm and hbm it is noted that the 2 node natural frequency in vertical bending mode by large scale model test 0 472 hz is slightly 7 27 lower than the small scale model testing result 0 509 hz which is mainly caused by the design error and scale effects however the 3 node natural frequency in vertical bending mode by large scale model test 1 305 hz is in fairly good agreement with the small scale model result 1 292 hz moreover the spectral density by large scale model test is in a broader distribution compared with the numerical and tank experimental results given in figs 21 23 the reason is twofold i the duration of large scale model s time series data is longer than that of tank model test and ii the wind generated realistic short crest sea waves are associated with broader frequency distribution than the artificially generated pseudo random unidirectional tank waves 6 2 comparison of statistics and probability distribution of ship motions and loads the statistical parameters of pitch and vbm by different model measurements in the equivalent sea state level 6 are summarized in table 7 note that the statistics of both the large and small scale model testing results are derived after the zero mean processing of raw time series for the sake of consistency the large scale model s standard deviations of pitch and vbms at stations 2 and 10 in head wave are respectively 3 35 17 45 and 17 72 larger than in starboard bow wave condition however although the sea state level ship speed and wave heading are the same for cases 5 and 6 the large scale model s standard deviations of pitch and vbms at stations 2 and 10 are respectively 29 12 23 48 and 24 73 lower than the small scale model results this indicates that the long crested waves would highly overestimate the statistical standard deviation of ship motions and loads even though sailing in a same sea state level the skewness and kurtosis of pitch motion are generally small apart from that the kurtosis of large scale model in head wave is 0 940 the skewness and kurtosis of large scale model s vbms are obviously deviation from the gaussian distribution due to the strong nonlinearity of ship responses in realistic sea waves especially for the vbm statistical results at bow where the kurtosis is 12 111 when sailing in head waves the comparisons of probability of exceedance for peaks of pitch and vbm between large and small scale model testing results are presented in figs 35 and 36 respectively as is seen the peaks of crest and trough of pitch motion are symmetrically distributed and only a slight asymmetry is observed at the tail of the distribution for all the three cases the largest pitch peaks show similar magnitude between large and small model in head wave conditions by comparing case 5 with 6 however the corresponding occurrence probability is lower for large scale model test the probability of exceedance of large scale model s pitch at low pitch peak value is generally much smaller than the small scale model result which explains the reason that the standard deviation of large scale model s pitch is 29 12 lower than small scale model result similar phenomenon can be also found by comparing the vbm results in cases 5 and 6 although the standard deviations of vbm in realistic sea waves are approximately 24 lower than those in tank waves the extreme vbm values in realistic sea waves are however much larger as found from the tail of vbm distribution especially at station 2 in the head wave case this means that rarely occurring events extreme loads are more frequently occurred in realistic sea waves than in tank waves thus the large scale model sea trial is a potential tool in the reproduction and investigation of rarely occurring events and nonlinear motions and loads of full scale ship sailing in seaways 7 conclusions in this study the vertical motion and load responses of a bow flare ship sailing in irregular waves are analyzed and compared both numerically and experimentally a 3d time domain hydroelasticity theory that includes the memory effect function considering froude krylov nonlinearity is developed for the prediction of hydroelastic responses of the ship in harsh waves small scale model tank tests and large scale model sea trial were successfully carried out to comprehensively understand ship hydroelastic responses in different wave fields based on the numerical and experimental study on ship response in harsh irregular waves the following conclusions are drawn 1 by comparing the results for ship sailing in regular waves the numerical ship vertical motions and vbm coincide well with experimental results for both time series and frequency domain rao results the high frequency impact loads amidships due to slamming and green water are also well estimated by the von karman momentum impact theory even though the water pile up and water exit effects during the slamming process are ignored 2 the retardation function based 3d time domain hydrodynamic method is reliable and demonstrated high efficiency in the calculation of ship hydroelastic responses in long crested irregular waves in general the numerical results in long crested irregular waves are well validated by tank model testing results the springing responses can be better reproduced in the numerical simulation rather than experiments since the model s surge motion is restrained in the numerical model and thus ship forward speed is steady 3 the numerical method overestimates the extreme pitch peak values compared with the tank experimental values which is probably due to the fact that the body surface nonlinearity is not considered in the calculation of radiation and diffraction forces in addition the asymmetric distributions of hogging and sagging peaks for vbm especially at bow are more obvious in the tank experimental results than the numerical results the numerical method evidently underestimates the total sagging vbm at bow which results in big difference in the kurtosis value of vbm at bow between experiment and numerical values 4 as a supplement to the traditional tank test the large scale model sea trial is a potential tool in the reproduction of nonlinear motions and loads acting on full scale ship operating in realistic sea waves although the statistical standard deviations of motion and loads in realistic sea waves are much lower than those in equivalent long crested wave state the extreme vbm values in realistic sea waves are much larger this indicates that some rarely occurring events e g extreme loads can be frequently suffered and observed in realistic sea waves than in artificially generated tank waves

22722,reduction of wave overtopping at urban coastal structures is a significant concern as uncontrolled flooding and the wave forces disrupt the daily flow of the urban life causing damage to people structures and economy however the design of these structures needs to consider the spatial and visual demands of the urban function that restrict the crest heights therefore crest modifications such as a storm wall a bullnose or a combined structure like stilling wave basin swb can be used to optimize the crest height for lower overtopping values although reduction factors of these modifications have been studied for sloped structures in eurotop 2016 there is relatively limited dataset regarding the vertical structures this paper presents the results of wave overtopping experiments for an urban vertical wall with low crested stilling wave basin structure with foreshore under impulsive wave conditions over 150 tests have been carried out using a model of a seawall and promenade combined structure based on the urban vertical seawall of kordon izmir a variety of design parameters such as the pattern of gaps blocking coefficients and promenade are investigated under constant hydraulic conditions to optimize swb design for this urban vertical wall structure the hydrodynamic conditions for overtopping experiments are designed to test the applicability of the empirical formulas of overtopping over vertical walls for impulsive waves in eurotop 2016 a method calculating reduction factors is determined for the finalized swb design for a broader spectrum of hydraulic boundary conditions 0 40 h m 0 d w 0 90 1 22 t m 1 0 2 02 s and 0 106 d w 0 20 m of the impulsive wave with 0 708 r c h m 0 2 091 keywords wave overtopping sea walls vertical structure stilling wave basin swb impulsive waves 1 introduction coastal zones with high population density such as coastal cities are vulnerable to storms and wave overtopping which hinders economic and social activities from time to time in extreme events the outcome becomes severe as significant damages might occur and human lives can be lost impacts of climate change are expected to reduce the resilience of coastal cities as the storms become intense with higher wave heights therefore extensive research has been carried out to increase the resilience of coastal areas through coastal protection structures by reducing the wave overtopping in turkey where the largest and economically important areas are coastal cities with highly urbanized shorelines the vulnerability associated with wave overtopping is significant in addition to the economic significance these shorelines have been an essential part of the social fabric as social and recreational activities take place frequently the shoreline of turkish coastal cities typically consists of a promenade protected by either revetments or seawalls kordon in izmir is a well known example of seawall and promenade see fig 1 behind the promenade main city roads and apartment buildings including shops and restaurants are present as the promenade is dominantly used for recreational purposes very low wall heights usually less than 50 cm are designed to satisfy the visual quality table 1 shows the characteristics of the cross sections of kordon seawall and promenade which are measured at seven different locations 1 7 in fig 1b from these cross sections a simplified representative cross section is defined for the experimental tests table 1 however during storm conditions usually every winter these promenades and the adjacent areas are flooded as the crest of the seawall is not high enough to reduce the wave overtopping fig 2 although increasing the crest heights of these structures would be the most straightforward measure to implement people and the local governments do not accept any obstruction to the scenery additionally urbanized shoreline usually restricts the landward spatial extension therefore other measures such as the landward expansion of the promenade cannot be applied stilling wave basin swb concept is one measure that can be designed to consider both the spatial and visual restrictions as the wave energy is dissipated between a partially permeable seaward wall and a landward wall where both walls can be designed with low heights the promenade can be utilized as the basin between the walls during the winter storm conditions with no allowance for public use stilling wave basin swb on the crest of smooth dike slopes under non breaking conditions have been studied and their effect on wave overtopping is presented in eurotop 2016 eurotop 2016 also presents several key points for wave overtopping at vertical structures such as seawalls the influence of the foreshore wave breaking conditions and low crest heights are taken into consideration and related design formulas are presented however the combination of seawalls and stilling wave basin on the crest has not been studied much to the best knowledge of the authors as more urban coastal areas are expected to experience changes in the hydrodynamic conditions due to climate change the level of overtopping is also expected to deviate from the initial design considerations therefore modification to the present structures will be required for many urban areas and swb might be an effective solution for locations similar to kordon izmir therefore the primary objective of this study is to present and discuss the wave overtopping at a seawall with low crested swb modification with foreshore as an alternative to modifications with higher crest heights for urban coastal areas to achieve the main objective at first the design of low crested swb structure is optimized specifically for the simplified model of urban seawall of kordon izmir table 1 then over 150 2d model tests have been carried out for a broader range of hydrodynamic conditions to analyze wave overtopping under impulsive wave conditions as described in eurotop 2016 for a vertical wall as well as swb modification to the urban vertical wall although the experiments are performed for one optimized cross section design of swb results of the broader spectrum of hydrodynamic conditions highlight the possible use of swb modification across different locations a comprehensive literature study about swb is given in section 2 a detailed overview of the design and execution procedure of the experiments and of the test database is presented in section 3 the test matrix was based on a broader spectrum of hydraulic boundary conditions which also cover the condition along the kordon seawall and promenade in izmir bay the overtopping type and characteristics were discussed in section 4 then the optimized swb design was tested using the whole test matrix of the vertical wall experiments to determine the reduction factor γswb 2 literature study in the literature methods of quantifying the wave overtopping discharge are widely discussed in many guidance manuals such as taw 2002 eurotop 2007 2016 in addition to the national guidelines of many countries one of the widely used guidelines is eurotop 2016 which presents the latest techniques and approved methods for establishing overtopping hazards and flooding for an extensive range of structure types one of the earliest formula on wave overtopping discharge is based on owen 1980 the general form of wave overtopping discharge q on many kinds of structures see fig 3 can be described as in equation 1 in which q decreases exponentially as the crest freeboard r c increases 1 q g h m o 3 a e x p b r c h m 0 where h m 0 is the spectral significant wave height and a and b are fitting coefficients the equation gives a straight line on a log linear graph with two coefficients for fitting the data early work by franco et al 1994 proposed a 0 2 and b 4 3 for relatively deep water while allsop et al 1995 determined a 0 05 and b 2 78 in conditions of shallower water when equation 1 is applied in the case of vertical structures however it is not possible to describe all hydrodynamic conditions in front of a vertical seawall by simple exponential form equations like equation 1 allsop et al 1995 used data from model studies where wave breaking occurred on the structure to propose a new empirical equation showing a power law decrease in overtopping discharge with freeboard rather than an exponential one therefore a discriminating parameter h was introduced equation 2 to determine whether an exponential or a power law should be used 2 h 1 35 h h m 0 2 π h g t m 1 0 2 the h parameter is used as a measure of impulsiveness with a transition from non impulsive to impulsive overtopping conditions at the wall taking place over the range 0 2 h 0 3 0 van der meer and bruce 2014 based on the variation of h parameter a comprehensive method for wave overtopping at vertical seawalls was proposed in eurotop 2007 as follows non impulsive condition h 0 3 3 q g h m 0 3 0 04 e x p 2 6 r c h m 0 0

performed in light of available datasets such as clash de rouck et al 2009 and the results lead to new considerations on wave overtopping for vertical walls for example goda 2000 showed significant peaks for some shallower relative water depths and found that local water depth on a foreshore is important in the new edition of the eurotop 2016 the standard equations for wave overtopping at vertical walls as described in the first edition of eurotop 2007 were reformulated the aim was to integrate the proposed equations into a more unified physically rational framework of prediction tools spanning a greater breadth of structure types and wave conditions the principal changes in eurotop 2016 are i a clear separation of situations based upon the existence of an influencing foreshore in front of the vertical structure ii an adjusted discriminator to identify impulsive overtopping conditions is used by replacing the previous h parameter iii a clearer integration of methods for composite vertical structures with plain vertical structures the newly proposed formulas in eurotop 2016 are described below no influence of foreshore deep water h l i 0 5 at the location of the

wave steepness 2 π h m 0 g t m 1 0 2 for a design or assessment approach it is strongly recommended to increase the average discharge by about one standard deviation σ thus equation 10 and equation 11 presented below should be used in design and safety assessments 10 q g h m 0 3 0 0155 h m 0 h s m 1 0 0 5 e x p 2 2 r c h m 0 0 1 r c h m 0 1 35 11 q g h m 0 3 0 0020 h m 0 h s m 1 0 0 5 r c h m 0 3 r c h m 0 1 35 all the proposed equations show that the amount of overtopping discharge strongly depends on the crest freeboard r c under constant hydraulic conditions therefore increasing r c seems to be a solution for reducing the overtopping discharges however direct implementation of this solution may not be possible for some locations where the stakeholders are against higher crest heights due to visual implications additionally landward expansion of the seawall might be impossible since buildings are often close to the seawall geeraerts et al 2006 to overcome these limitations the crest modifications of the vertical seawalls can be designed as a stilling wave basin swb eurotop 2016 defined stilling wave basin as an area designed in front of the crest or capping wall where a part of the up rushing wave may remain without overtopping the swb is made up of a partially permeable seaward storm wall a sloping promenade basin and a landward storm wall the seaward storm wall may consist of a double row of shifted storm walls or a single storm wall with some gaps to allow drainage of the water in the basin landward and seaward storm walls may have bullnose geometries of different angles geeraerts et al 2006 van doorslaer et al 2009 this crest design is based on the principle of energy dissipation the incoming wave dissipates most of its energy by hitting the seaward storm wall and through the basin before it reaches the landward storm wall consequently the landward wall is overtopped less in comparison with an unmodified crest even though the crest height has not been increased van doorslaer et al 2015 the swb concept was used in different configurations with coastal protection structures as follows a swb concept of sloping structures the application of swb at the top of smooth impermeable dikes was first described by aguado and sànchez naverac 1978 and was even tested for run up performance by ceniceros and medina 2001 then the first systematic model studies for overtopping performance was made by aminti and franco 2001 the data by aminti and franco were then re analyzed by cuomo et al 2005 to compare them with the prediction computations of the clash neural network they proposed a reduction factor due to the swb as a function of the relative basin s dimensions on the basis of physical 2 d model tests burcharth and andersen 2006 discussed the design and performance of breakwaters with the front reservoir and the sensitivity of the overtopping discharge to the width of the reservoir fig 4 it is demonstrated that breakwater cross sections with the front reservoir are very efficient and economical when low structure crest levels are demanded geeraerts et al 2006 investigated the application of swb at the top of smooth impermeable dikes to reduce wave overtopping fig 5 fig 5a shows both a standard dike and a dike with swb built in the crest where both structures have the same crest heights the influence of geometric variations of swb on top of a dike on wave overtopping can be summarized as van doorslaer et al 2015 grossi et al 2015 the effect of the height of the seaward wall γ w a l l is dominant while the effect of the basin s width γ p r o m e n a d e is present but less pronounced the slope angle and the wave period have a minor influence on the reduction of wave overtopping a reduction factor of γ s w b is found to be around 0 45 for swb geometry and can be used to quantify wave overtopping over a dike slope with swb eurotop 2016 kortenhaus et al 2007 introduced the concept of crest drainage dike by installing an overtopping buffer basin in the dike crest this concept was developed by nieuwenhuis et al 2005 initiated by the european comcoast project to reduce the wave load and wave overtopping of a dike overtopping buffer basin is a concrete u profile which serves as a swb in the dike crest fig 6 most of the overtopping water will be collected in this buffer basin and water will drain out through drainage pipes towards landward or seaward side of the dike between overtopping events they mentioned that the seaward drainage systems could be preferable in extreme events since it could drain more water than landward drainage designs cappietti and aminti 2012 experimentally measured the wave overtopping on scale models of rubble mound marina breakwaters to assess the effectiveness of building an overspill basin in front of the breakwater wave wall fig 7 the concept of swb and overspill basin has similar characteristics they observed that the design with swb decreases overtopping by up to a factor of 2 compared to a classically shaped breakwater within the range of experimental conditions tested veale et al 2012 and altomare et al 2014 performed wave overtopping and pressure tests to determine the optimal geometry of wave return walls to be constructed on the existing sloping sea dike at wenduine belgium for overtopping tests they considered three cases i a storm wall located either at the seaward ii at the landward edge of the vertical dike and iii both storm walls together which is defined as stilling wave basin swb fig 8 they indicated that the storm wall located at the landward edge of the vertical dike showed a better performance for reducing mean overtopping discharge than the case where the storm wall located at the seaward edge however the best result was obtained from the swb case the storm surge protection spp wall kortenhaus et al 2002 which consists of an underwater stilling wave basin can be considered as another example of a related structure however it is not further discussed because of its different hydraulic effect b swb concept on vertical structures in the 1960s the principality of monaco built the vertical breakwater of fontvieille fig 9 with a swb at the crest this combination was designed to overcome the lack of hinterland and the significant water depths 30 40 m at the location of the breakwater bouchet 1992 this is one of the earliest examples of a swb concept combined with vertical structures similarly di risio et al 2006 studied vertical composite breakwaters with several different parapet walls and an overspill basin by means of a 2d physical model with the scale of 1 35 in non breaking wave conditions instead of the term stilling wave basin they used the term overspill basin the composite breakwater was made of a caisson over a quarry stone mound fig 10 they observed better overtopping performance with the parapet walls than using an overspill basin later crema et al 2009 conducted laboratory measurement of the wave by wave overtopping volumes and mean overtopping discharges at a plain vertical wall breakwater with and without an overspill basin to investigate the effect in the reduction of the wave overtopping discharges and volumes the model was tested for nine different configurations including the overspill basin in fig 11 of an almost non impulsive overtopping regime under irregular waves therefore they interpolated the experimental measurements by using the non impulsive formulation equation 3 for the plain vertical wall in eurotop 2007 where the reduction factor γ s w b 0 69 have been calibrated for the configuration with overspill basin 12 q g h m 0 3 0 04 e x p 2 6 r c h m 0 1 γ s w b γ s w b 0 69 is related to the experimental ranges in 1 18 r c h m 0 1 85 within the range of the experiments they concluded that the effect of the overspill basin in reducing the mean overtopping discharges is poor this is mainly due to the use of a smaller capacity basin which is built by considering a relatively lower seaward storm wall the reduction factor γ s w b for the overtopping discharge due to the swb depends on parameters like basin height width and permeability therefore it is difficult to set a single value of γ s w b since geometry may vary a lot however it is possible to define the swb geometry based on a parametric survey study in addition the literature on swb dominantly focuses on sloped structures such as dikes according to the authors knowledge the information for the combined vertical structures with a swb crest modification is limited and the existing ones mainly considered the non breaking wave conditions therefore there is still a research gap on the reduction coefficient γ s w b for swb crest modification of vertical seawalls under the breaking wave condition 3 methodology the experimental work is primarily designed to understand the wave overtopping over a low crested swb structure on a vertical seawall located at an urban coastal area therefore a parametric survey study of swb geometry is performed to optimize the cross section of swb for lower overtopping values considering the limitations due to being part of urban fabric such as low crest heights for visual aesthetics the optimization tests for swb modification were performed under the wave condition used in the initial design of the vertical wall then both the optimized swb cross section and the initial vertical seawall were tested under a boarder range of hydrodynamic conditions impulsive conditions to highlight the possible effects of the performance of such crest modification across different urban areas physical model tests have been carried out in the wave flume of coastal and harbour engineering laboratory department of civil engineering of middle east technical university metu turkey the wave flume is 26 m in length 6 m in width and 1 0 m in depth an inner channel with glass side walls 18 m in length 1 5 m in width is constructed in the wave flume to reduce the size of the cross section and the effects of reflection occurring due to concrete sidewalls fig 12 a and fig 13 a a slope of plastic wire scrubbers acting as wave absorbers is installed at the end of the flume as passive absorption system figs 12b and 13b a piston type wavemaker which is capable of generating irregular waves at water depths of 0 30 0 60 m is placed at the other end of the wave flume the wavemaker frequency is between 0 05 hz and 2 0 hz and the maximum stroke length is 290 mm each time series of the experiments contained 500 irregular waves with bretschneider spectrum romano et al 2015 stated that a wave train of at least 500 waves could be used in overtopping tests to achieve a comparable accuracy for which the confidence interval difference is less than 20 with those obtained for 1000 waves the froude model scale was set as 1 16 after considering possible water depth in the flume and wavemaker capacity to ensure correct reproduction of all wave processes the model was instrumented with ten wave gauges and three video cameras were used to capture the wave overtopping process the overtopped water was collected in an overtopping tank figs 12c and 13c the models were located 18 m away from the wave paddle on a uniform foreshore slope 1 s f fig 12d the set up was used to analyze i the case without structure ii the simple vertical seawall model a iii the optimization of swb cross section of a vertical seawall and iv the vertical seawall with optimized swb model b the models were built from wooden and plastic materials fig 13d the incident waves at the location of the structure i e undisturbed wave conditions generated using the set up without the structure were used to calculate the wave overtopping the incident spectral significant wave heights h m 0 and wave periods t m 1 0 were measured at wave gauges 8 9 and 10 fig 12 by utilizing the standard 3 gauge procedure of mansard and funke 1980 while l was determined by linear wave theory for any depth h m 0 l is the wave steepness based on spectral wave height and period there are a number of different measurement techniques which enable a direct quantification of wave overtopping e g kortenhaus et al 2004 troch et al 2004 in this study the overtopped water was collected over a specific crest width that drained into a tank down a chute the accumulated water in the tank was measured at the end of each test and the mean wave overtopping discharge q m 3 s p e r m width was calculated 3 1 vertical seawall model a fig 14 shows the details of the simple vertical seawall model model a which represents the simplified model of the existing kordon seawall and promenade in izmir turkey kisacik et al 2017 here d c is the water depth at the paddle f t is the foreshore slab thickness d w is the water depth at the structure d f is the vertical distance between swl and promenade h b is the seaward storm wall height w b is the seaward storm wall width and x r is the horizontal width of the promenade the seaward storm wall is one piece of continuous wall without gaps on it the total crest freeboard is r c h b d f the geometric dimensions of the simple vertical seawall model model a table 2 are scaled from the dimensions of the representative cross sections along the kordon seawall and promenade table 1 3 2 optimization of swb for an urban seawall to optimize the swb cross section with lower overtopping discharge in an urban setting the parametric survey considered several parameters that control the amount of the overtopping water such as the pattern of the gaps in the storm walls the blocking coefficients c b the storm wall order the horizontal gap between the seaward storm walls δ x the horizontal width of the promenade x r the height of the landward storm wall h r and the height of the seaward storm wall h b fig 15 shows the different configurations of swb table 3 at the model scale at a constant water depth d w 0 163 m and d f 0 047 m since swb is proposed as a crest modification to a present vertical seawall the test hydrodynamic condition was kept constant h m 0 0 827 m and t m 1 0 1 33 s which reflects the 100 year return period storm condition of izmir bay used in the design of the vertical seawall horizontal and vertical dimensions are normalized with deep water wave length l m 1 0 and wave height h m 0 at the model location respectively for each set up the cumulative overtopping discharge per meter q l m after 500 waves is presented in table 3 although the reduction in the overtopping discharge as discussed in this section was the main focus in optimization the aesthetic considerations imposed by the urban setting such as the height of storm walls limit the range of dimensions to be tested for the optimization of swb therefore it is important to state that the optimized swb structure model b modeled from the parametric study is not optimized for lowest overtopping values under the hydrodynamic condition tested but it is an optimized design for lower wave overtopping for urban settings with similar functions and uses compared to the use of high crested structures each tested parameter and the respective configurations named as cases a g are described below for cases a e the heights of the seaward and landward storm walls are kept constant h b h m 0 h r h m 0 0 363 for cases e g the seaward storm wall arrangement is kept constant as two rows of walls where the front wall has c b 66 7 the second wall has c b 33 and the distance between the two rows are δ x l m 1 0 0 014 m a the arrangements of the block units of the seaward storm wall are defined as the pattern of gaps from fine to very coarse four different patterns were considered fig 15a in the pattern analysis a constant blocking coefficient of c b 50 and the wall height of h r h m 0 0 363 was used for all the patterns limited variations were observed among the tested patterns row a in fig 15 therefore it is concluded that the influence of pattern variations is negligible b the blocking coefficient c b is the ratio of the closed part of the seaward storm wall for a proper design the structure should allow inflow to the basin as low as possible while maximum outflow from the basin four different blocking coefficients c b 33 50 66 7 and 76 6 were considered through the optimization process fig 15b increasing the c b resulted in lower overtopping discharge row b in fig 15 however it was observed that rapid drainage was not maintained for the highest c b therefore a blocking coefficient of c b 66 7 for the most seaward wall was determined as optimal c two rows of the wall were further considered to increase the reduction of the wave overtopping compared to cases a and b as it is mentioned above the blocking coefficient of the outer seaward storm wall was c b 66 7 then the blocking coefficient of the second row is arranged such that walls on the second row mirror the gaps of the first row without any overlap this leads to a blocking coefficient of c b 33 3 100 66 7 33 3 for the second row then the order of the rows was changed and tests were repeated fig 15c it was observed that the order of the rows did not have any significant influence on the results row c in fig 15 d four different values for the horizontal gap between the rows of the seaward storm walls δ x l m 1 0 0 007 0 011 0 014 a n d 0 018 for l m 1 0 2 759 m were considered fig 15d variation of δ x did not generate a significant difference on the amount of overtopping discharge row d in fig 15 as accumulated water over the promenade from previous overtopping events may have a negative influence on the wave overtopping measured at the landward storm wall an optimal value δ x l m 1 0 0 014 was defined which was observed to allow rapid drainage e the horizontal width of the promenade x r has an influence by reducing the energy of the flow on the sloping promenade as the water reaches to the landward storm wall additionally increasing the storage capacity of this area that acts like a basin decreases the overtopping discharge optimization tests were performed for three different normalized values of x r l m 1 0 0 127 0 181 a n d 0 232 where l m 1 0 2 759 m fig 15e the results from x r l m 1 0 0 181 a n d 0 232 were close to each other row e in fig 15 x r l p 0 0 181 was defined as an optimal value in light of the spatial limitations for urban areas f the landward storm wall height h r is another critical parameter for the optimization veale et al 2012 mentioned that the stakeholders accept the wall height not more than 0 7 m for aesthetic reasons therefore optimization tests considered three different normalized h r values h r h m 0 0 363 0 484 a n d 0 605 where h m0 0 0827 m although the case of h r h m 0 0 605 had the least overtopping discharge row f in fig 15 h r h m 0 0 484 was selected as an optimal value considering the visual implications and the stakeholder acceptance h r h m 0 0 529 g the seaward storm wall height h b is the last parameter considered in the optimization process similar to the landward storm wall height h b must be designed as low as possible for community acceptance but must also restrict the overtopping by limiting mean overtopping discharge to tolerable discharge criteria tests were done for three different normalized wall heights h b h m 0 0 242 0 363 a n d 0 484 and h b h m 0 0 484 was selected as the final dimension which meets the stakeholder expectations while limiting the overtopping discharge row g in fig 15 3 3 vertical seawall with optimized swb model model b fig 16 shows the details of the vertical seawall with swb model model b the partially permeable seaward storm wall consists of a double row of shifted storm walls 1 wall and 2 wall with a horizontal gap δ x the layout of the seaward storm walls is determined with a blocking coefficient c b which is the ratio of the closed parts to the whole width of each row of shifted storm walls the promenade is located behind the storm walls with a seaward slope 1 s r 1 40 which is the standard value of the cross slope of a public road h r is the height of the landward storm wall which is located at the end of the promenade the landward storm wall is sloped seaward direction with a 45 angle the total crest freeboard r c is the vertical distance between swl and the crest of the h r the results of the parametric survey discussed in detail in section 3 2 was used to optimize the design of model b table 4 fig 16 shows the dimensions of the finalized design of model b which was tested for a broader range of hydrodynamic conditions to assess the reduction in wave overtopping 3 4 test matrix the test matrix is based on hydraulic boundary conditions present along the kordon seawall and promenade in izmir ozyurt tarakcıoglu et al 2015 but opened up to a broader spectrum of relevant parameters to have a good base for analysis e g from small to large wave periods from small to large dimensionless freeboards of a reduction factor for swb structures both model a and model b were tested with irregular waves for six different water depths d c for each water depth six different values of wave periods t m 1 0 measured in front of the seawall were considered three different h b values were assessed in model a setup through 78 successful tests which result in three different sets of r c r c1 r c2 and r c3 then twenty six tests repeated twice were successfully performed for model b with a fixed cross section geometry table 6 shows the whole test matrix for irregular waves 0 067 h m 0 0 114 m 1 22 t m 1 0 2 02 s and 0 106 d w 0 200 m 4 overtopping characteristics the wave condition at a vertical seawall may be non impulsive sometimes referred to as pulsating or impulsive breaking non impulsive waves result in green water overtopping whereas impulsive waves result in violent splash or spray type overtopping however the combination of swb at the crest of a vertical seawall tested in this research is expected to affect the type and characteristics of overtopping that is usually observed on simple vertical walls fig 17 shows five photos in a sequence indicating the developments of water surface variations during overtopping through the crest of a vertical seawall with a swb these photographs are obtained from camera recordings photographs a1 and b1 depict the test set up with drawings the horizontal white line in the middle represents the level of still water level swl the free water surface at the starting instant is marked with a white color fig 17 a1 to a5 show the free surface profiles of an approaching non impulsive wave the approaching wave is tending to break the water level on the wall starts below the swl and it rises to the level fig 17 a1 accelerated water which is rising on the vertical wall reaches the impact point before the arrival of the approaching wave crest therefore the approaching wave cannot break and it is a non impulsive wave then the following wave run up levels are high enough for the water to reach and pass over the crest of the seaward storm walls fig 17 a2 this is defined as the green water overtopping case where a continuous sheet of water passes over the crest of the seaward storm walls then the incoming wave dissipates most of its energy by hitting the seaward storm wall and through the basin before it reaches the landward storm wall fig 17 a3 a secondary impact occurs on the landward storm wall fig 17 a4 however this impact is different from the first one and creates a splash type overtopping fig 17 a5 finally accumulated water in the basin evacuates back through the double row of shifted seaward storm walls from this example it is seen that even if the overtopping starts as a green water overtopping type at the seaward storm wall it may end up as a splash type overtopping at the landward storm wall where the overtopping water is collected this shift will be influenced by the amount of the green water overtopping discharge from the seaward storm walls and the drainage capacity of the basin fig 17 b1 to b5 shows the free surface profiles of an approaching impulsive wave the onset of breaking occurs at a distance before the wall location fig 17 b1 white spikes are evidence that waves already start to lose some energy the wave collides on the vertical seawall with a more parallel or curved face air is enclosed in the curve of the wave face wave crest and trapped air break up into pieces very soon and sends splashes sprays fig 17 b2 these droplets are carried over the sloping promenade under their own momentum fig 17 b3 and b4 some of these droplets may pass the landward storm wall and other reflected back fig 17 b5 the splash and spray type overtopping will be strongly influenced by the onshore winds eurotop 2016 suggests a maximum increase of factor 3 4 for the lowest discharges however the effect of wind on this type of discharge was not modeled in this research 5 results the mean overtopping discharge q is a key design parameter for many coastal structures which are designed to limit overtopping below a selected admissible discharge van der meer and bruce 2014 therefore the mean overtopping discharge q is measured carefully from the collected water in the overtopping tank after each successful test the discussion on the simple vertical seawall model model a is presented as a reference case to calculate the reduction in overtopping due to swb model b then the effect of swb on overtopping is described as a reduction factor γ s w b discussion on tolerable overtopping discharge is included for a complete assessment of the effect of swb the test set up measuring devices and techniques were kept constant for both model a and model b experiments to guarantee good comparison and to diminish the model effects little or no scale effect is expected in the overtopping results of this research as measurements from large scale laboratory tests for steeply battered 10 1 and 5 1 near vertical walls under impulsive breaking conditions indicate that there is good agreement at both small and large scales pearson et al 2002 pullen et al 2004 and pearson et al 2001 also support these observations through a comparison of the field and laboratory measurements 5 1 overtopping at a vertical seawall model a model a serves as the reference case to determine the reduction factor of the stilling wave basin model b the measured overtopping values are used to plot the performance of model a to compare with simple vertical wall formulations of eurotop 2016 the test conditions are summarized in tables 2 and 7 for three different r c values all the tested waves break at the structure generating impulsive overtopping conditions d w 2 h m 0 l m 1 0 0 23 following the definitions given in eurotop 2016 data is within the range of 0 113 r c h m 0 1 924 in addition most of the data is defined as a low freeboard condition r c h m 0 1 35 the data points from high freeboard condition are marked with a in table 7 fig 18 shows the relative overtopping discharge q g h m 0 3 h m 0 d w s m 1 0 0 5 plotted against the relative freeboard r c h m 0 on model a following the approach presented in eurotop 2016 trend lines which are the regression means are fitted through the data for both low and high freeboard conditions the test results are compared to the predicted values using eqs 3 5 for eurotop 2007 and eqs 8 and 9 for eurotop 2016 fig 18 shows that the formulations of eurotop 2016 predict significantly better than the first edition of the manual eurotop 2007 the main differences between the two versions of the eurotop manual on vertical wall structures are enhanced in this research set up and conditions therefore better prediction capability of eurotop 2016 is highlighted on the other hand there are some differences between data trend lines and the mean value approach of eurotop 2016 model effect the differences in the number of waves in one run and the wave generation spectrum type will be the main source of the differences however the trend lines of the dataset fig 18 coincide with the results of equation 10 and equation 11 in eurotop 2016 which increase the average discharge by about one standard deviation σ for low and high freeboard conditions therefore one σ increased version of eurotop 2016 equation 10 and equation 11 is considered to represent data set 5 2 overtopping at the crest of the vertical seawall with swb model b the stilling wave basin model b is tested under the conditions summarized in table 5 and table 8 waves break at the structure and the dataset is within the reliability range of impulsive overtopping d w 2 h m 0 l m 1 0 0 23 low and high freeboard conditions data is within the range of 0 708 r c h m 0 2 091 most of the data is defined as a low freeboard condition r c h m 0 1 35 the data points from high freeboard condition are marked with a in table 8 and they are all below 0 01 l m s it is hard to determine one reduction formula that can be applied to swb since many variations in the geometry of the swb are possible therefore the optimized swb geometry of model b was tested under the identical hydrodynamic conditions that model a was tested table 7 to propose a reduction factor for structures with similar geometries the mean overtopping discharge was measured from the collected water in the tank however the mean overtopping discharge would be the result of either green water or splash spray type overtopping since both types may be observed during a run with 500 irregular wave train so it is hard to determine which type of overtopping is responsible for the accumulated water in the tank however it is seen that waves in the range of high freeboard condition r c h m 0 1 35 mainly result in splash or spray type of overtopping whereas waves in the range of low freeboard condition r c h m 0 1 35 mainly result in green water type overtopping the splash or spray type of overtopping discharges are q 0 01 l m s and their type are also confirmed by visual observations fig 19 shows the relative overtopping discharge q g h m 0 3 h m 0 d w s m 1 0 0 5 plotted against the relative freeboard r c h m 0 of the model b the green water type of overtopping is shown in the green color corresponding to low freeboard 0 708 r c h m 0 1 35 whereas splash spray type q 10 l m is shown in red color for high freeboard 1 35 r c h m 0 2 091 condition as it is discussed before one σ increased version of eurotop 2016 equations equation 10 and equation 11 can fairly estimate the regression mean of the measurements from model a therefore this line is used as the reference value to assess the impact of swb on overtopping discharge fig 19 shows the reduction impact of swb on the overtopping discharge for both the low and high freeboard conditions under the impulsive waves h 2 h m 0 l m 1 0 0 23 this effect of swb can be expressed by a reduction factor for every test case by comparing the measured discharge value of model b to the expected discharge value of model a for same freeboard condition r c h m 0 using the respective equation for low and high freeboard conditions as described below a for low freeboard condition 0 1 r c h m 0 1 35 the reference formula has an exponential form equation 10 and it can be re arranged as 13 1 0 0155 q g h m 0 3 h m 0 h s m 1 0 0 5 e x p 2 2 r c h m 0 the right side of the equation can be denoted as 14 y 1 0 0155 q g h m 0 3 h m 0 h s m 1 0 0 5 then the equation can be simply written as 15 y e x p 2 2 r c h m 0 after taking the natural logarithm of both sides the expression is re written as 16 ln y 2 2 r c h m 0 for a known r c h m 0 value the presence of the swb reduces the average overtopping discharge from y to y1 by a reduction factor r c h m 0 1 γ s w b 17 ln y 1 2 2 r c h m 0 1 γ s w b y is the calculated theoretical value from equation 16 while y1 is the value considering measured q from model b with swb then the reduction factor γ s w b for low freeboard condition can be written as 18 2 2 ln y 1 r c h m 0 γ s w b b for high freeboard condition r c h m 0 1 35 a similar procedure to low freeboard conditions is followed the reference formula equation 11 has a power form and it can be re arranged as 19 1 0 002 q g h

h m 0 value the presence of the swb reduces the average overtopping discharge from y to y 1 by a reduction factor r c h m 0 1 γ s w b 22 y 1 r c h m 0 1 γ s w b 3 y is the calculated theoretical value from equation 21 while y1 is value considering measured q from model b with swb then the reduction factor γ s w b for high freeboard condition can be written as 23 r c h m 0 y 2 1 3 γ s w b individual reduction factors obtained for the 26 tests on model b are calculated using equation 18 and equation 23 and the results are presented in table 8 fig 20 shows the variation of calculated reduction factors for both low and high freeboard conditions regression lines of reduction factors are drawn for low and high freeboard conditions to assess the sensitivity of the reduction factor to the change of freeboard equation 24 and equation 25 represent the regression means for low and high freeboard conditions the reduction factor variation is in the range of 0 39 γ s w b 0 62 and 0 05 γ s w b 0 31 respectively it is observed that swb designed as model b presents higher efficiency in reducing the overtopping for high freeboard conditions also for the tested swb geometry the reduction factor is more sensitive to the change of freeboard condition in the zone of high freeboard condition still the scatter of the data has to be considered low freeboard condition greenwater type 24 γ s w b l o w

eurotop equations equation 10 and equation 11 the new forms of non dimensionalised exponential and power form equations can be written as 26 q g h m 0 3 0 0155 h m 0 h s m 1 0 0 5 e x p 2 2 r c h m 0

swb data for low freeboard greenwater type and high freeboard splash spray type conditions in fig 21 within the parameters range a good agreement is observed for the specified geometry of the swb 5 3 tolerable overtopping for people tolerable overtopping discharge is the amount of water passing over a structure that is considered safe the structures presented in this paper are primarily designed and tested to limit overtopping that might cause flooding in an urban setting therefore the direct hazard of overtopping to people and cars is a meaningful discussion to consider since people have access to these structures all the time therefore the experimental results are discussed in light of the concept of a tolerable overtopping discharge for people and vehicles defined in eurotop 2016 as presented in table 9 tolerable overtopping strongly depends on wave height in addition to maximum overtopping volume fig 22 shows the variation of the overtopping discharge q l m s as a function of the spectral significant wave height h m 0 the plots compare the measured values of q from model a and model b with tolerable overtopping discharge limits for people proposed in eurotop 2016 in the experiments the wave heights ranged from 1 m to 2 m which corresponds to tolerable overtopping discharges from 20 t o 1 l m s respectively see table 9 however due to the absence of sufficient data it is not clear about the form of the function between h m 0 1 2 m eurotop 2016 as it is seen from the figure the measured values for model a are mostly above the tolerable values these results accurately depict the negative consequences of overtopping observed every year during winter storms kisacik et al 2017 however swb modification of model b significantly decreases the overtopping discharge for h m 0 1 6 m which enhances the applicability of such modification in real life it should be strongly noted that the values plotted in model b belong to overtopping behind the landward seawall not in the basin of the swb which is the promenade if such a modification is realized on site precautions must be taken to inform people about the use of promenade under storm conditions 6 conclusions over 150 tests have been carried out to investigate wave overtopping at a vertical wall with low crested stilling wave basin structure with foreshore and under impulsive conditions in an urban coastal area reduction of wave overtopping in the optimized swb modification compared to simple vertical seawall is discussed for a range of wave conditions correspond to impulsive conditions defined by eurotop 2016 conditions limiting the modification of existing coastal structures in urban settings for wave overtopping are reflected in the experiment design the performance of swb in terms of tolerable overtopping in an urban setting is also discussed for the tested hydrodynamic conditions a parametric survey with 23 different geometries was performed under constant hydrodynamic conditions 100 year return period storm condition of izmir bay to optimize swb geometry as a crest modification for the vertical seawall the results of the parametric study indicate that essential parameters in the design of swb are the height of the storm walls the number of rows on the seaward edge and an optimal blocking coefficient moreover as the width of the promenade increases its effect on wave overtopping decreases exponentially a simplified model of an existing seawall and promenade well known as kordon in izmir turkey was tested to analyze the performance of the structure under impulsive conditions these experiments showed that a single non impulsive wave generally produces green water overtopping at low freeboard condition whereas splash or spray type overtopping is seen at high freeboard condition for an impulsive wave however it was observed that the existence of swb changes the overtopping type and characteristics with swb two sequential overtopping types take place for one single wave the first one occurs on the seaward and the second one occurs on the landward storm walls and the overtopping type may shift from one type to the other one when it is passing from seaward to the landward walls the final measured overtopping discharge in the tank will belong to the second overtopping type which appears on the landward storm wall as both green water and splash spray types of overtopping was observed to occur in each run with a wave train of 500 irregular waves the green water type of overtopping corresponds to low freeboard 0 708 r c h m 0 1 35 whereas splash spray type corresponds for high freeboard 1 35 r c h m 0 2 091 condition differences between measured data trend lines and the mean value approach of eurotop 2016 were observed the model effect the differences in the number of waves and the wave generation spectrum type might be the primary sources of the differences however the trend lines of the experiment dataset coincide with the results of eurotop 2016 which increase the average discharge by about one standard deviation σ for low and high freeboard conditions the effect of swb modification is expressed by a reduction factor for every test case by comparing the measured discharge value of model b to the expected discharge value of model a for same freeboard condition r c h m 0 using the respective equations of eurotop 2016 regression mean lines of reduction factors are drawn for low and high freeboard conditions of individual reduction factors obtained for the 26 tests on model b low freeboard condition greenwater type

variation is in the range of 0 39 γ s w b 0 62 and 0 05 γ s w b 0 31 for low and high freeboard condition respectively the new forms of non dimensionalised exponential and power form equations are written as q g h m 0 3 0 0155 h m 0 h s m 1 0 0 5 e x p 2 2 r c h m 0 1 γ s w b l o w 0 708 r c h m 0 1 35 q g h m 0 3 0 0020 h m 0 hs m 1 0 0 5 r c h m 0 1 γ swb high 3 1 35 r c h m 0 2 09 this swb crest modification on vertical seawall performs similarly to dike modifications presented by cavani et al 1999 aminti and franco 2001 and geeraerts et al 2006 the reduction coefficient proposed in this study can be directly used with the formula of eurotop 2016 however it is specific to the test geometry for a general design optimization of the swb under different hydrodynamic conditions is also necessary although the reduction factors presented in this study has limited applicability for general design of swb both the parametric study and the reduction observed under broader hydrodynamic conditions indicate that modifying the crest of a vertical seawall with a double row shifted storm walls on the seaside a promenade and a landward storm wall with bullnose swb lead to a significant reduction of the overtopping discharge while preserving the original outline of the seawall and promenade it should also be noted that such innovative geometry of the overspill basin in an urban setting is relatively easy and cheap to be made especially in existing structures with large low crest berms where some rocks in front of the wave wall could be shifted seaward to create a higher outer crest and a rear dissipating basin grossi et al 2015 therefore swb modification of seawalls can be an efficient alternative solution to adapting to the possibility of higher overtopping

22722,reduction of wave overtopping at urban coastal structures is a significant concern as uncontrolled flooding and the wave forces disrupt the daily flow of the urban life causing damage to people structures and economy however the design of these structures needs to consider the spatial and visual demands of the urban function that restrict the crest heights therefore crest modifications such as a storm wall a bullnose or a combined structure like stilling wave basin swb can be used to optimize the crest height for lower overtopping values although reduction factors of these modifications have been studied for sloped structures in eurotop 2016 there is relatively limited dataset regarding the vertical structures this paper presents the results of wave overtopping experiments for an urban vertical wall with low crested stilling wave basin structure with foreshore under impulsive wave conditions over 150 tests have been carried out using a model of a seawall and promenade combined structure based on the urban vertical seawall of kordon izmir a variety of design parameters such as the pattern of gaps blocking coefficients and promenade are investigated under constant hydraulic conditions to optimize swb design for this urban vertical wall structure the hydrodynamic conditions for overtopping experiments are designed to test the applicability of the empirical formulas of overtopping over vertical walls for impulsive waves in eurotop 2016 a method calculating reduction factors is determined for the finalized swb design for a broader spectrum of hydraulic boundary

impulsive waves 1 introduction coastal zones with high population density such as coastal cities are vulnerable to storms and wave overtopping which hinders economic and social activities from time to time in extreme events the outcome becomes severe as significant damages might occur and human lives can be lost impacts of climate change are expected to reduce the resilience of coastal cities as the storms become intense with higher wave heights therefore extensive research has been carried out to increase the resilience of coastal areas through coastal protection structures by reducing the wave overtopping in turkey where the largest and economically important areas are coastal cities with highly urbanized shorelines the vulnerability associated with wave overtopping is significant in addition to the economic significance these shorelines have been an essential part of the social fabric as social and recreational activities take place frequently the shoreline of turkish coastal cities typically consists of a promenade protected by either revetments or seawalls kordon in izmir is a well known example of seawall and promenade see fig 1 behind the promenade main city roads and apartment buildings including shops and restaurants are present as the promenade is dominantly used for recreational purposes very low wall heights usually less than 50 cm are designed to satisfy the visual quality table 1 shows the characteristics of the cross sections of kordon seawall and promenade which are measured at seven different locations 1 7 in fig 1b from these cross sections a simplified representative cross section is defined for the experimental tests table 1 however during storm conditions usually every winter these promenades and the adjacent areas are flooded as the crest of the seawall is not high enough to reduce the wave overtopping fig 2 although increasing the crest heights of these structures would be the most straightforward measure to implement people and the local governments do not accept any obstruction to the scenery additionally urbanized shoreline usually restricts the landward spatial extension therefore other measures such as the landward expansion of the promenade cannot be applied stilling wave basin swb concept is one measure that can be designed to consider both the spatial and visual restrictions as the wave energy is dissipated between a partially permeable seaward wall and a landward wall where both walls can be designed with low heights the promenade can be utilized as the basin between the walls during the winter storm conditions with no allowance for public use stilling wave basin swb on the crest of smooth dike slopes under non breaking conditions have been studied and their effect on wave overtopping is presented in eurotop 2016 eurotop 2016 also presents several key points for wave overtopping at vertical structures such as seawalls the influence of the foreshore wave breaking conditions and low crest heights are taken into consideration and related design formulas are presented however the combination of seawalls and stilling wave basin on the crest has not been studied much to the best knowledge of the authors as more urban coastal areas are expected to experience changes in the hydrodynamic conditions due to climate change the level of overtopping is also expected to deviate from the initial design considerations therefore modification to the present structures will be required for many urban areas and swb might be an effective solution for locations similar to kordon izmir therefore the primary objective of this study is to present and discuss the wave overtopping at a seawall with low crested swb modification with foreshore as an alternative to modifications with higher crest heights for urban coastal areas to achieve the main objective at first the design of low crested swb structure is optimized specifically for the simplified model of urban seawall of kordon izmir table 1 then over 150 2d model tests have been carried out for a broader range of hydrodynamic conditions to analyze wave overtopping under impulsive wave conditions as described in eurotop 2016 for a vertical wall as well as swb modification to the urban vertical wall although the experiments are performed for one optimized cross section design of swb results of the broader spectrum of hydrodynamic conditions highlight the possible use of swb modification across different locations a comprehensive literature study about swb is given in section 2 a detailed overview of the design and execution procedure of the experiments and of the test database is presented in section 3 the test matrix was based on a broader spectrum of hydraulic boundary conditions which also cover the condition along the kordon seawall and promenade in izmir bay the overtopping type and characteristics were discussed in section 4 then the optimized swb design was tested using the whole test matrix of the vertical wall experiments to determine the reduction factor γswb 2 literature study in the literature methods of quantifying the wave overtopping discharge are widely discussed in many guidance manuals such as taw 2002 eurotop 2007 2016 in addition to the national guidelines of many countries one of the widely used guidelines is eurotop 2016 which presents the latest techniques and approved methods for establishing overtopping hazards and flooding for an extensive range of structure types one of the earliest formula on wave overtopping discharge is based on owen 1980 the general form of wave overtopping discharge q on many kinds of structures see fig 3 can be described as in equation 1 in which q decreases exponentially as the crest freeboard r c increases 1 q g h m o 3 a e x p b r c h m 0 where h m 0 is the spectral significant wave height and a and b are fitting coefficients the equation gives a straight line on a log linear graph with two coefficients for fitting the data early work by franco et al 1994 proposed a 0 2 and b 4 3 for relatively deep water while allsop et al 1995 determined a 0 05 and b 2 78 in conditions of shallower water when equation 1 is applied in the case of vertical structures however it is not possible to describe all hydrodynamic conditions in front of a vertical seawall by simple exponential form equations like equation 1 allsop et al 1995 used data from model studies where wave breaking occurred on the structure to propose a new empirical equation showing a power law decrease in overtopping discharge with freeboard rather than an exponential one therefore a discriminating parameter h was introduced equation 2 to determine whether an exponential or a power law should be used 2 h 1 35 h h m 0 2 π h g t m 1 0 2 the h parameter is used as a measure of impulsiveness with a transition from non impulsive to impulsive overtopping conditions at the wall taking place over the range 0 2 h 0 3 0 van der meer and bruce 2014 based on the variation of h parameter a comprehensive method for wave overtopping at vertical seawalls was proposed in eurotop 2007 as follows non impulsive condition h 0 3 3 q g h m 0 3 0 04 e x p 2 6 r c h m 0 0 1 r c h m 0 3 5 impulsive condition h 0 2 4 q h 2 g h 3 1 5 10 4 e x p h r c h m 0 3 1 0 03 h r c h m 0 1 0 broken waves 5 q h 2 g h 3 2 7 10 4 h r c h m 0 2 7 h r c h m 0 0 02 further research was performed in light of available datasets such as clash de rouck et al 2009 and the results lead to new considerations on wave overtopping for vertical walls for example goda 2000 showed significant peaks for some shallower relative water depths and found that local water depth on a foreshore is important in the new edition of the eurotop 2016 the standard equations for wave overtopping at vertical walls as described in the first edition of eurotop 2007 were reformulated the aim was to integrate the proposed equations into a more unified physically rational framework of prediction tools spanning a greater breadth of structure types and wave conditions the principal changes in eurotop 2016 are i a clear separation of situations based upon the existence of an influencing foreshore in front of the vertical structure ii an adjusted discriminator to identify impulsive overtopping conditions is used by replacing the previous h parameter iii a clearer integration of methods for composite vertical structures with plain vertical structures the newly proposed formulas in eurotop 2016 are described below no influence of foreshore deep water h l i 0 5 at the location of the structure l i is the wavelength calculated from the dispersion relation based on t m 1 0 at water depth h 6 q g h m 0 3 0 047 e x p 2 35 r c h m 0 1 3 influence of the foreshore but no wave breaking non impulsive h 2 h m 0 l m 1 0 0 23 7 q g h m 0 3 0 05 e x p 2 78 r c h m 0 where l m 1 0 being the deep water wavelength based on t m 1 0 l m 1 0 g t m 1 0 2 2 π waves break at the structure

wave steepness 2 π h m 0 g t m 1 0 2 for a design or assessment approach it is strongly recommended to increase the average discharge by about one standard deviation σ thus equation 10 and equation 11 presented below should be used in design and safety assessments 10 q g h m 0 3 0 0155 h m 0 h s m 1 0 0 5 e x p 2 2 r c h m 0 0 1 r c h m 0 1 35 11 q g h m 0 3 0 0020 h m 0 h s m 1 0 0 5 r c h m 0 3 r c h m 0 1 35 all the proposed equations show that the amount of overtopping discharge strongly depends on the crest freeboard r c under constant hydraulic conditions therefore increasing r c seems to be a solution for reducing the overtopping discharges however direct implementation of this solution may not be possible for some locations where the stakeholders are against higher crest heights due to visual implications additionally landward expansion of the seawall might be impossible since buildings are often close to the seawall geeraerts et al 2006 to overcome these limitations the crest modifications of the vertical seawalls can be designed as a stilling wave basin swb eurotop 2016 defined stilling wave basin as an area designed in front of the crest or capping wall where a part of the up rushing wave may remain without overtopping the swb is made up of a partially permeable seaward storm wall a sloping promenade basin and a landward storm wall the seaward storm wall may consist of a double row of shifted storm walls or a single storm wall with some gaps to allow drainage of the water in the basin landward and seaward storm walls may have bullnose geometries of different angles geeraerts et al 2006 van doorslaer et al 2009 this crest design is based on the principle of energy dissipation the incoming wave dissipates most of its energy by hitting the seaward storm wall and through the basin before it reaches the landward storm wall consequently the landward wall is overtopped less in comparison with an unmodified crest even though the crest height has not been increased van doorslaer et al 2015 the swb concept was used in different configurations with coastal protection structures as follows a swb concept of sloping structures the application of swb at the top of smooth impermeable dikes was first described by aguado and sànchez naverac 1978 and was even tested for run up performance by ceniceros and medina 2001 then the first systematic model studies for overtopping performance was made by aminti and franco 2001 the data by aminti and franco were then re analyzed by cuomo et al 2005 to compare them with the prediction computations of the clash neural network they proposed a reduction factor due to the swb as a function of the relative basin s dimensions on the basis of physical 2 d model tests burcharth and andersen 2006 discussed the design and performance of breakwaters with the front reservoir and the sensitivity of the overtopping discharge to the width of the reservoir fig 4 it is demonstrated that breakwater cross sections with the front reservoir are very efficient and economical when low structure crest levels are demanded geeraerts et al 2006 investigated the application of swb at the top of smooth impermeable dikes to reduce wave overtopping fig 5 fig 5a shows both a standard dike and a dike with swb built in the crest where both structures have the same crest heights the influence of geometric variations of swb on top of a dike on wave overtopping can be summarized as van doorslaer et al 2015 grossi et al 2015 the effect of the height of the seaward wall γ w a l l is dominant while the effect of the basin s width γ p r o m e n a d e is present but less pronounced the slope angle and the wave period have a minor influence on the reduction of wave overtopping a reduction factor of γ s w b is found to be around 0 45 for swb geometry and can be used to quantify wave overtopping over a dike slope with swb eurotop 2016 kortenhaus et al 2007 introduced the concept of crest drainage dike by installing an overtopping buffer basin in the dike crest this concept was developed by nieuwenhuis et al 2005 initiated by the european comcoast project to reduce the wave load and wave overtopping of a dike overtopping buffer basin is a concrete u profile which serves as a swb in the dike crest fig 6 most of the overtopping water will be collected in this buffer basin and water will drain out through drainage pipes towards landward or seaward side of the dike between overtopping events they mentioned that the seaward drainage systems could be preferable in extreme events since it could drain more water than landward drainage designs cappietti and aminti 2012 experimentally measured the wave overtopping on scale models of rubble mound marina breakwaters to assess the effectiveness of building an overspill basin in front of the breakwater wave wall fig 7 the concept of swb and overspill basin has similar characteristics they observed that the design with swb decreases overtopping by up to a factor of 2 compared to a classically shaped breakwater within the range of experimental conditions tested veale et al 2012 and altomare et al 2014 performed wave overtopping and pressure tests to determine the optimal geometry of wave return walls to be constructed on the existing sloping sea dike at wenduine belgium for overtopping tests they considered three cases i a storm wall located either at the seaward ii at the landward edge of the vertical dike and iii both storm walls together which is defined as stilling wave basin swb fig 8 they indicated that the storm wall located at the landward edge of the vertical dike showed a better performance for reducing mean overtopping discharge than the case where the storm wall located at the seaward edge however the best result was obtained from the swb case the storm surge protection spp wall kortenhaus et al 2002 which consists of an underwater stilling wave basin can be considered as another example of a related structure however it is not further discussed because of its different hydraulic effect b swb concept on vertical structures in the 1960s the principality of monaco built the vertical breakwater of fontvieille fig 9 with a swb at the crest this combination was designed to overcome the lack of hinterland and the significant water depths 30 40 m at the location of the breakwater bouchet 1992 this is one of the earliest examples of a swb concept combined with vertical structures similarly di risio et al 2006 studied vertical composite breakwaters with several different parapet walls and an overspill basin by means of a 2d physical model with the scale of 1 35 in non breaking wave conditions instead of the term stilling wave basin they used the term overspill basin the composite breakwater was made of a caisson over a quarry stone mound fig 10 they observed better overtopping performance with the parapet walls than using an overspill basin later crema et al 2009 conducted laboratory measurement of the wave by wave overtopping volumes and mean overtopping discharges at a plain vertical wall breakwater with and without an overspill basin to investigate the effect in the reduction of the wave overtopping discharges and volumes the model was tested for nine different configurations including the overspill basin in fig 11 of an almost non impulsive overtopping regime under irregular waves therefore they interpolated the experimental measurements by using the non impulsive formulation equation 3 for the plain vertical wall in eurotop 2007 where the reduction factor γ s w b 0 69 have been calibrated for the configuration with overspill basin 12 q g h m 0 3 0 04 e x p 2 6 r c h m 0 1 γ s w b γ s w b 0 69 is related to the experimental ranges in 1 18 r c h m 0 1 85 within the range of the experiments they concluded that the effect of the overspill basin in reducing the mean overtopping discharges is poor this is mainly due to the use of a smaller capacity basin which is built by considering a relatively lower seaward storm wall the reduction factor γ s w b for the overtopping discharge due to the swb depends on parameters like basin height width and permeability therefore it is difficult to set a single value of γ s w b since geometry may vary a lot however it is possible to define the swb geometry based on a parametric survey study in addition the literature on swb dominantly focuses on sloped structures such as dikes according to the authors knowledge the information for the combined vertical structures with a swb crest modification is limited and the existing ones mainly considered the non breaking wave conditions therefore there is still a research gap on the reduction coefficient γ s w b for swb crest modification of vertical seawalls under the breaking wave condition 3 methodology the experimental work is primarily designed to understand the wave overtopping over a low crested swb structure on a vertical seawall located at an urban coastal area therefore a parametric survey study of swb geometry is performed to optimize the cross section of swb for lower overtopping values considering the limitations due to being part of urban fabric such as low crest heights for visual aesthetics the optimization tests for swb modification were performed under the wave condition used in the initial design of the vertical wall then both the optimized swb cross section and the initial vertical seawall were tested under a boarder range of hydrodynamic conditions impulsive conditions to highlight the possible effects of the performance of such crest modification across different urban areas physical model tests have been carried out in the wave flume of coastal and harbour engineering laboratory department of civil engineering of middle east technical university metu turkey the wave flume is 26 m in length 6 m in width and 1 0 m in depth an inner channel with glass side walls 18 m in length 1 5 m in width is constructed in the wave flume to reduce the size of the cross section and the effects of reflection occurring due to concrete sidewalls fig 12 a and fig 13 a a slope of plastic wire scrubbers acting as wave absorbers is installed at the end of the flume as passive absorption system figs 12b and 13b a piston type wavemaker which is capable of generating irregular waves at water depths of 0 30 0 60 m is placed at the other end of the wave flume the wavemaker frequency is between 0 05 hz and 2 0 hz and the maximum stroke length is 290 mm each time series of the experiments contained 500 irregular waves with bretschneider spectrum romano et al 2015 stated that a wave train of at least 500 waves could be used in overtopping tests to achieve a comparable accuracy for which the confidence interval difference is less than 20 with those obtained for 1000 waves the froude model scale was set as 1 16 after considering possible water depth in the flume and wavemaker capacity to ensure correct reproduction of all wave processes the model was instrumented with ten wave gauges and three video cameras were used to capture the wave overtopping process the overtopped water was collected in an overtopping tank figs 12c and 13c the models were located 18 m away from the wave paddle on a uniform foreshore slope 1 s f fig 12d the set up was used to analyze i the case without structure ii the simple vertical seawall model a iii the optimization of swb cross section of a vertical seawall and iv the vertical seawall with optimized swb model b the models were built from wooden and plastic materials fig 13d the incident waves at the location of the structure i e undisturbed wave conditions generated using the set up without the structure were used to calculate the wave overtopping the incident spectral significant wave heights h m 0 and wave periods t m 1 0 were measured at wave gauges 8 9 and 10 fig 12 by utilizing the standard 3 gauge procedure of mansard and funke 1980 while l was determined by linear wave theory for any depth h m 0 l is the wave steepness based on spectral wave height and period there are a number of different measurement techniques which enable a direct quantification of wave overtopping e g kortenhaus et al 2004 troch et al 2004 in this study the overtopped water was collected over a specific crest width that drained into a tank down a chute the accumulated water in the tank was measured at the end of each test and the mean wave overtopping discharge q m 3 s p e r m width was calculated 3 1 vertical seawall model a fig 14 shows the details of

urban seawall to optimize the swb cross section with lower overtopping discharge in an urban setting the parametric survey considered several parameters that control the amount of the overtopping water such as the pattern of the gaps in the storm walls the blocking coefficients c b the storm wall order the horizontal gap between the seaward storm walls δ x the horizontal width of the promenade x r the height of the landward storm wall h r and the height of the seaward storm wall h b fig 15 shows the different configurations of swb table 3 at the model scale at a constant water depth d w 0 163 m and d f 0 047 m since swb is proposed as a crest modification to a present vertical seawall the test hydrodynamic condition was kept constant h m 0 0 827 m and t m 1 0 1 33 s which reflects the 100 year return period storm condition of izmir bay used in the design of the vertical seawall horizontal and vertical dimensions are normalized with deep water wave length l m 1 0 and wave height h m 0 at the model location respectively for each set up the cumulative overtopping discharge per meter q l m after 500 waves is presented in table 3 although the reduction in the overtopping discharge as discussed in this section was the main focus in optimization the aesthetic considerations imposed by the urban setting such as the height of storm walls limit the range of dimensions to be tested for the optimization of swb therefore it is important to state that the optimized swb structure model b modeled from the parametric study is not optimized for lowest overtopping values under the hydrodynamic condition tested but it is an optimized design for lower wave overtopping for urban settings with similar functions and uses compared to the use of high crested structures each tested

cases e g the seaward storm wall arrangement is kept constant as two rows of walls where the front wall has c b 66 7 the second wall has c b 33 and the distance between the two rows are δ x l m 1 0 0 014 m a the arrangements of the block units of the seaward storm wall are defined as the pattern of gaps from fine to very coarse four different patterns were considered fig 15a in the pattern analysis a constant blocking coefficient of c b 50 and the wall height of h r h m 0 0 363 was used for all the patterns limited variations were observed among the tested patterns row a in fig 15 therefore it is concluded that the influence of pattern variations is negligible b the blocking coefficient c b is the ratio of the closed part of the seaward storm wall for a proper design the structure should allow inflow to the basin as low as possible while maximum outflow from the basin four different blocking coefficients c b 33 50 66 7 and 76 6 were considered through the optimization process fig 15b increasing the c b resulted in lower overtopping discharge row b in fig 15 however it was observed that rapid drainage was not maintained for the highest c b therefore a blocking coefficient of c b 66 7 for the most seaward wall was determined as optimal c two rows of the wall were further considered to increase the reduction of the wave overtopping compared to cases a and b as it is mentioned above the blocking coefficient of the outer seaward storm wall was c b 66 7 then the blocking coefficient of the second row is arranged such that walls on the second row mirror the gaps of the first row without any overlap this leads to a blocking coefficient of c b 33 3 100 66 7 33 3 for the second row then the order of the rows was changed and tests were repeated fig 15c it was observed that the order of the rows did not have any significant influence on the results row c in fig 15 d four different values for the horizontal gap between the rows of the seaward storm walls δ x l m 1 0 0 007 0 011 0 014 a n d 0 018 for l m 1 0 2 759 m were considered fig 15d variation of δ x did not generate a significant difference on the amount of overtopping discharge row d in fig 15 as accumulated water over the promenade from previous overtopping events may have a negative influence on the wave overtopping measured at the landward storm wall an optimal value δ x l m 1 0 0 014 was defined which was observed to allow rapid drainage e the horizontal width of the promenade x r has an influence by reducing the energy of the flow on the sloping promenade as the water reaches to the landward storm wall additionally increasing the storage capacity of this area that acts like a basin decreases the overtopping discharge optimization tests were performed for three different normalized values of x r l m 1 0 0 127 0 181 a n d 0 232 where l m 1 0 2 759 m fig 15e the results from x r l m 1 0 0 181 a n d 0 232 were close to each other row e in fig 15 x r l p 0 0 181 was defined as an optimal value in light of the spatial limitations for urban areas f the landward storm wall height h r is another critical parameter for the optimization veale et al 2012 mentioned that the stakeholders accept the wall height not more than 0 7 m for aesthetic reasons therefore optimization tests considered three different normalized h r values h r h m 0 0 363 0 484 a n d 0 605 where h m0 0 0827 m although the case of h r h m 0 0 605 had the least overtopping discharge row f in fig 15 h r h m 0 0 484 was selected as an optimal value considering the visual implications and the stakeholder acceptance h r h m 0 0 529 g the seaward storm wall height h b is the last parameter considered in the optimization process similar to the landward storm wall height h b must be designed as low as possible for community acceptance but must also restrict the overtopping by limiting mean overtopping discharge to tolerable discharge criteria tests were done for three different normalized wall heights h b h m 0 0 242 0 363 a n d 0 484 and h b h m 0 0 484 was selected as the final dimension which meets the stakeholder expectations while limiting the overtopping discharge row g in fig 15 3 3 vertical seawall with optimized swb model model b fig 16 shows the details of the vertical seawall with swb model model b the partially permeable seaward storm wall consists of a double row of shifted storm walls 1 wall and 2 wall with a horizontal gap δ x the layout of the seaward storm walls is determined with a blocking coefficient c b which is the ratio of the closed parts to the whole width of each row of shifted storm walls the promenade is located behind the storm walls with a seaward slope 1 s r 1 40 which is the standard value of the cross slope of a public road h r is the height of the landward storm wall which is located at the end of the promenade the landward storm wall is sloped seaward direction with a 45 angle the total crest freeboard r c is the vertical distance between swl and the crest of the h r the results of the parametric survey discussed in detail in section 3 2 was used to optimize the design of model b table 4 fig 16 shows the dimensions of the finalized design of model b which was tested for a broader range of hydrodynamic conditions to assess the reduction in wave overtopping 3 4 test matrix the test matrix is based on hydraulic boundary conditions present along the kordon seawall and promenade in izmir ozyurt tarakcıoglu et al 2015 but opened up to a broader spectrum of relevant parameters to have a good base for analysis e g from small to large wave periods from small to large dimensionless freeboards of a reduction factor for swb structures both model a and model b were tested with irregular waves for six different water depths d c for each water depth six different values of wave periods t m 1 0 measured in front of the seawall were considered three different h b values were assessed in model a setup through 78 successful tests which result in three different sets of r c r c1 r c2 and r c3 then twenty six tests repeated twice were successfully performed for model b with a fixed cross section geometry table 6 shows the whole test matrix for irregular waves 0 067 h m 0 0 114 m 1 22 t m 1 0 2 02 s and 0 106 d w 0 200 m 4 overtopping characteristics the wave condition at a vertical seawall may be non impulsive sometimes referred to as pulsating or impulsive breaking non impulsive waves result in green water overtopping whereas impulsive waves result in violent splash or spray type overtopping however the combination of swb at the crest of a vertical seawall tested in this research is expected to affect the type and characteristics of overtopping that is usually observed on simple vertical walls fig 17 shows five photos in a sequence indicating the developments of water surface variations during overtopping through the crest of a vertical seawall with a swb these photographs are obtained from camera recordings photographs a1 and b1 depict the test set up with drawings the horizontal white line in the middle represents the level of still water level swl the free water surface at the starting instant is marked with a white color fig 17 a1 to a5 show the free surface profiles of an approaching non impulsive wave the approaching wave is tending to break the water level on the wall starts below the swl and it rises to the level fig 17 a1 accelerated water which is rising on the vertical wall reaches the impact point before the arrival of the approaching wave crest therefore the approaching wave cannot break and it is a non impulsive wave then the following wave run up levels are high enough for the water to reach and pass over the crest of the seaward storm walls fig 17 a2 this is defined as the green water overtopping case where a continuous sheet of water passes over the crest of the seaward storm walls then the incoming wave dissipates most of its energy by hitting the seaward storm wall and through the basin before it reaches the landward storm wall fig 17 a3 a secondary impact occurs on the landward storm wall fig 17 a4 however this impact is different from the first one and creates a splash type overtopping fig 17 a5 finally accumulated water in the basin evacuates back through the double row of shifted seaward storm walls from this example it is seen that even if the overtopping starts as a green water overtopping type at the seaward storm wall it may end up as a splash type overtopping at the landward storm wall where the overtopping water is collected this shift will be influenced by the amount of the green water overtopping discharge from the seaward storm walls and the drainage capacity of the basin fig 17 b1 to b5 shows the free surface profiles of an approaching impulsive wave the onset of breaking occurs at a distance before the wall location fig 17 b1 white spikes are evidence that waves already start to lose some energy the wave collides on the vertical seawall with a more parallel or curved face air is enclosed in the curve of the wave face wave crest and trapped air break up into pieces very soon and sends splashes sprays fig 17 b2 these droplets are carried over the sloping promenade under their own momentum fig 17 b3 and b4 some of these droplets may pass the landward storm wall and other reflected back fig 17 b5 the splash and spray type overtopping will be strongly influenced by the onshore winds eurotop 2016 suggests a maximum increase of factor 3 4 for the lowest discharges however the effect of wind on this type of discharge was not modeled in this research 5 results the mean overtopping discharge q is a key design parameter for many coastal structures which are designed to limit overtopping below a selected admissible discharge van der meer and bruce 2014 therefore the mean overtopping discharge q is measured carefully from the collected water in the overtopping tank after each successful test the discussion on the simple vertical seawall model model a is presented as a reference case to calculate the reduction in overtopping due to swb model b then the effect of swb on overtopping is described as a reduction factor γ s w b discussion on tolerable overtopping discharge is included for a complete assessment of the effect of swb the test set up measuring devices and techniques were kept constant for both model a and model b experiments to guarantee good comparison and to diminish the model effects little or no scale effect is expected in the overtopping results of this research as measurements from large scale laboratory tests for steeply battered 10 1 and 5 1 near vertical walls under impulsive breaking conditions indicate that there is good agreement at both small and large scales pearson et al 2002 pullen et al 2004 and pearson et al 2001 also support these observations through a comparison of the field and laboratory measurements 5 1 overtopping at a vertical seawall model a model a serves as the reference case to determine the reduction factor of the stilling wave basin model b the measured overtopping values are used to plot the performance of model a to compare with simple vertical wall formulations of eurotop 2016 the test conditions are summarized in tables 2 and 7 for three different r c values all the tested waves break at the structure generating impulsive overtopping conditions d w 2 h m 0 l m 1 0 0 23 following the definitions given in eurotop 2016 data is within the range of 0 113 r c h m 0 1 924 in addition most of the data is defined as a low freeboard condition r c h m 0 1 35 the data points from high freeboard condition are marked with a in table 7 fig 18 shows the relative overtopping discharge q g h m 0 3 h m 0 d w s m 1 0 0 5 plotted against the relative freeboard r c h m 0 on model a following the approach presented in eurotop 2016 trend lines which are the regression means are fitted through the data for both low and high freeboard conditions the test results are compared to the predicted values using eqs 3 5 for eurotop 2007 and eqs 8 and 9 for eurotop 2016 fig 18 shows that the formulations of eurotop 2016 predict significantly better than the first edition of the manual eurotop 2007 the main differences between the two versions of the eurotop manual on vertical wall structures are enhanced in this research set up and conditions therefore better prediction capability of eurotop 2016 is highlighted on the other hand there are some differences between data trend lines and the mean value approach of eurotop 2016 model effect the differences in the number of waves in one run and the wave generation spectrum type will be the main source of the differences however the trend lines of the dataset fig 18 coincide with the results of equation 10 and equation 11 in eurotop 2016 which increase the average discharge by about one standard deviation σ for low and high freeboard conditions therefore one σ increased version of eurotop 2016 equation 10 and equation 11 is considered to represent data set 5 2 overtopping at the crest of the vertical seawall with swb model b the stilling wave basin model b is tested under the conditions summarized in table 5 and table 8 waves break at the structure and the dataset is within the reliability range of impulsive overtopping d w 2 h m 0 l m 1 0 0 23 low and high freeboard conditions data is within the range of 0 708 r c h m 0 2 091 most of the data is defined as a low freeboard condition r c h m 0 1 35 the data points from high freeboard condition are marked with a in table 8 and they are all below 0 01 l m s it is hard to determine one reduction formula that can be applied to swb since many variations in the geometry of the swb are possible therefore the optimized swb geometry of model b was tested under the identical hydrodynamic conditions that model a was tested table 7 to propose a reduction factor for structures with similar geometries the mean overtopping discharge was measured from the collected water in the tank however the mean overtopping discharge would be the result of either green water or splash spray type overtopping since both types may be observed during a run with 500 irregular wave train so it is hard to determine which type of overtopping is responsible for the accumulated water in the tank however it is seen that waves in the range of high freeboard condition r c h m 0 1 35 mainly result in splash or spray type of overtopping whereas waves in the range of low freeboard condition r c h m 0 1 35 mainly result in green water type overtopping the splash or spray type of overtopping discharges are q 0 01 l m s and their type are also confirmed by visual observations fig 19 shows the relative overtopping discharge q g h m 0 3 h m 0 d w s m 1 0 0 5 plotted against the relative freeboard r c h m 0 of the model b the green water type of overtopping is shown in the green color corresponding to low freeboard 0 708 r c h m 0 1 35 whereas splash spray type q 10 l m is shown in red color for high freeboard 1 35 r c h m 0 2 091 condition as it is discussed before one σ increased version of eurotop 2016 equations equation 10 and equation 11 can fairly estimate the regression mean of the measurements from model a therefore this line is used as the reference value to assess the impact of swb on overtopping discharge fig 19 shows the reduction impact of swb on the overtopping discharge for both the low and high freeboard conditions under the impulsive waves h 2 h m 0 l m 1 0 0 23 this effect of swb can be expressed by a reduction factor for every test case by comparing the measured discharge value of model b to the expected discharge value of model a for same freeboard condition r c h m 0 using the respective equation for low and high freeboard conditions as described below a for low freeboard condition 0 1 r c h m 0 1 35 the reference formula has an exponential form equation 10 and it can be re arranged as 13 1 0 0155 q g h m 0 3 h m 0 h s m 1 0 0 5 e x p 2 2 r c h m 0 the right side of the equation can be denoted as 14 y 1 0 0155 q g h m 0 3 h m 0 h s m 1 0 0 5 then the equation can be simply written as 15 y e x p 2 2 r c h m 0 after taking the natural logarithm of both sides the expression is re written as 16 ln y 2 2 r c h m 0 for a known r c h m 0 value the presence of the swb reduces the average overtopping discharge from y to y1 by a reduction factor r c h m 0 1 γ s w b 17 ln y 1 2 2 r c h m 0 1 γ s w b y is the calculated theoretical value from equation 16 while y1 is the value considering measured q from model b with swb then the reduction factor γ s w b for low freeboard condition can be written as 18 2 2 ln y 1 r c h m 0 γ s w b b for high freeboard condition r c h m 0 1 35 a similar procedure to low freeboard conditions is followed the reference formula equation 11 has a power form and it can be re arranged as 19 1 0 002 q g h m 0 3 h m 0 h s m 1 0 0 5 r c h m 0 3 the right side of the equation can be denoted as 20 y 1 0 002 q g h m 0 3 h m 0 h s m 1 0 0 5 then the equation can be written as 21 y r c h m 0 3 for a known r c h m 0 value the presence of the swb reduces the average overtopping discharge from y to y 1 by a reduction factor r c h m 0 1 γ s w b 22 y 1 r c h m 0 1 γ s w b 3 y is the calculated theoretical value from equation 21 while y1 is value considering measured q from model b with swb then the reduction factor γ s w b for high freeboard condition can be written as 23 r c h m 0 y 2 1 3 γ s w b individual reduction factors obtained for the 26 tests on model b are calculated using equation 18 and equation 23 and the results are presented in table 8 fig 20 shows the variation of calculated reduction factors for both low and high freeboard conditions regression lines of reduction factors are drawn for low and high freeboard conditions to assess the sensitivity of the reduction factor to the change of freeboard equation 24 and equation 25 represent the regression means for low and high freeboard conditions the reduction factor variation is in the range of 0 39 γ s w b 0 62 and 0 05 γ s w b 0 31 respectively it is observed that swb designed as model b presents higher efficiency in reducing the overtopping for high freeboard conditions also for the tested swb geometry the reduction factor is more sensitive to the change of freeboard condition in the zone of high freeboard condition still the scatter of the data has to be considered low freeboard condition greenwater type 24 γ s w b l o w 0 0615 r c h m 0 0 577 0 708 r c h m 0 1 35 high freeboard condition splash spray type 25 γ s w b h i g h 0 3812 r c h m 0 0 828 1 35 r c h m 0 2 09 if equation 24 and equation 25 integrated into the eurotop equations equation 10 and equation 11 the new forms of non dimensionalised exponential and power form equations can be written as 26 q g h m 0 3 0 0155 h m 0 h s m 1 0 0 5 e x p 2 2 r c h m 0 1 γ s w b l o w 0 708 r c h m 0 1 35 27 q g h m 0 3 0 0020 h m 0 h s m 1 0 0 5 r c h m 0 1 γ s w b h i g h 3 1 35 r c h m 0 2 09 then trend lines from equation 26 and equation 27 are plotted with the swb data for low freeboard greenwater type and high freeboard splash spray type conditions in fig 21 within the parameters range a good agreement is observed for the specified geometry of the swb 5 3 tolerable overtopping for people tolerable overtopping discharge is the amount of water passing over a structure that is considered safe the structures presented in this paper are primarily designed and tested to limit overtopping that might cause flooding in an urban setting therefore the direct hazard of overtopping to people and cars is a meaningful discussion to consider since people have access to these structures all the time therefore the experimental results are discussed in light of the concept of a tolerable overtopping discharge for people and vehicles defined in eurotop 2016 as presented in table 9 tolerable overtopping strongly depends on wave height in addition to maximum overtopping volume fig 22 shows the variation of the overtopping discharge q l m s as a function of the spectral significant wave height h m 0 the plots compare the measured values of q from model a and model b with tolerable overtopping discharge limits for people proposed in eurotop 2016 in the experiments the wave heights ranged from 1 m to 2 m which corresponds to tolerable overtopping discharges from 20 t o 1 l m s respectively see table 9 however due to the absence of sufficient data it is not clear about the form of the function between h m 0 1 2 m eurotop 2016 as it is seen from the figure the measured values for model a are mostly above the tolerable values these results accurately depict the negative consequences of overtopping observed every year during winter storms kisacik et al 2017 however swb modification of model b significantly decreases the overtopping discharge for h m 0 1 6 m which enhances the applicability of such modification in real life it should be strongly noted that the values plotted in model b belong to overtopping behind the landward seawall not in the basin of the swb which is the promenade if such a modification is realized on site precautions must be taken to inform people about the use of promenade under storm conditions 6 conclusions over 150 tests have been carried out to investigate wave overtopping at a vertical wall with low crested stilling wave basin structure with foreshore and under impulsive conditions in an urban coastal area reduction of wave overtopping in the optimized swb modification compared to simple vertical seawall is discussed for a range of wave conditions correspond to impulsive conditions defined by eurotop 2016 conditions limiting the modification of existing coastal structures in urban settings for wave overtopping are reflected in the experiment design the performance of swb in terms of tolerable overtopping in an urban setting is also discussed for the tested hydrodynamic conditions a parametric survey with 23 different geometries was performed under constant hydrodynamic conditions 100 year return period storm condition of izmir bay to optimize swb geometry as a crest modification for the vertical seawall the results of the parametric study indicate that essential parameters in the design of swb are the height of the storm walls the number of rows on the seaward edge and an optimal blocking coefficient moreover as the width of the promenade increases its effect on wave overtopping decreases exponentially a simplified model of an existing seawall and promenade well known as kordon in izmir turkey was tested to analyze the performance of the structure under impulsive conditions these experiments showed that a single non impulsive wave generally produces green water overtopping at low freeboard condition whereas splash or spray type overtopping is seen at high freeboard condition for an impulsive wave however it was observed that the existence of swb changes the overtopping type and characteristics with swb two sequential overtopping types take place for one single wave the first one occurs on the seaward and the second one occurs on the landward storm walls and the overtopping type may shift from one type to the other one when it is passing from seaward to the landward walls the final measured overtopping discharge in the tank will belong to the second overtopping type which appears on the landward storm wall as both green water and splash spray types of overtopping was observed to occur in each run with a wave train of 500 irregular waves the green water type of overtopping corresponds to low freeboard 0 708 r c h m 0 1 35 whereas splash spray type corresponds for high freeboard 1 35 r c h m 0 2 091 condition differences between measured data trend lines and the mean value approach of eurotop 2016 were observed the model effect the differences in the number of waves and the wave generation spectrum type might be the primary sources of the differences however the trend lines of the experiment dataset coincide with the results of eurotop 2016 which increase the average discharge by about one standard deviation σ for low and high freeboard conditions the effect of swb modification is expressed by a reduction factor for every test case by comparing the measured discharge value of model b to the expected discharge value of model a for same freeboard condition r c h m 0 using the respective equations of eurotop 2016 regression mean lines of reduction factors are drawn for low and high freeboard conditions of individual reduction factors obtained for the 26 tests on model b low freeboard condition greenwater type γ s w b l o w 0 0615 r c h m 0 0 577 0 708 r c h m 0 1 35 high freeboard condition splash spray type γ s w b h i g h 0 3812 r c h m 0 0 828 1 35 r c h m 0 2 09 it is observed that the reduction factor variation is in the range of 0 39 γ s w b 0 62 and 0 05 γ s w b 0 31 for low and high freeboard condition respectively the new forms of non dimensionalised exponential and power form equations are written as q g h m 0 3 0 0155 h m 0 h s m 1 0 0 5 e x p 2 2 r c h m 0 1 γ s w b l o w 0 708 r c h m 0 1 35 q g h m 0 3 0 0020 h m 0 hs m 1 0 0 5 r c h m 0 1 γ swb high 3 1 35 r c h m 0 2 09 this swb crest modification on vertical seawall performs similarly to dike modifications presented by cavani et al 1999 aminti and franco 2001 and geeraerts et al 2006 the reduction coefficient proposed in this study can be directly used with the formula of eurotop 2016 however it is specific to the test geometry for a general design optimization of the swb under different hydrodynamic conditions is also necessary although the reduction factors presented in this study has limited applicability for general design of swb both the parametric study and the reduction observed under broader hydrodynamic conditions indicate that modifying the crest of a vertical seawall with a double row shifted storm walls on the seaside a promenade and a landward storm wall with bullnose swb lead to a significant reduction of the overtopping discharge while preserving the original outline of the seawall and promenade it should also be noted that such innovative geometry of the overspill basin in an urban setting is relatively easy and cheap to be made especially in existing structures with large low crest berms where some rocks in front of the wave wall could be shifted seaward to create a higher outer crest and a rear dissipating basin grossi et al 2015 therefore swb modification of seawalls can be an efficient alternative solution to adapting to the possibility of higher overtopping

22723,the adoption of liquefied natural gas lng as an alternative marine fuel is a promising solution for green shipping with potential extensive reduction of pollutant emissions the future development and spread of lng technologies for ship bunkering and fuel systems operation will necessarily need to face the safety issues associated with the high flammability of lng compared to conventional marine fuels in this study a comparative analysis of the inherent safety performance of the foreseen technologies for lng bunkering was performed moreover a comparison with conventional technologies based on marine diesel fuels was also carried out an inherent safety ranking based on overall indicators deriving from severity of consequences and credibility of loss of containment events was introduced the results allowed the identification of the inherently safer solutions for maritime fuel bunkering highlighting critical units and providing insights on the safety issues to be

demand is predicted to grow by 28 between 2015 and 2040 consequently carbon dioxide co2 emissions are projected to grow of about 0 6 on a yearly basis us energy information administration 2017 unless mitigation strategies are adopted this scenario is not compatible with the goal to limit global temperature increase below 2 c set by the paris agreement united nations 2015 transport represents almost a quarter of europe s greenhouse gas ghg emissions within this sector shipping is responsible for about 13 of eu s ghg emissions and of 2 2 of global ghg emissions as reported by european environment agency 2015 and by the third international maritime organization imo ghg study imo 2015a moreover since maritime activities are heavily dependent on diesel fuels maritime transportation is a major source of global emissions of sulfur sox and nitrogen oxides nox and contributes up to 8 and 15 to the respective overall emissions maragkogianni et al 2016 considerable efforts were made by international authorities over recent years to pursue the reduction of pollutant emissions increasing energy efficiency and shifting from conventional diesel fuels towards natural gas and renewable energy sources to achieve this goal imo has recently revised annex vi of marpol convention marpol 2006 introducing tight emission limits for sox nox and particulate matter pm requirements for fuels sulfur content and emissions abatement technologies installed on seagoing vessels were also introduced from an environmental perspective the adoption of liquefied natural gas lng as a ship fuel appears to be a viable solution to comply with the stringent emission regulations lng should allow reducing emissions of co2 up to 20 sox up to 100 nox up to 90 and pm up to 99 igu 2015 moreover the favorable price conditions make natural gas a sustainable alternative to traditional fuels therefore several studies dealt with the analysis of the environmental benefits related to the adoption of lng based technologies with respect to conventional diesel fuels in terms of emissions reduction in hybrid engines kavli et al 2017 or in the implementation of dual fuel engines stoumpos et al 2018 lepistö et al 2016 performed the analysis of energy efficiency and heat recovery through dynamic process simulation in lng fueled ships concerning economic aspects schinas and butler 2016 provided strategies to promote the commercial aspects related to the spread of lng technologies also addressing their feasibility life cycle assessment with particular reference to the analysis of air emissions was developed chatzinikolaou and ventikos 2015 tagliaferri et al 2017 allowing a more detailed analysis of energetic economic and environmental aspects however due to the high flammability of lng compared to conventional fuels for diesel engines safety aspects will become crucial for the development of green shipping based on lng technologies hence several works investigated safety issues involving lng operations alderman 2005 lee et al 2015 safety exclusion zones for lng bunkering sites jeong et al 2018 fire risk on board lng fueled vessels jeong et al 2017 kim et al 2014 risk profiles of different lng bunkering operations performed in port areas were assessed in specific risk studies carried out by dnv det norske veritas 2012 however a direct comparison among safety issues posed by different fueling alternatives is not present in the literature and a comparative safety assessment addressing both traditional diesel fuels such as fuel oil or marine gasoil and natural gas fueling systems is still lacking the use of lng in the marine sector is far from consolidated hence there is still a lack of harmonization in technical standards and regulations concerning the safety of lng maritime infrastructures along with limited information about safety performance of such installations a screening tool based on inherent safety principles kletz and amyotte 2010 driving the development of future projects would thus be crucial to support a safe and sustainable introduction of lng based technologies in maritime transportation the main concept behind the inherent safety approach in supporting preliminary process design is the aim to eliminate or radically reduce hazards by a mindful choice among design alternatives inherent safety philosophy is hinged on five fundamental principles kletz 1978 minimization of inventories substitution of hazardous materials attenuation of process conditions limitation of the effects and process simplification although these principles can lead the decision process towards safer options assessment of alternatives and decision making need to be based on a specific metric jafari et al 2018 in the present study a tool for the quantitative assessment of the inherent safety performance of alternative technologies was developed the tool aims at supporting decision making in early process design of lng bunkering technologies allowing a comparison to the safety performance of diesel fuel baseline technologies by the comparison of reference systems for alternative bunkering technologies the definition and assessment of a specific set of inherent safety key performance indicators kpis allowed ranking the proposed lng based technologies for ship bunkering supporting the identification of the inherently safer solutions and the identification of critical issues that need to be addressed in the further development of inherently safer lng bunkering technologies 2 alternative systems considered for ship bunkering 2 1 alternative bunkering systems different solutions are currently available or under development to carry out the fueling of lng ships these differ mainly due to the availability of lng supply infrastructures and the ship type in this study to ease the analysis of inherent safety performances the overall bunkering process was considered as a system each system was considered as based on a specific concept and constituted of different process blocks fig 1 and table 1 summarize the four ship bunkering alternative concepts considered although concepts c and d are representative of a shore to ship bunkering arrangement refueling operations for passenger ships are carried out through a small scale auxiliary bunker vessel having an overall storage capacity in the range of 700 000 kg of fuel see table 1 bunkering operations are typically carried out at berth during passenger boarding through the use of flexible rubber hoses compliant to en 1765 2016 cen 2016 and not through the use of transfer arms as considered for concept a reference schemes for the relevant technologies were elaborated for each lng bunkering concept based on a survey of the technical literature and of the industrial practice det norske veritas 2012 2014 2015 jeong et al 2018 dma 2012 gie 2018 it must be remarked that the reference schemes defined have the only purpose to represent the main alternative technological solutions used or proposed for lng bunkering operations the schemes provide a basis to gather the general data required in the framework of the present study and are only aimed to allow the identification and comparison of the expected inherent safety performance of alternative bunkering technologies other crucial issues for technology application e g the actual stage of development the cost storage and energy efficiency etc were not considered at this stage of the work and fall out of the scope of the present study reference schemes of conventional technologies for diesel fuels supply were also obtained for the sake of comparison 2 2 reference systems for lng bunkering and supply three main alternative options are considered to supply lng to vessels det norske veritas 2012 jeong et al 2018 truck to ship ship to ship and port to ship the choice between different fuel delivery configurations depends on three main parameters required bunkering volumes bunkering frequency and physical and logistical limitations more specifically the total lng volume handled on a yearly basis in a harbor area coping with possible time constraints for operations drives the selection of the most suitable bunkering method in the present study two main alternative lng bunkering systems were only considered concept a featuring the typical port to ship configuration fig 1a and concept b with a ship to ship configuration fig 1b concept a is usually implemented for transferring large volumes of fuel since it requires a shore based storage facility see fig 1a and description in section 2 2 1 with a dedicated bunkering jetty instead concept b is more flexible with respect to bunker location and is suitable both for large and small scale applications depending on bunker ship capacity see fig 1b and description in section 2 2 2 truck to ship technology is only suitable for small scale applications since it features limited inventories compared to previous alternatives and is not considered in the present analysis the simplified reference process flow diagrams pfds including the equipment tags for of all the blocks present in the two alternative systems see fig 1 are reported in fig 2 and discussed in detail in the following process operative conditions and equipment features and size are summarized in appendix a see table a1 2 2 1 s lng block lng shore based bunkering facility the reference pfd considered for lng shore based bunkering facilities is reported in fig 2a for both concepts a and b in both concept a and b cryogenic loading pumps g01 a b transfer lng from storage tanks d01 d02 etc connected with a common manifold up to the loading arm s02 similarly a boil off gas bog line connects tanks to bog transfer arm s01 allowing tank pressure regulation and equalization during lng transfer to either user vessel fuel system concept a or bunker vessel concept b 2 2 2 b lng block ship to ship bunker vessel ship to ship bunkering is the transfer of lng from a bunker vessel or barge to a ship det norske veritas 2014 ship to ship operations for lng bunkering may be carried out either in port areas or in the open sea in this study only ship to ship transfer in port areas is considered fig 2b provides a reference scheme for a small scale bunker vessel with a storage capacity of about 6000 m3 det norske veritas 2014 lng is stored in two bi lobe imo type c tanks imo 2015b d01 and d02 and is delivered to the receiving ship using submerged cryogenic pumps installed inside the tanks through a flexible hose for cryogenic applications lng line s04 designed according to en 1474 2 cen 2008 during bunkering operations the bog line s03 is connected with the receiving vessel moreover the bog produced is managed by means of a compressor p01 which allows tank pressure compensation and the fuel supply to the vessel dual fuel engine in addition the bunker vessel is equipped with a fuel gas supply system see section 2 2 3 for more details to feed the dual fuel engines 2 2 3 v lng block user vessel the reference scheme assumed for the lng fuel system installed on a ship is shown in fig 2c the reference scheme considered is representative of a passenger ferry boat with an installed power of about 38 mw det norske veritas 2015 fuel gas supply system includes a single lng storage tank d01 a lng vaporizer and a fuel gas heater e01 and e02 respectively needed to control gas temperature the bog compressor p01 is used to manage tank pressure a bog pre heater e03 is installed upstream the compressor to control vapor temperature 2 3 reference systems for conventional bunkering with diesel fuels bunkering technologies based on the utilization of diesel fuels either related to storage or transfer are consolidated in order to define the reference schemes for these technologies a team of experts was defined involving port operators either qualified personnel of port authorities or operating companies of several italian harbor areas a specific survey was submitted to the expert team to integrate the information available from technical literature caterpillar 2013 ocimf 2010 woodyard 2004 and regulations in particular the six annexes of marpol 73 78 convention marpol 2006 reference process schemes for conventional diesel fuel bunkering were thus defined diesel fuel bunkering operations were considered to be carried adopting only shore to ship configurations by the use of a small scale auxiliary bunker vessel as shown in fig 1 in the present study two alternative concepts were considered for the sake of comparison based on different fuel types requiring different operating conditions the two alternative fuels considered are i intermediate fuel oil ifo 380 in concept c fig 1c ii marine gas oil mgo in concept d fig 1d more details on the characteristics of both fuels classified according to iso 8217 specifications iso 2017 are reported elsewhere mohd noor et al 2018 the simplified reference schemes including the equipment tags for the two alternative concepts are reported in fig 3 due to the similarities a single reference scheme was considered for ifo and mgo in each block of fig 1 process operative conditions and equipment features are summarized in appendix a table a2 and a3 respectively for concepts c and d 2 3 1 s ifo and s mgo blocks onshore bunkering facilities fig 3a shows the reference scheme considered for the land based fuel oil facilities of ifo and mgo the fuel is stored in several atmospheric tanks t01 t06 connected with a pipe network and pumping stations pumps g01 02 which allow fuel transfer to the bunker vessel at about 2 bar pressure ocimf 2010 2 3 2 b ifo and b mgo blocks ship to ship auxiliary bunker vessel fig 3b shows the reference scheme considered for a typical auxiliary bunker vessel employed for refueling operations for ferry boats either adopting ifo or mgo the onboard storage system consists of atmospheric tanks t01 t07 that are heated in order to reduce fuel viscosity and to ease transfer operations a bunker pump g01 is used to deliver the required fuel at about 2 bar pressure to the receiving vessel tanks ocimf 2010 2 3 3 v imo and v mgo blocks fuel system on the end user vessel fig 3c shows the reference scheme of a typical diesel fuel system adopted on ferry boats fuel is stored onboard in two prismatic atmospheric tanks d01 and d02 a gear pump g01 transfers the fuel towards two settling tanks d03 and d04 a heater e01 follows the settling tanks then the oil is transferred by pump g02 to two daily service tanks d05 and d06 prior to engine injection the fuel is heated again in heater e02 in order to reach an adequate viscosity grade as required by the engine and finally injected into the engine through a booster pump g03 caterpillar 2013 3 methodology 3 1 overview the inherent safety performance assessment of the different schemes for vessel bunkering was carried out by an approach relying on consequence based key performance indicators kpis the methodology developed is derived from a consequence based method for quantitative inherent safety assessment developed in a previous study tugnoli et al 2007 and applied to the analysis of fuel supply chains such as in the case of hydrogen landucci et al 2010 2008 tugnoli et al 2009 however a further development of the procedure was necessary to allow the assessment of some key features of vessel bunkering operations thus extending its applicability from onshore facilities to marine fuel supply systems also taking into account the possibility of accident escalation the methodology for kpis assessment is schematized in fig 4 and is summarized in the following the preliminary part of the analysis step 1 in fig 4 consists in the definition of reference schemes for vessel bunkering to support the inherent safety assessment of each technology considered the present analysis was based on the reference schemes described in section 2 a set of specific literature based locs loss of containment events was associated to each process unit defining the release events to be considered for the consequence assessment a credit factor cf is then assigned to each loc step 2 in fig 4 credit factors are introduced in the method to assess the credibility of the loc events associated with each piece of equipment in the present approach the numerical values of credit factors were derived from statistical data on equipment leak frequency reported for standard technologies in several publications american petroleum institute 2000 uijt de haag and ale 2005 this approach allows for the estimation of standard credit factors for each reference class of equipment units which may be modified to account for improved safety standards of specific equipment items if further information is available therefore credit factors should not be intended as equipment failure frequencies but only as factors summarizing the past performance of similar equipment items these factors allow identifying the worst credible scenarios in the analysis an example of standard sets of locs and related credit factors proposed for some unit categories is given in table 2 more details on the credit factors are reported elsewhere tugnoli et al 2007 2009 in step 3 of the methodology see fig 4 the consequence analysis of the possible scenarios following each loc is performed standard event trees are used to identify the scenarios while source terms and physical effects are calculated by conventional literature models van den bosh and weterings 2005 for the sake of simplicity the composition of the hazardous materials considered in the present study is schematized as follows i lng assumed as pure methane ii ifo assumed as pure n dodecane and iii mgo assumed as pure n nonane clearly enough such composition was used only to calculate reference damage distances for the different loc events in order to compare their severity rather than to carry out a detailed consequence analysis which should need a more accurate characterization of the fuel properties consequence analysis is carried out by a threshold based approach considering the threshold values reported in table 3 these values are derived from the technical literature van den bosh and twilt 1992 for effects on humans cozzani et al 2006 for escalation hazard the damage distances obtained are used to calculate the unit inherent safety kpis step 4 of fig 4 all the assessed units are allocated to the relevant process blocks step 5 of fig 4 according to equations presented in section 3 2 aggregation of indicators is performed to obtain block and overall inherent hazard indexes step 6 and 7 of fig 4 finally the alternative distribution systems are ranked on the basis of the overall kpis calculated in the previous steps step 8 in fig 4 3 2 description of kpis as discussed above a specific set of kpis was obtained to assess the inherent safety of the alternative bunkering options two kpis were defined for each unit the unit potential hazard index and the unit inherent hazard index the unit potential hazard index is calculated as follows 1 u p i i k max j h i k j 2 where h i k j is the maximum damage distance obtained for the j th loc of the i th unit belonging to the k th block of the system to avoid uncertainties introduced by consequence analysis models in describing near field effects the actual damage distance used in eq 1 is the maximum between calculated damage distances and 5 m the upi i k index is representative of the largest area affected by the worst case scenario originated from the considered process unit being hence proportional to the squared value of damage distance the unit inherent hazard index is defined as 2 u h i i k j 1 n i k c f i k j h i k j 2 where n i k is the number of locs considered for the i th unit of the k th considered block and c f i k j is the credit factor of the j th loc thus in the uhi i k index the credit factors are also considered the sum of the upi and of uhi values for a particular block of a bunkering system defined as a group of n units see appendix a for a detailed list of equipment considered in each block is used to calculate respectively the block potential hazard index bpi k and the block inherent hazard index bhi k 3 b p i k i 1 n u p i i k 4 b h i k i 1 n u h i i k these aggregated indexes allow the assessment of the expected inherent safety performance of each block of fuel bunkering systems based either on a direct assessment of potential worst case scenarios bpi or on safety performance and release scenarios of the process units bhi therefore the aggregation at the level of the overall system thus considering all the blocks in the bunkering system is also needed in particular the sum of the overall kpis for each block is adopted to evaluate the overall inherent safety performance of the system 5 p i k 1 m b p i k 6 h i k 1 m b h i k where m is the number of blocks in each bunkering system whereas pi and hi are the overall potential and overall inherent hazard indexes respectively considering the limited space available on board of vessels and the limited distances between process units in bunkering facilities escalation indexes are also critical for the evaluation of the inherent safety profile of the systems considered these account for the possibility of severe domino scenarios due to the simultaneous damage and release from several units not accounted in the assessment of single units the kpis considered for escalation are based on the evaluation of an escalation distance e i j for each credible scenario which is calculated using the domino effect thresholds listed in table 3 also in this case a near field cut off approach has been adopted thus considering as escalation distance the maximum between the calculated escalation distance and 5 m similarly to upi i k the unit potential domino index upd i k is defined as the square of the maximum escalation distance calculated for the unit 7 u p d i k max j e i k j 2 the unit domino hazard index uhd i k is defined as follows in analogy to uhi i k 8 u h d i k j 1 n i k c f i k j e i k j 2 a block domino potential hazard index bpd k and a block domino inherent hazard index bhd k are defined summing up respectively the upd i k and uhd i k values for all the units in the k th block of the bunkering system also in this case overall indexes for each block are calculated to evaluate the aggregated overall inherent safety of the considered bunkering system in analogy with eq s 5 and 6 the overall domino potential hazard index pd and the overall domino inherent hazard index hd are defined as 9 p d k 1 m b p d k 10 h d k 1 m b h d k quite obviously the different indexes defined contribute to score different inherent safety aspects and may be used to obtain an inherent safety fingerprint of the bunkering process or of single units 4 results and discussion 4 1 inherent safety performance of lng technologies the complete set of results for the kpi assessment of the alternative technologies for lng bunkering is reported in appendix b table b1 the analysis evidenced that in concept a lng storage tanks account for the highest upi and upd the presence of external loading pumps in the shore facility is a critical issue since these units show a uhi value of 43 3 m2 y and a uhd of 40 4 m2 y these values are the highest of the entire system and are very similar to those of the lng transfer arm this is due to the fact that credit factors of utilities pumps and compressors are particularly high due to the presence of rotating parts which increase the likelihood of failure see table 2 submerged lng transfer pumps are installed inside the double walled storage tank hence release events from these units are excluded from the present analysis with reference to ship to ship operations concept b it may be noticed that the main lng storage tanks onboard the bunker vessel show both the higher unit potential index upi and the higher unit potential domino upd of the entire bunkering system respectively 8 04 106 m2 and 7 87 106 m2 these values are almost doubled if compared to those of the shore facility storage tanks since i the bunker ship tanks feature an almost double capacity with respect to each individual tank used for lng storage in the shore facility see appendix a for details on equipment features ii operating conditions in the bunker ship tank are more severe than those adopted for in shore facility storages higher temperature and pressure taking into account the influence of credit factors the lng loading pumps located in the shore facility appear also in this case the least inherently safe equipment involved in this system with the highest uhi and uhd for the sake of comparison the kpis were calculated also for the conventional bunkering technologies results obtained are reported in table b2 and table b3 of appendix b respectively for concept c adopting ifo and concept d adopting mgo storage tanks located on the shore facility feature the highest upi and upd values due to the largest amount of stored hazardous substance the bunker hose used in the shore facility is the most critical unit in terms of inherent hazard index thus achieving the highest values of both uhi and uhd it is worth mentioning that the indexes obtained in the case of concept d are higher than those obtained for concept c due to the lower flash point and wider flammability range of mgo with respect to ifo 4 2 comparison among the alternative bunkering systems fig 5 reports a comparison among the normalized values of the potential and hazard indexes calculated for the alternative technologies the figure also shows the correspondent normalized indexes for domino effect the radar plot allows for an effective comparison among the expected safety performance of the critical equipment units adopted in the alternative concepts considered relevant differences are obtained when comparing the unit potential index of storage units in the onshore facility upi storage in fig 5 the contribution of critical scenarios such as jet fire and flash fire lead to the worsening of hazard distances in the case of lng based technologies concepts a and b the worst case scenarios considered for conventional technologies i e ifo or mgo pool fires have a limited impact with a decrement of upi in the storage units of one order of magnitude with respect to the lng systems it is worth to notice that the maximum value of upi upi max in fig 5 is associated with the lng bunker vessel in concept b see also section 4 1 while in all the other cases shore facility storage tanks result the most critical equipment items among the entire system due to the relevant inventories of hazardous substances when credit factors are introduced in the analysis a completely different result is obtained from the comparison among the inherent hazard indexes for the shore facility storage tanks uhi storage in fig 5 in fact credit factors of atmospheric vertical tanks adopted for conventional fuels storage are one order of magnitude higher than those of the pressurized or semi pressurized tanks adopted for lng storage see table 2 this leads to doubled uhi storage values with respect to lng storage tanks despite the more limited severity of conventional fuels scenarios compared to those calculated for lng credit factors also affect the relative ranking among the performance of the worst critical equipment of each system reducing the difference among the inherent safety performance of lng and conventional technologies see fig 5 the same qualitative considerations may be extended to the comparison among the domino escalation indexes in particular upd and uhd respectively domino potential and inherent hazard indexes for shore facility tanks and the most critical equipment drastically penalize lng based concepts with respect to the conventional systems see fig 5 fig 6 reports the kpis calculated for each block of the different bunkering systems considered considering both the block potential hazard index bpi in fig 6a and the block inherent hazard index bhi in fig 6b it is evident that the shore facility is the more critical unit of all bunkering blocks this is due to i the larger inventories of hazardous materials and ii the more severe conditions in fluid handling and transfer however the analysis also points out that the kpis of the lng based fuel system are quite high well in the order of those of the shore facility despite the onboard inventory of hazardous substances is limited the complexity of lng fuel system in terms of required auxiliary units is the main cause of such result moreover while the hazard of the lng fuel system is comparable with that of the shore facility the vulnerability is higher due to the presence of passengers onboard during bunkering operation this highlights an important issue that should be considered in the safe development of lng fueled vessels the analysis of domino effect results crucial to identify potential interference among the different operations carried out within each bunkering system possibly leading to accident propagation on the one hand as shown in fig 6c and d reporting respectively the values of the block domino potential and inherent hazard indexes a relevant escalation hazard is present in lng bunkering systems this is due to the possibility of severe scenarios as vapor cloud explosions which may induce the catastrophic failure of neighboring units on the other hand in both concepts c and d the scenarios associated with the release of ifo and mgo have a limited potential to cause damages to neighboring units due to their limited severity and extension the overall inherent safety performance of the four alternative bunkering concepts considered is shown in fig 7 that compares the overall values of the kpis it is evident that lng based technologies concepts a and b result in much higher values of the kpis with respect to conventional technologies concepts c and d in particular as shown in fig 7a the overall potential and domino indexes pi and pd for conventional fuel bunkering systems are at least one order of magnitude lower than those calculated for lng when comparing the overall inherent hazard index hi see fig 7b the differences among the four alternative fueling concepts are attenuated but still the lng based technologies feature kpi values that are almost double with respect to those obtained for conventional technologies also when considering the domino overall inherent hazard hd see fig 7b conventional technologies concepts c and d show again kpis that are at least one order of magnitude lower than those of lng concepts a and b based upon the values of the overall potential and inherent indexes it is possible to define an inherent safety based ranking among the alternative bunkering technologies considered as summarized in fig 7c this ranking is independent from the selection of a particular kpi since all the overall indexes have the same qualitative trend see fig 7a and b 4 3 discussion the analysis of the inherent safety kpis allows for an inherent safety ranking among the possible alternatives for lng bunkering operations identifying the critical units and at the same time evaluating the overall performance of the system the two main alternatives considered for lng bunkering operation differ due to the presence of the bunker vessel in concept b which induces an overall decrement of inherent safety performance of this technology due to the increased number of units in the system and at the same time to the introduction of several loading unloading operations which are recognized as the most critical in lng operations uguccioni 2011 hence concept b scores an overall worsened performance when compared to concept a in accordance with the inherent safety guideword simplification at the same time concept a features higher storage inventories thus leading to the worst case scenarios among all the units considered it is worth mentioning that the consequence assessment of lng scenarios was carried out with conventional tools based on integral models van den bosh and weterings 2005 that are adequate for the purpose of an inherent safety screening of alternative technologies when more detailed results are required the introduction of a dedicated approach for lng consequence assessment with dedicated setting and tools may allow for the further improvement of the present results moreover since the operations and the related accident scenarios considered feature relevant complexity distributed parameters models for consequence assessment such as cfd computational fluid dynamics schmidt 2012 may constitute a further useful support for detailed studies accounting for the analysis of dispersion in presence of obstacles busini et al 2012 derudi et al 2014 pontiggia et al 2011 and for the detailed assessment of domino effect scenarios caused by lng fires affecting neighboring units landucci et al 2016 dealing with conventional vessel bunkering techniques based on diesel fuel leads to less severe accidental scenarios due to the limited flammability features of ifo and mgo when compared to lng it is also worth mentioning that in the case of conventional fuels the environmental damage related to oil spills is not accounted in the analysis which focused only on the safety of exposed population and personnel more in general the environmental and economic benefits related to the implementation of lng technologies in comparison to the conventional technologies should be considered when a holistic assessment of the sustainability of maritime transport is of interest finally it is important to remark that the focus of the present study was the assessment of alternative technologies for bunkering thus without providing a comparison among the entire fuel supply chains 5 conclusions in the present study the inherent safety assessment of alternative bunkering technologies was carried out based on the quantification of consequence based kpis a specific method was developed in order to include the assessment of the entire process involved in fuel bunkering the results obtained allowed investigating the inherent safety performance of novel concepts proposed for lng operations comparing them to conventional bunkering systems based on fuel oil ifo or marine gasoil mgo process complexity more severe operating conditions and higher flammability of lng resulted in a penalization of the expected inherent safety performance of the lng based concepts calculation of inherent safety kpis allowed the definition of a ranking of alternatives based on overall hazard indexes in particular the ifo based concept resulted the inherently safer bunkering technology when compared to the other solutions followed by mgo based concept whereas lng concepts resulted inherently less safe the criticalities affecting the safety performance of lng based technologies and in particular the ship to ship configuration are related to the lng transfer equipment the safety of lng transfer operations emerged as the main critical point in the safety of lng fuel systems the results obtained may drive i the selection of future alternative processes based on lng technologies and ii the safety improvement of the most critical components in the bunkering systems considered for further development thus the present methodology may constitute a starting point to support the holistic evaluation of novel green shipping technologies providing a detailed screening of safety issues to be integrated with the analysis to environmental and economic aspects appendix a reference schemes quantification the knowledge of reference operating conditions and key features of the units considered in this study constitutes an essential information for the quantitative consequence assessment and thus for the application of the methodology developed in the present work data adopted for systems based on lng technologies concepts a and b are reported in table a1 while data for concept c based on ifo utilization and concept d based on mgo utilization are reported in tables a2 and a3 respectively process conditions and equipment features of the s lng block in concept a are representative of a 10 000 m3 small scale lng terminal based on current industrial practice det norske veritas 2012 2014 dma 2012 gie 2018 in accordance with current design solutions cen 2007 a typical tank size of 1450 m3 was selected thus obtaining seven storage units d01 d07 in this case part of the stored lng may be devoted to feed other end users such as truck loading bays and or regasification units with direct delivery to the natural gas network in concept b the storage portion devoted to other users which is about 30 considering the average value for current lng medium or small scale terminals in europe gie 2018 is not considered thus the stored volume is reduced by 30 obtaining a storage facility with only five

22723,the adoption of liquefied natural gas lng as an alternative marine fuel is a promising solution for green shipping with potential extensive reduction of pollutant emissions the future development and spread of lng technologies for ship bunkering and fuel systems operation will necessarily need to face the safety issues associated with the high flammability of lng compared to conventional marine fuels in this study a comparative analysis of the inherent safety performance of the foreseen technologies for lng bunkering was performed moreover a comparison with conventional technologies based on marine diesel fuels was also carried out an inherent safety ranking based on overall indicators deriving from severity of consequences and credibility of loss of containment events was introduced the results allowed the identification of the inherently safer solutions for maritime fuel bunkering highlighting critical units and providing insights on the safety issues to be

demand is predicted to grow by 28 between 2015 and 2040 consequently carbon dioxide co2 emissions are projected to grow of about 0 6 on a yearly basis us energy information administration 2017 unless mitigation strategies are adopted this scenario is not compatible with the goal to limit global temperature increase below 2 c set by the paris agreement united nations 2015 transport represents almost a quarter of europe s greenhouse gas ghg emissions within this sector shipping is responsible for about 13 of eu s ghg emissions and of 2 2 of global ghg emissions as reported by european environment agency 2015 and by the third international maritime organization imo ghg study imo 2015a moreover since maritime activities are heavily dependent on diesel fuels maritime transportation is a major source of global emissions of sulfur sox and nitrogen oxides nox and contributes up to 8 and 15 to the respective overall emissions maragkogianni et al 2016 considerable efforts were made by international authorities over recent years to pursue the reduction of pollutant emissions increasing energy efficiency and shifting from conventional diesel fuels towards natural gas and renewable energy sources to achieve this goal imo has recently revised annex vi of marpol convention marpol 2006 introducing tight emission limits for sox nox and particulate matter pm requirements for fuels sulfur content and emissions abatement technologies installed on seagoing vessels were also introduced from an environmental perspective the adoption of liquefied natural gas lng as a ship fuel appears to be a viable solution to comply with the stringent emission regulations lng should allow reducing emissions of co2 up to 20 sox up to 100 nox up to 90 and pm up to 99 igu 2015 moreover the favorable price conditions make natural gas a sustainable alternative to traditional fuels therefore several studies dealt with the analysis of the environmental benefits related to the adoption of lng based technologies with respect to conventional diesel fuels in terms of emissions reduction in hybrid engines kavli et al 2017 or in the implementation of dual fuel engines stoumpos et al 2018 lepistö et al 2016 performed the analysis of energy efficiency and heat recovery through dynamic process simulation in lng fueled ships concerning economic aspects schinas and butler 2016 provided strategies to promote the commercial aspects related to the spread of lng technologies also addressing their feasibility life cycle assessment with particular reference to the analysis of air emissions was developed chatzinikolaou and ventikos 2015 tagliaferri et al 2017 allowing a more detailed analysis of energetic economic and environmental aspects however due to the high flammability of lng compared to conventional fuels for diesel engines safety aspects will become crucial for the development of green shipping based on lng technologies hence several works investigated safety issues involving lng operations alderman 2005 lee et al 2015 safety exclusion zones for lng bunkering sites jeong et al 2018 fire risk on board lng fueled vessels jeong et al 2017 kim et al 2014 risk profiles of different lng bunkering operations performed in port areas were assessed in specific risk studies carried out by dnv det norske veritas 2012 however a direct comparison among safety issues posed by different fueling alternatives is not present in the literature and a comparative safety assessment addressing both traditional diesel fuels such as fuel oil or marine gasoil and natural gas fueling systems is still lacking the use of lng in the marine sector is far from consolidated hence there is still a lack of harmonization in technical standards and regulations concerning the safety of lng maritime infrastructures along with limited information about safety performance of such installations a screening tool based on inherent safety principles kletz and amyotte 2010 driving the development of future projects would thus be crucial to support a safe and sustainable introduction of lng based technologies in maritime transportation the main concept behind the inherent safety approach in supporting preliminary process design is the aim to eliminate or radically reduce hazards by a mindful choice among design alternatives inherent safety philosophy is hinged on five fundamental principles kletz 1978 minimization of inventories substitution of hazardous materials attenuation of process conditions limitation of the effects and process simplification although these principles can lead the decision process towards safer options assessment of alternatives and decision making need to be based on a specific metric jafari et al 2018 in the present study a tool for the quantitative assessment of the inherent safety performance of alternative technologies was developed the tool aims at supporting decision making in early process design of lng bunkering technologies allowing a comparison to the safety performance of diesel fuel baseline technologies by the comparison of reference systems for alternative bunkering technologies the definition and assessment of a specific set of inherent safety key performance indicators kpis allowed ranking the proposed lng based technologies for ship bunkering supporting the identification of the inherently safer solutions and the identification of critical issues that need to be addressed in the further development of inherently safer lng bunkering technologies 2 alternative systems considered for ship bunkering 2 1 alternative bunkering systems different solutions are currently available or under development to carry out the fueling of lng ships these differ mainly due to the availability of lng supply infrastructures and the ship type in this study to ease the analysis of inherent safety performances the overall bunkering process was considered as a system each system was considered as based on a specific concept and constituted of different process blocks fig 1 and table 1 summarize the four ship bunkering alternative concepts considered although concepts c and d are representative of a shore to ship bunkering arrangement refueling operations for passenger ships are carried out through a small scale auxiliary bunker vessel having an overall storage capacity in the range of 700 000 kg of fuel see table 1 bunkering operations are typically carried out at berth during passenger boarding through the use of flexible rubber hoses compliant to en 1765 2016 cen 2016 and not through the use of transfer arms as considered for concept a reference schemes for the relevant technologies were elaborated for each lng bunkering concept based on a survey of the technical literature and of the industrial practice det norske veritas 2012 2014 2015 jeong et al 2018 dma 2012 gie 2018 it must be remarked that the reference schemes defined have the only purpose to represent the main alternative technological solutions used or proposed for lng bunkering operations the schemes provide a basis to gather the general data required in the framework of the present study and are only aimed to allow the identification and comparison of the expected inherent safety performance of alternative bunkering technologies other crucial issues for technology application e g the actual stage of development the cost storage and energy efficiency etc were not considered at this stage of the work and fall out of the scope of the present study reference schemes of conventional technologies for diesel fuels supply were also obtained for the sake of comparison 2 2 reference systems for lng bunkering and supply three main alternative options are considered to supply lng to vessels det norske veritas 2012 jeong et al 2018 truck to ship ship to ship and port to ship the choice between different fuel delivery configurations depends on three main parameters required bunkering volumes bunkering frequency and physical and logistical limitations more specifically the total lng volume handled on a yearly basis in a harbor area coping with possible time constraints for operations drives the selection of the most suitable bunkering method in the present study two main alternative lng bunkering systems were only considered concept a featuring the typical port to ship configuration fig 1a and concept b with a ship to ship configuration fig 1b concept a is usually implemented for transferring large volumes of fuel since it requires a shore based storage facility see fig 1a and description in section 2 2 1 with a dedicated bunkering jetty instead concept b is more flexible with respect to bunker location and is suitable both for large and small scale applications depending on bunker ship capacity see fig 1b and description in section 2 2 2 truck to ship technology is only suitable for small scale applications since it features limited inventories compared to previous alternatives and is not considered in the present analysis the simplified reference process flow diagrams pfds including the equipment tags for of all the blocks present in the two alternative systems see fig 1 are reported in fig 2 and discussed in detail in the following process operative conditions and equipment features and size are summarized in appendix a see table a1 2 2 1 s lng block lng shore based bunkering

storage tanks d01 d02 etc connected with a common manifold up to the loading arm s02 similarly a boil off gas bog line connects tanks to bog transfer arm s01 allowing tank pressure regulation and equalization during lng transfer to either user vessel fuel system concept a or bunker vessel concept b 2 2 2 b lng block ship to ship bunker vessel ship to ship bunkering is the transfer of lng from a bunker vessel or barge to a ship det norske veritas 2014 ship to ship operations for lng bunkering may be carried out either in port areas or in the open sea in this study only ship to ship transfer in port areas is considered fig 2b provides a reference scheme for a small scale bunker vessel with a storage capacity of about 6000 m3 det norske veritas 2014 lng is stored in two bi lobe imo type c tanks imo 2015b d01 and d02 and is delivered to the receiving ship using submerged cryogenic pumps installed inside the tanks through a flexible hose for cryogenic applications lng line s04 designed according to en 1474 2 cen 2008 during bunkering operations the bog line s03 is connected with the receiving vessel moreover the bog produced is managed by means of a compressor p01 which allows tank pressure compensation and the fuel supply to the vessel dual fuel engine in addition the bunker vessel is equipped with a fuel gas supply system see section 2 2 3 for more details to feed the dual fuel engines 2 2 3 v lng block user vessel the reference scheme assumed for the lng fuel system installed on a ship is shown in fig 2c the reference scheme considered is representative of a passenger ferry boat with an installed power of about 38 mw det norske veritas 2015 fuel gas supply system includes a single lng storage tank d01 a lng vaporizer and a fuel gas heater e01 and e02 respectively needed to control gas temperature the bog compressor p01 is used to manage tank pressure a bog pre heater e03 is installed upstream the compressor to control vapor temperature 2 3 reference systems for conventional bunkering with diesel fuels bunkering technologies based on the utilization of diesel fuels either related to storage or transfer are consolidated in order to define the reference schemes for these technologies a team of experts was defined involving port operators either qualified personnel of port authorities or operating companies of several italian harbor areas a specific survey was submitted to the expert team to integrate the information available from technical literature caterpillar 2013 ocimf 2010 woodyard 2004 and regulations in particular the six annexes of marpol 73 78 convention marpol 2006 reference process schemes for conventional diesel fuel bunkering were thus defined diesel fuel bunkering operations were considered to be carried adopting only shore to ship configurations by the use of a small scale auxiliary bunker vessel as shown in fig 1 in the present study two alternative concepts were considered for the sake of comparison based on different fuel types requiring different operating conditions the two alternative fuels considered are i intermediate fuel oil ifo 380 in concept c fig 1c ii marine gas oil mgo in concept d fig 1d more details on the characteristics of both fuels classified according to iso 8217 specifications iso 2017 are reported elsewhere mohd noor et al 2018 the simplified reference schemes including the equipment tags for the two alternative concepts are reported in fig 3 due to the similarities a single reference scheme was considered for ifo and mgo in each block of fig 1 process operative

auxiliary bunker vessel employed for refueling operations for ferry boats either adopting ifo or mgo the onboard storage system consists of atmospheric tanks t01 t07 that are heated in order to reduce

system on the end user vessel fig 3c shows the reference scheme of a typical diesel fuel system adopted on ferry boats fuel is stored onboard in two prismatic atmospheric tanks d01 and d02 a gear pump g01 transfers the fuel towards two settling tanks d03 and d04 a heater e01 follows the settling tanks then the oil is transferred by pump g02 to two daily service tanks d05 and d06 prior to engine injection the fuel is heated again in heater e02 in order to reach an adequate viscosity grade as required by the engine and finally injected into the engine through a booster pump g03 caterpillar

indicators kpis the methodology developed is derived from a consequence based method for quantitative inherent safety assessment developed in a previous study tugnoli et al 2007 and applied to the analysis of fuel supply chains such as in the case of hydrogen landucci et al 2010 2008 tugnoli et al 2009 however a further development of the procedure was necessary to allow the assessment of some key features of vessel bunkering operations thus extending its applicability from onshore facilities to marine fuel supply systems also taking into account the possibility of accident escalation the methodology for kpis assessment is schematized in fig 4 and is summarized in the following the preliminary part of the analysis step 1 in fig 4 consists in the definition of reference schemes for vessel bunkering to support the inherent safety assessment of each technology considered the present analysis was based on the reference schemes described in section 2 a set of specific literature based locs loss of containment events was associated to each process unit defining the release events to be considered for the consequence assessment a credit factor cf is then assigned to each loc step 2 in fig 4 credit factors are introduced in the method to assess the credibility of the loc events associated with each piece of equipment in the present approach the numerical values of credit factors were derived from statistical data on equipment leak frequency reported for standard technologies in several publications american petroleum institute 2000 uijt de haag and ale 2005 this approach allows for the estimation of standard credit factors for each reference class of equipment units which may be modified to account for improved safety standards of specific equipment items if further information is available therefore credit factors should not be intended as equipment failure frequencies but only as factors summarizing the past performance of similar equipment items these factors allow identifying the worst credible scenarios in the analysis an example of standard sets of locs and related credit factors proposed for some unit categories is given in table 2 more details on the credit factors are reported elsewhere tugnoli et al 2007 2009 in step 3 of the methodology see fig 4 the consequence analysis of the possible scenarios following each loc is performed standard event trees are used to identify the scenarios while source terms and physical effects are calculated by conventional literature models van den bosh and weterings 2005 for the sake of simplicity the composition of the hazardous materials considered in the present study is schematized as follows i lng assumed as pure methane ii ifo assumed as pure n dodecane and iii mgo assumed as pure n nonane clearly enough such composition was used only to calculate reference damage distances for the different loc events in order to compare their severity rather than to carry out a detailed consequence analysis which should need a more accurate characterization of the fuel properties consequence analysis is carried out by a threshold based approach considering the threshold values reported in table 3 these values are derived from the technical literature van den bosh and twilt 1992 for effects on humans cozzani et al 2006 for escalation hazard the damage distances obtained are used to calculate the unit inherent safety kpis step 4 of fig 4 all the assessed units are allocated to the relevant process blocks step 5 of fig 4 according to equations presented in section 3 2 aggregation of indicators is performed to obtain block and overall inherent hazard indexes step 6 and 7 of fig 4 finally the alternative distribution systems are ranked on the basis of the overall kpis calculated in the previous steps step 8 in fig 4 3 2 description of kpis as discussed above a specific set of kpis was obtained to assess the inherent safety of the alternative bunkering options two kpis were defined for each unit the unit potential hazard index and the unit inherent hazard index the unit potential hazard index is calculated as follows 1 u p i i k max j h i k j 2 where h i k j is the maximum damage distance obtained for the j th loc of the i th unit belonging to the k th block of the system to avoid uncertainties introduced by consequence analysis models in describing near field effects the actual damage distance used in eq 1 is the maximum between calculated damage distances and 5 m the upi i k index is representative of the largest area affected by the worst case scenario originated from the considered process unit being hence proportional to the squared value of damage distance the unit inherent hazard index is defined as 2 u h i i k j 1 n i k c f i k j h i k j 2 where n i k is the number of locs considered for the i th unit of the k th considered block and c f i k j is the credit factor of the j th loc thus in the uhi i k index the credit factors are also considered the sum of the upi and of uhi values for a particular block of a bunkering system defined as a group of n units see appendix a for a detailed list of equipment considered in each block is used to calculate respectively the block potential hazard index bpi k and the block inherent hazard index bhi k 3 b p i k i 1 n u p i i k 4 b h i k i 1 n u h i i k these aggregated indexes allow the assessment of the expected inherent safety performance of each block of fuel bunkering systems based either on a direct assessment of potential worst case scenarios bpi or on safety performance and release scenarios of the process units bhi therefore the aggregation at the level of the overall system thus considering all the blocks in the bunkering system is also needed in particular the sum of the overall kpis for each block is adopted to evaluate the overall inherent safety performance of the system 5 p i k 1 m b p i k 6 h i k 1 m b h i k where m is the number of blocks in each bunkering system whereas pi and hi are the overall potential and overall inherent hazard indexes respectively considering the limited space available on board of vessels and the limited distances between process units in bunkering facilities escalation indexes are also critical for the evaluation of the inherent safety profile of the systems considered these account for the possibility of severe domino scenarios due to the simultaneous damage and release from several units not accounted in the assessment of single units the kpis considered for escalation are based on the evaluation of an escalation distance e i j for each credible scenario which is calculated using the domino effect thresholds listed in table 3 also in this case a near field cut off approach has been adopted thus considering as escalation distance the maximum between the calculated escalation distance and 5 m similarly to upi i k the unit potential domino index upd i k is defined as the square of the maximum escalation distance calculated for the unit 7 u p d i k max j e i k j 2 the unit domino hazard index uhd i k is defined as follows in analogy to uhi i k 8 u h d i k j 1 n i k c f i k j e i k j 2 a block domino potential hazard index bpd k and a block domino inherent hazard index bhd k are defined summing up respectively the upd i k and uhd i k values for all the units in the k th block of the bunkering system also in this case overall indexes for each block are calculated to evaluate the aggregated overall inherent safety of the considered bunkering system in analogy with eq s 5 and 6 the overall domino potential hazard index pd and the overall domino inherent hazard index hd are defined as 9 p d k 1 m b p d k 10 h d k 1 m b h d k quite obviously the different indexes defined contribute to score different inherent safety aspects and may be used to obtain an inherent safety fingerprint of the bunkering process or of single units 4 results and discussion 4 1 inherent safety performance of lng technologies the complete set of results for the kpi assessment of the alternative technologies for lng bunkering is reported in appendix b table b1 the analysis evidenced that in concept a lng storage tanks account for the highest upi and upd the presence of external loading pumps in the shore facility is a critical issue since these units show a uhi value of 43 3 m2 y and a uhd of 40 4 m2 y these values are the highest of the entire system and are very similar to those of the lng transfer arm this is due to the fact that credit factors of utilities pumps and compressors are particularly high due to the presence of rotating parts which increase the likelihood of failure see table 2 submerged lng transfer pumps are installed inside the double walled storage tank hence release events from these units are excluded from the present analysis with reference to ship to ship operations concept b it may be noticed that the main lng storage tanks onboard the bunker vessel show both the higher unit potential index upi and the higher unit potential domino upd of the entire bunkering system respectively 8 04 106 m2 and 7 87 106 m2 these values are almost doubled if compared to those of the shore facility storage tanks since i the bunker ship tanks feature an almost double capacity with respect to each individual tank used for lng storage in the shore facility see appendix a for details on equipment features ii operating conditions in the bunker ship tank are more severe than those adopted for in shore facility storages higher temperature and pressure taking into account the influence of credit factors the lng loading pumps located in the shore facility appear also in this case the least inherently safe equipment involved in this system with the highest uhi and uhd for the sake of comparison the kpis were calculated also for the conventional bunkering technologies results obtained are reported in table b2 and table b3 of appendix b respectively for concept c adopting ifo and concept d adopting mgo storage tanks located on the shore facility feature the highest upi and upd values due to the largest amount of stored hazardous substance the bunker hose used in the shore facility is the most critical unit in terms of inherent hazard index thus achieving the highest values of both uhi and uhd it is worth mentioning that the indexes obtained in the case of concept d are higher than those obtained for concept c due to the lower flash point and wider flammability range of mgo with respect to ifo 4 2 comparison among the alternative bunkering systems fig 5 reports a comparison among the normalized values of the potential and hazard indexes calculated for the alternative technologies the figure also shows the correspondent normalized indexes for domino effect the radar plot allows for an effective comparison among the expected safety performance of the critical equipment units adopted in the alternative concepts considered relevant differences are obtained when comparing the unit potential index of storage units in the onshore facility upi storage in fig 5 the contribution of critical scenarios such as jet fire and flash fire lead to the worsening of hazard distances in the case of lng based technologies concepts a and b the worst case scenarios considered for conventional technologies i e ifo or mgo pool fires have a limited impact with a decrement of upi in the storage units of one order of magnitude with respect to the lng systems it is worth to notice that the maximum value of upi upi max in fig 5 is associated with the lng bunker vessel in concept b see also section 4 1 while in all the other cases shore facility storage tanks result the most critical equipment items among the entire system due to the relevant inventories of hazardous substances when credit factors are introduced in the analysis a completely different result is obtained from the comparison among the inherent hazard indexes for the shore facility storage tanks uhi storage in fig 5 in fact credit factors of atmospheric vertical tanks adopted for conventional fuels storage are one order of magnitude higher than those of the pressurized or semi pressurized tanks adopted for lng storage see table 2 this leads to doubled uhi storage values with respect to lng storage tanks despite the more limited severity of conventional fuels scenarios compared to those calculated for lng credit factors also affect the relative ranking among the performance of the worst critical equipment of each system reducing the difference among the inherent safety performance of lng and conventional technologies see fig 5 the same qualitative considerations may be extended to the comparison among the domino escalation indexes in particular upd and uhd respectively domino potential and inherent hazard indexes for shore facility tanks and the most critical equipment drastically penalize lng based concepts with respect to the conventional systems see fig 5 fig 6 reports the kpis calculated for each block of the different bunkering systems considered considering both the block potential hazard index bpi in fig 6a and the block inherent hazard index bhi in fig 6b it is evident that the shore facility is the more critical unit of all bunkering blocks this is due to i the larger inventories of hazardous materials and ii the more severe conditions in fluid handling and transfer however the analysis also points out that the kpis of the lng based fuel system are quite high well in the order of those of the shore facility despite the onboard inventory of hazardous substances is limited the complexity of lng fuel system in terms of required auxiliary units is the main cause of such result moreover while the hazard of the lng fuel system is comparable with that of the shore facility the vulnerability is higher due to the presence of passengers onboard during bunkering operation this highlights an important issue that should be considered in the safe development of lng fueled vessels the analysis of domino effect results crucial to identify potential interference among the different operations carried out within each bunkering system possibly leading to accident propagation on the one hand as shown in fig 6c and d reporting respectively the values of the block domino potential and inherent hazard indexes a relevant escalation hazard is present in lng bunkering systems this is due to the possibility of severe scenarios as vapor cloud explosions which may induce the catastrophic failure of neighboring units on the other hand in both concepts c and d the scenarios associated with the release of ifo and mgo have a limited potential to cause damages to neighboring units due to their limited severity and extension the overall inherent safety performance of the four alternative bunkering concepts considered is shown in fig 7 that compares the overall values of the kpis it is evident that lng based technologies concepts a and b result in much higher values of the kpis with respect to conventional technologies concepts c and d in particular as shown in fig 7a the overall potential and domino indexes pi and pd for conventional fuel bunkering systems are at least one order of magnitude lower than those calculated for lng when comparing the overall inherent hazard index hi see fig 7b the differences among the four alternative fueling concepts are attenuated but still the lng based technologies feature kpi values that are almost double with respect to those obtained for conventional technologies also when considering the domino overall inherent hazard hd see fig 7b conventional technologies concepts c and d show again kpis that are at least one order of magnitude lower than those of lng concepts a and b based upon the values of the overall potential and inherent indexes it is possible to define an inherent safety based ranking among the alternative bunkering technologies considered as summarized in fig 7c this ranking is independent from the selection of a particular kpi since all the overall indexes have the same qualitative trend see fig 7a and b 4 3 discussion the analysis of the inherent safety kpis allows for an inherent safety ranking among the possible alternatives for lng bunkering operations identifying the critical units and at the same time evaluating the overall performance of the system the two main alternatives considered for lng bunkering operation differ due to the presence of the bunker vessel in concept b which induces an overall decrement of inherent safety performance of this technology due to the increased number of units in the system and at the same time to the introduction of several loading unloading operations which are recognized as the most critical in lng operations uguccioni 2011 hence concept b scores an overall worsened performance when compared to concept a in accordance with the inherent safety guideword simplification at the same time concept a features higher storage inventories thus leading to the worst case scenarios among all the units considered it is worth mentioning that the consequence assessment of lng scenarios was carried out with conventional tools based on integral models van den bosh and weterings 2005 that are adequate for the purpose of an inherent safety screening of alternative technologies when more detailed results are required the introduction of a dedicated approach for lng consequence assessment with dedicated setting and tools may allow for the further improvement of the present results moreover since the operations and the related accident scenarios considered feature relevant complexity distributed parameters models for consequence assessment such as cfd computational fluid dynamics schmidt 2012 may constitute a further useful support for detailed studies accounting for the analysis of dispersion in presence of obstacles busini et al 2012 derudi et al 2014 pontiggia et al 2011 and for the detailed assessment of domino effect scenarios caused by lng fires affecting neighboring units landucci et al 2016 dealing with conventional vessel bunkering techniques based on diesel fuel leads to less severe accidental scenarios due to the limited flammability features of ifo and mgo when compared to lng it is also worth mentioning that in the case of conventional fuels the environmental damage related to oil spills is not accounted in the analysis which focused only on the safety of exposed population and personnel more in general the environmental and economic benefits related to the implementation of lng technologies in comparison to the conventional technologies should be considered when a holistic assessment of the sustainability of maritime transport is of interest finally it is important to remark that the focus of the present study was the assessment of alternative technologies for bunkering thus without providing a comparison among the entire fuel supply chains 5 conclusions in the present study the inherent safety assessment of alternative bunkering technologies was carried out based on the quantification of consequence based kpis a specific method was developed in order to include the assessment of the entire process involved in fuel bunkering the results obtained allowed investigating the inherent safety performance of novel concepts proposed for lng operations comparing them to conventional bunkering systems based on fuel oil ifo or marine gasoil mgo process complexity more severe operating conditions and higher flammability of lng resulted in a penalization of the expected inherent safety performance of the lng based concepts calculation of inherent safety kpis allowed the definition of a ranking of alternatives based on overall hazard indexes in particular the ifo based concept resulted the inherently safer bunkering technology when compared to the other solutions followed by mgo based concept whereas lng concepts resulted inherently less safe the criticalities affecting the safety performance of lng based technologies and in particular the ship to ship configuration are related to the lng transfer equipment the safety of lng transfer operations emerged as the main critical point in the safety of lng fuel systems the results obtained may drive i the selection of future alternative processes based on lng technologies and ii the safety improvement of the most critical components in the bunkering systems considered for further development thus the present methodology may constitute a starting point to support the holistic evaluation of novel green shipping technologies providing a detailed screening of safety issues to be integrated with the analysis to environmental and economic aspects appendix a reference schemes quantification the knowledge of reference operating conditions and key features of the units considered in this study constitutes an essential information for the quantitative consequence assessment and thus for the application of the methodology developed in the present work data adopted for systems based on lng technologies concepts a and b are reported in table a1 while data for concept c based on ifo utilization and concept d based on mgo utilization are reported in tables a2 and a3 respectively process conditions and equipment features of the s lng block in concept a are representative of a 10 000 m3 small scale lng terminal based on current industrial practice det norske veritas 2012 2014 dma 2012 gie 2018 in accordance with current design solutions cen 2007 a typical tank size of 1450 m3 was selected thus obtaining seven storage units d01 d07 in this case part of the stored lng may be devoted to feed other end users such as truck loading bays and or regasification units with direct delivery to the natural gas network in concept b the storage portion devoted to other users which is about 30 considering the average value for current lng medium or small scale terminals in europe gie 2018 is not considered thus the stored volume is reduced by 30 obtaining a storage facility with only five

22724,in this work a six degrees of freedom dof nonlinear kinematic and dynamic model of a hybrid autonomous underwater vehicle h auv is derived for the two modes of locomotion propelled and gliding modes a comprehensive linearization algorithm is developed to include both modes of locomotion starting with a three dimensional time parameterized curve of position history frenet serret frames are used to specify the unknown nominal states which in turn are used to obtain the nominal inputs a linear time variant ltv state space model is obtained and a linear quadratic regulator lqr is designed and applied to the nonlinear model the performance of the devised controller is assessed via a metric that computes the error between the actual and the desired position simulation results show that the lqr provides accurate tracking performance even in the presence of underwater currents with bounded flow velocity moreover the controller autonomously switches modes between propulsion and gliding to ensure minimal trajectory tracking error and energy consumption keywords autonomous underwater vehicle linear time varying state space model trajectory tracking robust control linearization 1 introduction in the last decades the field of marine robotics has witnessed significant development that is motivated by the need for exploring the oceans and collecting scientific data from deep underwater areas recently autonomous underwater vehicles auvs have garnered the interest of several research institutions and they have been developed in many countries the conventional auv has a torpedo shape that is driven by at least one propeller to go forward and control surfaces to change direction and altitude examples of auvs can be seen in prestero 2001 yoerger et al 2007 hagen et al 2008 jun et al 2009 and zhang et al 2017 propelled auvs consume large amounts of energy which limits their continuous operation time to a few hours underwater gliders are another type of underwater vehicles that are driven by varying their buoyancy which is acheived by pumping water in or out of a control chamber and thus controlling the position of the vehicle s center of mass by controlling the vehicle s buoyancy to be greater than or less than that of the sea water the vehicle dives down then floats up while gliding forward in a saw tooth path given its fixed wings and shifted center of mass unlike propelled underwater vehicles gliders consume significantly less energy which makes their operation time last for days mahmoudian et al 2010 examples of underwater gliders can be seen in alvarez 2010 webb et al 2001 eriksen et al 2001 sherman et al 2001 and barker 2012 significant research effort is being invested in the area of motion control of autonomous underwater vehicles in order to allow them to roam the oceans freely and be able to collect scientific data accurately therefore these vehicles should be equipped with advanced control systems that command them to go to their desired destinations while being exposed to the harsh sea environment the motion control problems for underwater vehicles addressed in the literature are divided into three classifications point stabilization path following and trajectory tracking control problems in point stabilization control the vehicle is commanded to be steered to a desired position and orientation from an initial configuration in path following control the vehicle is commanded to converge to and follow a desired geometric path without any temporal specifications trajectory tracking control requires the vehicle to track a desired time parameterized curve in this work a nonlinear six degrees of freedom 6 dof dynamic and kinematic model of a hybrid autonomous underwater vehicle h auv is derived the h auv combines the features of a propelled auv and those of an underwater glider when high speed and dynamic maneuvering are required the vehicle switches to the thrust mode by turning on the propeller when conserving energy and extending battery life are required the vehicle switches to gliding mode by turning off the propeller the aim of this work is to design a single controller for both modes of operation which commands the vehicle to track a trajectory in three dimensional 3d space parameterized with respect to time in the presence of disturbance the controller also determines turning on the propeller when disturbances are encountered in the gliding mode decoupling the nonlinear 6 dof dynamic model of the auv into independent subsystems can simplify the control design problem in healey and lienard 1993 the nonlinear model was decoupled into three independent non interacting subsystems steering diving and speed control each subsystem had multiple states and a single input which were different and independent from those of the other subsystems and each subsystem was linearized about constant operating points a control law for each linearized single input multiple output simo subsystem was derived however when these control laws are applied to the coupled nonlinear model as expected they give unsatisfactory results in this work the control design problem is simplified by linearizing the 6 dof model about a given 3d curve parameterized with respect to time without decoupling and a linear time variant ltv multi input multi output mimo state space model is obtained a single control law is derived taking into account the coupled model in order to overcome the conflict between the control inputs while keeping the control design problem simplified in fryxell 1994 the authors introduce a trajectory tracking problem for an autonomous underwater vehicle where gain scheduled controllers were used to command the vehicle to track a desired trajectory a different approach for solving the problem of path following was first introduced in samson 1992 where the problem of path following for wheeled land robots was solved using lyapunov based nonlinear techniques based on the kinematic model later this work was extended in encarnaçao et al 2000 and encarnaçao and pascoal 2000 to deal with underwater vehicles where a lyapunov based nonlinear controller was developed for the kinematic model then backstepping techniques were used to extend the controller to include the dynamics of the system it is assumed in samson 1992 encarnaçao et al 2000 and encarnaçao and pascoal 2000 that the position of the virtual vehicle should be at the closest point on the desired path to the vehicle this assumption creates a drawback to this path following control approach as it stipulates that the initial position error of the vehicle should be smaller than the smallest radius of curvature in the desired path furthermore this assumption imposes limitations on the shape of the path to be followed where the path should be chosen such that singularities which occur when the distance between the vehicle and the desired path is not well specified are avoided for example when the actual vehicle is positioned exactly at the center of curvature of a circular path this limitation was solved in casalino et al 1995 for wheeled robots by controlling the motion of the virtual target on the desired path which results in introducing an extra degree of freedom in the position error between the actual vehicle and the virtual target later this work was extended in aicardi et al 2001 for the control of underactuated underwater vehicles where the controller was built based on the kinametic model the work in aicardi et al 2001 was further developed in lapierre and soetanto 2007 to extend the controller to include the dynamics of the system using backstepping techniques see also fossen 2011 in zhou et al 2018 a bio inspired model is integrated and backstepping technique is applied to perform three dimensional trajectory tracking for an underactuated auv an adaptive second order sliding mode controller is used in zhang et al 2018 for auv path following control where the adaptive controller estimates the upper bound of disturbance and eliminates chattering effect in the control output trajectory tracking control for a car trailer system was addressed in divelbiss and wen 1997 in which the authors proposed a scheme consisting of three steps a generating a path offline and using it to construct a trajectory by setting the velocity profile to the maximum b linearizing the kinematic model of the car about the generated trajectory and c applying a time varying linear quadratic regulator to track the trajectory in joo and qu 2015 the authors linearized the dynamic model of an underwater glider about two sets of operating points which correspond to the cases when the vehicle dives down and floats up a linear quadratic regulator is then derived to control the depth of the vehicle and command it to move in a saw tooth path the methods in this paper are based on the work in makdah et al 2016 where the control design for the trajectory tracking problem was simplified by linearizing the 6 dof dynamic and kinematic model of the auv about a given optimal 3d trajectory a time varying linear quadratic regulator was designed based on the linear model and applied to the nonlinear model to track the given trajectory the limitation of the vehicle s initial position error with respect to the path was avoided because the given trajectory was generated after specifying the vehicle s initial and final positions and orientations using the work in wehbe et al 2014 2015 2017 the trajectories could be optimal similar to the ones given in hammoud and shammas 2016 while the work in makdah et al 2016 dealt with the thrust mode only this work also includes controling the vehicle in gliding mode the 6 dof model of the h auv is derived for both modes of operation and the model is linearized about a given trajectory to arrive at a linear time varying state space model which is used to design a linear quadratic regulator in makdah et al 2016 frenet serret frames were used to calculate the nominal states about which the nonlinear dynamic and kinematic model was linearized which added an unnecessary restriction on the desired orientation of the vehicle and resulted in increased control effort another contribution of this paper is the design of a single control law that determines the mode of operation based on the type of the given time parameterized curve of position history which avoids the hazards of switching between control laws the controller also determines whether to turn the propeller on during gliding mode in the presence of disturbances furthermore the restriction on the desired vehicle orientation due to frenet serret frames is investigated by recording the trajectory and states which are generated from open loop simulation of the 6 dof nonlinear model when applying known inputs to it the recorded trajectory is considered as the nominal trajectory about which the nonlinear model is linearized the open loop inputs are then compared to the lqr control inputs that are obtained from the linearized system by assigning more weight on the vehicle position and less weight on its orientation the restriction on the desired orientation of the frenet serret frames is relaxed which results in reduced control effort while maintaining accurate tracking of the desired trajectory to quantify the accuracy of the position controller a metric that computes the error between the actual vehicle position and the desired trajectory is introduced in this work the structure of this paper is as follows in section 2 the nonlinear 6 dof dynamic and kinematic model of the h auv is briefly discussed and a model of unknown underwater current is introduced in section 3 the nonlinear model is linearized about a given 3d trajectory to obtain a linear time varying state space model in section 3 4 a time varying linear quadratic regulator is designed based on the linear model the effect of employing frenet serret frames is investigated in section 4 where the performance of the linear quadratic regulator is evaluated in simulation followed by a discussion of the obtained results finally the paper is concluded and future work is discussed in section 5 2 h auv model the underwater vehicle which is developed and is being manufactured at the american university of beirut employs a hybrid design which combines the characteristics of a propelled auv and an underwater glider a computer aided design cad model of the h auv is shown in fig 1 when high speed maneuvers are required the vehicle turns on the propeller and switches to thrust mode when conserving energy and extending battery life are required the vehicle turns off the propeller and switches to gliding mode in gliding mode the vehicle is driven by alternatively changing its density to be greater than or less than that of the sea water by pumping water in and out of an enclosed chamber respectively when water is pumped into the chamber the vehicle s mass increases and its center of mass shifts from its geometric center towards the nose which makes the vehicle negatively buoyant and causes it to pitch down while diving vise versa when water is pumped out of the chamber the vehicle s mass decreases and its center of mass shifts from its geometric center towards the rear which makes the vehicle positively buoyant and causes it to pitch up while floating as the vehicle dives down or floats up it also glides and moves forward due to the effect of the fixed wings hence in gliding mode the vehicle can move forward in a saw tooth pattern by alternatively pumping water in and out of its chamber details about the vehicle s design can be found in wehbe et al 2014 as depicted in fig 1 the h auv has four control surfaces that are attached at the rear end in a cruciform pattern two coupled rudder fins to control the yaw motion and two decoupled stern fins to control the pitch and roll motions a propeller is attached to the rear end of the vehicle to provide thrust force in the surge direction the rest of this section discusses the frames of reference assignment and describes h auv s kinematic and dynamic models 2 1 frames of reference assignment according to the society of naval architects and marine engineers sname sname 1952 two frames of reference are assigned to describe the motion of the h auv 1 an earth fixed coordinate frame s with the origin o s fixed at an arbitrary position on the surface of the ocean and the z s axis pointing towards the center of the earth and 2 a body fixed coordinate frame b with its origin o b placed at the vehicle s geometric center and the x b axis pointing towards the vehicle s nose as shown in fig 2 the sname notation is used to describe the general motion of the vehicle in the six degrees of freedom 1 η η 1 t η 2 t t η 1 x y z t η 2 ϕ θ ψ t ν ν 1 t ν 2 t t ν 1 u v w t ν 2 p q r t τ τ 1 t τ 2 t t τ 1 x y z t τ 2 k m n t where η 1 and

the earth fixed frame s the vector ν denotes the vehicle s linear and angular velocities expressed in the body fixed frame b note that ν 2 represents the angular velocity components p q and r about the x b y b and z b axes in b the vector τ is used to denote the external forces and moments acting on the vehicle with respect to the body fixed frame b with τ 1 being the vector consisting of the external forces x y and z in the direction of x b y b and z b axes in b and τ 2 being the vector containing the external moments k m and n about the x b y b and z b axes in b 2 2 kinematic model the velocity kinematic transformation from the body fixed frame b to the earth fixed frame s is given by 2 η j η 2 ν where j η 2 is the transformation matrix that is a function of the euler angles roll ϕ pitch θ and yaw ψ the inverse transformation velocity is given by 3 ν j 1 η 2 η the transformation matrix j can be written as follows 4 j j 1 0 3 3 0 3 3 j 2 where j 1 is the linear velocity transformation matrix j 2 is the angular velocity transformation matrix and 0 3 3 is a 3 3 zero matrix the matrices j 1 and j 2 in 4 are given by 5 j 1 c ψ c θ s ψ c ϕ c ψ s θ s ϕ s ψ s ϕ c ψ c ϕ s θ

the derivations in fossen 1994 the six degrees of freedom equations of motion are derived 6 m u v r w q x g q 2 r 2 y g p q r z g p r q x m v w p u r y g r 2 p 2 z g q r p x g q p r y m w u q v p z g

vehicle s dry mass x g y g and z g are the coordinates of the vehicle s center of gravity in the body fixed frame b i x i y and i z are the vehicle s moments of inertia about the x b y b and z b axes in the body fixed frame b respectively the equations of motion in 6 can be represented in a vectorial form as 7 m r b ν c r b ν ν τ r b where m r b is the rigid body inertia matrix and c r b is the matrix containing the coriolis and centripetal terms which are also derived in fossen 1994 the external forces and moments acting on the vehicle in 6 have the following components 8 τ r b τ h y d r o s t a t i c τ a d d e d m a s s τ d r a g τ l i f t τ p r o p e l l e r where τ h y d r o s t a t i c is the hydrostatic forces and moments τ a d d e d m a s s is the term corresponding to the forces and moments generated by the added mass τ d r a g are the drag forces and moments due to skin friction τ l i f t are the lift forces and moments and τ p r o p e l l e r are the thrust force and moment generated by the propeller the derivations of these forces can be found appendix 6 2 4 modeling of the unknown underwater current the robustness of the controller is investigated in the presence of an unknown disturbance which is mainly caused by underwater current in this paper the underwater current is modeled as a velocity flow field and it is expressed with respect to the global frame as follows 9 ν c s u c s v c s w c s where u c s v c s and w c s are underwater current velocities along the direction of the x s y s and z s axes of the global frame respectively the velocity flow field of the underwater current is assumed to have constant uniform magnitude and constant direction with respect to the global frame of reference to include the effect of the unknown underwater current velocity in the 6 dof nonlinear model in 7 it is expressed with respect to the body fixed frame this is done using the linear velocity transformation matrix j 1 from the body fixed frame b to the earth fixed frame s as follows 10 ν c b j 1 1 ν c s j 1 1 u c s v c s w c s the effect of the underwater current velocity is then included in the 6 dof dynamic model by substituting ν with ν r in 7 where 11 ν r ν ν c b since the vehicle exhibits slow dynamics and the flow field of the underwater current is constant in magnitude and direction with respect to the global frame ν c b is negligible and is assumed to be zero the vectorial 6 dof dynamic equation of motion becomes 12 m r b ν c r b ν r ν r τ r b note that the kinematic equations in 2 are not affected by the underwater current terms 3 linearization about a given trajectory and control design in this section the nonlinear model in 7 and 2 is linearized about a given smooth 3d curve parameterized with respect to time γ t x n m t y n m t z n m t which satisfies the following assumptions a 1 the path is smooth and the motion is steady a 2 the path is dynamically feasible in which it does not inherit maneuvers and velocities that cannot be performed by the vehicle a 3 the path is regular in which the arc distance along the curve increases monotonically with time a 4 the desired time parameterized 3d γ t is constructed using planning algorithms such that the initial point of γ t coincides with the actual position of the vehicle the nonlinear model can be written in state space form as 13 χ f χ u m which includes the six dynamic equations of motion in 7 and the six kinematic equations in 2 χ ν η t is the state vector of length 12 u x t δ r δ s r δ s l t is the input vector of length 4 which consists of the thrust force x t provided by the propeller the rudder fins δ r the right stern fin δ s r and the left stern fin δ s l angles and m is the mass of the vehicle it is worth noting that once the desired trajectory is known the mode of operation of the h auv propulsion or gliding is determined thus setting the mass of the vehicle m in 13 in order to linearize the model in 13 about the nominal trajectory the nominal states χ n m t and inputs u n m t which satisfy the desired trajectory γ t must be computed at each time step as well as the desired mass m at the end of this section a linear quadratic regualtor is designed based on the linearized model and the derived control law is applied to the nonlinear model 3 1 calculating the unknown nominal states when a desired three dimensional curve of position history that specifies only a subset of the nominal states namely η 1 n m x n m t y n m t z n m t t with respect to s is given as a function of time the remaining nominal states need to be calculated to calculate the desired vehicle s orientation η 2 n m t ϕ n m t θ n m t ψ n m t t along the trajectory consider the frenet serret fs frame associated with each point on the path at each instant of time with its unit vectors t tangent to the path n normal to the path and pointing towards its center of curvature and b t n as shown in fig 2 the position of the origin of the frenet serret frame o f s with respect to s is the desired position of the vehicle η 1 n m x n m t y n m t z n m t t the desired orientation parametrizes the rotation matrix from the fs frame to the s frame as shown in the following equation 14 r fs s t t s n t s b t s c ψ n m c θ n m s ψ n m c ϕ n m c ψ n m s θ n m s ϕ n m s ψ n m s ϕ n m c ψ n m c ϕ n m s θ n m s ψ n m c θ n m c ψ n m c ϕ n m s ϕ n m s

in accordance with that introduced in spong et al 2006 to calculate the coordinates of the unit vectors of fs with respect to s the given 3d time parameterized curve of position history γ t is reparameterized with respect to the arc length to get α s x n m s y n m s z n m s the arc length is defined as 15 s γ γ t d t where γ t is the first time derivative of γ t and γ t is the absolute velocity of the curve with respect to s the coordinates of the unit vectors t s and n s with respect to s are calculated by differentiating α s with respect to s once and twice respectively and b s t s n s the vectors are then reparameterized with respect to time for more details about frenet serret frames see carmo 1976 equation 14 is solved to obtain the desired nominal euler angles η 2 n m t following a similar approach as in spong et al 2006 the nominal pitch angle θ n m is calculated using the first element of the third row of the transformation matrix in 14 as follows 16 θ n m sin 1 t z t s where t z t s is the z coordinate of the vector t t s with respect to s since the pitch angle is desired to be near zero degrees the first solution obtained in 16 is chosen the nominal roll angle ϕ n m is then calculated using the second element of the third row of the transformation matrix in 14 as follows 17 ϕ n m sin 1 sec θ n m n z t s where n z t s is the z component of the vector n t s with respect to s similarly as the pitch angle the first solution is chosen for the nominal roll angle the yaw angle is calculated using the first and second elements of the first column of the transformation matrix in 14 as follows 18 ψ n m tan 1 t y t s t x t s k π k n where t x t s and t y t s are the x and y components of the vector t t s with respect to s respectively the nominal yaw angle is not bounded between π π to avoid discontinuity in the numerical simulation the rest of the nominal states ν n m t which represent the nominal linear and angular velocities with respect to s expressed in fs are the velocities that satisfy the given nominal curve of position history γ t and are calculated using the kinematic transformation in 3 as follows 19 ν e q t j ϕ n m θ n m ψ n m 1 η e q t where j ϕ n m θ n m ψ n m 1 is the inverse of the transformation matrix j defined in 4 that is parameterized with respect to the nominal euler angles ϕ n m θ n m and ψ n m and η n m t is the time derivative of η n m t in gliding mode the vehicle is driven by the hydro static forces buoyancy and weight which act about its center therefore when floating up or diving down the x axis of the body fixed frame x b is not necessarily tangent to the desired 3d trajectory while tracking it as is the case in thrust mode hence the longitudinal and transverse velocities u t and w t respectively differ from the nominal values calculated in 19 similarly the vehicle s pitch angle does not equal the nominal pitch angle θ n m calculated in 16 as shown in fig 3 therefore to track these nominal values the vehicle has to exert more control effort and consume more energy which defeats the gliding mode s purpose of energy conservation since the desired trajectory to be tracked in gliding mode is a saw tooth path the nonlinear model is linearized about constant operating points for the pitch angle θ longitudinal velocity u and transverse velocity w and the remaining nominal states calculated in 14 and 19 the gliding mode is divided into two phases diving phase and floating phase in each phase the nominal values for the pitch angle and transverse velocity are considered constant and different from the other phase while the nominal longitudinal velocity is assumed to be constant and fixed for both phases whether the vehicle is desired to dive down or float up is determined based on the nominal pitch angle θ n m calculated in 16 if the nominal pitch angle θ n m is positive the vehicle is desired to float up whereas if the nominal pitch angle θ n m is negative the vehicle is desired to dive down accordingly the nominal longitudnal velocity nominal transverse velocity and the nominal pitch angle in gliding mode are calculated based on the nominal pitch angle θ n m which is calculated from 16 as follows 20 u n m u g l i d i n g m s w n m t w m a x tanh θ n m t ε m s θ n m t θ m a x tanh θ n m t ε r a d where the hyperbolic tangent function tanh is used to avoid the discrete transition between the two values of w n m as well as between the two values of θ n m which occurs when the vehicle switches between the two phases floating up or diving down that is when θ n m t calculated in 16 changes sign note that although computing the nominal transverse velocity and the nominal pitch angle for gliding mode using 20 results in acceptable performance based on the simulation of the vehicle dynamics see section 4 this paper does not provide theoretical guarantees that all pitch over maneuvers can be successfully accomplished u g l i d i n g w m a x and θ m a x are constants that are calculated from open loop simulation for the cases of floating up and diving down in gliding mode as will be discussed in section 6 6 the constant ε is used for both θ n m and w n m to control the rate they each transition between their two phase values the is used to distinguish between the constant nominal longitudinal velocity transverse velocity and pitch angle used for gliding mode instead of the variable nominal longitudinal velocity transverse velocity and pitch angle that are calculated in 19 and 16 3 2 identifying the mode of operation and setting the vehicle s desired mass according to open loop simulation each mode of operation has specific range of longitudinal velocities as it will be shown in section 6 6 the vehicle s longitudinal velocity u in thrust mode is about seven times larger than that when it is in gliding mode the values of the longitudinal velocities at which the vehicle s speed ranges about in thrust mode and gliding mode are denoted as u t h r u s t m s and u g l i d i n g m s respectively it follows that the desired mode of operation is determined based on the velocity profile of the given trajectory if u n m is greater than or equal to a threshold value u t the vehicle switches to thrust mode if u n m is less than u t the vehicle switches to gliding mode the vehicle s desired mass and the x position of its center of gravity x g with respect to the body fixed frame b change according to the mode of operation when the vehicle is in the propelled mode its mass is set to a constant value that renders it neutrally buoyant and the position of its center of gravity is at the origin of the body fixed frame b hence the corresponding nonlinear state space form is written as 21 χ f χ u m n e u t r a l where m n e u t r a l is the mass of the vehicle when its chamber is half full of sea water neutrally buoyant in gliding mode the mass of the vehicle varies between m m i n and m m a x where m m i n is the mass of the vehicle when its chamber is empty of sea water vehicle is positively buoyant and m m a x is the mass of the vehicle when its chamber is full of sea water vehicle is negatively buoyant also the x position of vehicle s center of gravity x g with respect to b varies between x g m i n and x g m a x which are specified by design to simplify the linearization process of the gliding dynamics the mass of the vehicle and the x position of its center of gravity are set to be constant to m m i n and x g m i n respectively when it is floating up and to m m a x and x g m a x respectively when it is diving down as such the nonlinear state space form for the gliding mode is written as χ f χ u m m i n when the vehicle is floating up and χ f χ u m m a x when the vehicle is diving down whether the vehicle is desired to be floating up or diving down is determined by the nominal pitch angle if the nominal pitch angle is positive the vehicle is desired to be floating up to follow the desired trajectory its mass and the x position of its center of gravity with respect to b are set to m m i n and x g m i n respectively whereas if the nominal pitch angle is negative the vehicle is desired to be diving down to track the desired trajectory its mass and the x position of its center of gravity with respect to b are set to m m a x and x g m a x respectively in gliding mode the desired mass is calculated based on the nominal pitch angle θ n m using the following equation 22 m g l i d i n g 1 k g tanh θ n m t ε m n e u t r a l where the hyperbolic tangent function t a n h is used to avoid the discontinuity between m m i n and m m a x when the nominal pitch angle changes from positive to negative the constant ε is used to control the rate of transition between m m i n and m m a x the x position of the vehicle s center of gravity with respect to the body fixed frame b x g is coupled with the mass of the vehicle so when the mass changes between m m i n and m m a x x g changes between x g m i n and x g m a x respectively according to the following relationship 23 x g c g m g l i d i n g m n e u t r a l where c g is a constant equal to x g m a x and m g l i d i n g is calculated in 22 notice that in order to glide forward in gliding mode the vehicle must alternatively switch between ascending and descending gilding motions following this if a horizontal trajectory with a forward velocity less than u t is provided based on the above mentioned method the vehicle will switch to the gliding mode however in this case the vehicle will fail to track the trajectory since in gliding mode the vehicle must have a minimum attainable ascending or descending pitch angle in order to glide forward this case is avoided since the desired trajectory to be tracked is generated while accounting for this limitation consider the additional two assumptions a 5 the desired time parameterized 3d curve generated for the gliding mode should have a forward velocity less than u t and should not have zero pitch angle with zero pitch angular velocity at any given time a 6 the desired time parameterized 3d curve generated for the propelled mode should have a forward velocity greater than or equal to u t remark 1 in this work for the gliding mode only saw tooth trajectory which satisfies assumptions a 1 a 2 a 3 a 4 and a 5 is considered for the analysis and for the controllability check as for the propelled mode the s shaped trajectory see section 4 and the 3d dubin trajectory generated using wehbe et al 2015 wehbe et al 2014 wehbe et al 2017 are studied and considered for the controllability analysis note that the later two trajectories satisfy assumptions a 1 a 2 a 3 a 4 and a 6 it is noted that the work in this paper can be applied to 3d curves that satisfy the stipulated assumptions given that the linearized system is state controllable 3 3 calculating the nominal inputs after determining the nominal states the nominal inputs u n m that satisfy the nominal trajectory need to be calculated to linearize the system about them the nominal inputs are calculated from 13 evaluated at the nominal trajectory 24 χ n m f χ n m u n m m d e s i r e d however the inputs which are included in 13 and 24 do not appear in the kinematic equations therefore only the six dynamic equations in 24 are needed to calculate the nominal inputs the six dynamic equations in 7 evaluated at the nominal states can be written in the following form 25 ν n m f 1 ν n m ϕ n m θ n m u n m m d e s i r e d ν n m ν n m ϕ n m θ n m and m d e s i r e d in 25 are known and only the nominal inputs vector u n m is unknown and needs to be solved for equation 25 is simplified into the following linear form with respect to the unknown nominal inputs vector 26 n u n m b where n is a 6 4 matrix b is a vector of length 6 and both are known the system of equations in 26 is overdetermined since there are six equations and four unknowns nominal inputs x t h r u s t δ r δ s r and δ s l therefore an exact solution for u n m that satisfies the six equations does not exist rather u n m is estimated by minimizing the error e n u n m b in the least mean square lms sense and it can be determined from 27 u n m n t n 1 n t b note that the solution computed using 27 is not the only solution that satisfies the nominal trajectory later in section 4 1 it will be shown that for a given trajectory different input solutions are obtained moreover this method does not guarantee that a set of inputs can be computed for any arbitrary path especially for dynamically infeasible paths now that the nominal states χ n m t nominal inputs u n m t and desired vehicle s mass m d e s i r e d are calculated from the desired time parameterized curve of position history γ t equation 13 can be linearized and written in the following ltv state space form 28 χ t a t χ t b t u t where χ χ χ n m and u u u n m it is noted that the linearization is performed about the nominal solutions that are obtained for the states and inputs given a smooth path and steady motion in which deviations from the prescribed path are assumed negligible a t is a 12 12 matrix and b t is a 12 4 matrix which are calculated from equation 13 as follows de oliveira 2015 29 a t f χ χ χ n m t u u n m t b t f u χ χ n m t u u n m t the output equation of the state space model in 28 is written as follows 30 y t c χ t d u t where c is a 12 12 matrix and d is a 12 4 matrix it is assumed that all states are available for measurement at each instant of time so matrices c and d are given by 31 c i 12 12 d 0 12 4 where i 12 12 is a 12 12 identity matrix the steps for linearization about a given trajectory are summarized in algorithm 1 remark 2 controllability of ltv systems the controllability of the linearized system in 28 is investigated by checking the rank of the following matrix for t t 0 t f 32 w t k 0 t k 1 t k i t where i is a positive integer such that for t t 0 t f b t is i times continuously differentiable a t is i 1 times continuously differentiable and 33 k 0 t b t k j t a t k j 1 t k j 1 t j 1 2 i for the linearized systems that are obtained by linearizing about the 3d curves mentioned in remark 1 and for i 2 w t is full rank through out the history of the trajectories the details of used method can be found in rugh and rugh 1996 algorithm 1 linearization about a given trajectory 3 4 controller design in this subsection a linear quadratic regulator is designed based on the linearized model and the derived control law is applied to the nonlinear model the trajectory tracking problem is transformed into a regulation problem which is achieved by creating a deviation error system whose state space form is given by 28 the details of the used method can be found in chapter 14 of anderson and moore 2007 consider the linear time variant state space model in 28 the feedback lqr control law is written as follows 34 u t k t χ t where u t is the vector of the feedback control inputs of length 4 χ t χ t χ n m t is state error vector of length 12 and k t is a 4 12 matrix containing the control gains which vary with time the control gains of the lqr control law are calculated such that the control law in 34 minimizes the following cost function 35 h 1 2 t 0 t f χ t q χ u t r u d t where t 0 and t f are the initial and the final time of the of the vehicle s mission to track the given 3d curve γ t respectively q is a 12 12 weighing matrix for the states r is 4 4 weighing matrix for the inputs and both matrices are positive semi definite the limits of the integral in 35 also correspond to the initial and final time within which γ t is defined the control gains k that minimize the cost function h are calculated as follows 36 k t r 1 b t t p t where p t is a 12 12 matrix and is calculated by solving the following differential algebraic riccati equation 37 a t t p t p t a t q p t b t r 1 b t t p t p t which is solved numerically at each time step for more details about lqr see kirk 2012 4 simulation in this section the linearization algorithm and the derived controller are investigated via simulation the results of the open loop simulation for the derived nonlinear model can be found in the appendix 4 1 investigating the linearization algorithm to investigate the effect of frenet serret frames that are used to calculate the nominal euler angles and nominal velocities an arbitrary trajectory γ ˆ t x ˆ t y ˆ t z ˆ t t along with its corresponding states χ ˆ o l t are recorded from open loop simulation that involves applying known inputs u ˆ o l to the nonlinear model in 13 two linear systems are derived the first is derived by linearizing 21 about the recorded states χ n m t and the second is derived using algorithm 1 with the recorded curve of position history γ ˆ t as its input a control law is designed for each of the derived linear systems in order to investigate the use of the frenet serret frames in algorithm 1 the performance of the derived control laws u and u to command the vehicle to track the recorded trajectory are compared in simulation when applied to the nonlinear model the method is summarized in the block diagram given in fig 4 and the notations used in the figure are described in table 1 a metric that measures the error between the actual vehicle position and the desired trajectory is derived in order to compare the performance of the two systems the position error is calculated at each time step to be the smallest distance between the actual vehicle position and the desired trajectory consider e τ to be the error between the actual vehicle position at time τ and the time parameterized nominal trajectory given by 38 e τ t η 1 τ η 1 n m t η 1 τ x τ y τ z τ η 1 n m t x n m t y n m t z n m t where η 1 is the vector containing the actual vehicle position and η 1 n m is the vector containing the nominal position since η 1 n m contains the desired position parameterized with respect to time e τ in 38 is also parameterized with respect to time at each instant of time τ the distance between the vehicle s actual position η 1 τ x τ y τ z τ t and the nominal time parameterized curve of positions η 1 n m t x n m t y n m t z n m t t can be expressed as follows 39 d i s t τ t e τ 2 e τ t t e τ t to obtain the shortest distance between the vehicle s actual position at time τ and the time parameterized curve of positions the time that minimizes 39 is solved for 40 t argmin t d i s t τ t which will correspond to the instant of time at which the point on the nominal time parameterized curve of positions η 1 n m t x n m t y n m t z n m t t is the closest to the vehicle s actual position at time τ η 1 τ x τ y τ z τ t the performance of both control systems to track the recorded trajectory is shown in fig 5 where γ t γ ˆ t and γ t are defined in table 1 as observed in the figure both control laws have accurate tracking performance when applied to the nonlinear model to quantitatively compare the tracking performance of the two systems the r m s error between the vehicle s actual position and the position of its corresponding nearest point on the nominal time parameterized curve is calculated at each time step τ as follows 41 r m s τ e τ t t e τ t where e τ is defined in 38 and t is calculated using 40 the r m s error is plotted for each system in fig 6 where r m s and r m s are the root mean square errors that correspond to the control laws u and u that are derived as in fig 4 respectively as observed in fig 6 the r m s position error of both control systems ranges between 0 015 and 0 04 m which is relatively small when compared with the desired path dimensions it is also observed that the r m s errors of the trajectories generated from both control systems are approximately equal fig 7 and fig 8 show the open loop inputs δ ˆ s r δ ˆ s l and δ ˆ r the controlled inputs that are derived based on frenet serret frames δ s r δ s l and δ r and the controlled inputs that are derived based on the recorded states from open loop simulation δ s r δ s l and δ r fig 7 shows how each control law commands disparate inputs which is expected because the system is underactuated i e number of inputs is less than the system s degrees of freedom it is noted that the open loop stern angles δ ˆ s r and δ ˆ s l used to generate the recorded trajectory are considerably different from the controlled stern angles δ s r and δ s l which is due to the fact that more weight is put on the position in the q matrix when designing the lqr in 35 in conclusion simulation results support the feasibility of using frenet serret frames in algorithm 1 for calculating the nominal euler angles and nominal velocities without loss of fidelity 4 2 energy efficiency of the closed loop controller in order to investigate the effect of using frenet serret frames to calculate the nominal euler angles and the nominal velocities on the controlled actuators energy consumption an r m s value of the fins angular velocities is calculated at each time step for the controllers u and u as well as for the open loop inputs u o l this r m s value is denoted as v r m s and is calculated as follows 42 v r m s δ s r 2 δ s l 2 δ r 2 where δ s r δ s l and δ r are the right stern left stern and the rudder angular velocities respectively this metric provides an intuition about the efficiency of the closed loop controllers since the energy provided by the control surfaces actuators is proportional to the control surfaces angular velocities the v r m s values for the closed loop controller generated based on frenet serret frames u the closed loop controller generated based on the recorded states u and the open loop inputs u ˆ o l are shown in fig 9 as observed in the figure closed loop controllers u and u have lower v r m s value than that of the open loop inputs also it is observed in fig 9 that v r m s is lower than v r m s which indicates that the closed loop controller that is generated based on frenet serret frame u consumes less energy than the controller generated based on the recorded states u and the open loop inputs u ˆ o l this is due to the fact that more weight is put on the position in the q matrix when designing the lqr in 35 4 3 closed loop simulation in the presence of bounded unknown underwater current the performance of the linear controller to command the vehicle to track a 3d trajectory is investigated in the presence of unknown underwater current to test the controller three trajectories are used for simulation s shaped trajectory that is recorded from open loop simulation 3d dubin s trajectory to test the controller in thrust mode and a saw tooth trajectory to test the controller in gliding mode in each scenario the desired trajectory is considered as an input for algorithm 1 about which the nonlinear system in 13 is linearized and a linear quadratic regulator is designed accordingly in this work underwater current is modeled as a velocity field expressed with respect to the global reference frame it is noted here that modeling underwater current as a force field yielded unreasonable results in preliminary simulations not included in this work since the model treats the underwater current as a constant force acting only on the center of mass of the vehicle regardless of its outer geometric shape the effect of the underwater current velocity is included in the nonlinear state space model in 13 by substituting χ with χ r where 43 χ r ν r η t and ν r is given in 11 the nonlinear state space model with disturbance is expressed as follows 44 χ r f χ r u m to test the controller s performance in the presence of unknown underwater current the derived lqr is applied to 44 in the database of the surface ocean velocity provided in ocean surface current ana 2017 the average maximum surface velocity is measured to be 0 4 m s knowing that the velocity of seawater is maximum at the surface the value of 0 4 m s is adopted in this paper as the maximum velocity of the underwater current used in simulation fig 10 a shows the tracking of an s shaped trajectory which is recorded from open loop simulation fig 5 in the presence of constant underwater current of 0 7 m s flow velocity which is larger than the measured maximum surface velocity of 0 4 m s as observed in fig 10a the controller shows accurate tracking performance when applied to the nonlinear model in 44 in the presence of unknown underwater current which is applied at 20 s e c o n d s into the simulation whose run time is 100 s e c o n d s the shaded tubular region in fig 10a indicates the portion of the trajectory at which the disturbance is applied fig 10b shows the r m s position error between the actual vehicle position and the nominal trajectory calculated using 38 and 39 the error is approximately zero before the disturbance is applied at t 20 s the light blue shaded region between t 20 s and t 100 s refers to the time interval at which the disturbance is applied the r m s error reaches a maximum value of 2 m at t 40 s in the presence of disturbance which is still within the acceptable range compared with the desired path dimensions the error values between the actual and nominal euler angles are shown in fig 10c which shows error values close to zero before the disturbance is applied at t 20 s after the disturbance is applied the euler angles deviate from their nominal values as shown within the light blue shaded area it is noticed that the vehicle is no longer tangent to the trajectory that it is traversing since it is an underactuated system therefore to counter the side flow of the underwater current the vehicle orients itself with the propeller s thrust force and lift forces generated from the control surfaces which can be seen in fig 10a at t 65 s it is also observed in fig 10c that the actual roll angle deviates from its nominal value after five seconds from the beginning of the simulation at which the vehicle begins to steer this occurs since the vehicle s center of mass is designed to be 5 c m lower than its geometric center which forces the vehicle to bank when steering due to centrifugal forces that act on its center of mass the input signals are shown in fig 10d e and fig 10f as observed in fig 10d before the disturbance is applied at t 20 s the propeller provides a constant force of 0 15 k n after applying the disturbance depicted by the light blue shaded region the thrust force increases to a maximum value of 0 3 k n when the vehicle is moving upstream the underwater current and decreases to a value below 0 15 k n when the vehicle is moving downstream the underwater current in order to maintain the desired longitudinal velocity of 1 5 m s without disturbances the stern and rudder angles in figs 10e and f are similar to the control signals derived from the linearized system shown in figs 7 and 8 after applying the disturbance light blue shaded region the controlled angles of the fins change from their corresponding signals to adjust the vehicle s orientation and counter the underwater current notice that in fig 10a and c the controller prioritizes tracking of the vehicle s position over its orientation which is due to the larger weight that is assigned to position states over the other states in the q matrix in 35 fig 11 a shows the tracking of 3d dubin s trajectory in the presence of constant unknown underwater current with flow velocity of 0 7 m s the desired 3d dubin s trajectory is derived using the method developed in wehbe et al 2015 and it consists of five parts in the following order constant pitch helix variable pitch helix straight line variable pitch helix and a constant pitch helix fig 11a shows that the controller has good tracking performance when applied to the nonlinear model in 44 in the presence of disturbance which is applied at t 20 s the light blue shaded tubular region in the figure refers to the portion of the trajectory at which the disturbance is applied the r m s position error between the actual trajectory and the nominal dubin s trajectory as a function of time is shown in fig 10c which shows that the r m s error is approximately zero before the disturbance is applied and the error increases to a maximum of 0 4 m in the presence of disturbance which is still within the acceptable range compared with the desired path dimensions fig 11c shows error values between the actual and desired euler angles where the euler angles converge to their desired values before the disturbance is applied after applying the disturbance as depicted by the light blue shaded area the angles deviate from their desired values and the vehicle is no longer tangent to the trajectory that it is traversing similar to the s shaped trajectory tracking case in the presence of underwater current the vehicle aligns itself in the most suitable orientation to counter the underwater current with the propeller s thrust force and the lift forces that are generated from the fins while tracking the desired trajectory which can be seen in fig 11a at t 35 s it is also observed in figs 11b and c that the r m s error and the euler angles error values reach steady state when the vehicle is tracking the straight line portion of the trajectory in the presence of constant disturbance and they do not converge to zero in addition upon completing the straight line portion of the dubin s trajectory at t 44 s the error values in figs 11b and c increase and accumulate not being able to achieve zero steady state error is due to the employment of full state feedback which is of the proportional type that possesses this characteristic to drive the steady state error to zero and avoid error accumulation over time an integrator can be added to the control law in 34 the input signals are shown in fig 11d e and fig 11f as observed in fig 11d the propeller provides a constant thrust force of 0 15 k n before applying the disturbance in order to maintain a constant longitudinal velocity of 1 5 m s after the disturbance is applied light blue shaded region the thrust force increases to a maximum value of 0 27 k n when the vehicle moves opposite to the flow direction and decreases when the vehicle moves with the flow direction figs 11e and f show the control signals of the stern and rudder angles respectively the stern and rudder angles have constant values when the vehicle tracks the straight line portion of the dubin s trajectory in the presence of constant disturbance between t 20 s and t 44 s since the vehicle s orientation and velocity reach steady state values since the 3d dubin s trajectory consists of five segments the control inputs in fig 11d e and fig 11f change abruptly during the transition between segments which is due to the kinematic nature of dubin s curves that require instantaneous change in the vehicle s orientation infinite control energy between segments the tracking performance of the controller in gliding mode is shown in fig 11b where the controller commands the vehicle to track a saw tooth trajectory in the presence of underwater current with a flow velocity of 0 26 m s the controller exhibits good tracking performance in the presence of the unknown underwater current which is applied between t 30 s and t 300 s shown in the shaded region the r m s position error between the actual trajectory and the nominal saw tooth trajectory as a function of time is shown in fig 12 a the error is almost zero before the disturbance is applied it increases to a maximum value of 0 51 m in the presence of the disturbance and it decreases to a value of 0 15 m when the disturbance is stopped at t 300 s the light blue shaded region in fig 12b refers to the time interval at which the disturbance is applied the error values between the actual euler angles and their corresponding nominal values are shown in fig 12c as seen the euler angles converge to their desired values before the disturbance is applied with the exception of the pitch angle θ given that the initial orientation of the vehicle is at zero pitch angle whereas the desired pitch angle at time zero is 0 2769 r a d as shown in table 7 in the diving case of the gliding mode when the disturbance is applied between t 30 s and t 300 s light blue shaded region the error values increase and the vehicle orients itself in the most suitable orientation to counter the underwater current with lift forces generated from the fins and the propeller s thrust force which is turned on to overcome the disturbance when the disturbance is stopped at t 300 s the error values of the euler angles converge to zero except for the error in pitch angle which does not converge to zero until it crosses the curved tip of the saw tooth trajectory this occurs since the disturbance is turned off while the vehicle is traversing a straight line portion of the saw tooth trajectory during which the vehicle s orientation and velocity are at steady state when the disturbance is turned off the pitch angle error does not go to zero until the vehicle crosses the curved tip of the saw tooth trajectory at t 400 s the time at which the vehicle s orientation and velocity are no longer at steady state the input control signals are shown in fig 12d e and fig 12f as seen in fig 12d the propeller provides zero thrust force before the disturbance is applied when the disturbance is applied between t 30 s and t 300 s light blue shaded area the propeller turns on and provides an average thrust force of 0 01 k n in order to counter the underwater current and to maintain the desired longitudinal velocity of 0 2 m s when the disturbance is removed the propeller turns off to conserve energy figs 12e and f show the control signals of the stern and rudder angles respectively the stern and rudder angles exhibit oscillatory behavior when the disturbance is applied light blue shaded region while the rudder angle returns to zero when the disturbance is removed the stern angles do not until the vehicle crosses the next curved tip at t 400 s that is attributed to the error in the pitch angle θ which remains after the disturbance is turned off at t 300 s 4 4 testing robustness in this subsection the robustness of the derived control law for gliding mode is investigated in the presence of unknown underwater current with flow velocity that is large enough to render the vehicle unstable and diverge of the nominal trajectory the same saw tooth curve from subsection 4 3 is used in this subsection s simulation similar procedure is used to derive the control law where the time parameterized saw tooth curve is considered an input for algorithm 1 and a linear quadratic regulator is derived based on the linearized model the derived lqr is then applied to the nonlinear model in 44 to command the vehicle to track the saw tooth trajectory in the presence of unknown underwater current the underwater current is applied between t 30 s and t 300 s with flow velocity of 0 27 m s which is rather excessive and is larger than the value used in subsection 4 3 the tracking performance of the controller is shown in fig 13 a as observed in the figure the controller fails to command the vehicle to track the desired trajectory when the disturbance is applied and the vehicle diverges away from the nominal trajectory the input control signals are shown in fig 13b c and fig 13d as seen in fig 13b the propeller provides zero thrust force before the disturbance is applied when the disturbance is applied at t 30 s light blue shaded area the propeller turns on and provides an average thrust force of 0 01 k n in order to counter the underwater current and to maintain the desired longitudinal velocity of 0 2 m s after crossing the first tooth tip at t 134 s the vehicle loses its stability and the thrust force oscillates between 0 k n and 300 k n then it saturates at 300 k n figs 13c and d show the control signals of the stern and rudder angles respectively as observed the stern and rudder angles exhibit oscillatory behavior when the disturbance is applied light blue shaded area 5 conclusions in this work the linearization algorithm that was developed in makdah et al 2016 for the h auv s propulsive mode only is extended to include the gliding dynamics of the vehicle a single trajectory tracking controller which autonomously switches the vehicle s operation mode is derived based on the linearized model the effect of employing frenet serret frames to calculate the nominal euler angles and nominal velocities is investigated simulation results prove the feasibility of using frenet serret frames to calculate the nominal euler angles and the nominal velocities a metric to measure the error between the actual position of the vehicle and the desired trajectory is developed and used to assess the tracking performance of the derived controller the tracking performance is investigated in the presence of unknown underwater current with bounded flow velocity that is applied to the nonlinear model simulation results show that the linear control law provides satisfactory tracking performance in the presence of disturbance and that the controller is robust enough to autonomously switch modes between propulsive and gliding dynamics to ensure minimal tracking error with respect to the desired trajectory in future work the performance of the controller will be investigated on the actual prototype once the hardware manufacturing and assembly

derivation of the forces acting on the h auv and open loop simulation of the derived nonlinear model are presented below 6 1 hydrostatic forces and moments the hydrostatic forces and moments are the combined effects of the vehicle s weight and buoyancy forces the hydrostatic forces and moments are derived and expressed in the body fixed frame b as 45 x h y d r o s t a t i c w b s i n θ y h y d r

i n θ n h y d r o s t a t i c x g w s i n ϕ c o s θ y g w s i n θ where w is the weight force acting on the vehicle s center of mass and b is the buoyancy force acting on the vehicle s geometric center notice that there are no moments contributed from the buoyancy force this is because the origin of the body fixed frame b is placed at the vehicle s geometric center at witch the buoyancy force is acting 6 2 added mass forces and moments added mass as defined in fossen 1994 is a force generated due to inertia added to a body as it moves through a certain fluid as a submerged body accelerates or decelerates through a certain fluid it moves some of the surrounding fluids for simplicity it can be modeled as a mass of the fluid move with the body the added mass forces and moments are derived

where the coefficients that are in the form s e s x y z k m n and e u v w p q r are the added mass coefficients this notation is adopted according to sname 1952 and it refers to the added mass coefficient of the force or moment in the s direction due to the acceleration e in the body fixed frame b since most of the time the vehicle is completely submerged underwater the added mass coefficients are assumed to be constant notice that some of the added mass coefficients are neglected and are set to zero e g x v 0 because the vehicle is symmetric with respect to the x b y b and the x b z b planes of the body fixed frame b the added mass coefficients in 46 are calculated analytically calculating the these coefficients in three dimensions is difficult especially for geometries that have complex features in this work the added mass coefficients are calculated using the strip theory in which the outer geometry of the vehicle is divided into a number of strips then 2 dimensional hydrodynamic coefficients for added mass are computed for each strip and integrated over the length of the body to yield the 3 dimensional coefficients the 2 dimensional added mass coefficients for various 2 dimensional shapes can be found in newman 1977 and blevins 1979 the values of the added mass coefficients are presented in table 2 table 2 added mass coefficients table 2

are mainly due to skin friction between the fluid and the vehicle as it moves through the fluid the drag forces and moments are derived and are expressed as 47 x d r a g x u u u u y d r a g y v v v v y r r r r z d r a g z w w w w z q q q q k d r a g k p p p p m d r a g m q q q q m w w w w n d r a g n r r r r n v v v v where the coefficients that are in the form s e e s x y z k m n and e u v w p q r are the drag coefficients this notation denotes to the drag coefficient of the force or moment in the s direction due to the velocity e in the body fixed frame b similarly as the added mass coefficients some of the drag coefficients are neglected and are set to zero e g x v v 0 because the vehicle is symmetric with respect to the x b y b and the x b z b planes of the body fixed frame b the drag coefficients in 47 are calculated using empirical formulas that can be found in triantafyllou lewis 1988 hoerner and borst 1985 and whicker and fehlner 1958 the values of the drag

will cause a flow separation in the fluid creating a pressure difference between the upper and the lower parts of the body this pressure difference generates a lift force that acts on the body s center of mass the lift forces and moments that are acting on the vehicle are contributed from the fins wings and its body the derived and simplified lift forces and moments are written as 48 x l i f

simulation in order to determine the values of the constants u t u t h r u s t u g l i d i n g w m a x and θ m a x in 20 and algorithm 1 the nonlinear model in 13 is simulated when applying a known set of inputs u x t δ s r δ s l δ r t four cases are simulated the first and the second cases involve turning on the propeller in order to determine the values of u t h r u s t and u t which are the vehicle s longitudinal velocity in thrust mode and the threshold value that is used to determine the mode of operation respectively the third and the fourth cases involve turning off the propeller and changing the vehicle s buoyancy by setting the mass to m m i n and m m a x for each case respectively in the third case the vehicle is floating up while in the fourth case the vehicle is diving down and in both cases the values of u g l i d i n g w m a x and θ m a x are determined 6 6 1 moving forward in thrust mode in this case only the propeller is required to be turned on and the rest of the inputs are set to zero so the inputs u x t 0 15 k n δ s r 0 r a d δ s l 0 r a d δ r 0 r a d t are applied to the nonlinear model in 13 as a result the vehicle moves forward in a straight line as expected when the system reaches steady state the vehicle s longitudinal velocity that corresponds to u t h r u s t is determined to be 1 5 m s 6 6 2 moving forward in thrust mode with minimum thrust force in order to determine the value of u t in algorithm 1 the propeller is turned on with minimum thrust force and the rest of the inputs are set to zero thus the inputs u x t 0 01 k n δ s r 0 r a d δ s l 0 r a d δ r 0 r a d t are applied to the nonlinear model in 13 as expected the vehicle moves forward in a straight line when the system reaches steady state the vehicle s longitudinal velocity u t h r u s t is measured to be 0 39 m s hence the value of u t in algorithm 1 is chosen to be 0 4 m s where if u n m is greater or equal to 0 4 m s the vehicle switches to thrust mode and the propeller is turned on while if u n m is less than 0 4 m s the vehicle switches to gliding mode table 7 nominal states and desired mass table 7 nominalstatesand desiredmass thrust mode gliding mode diving

vehicle s mass is set to m m i n so the vehicle is positively buoyant and the rest of the inputs are set to zero hence the inputs u x t 0 k n δ s r 0 r a d δ s l 0 r a d δ r 0 r a d t and m m i n 71 5 k g are applied to 13 the vehicle floats up while moving forward at steady state the vehicle s longitudinal velocity transverse velocity and pitch angle that correspond to u g l i d i n g w m a x and θ m a x in 20 respectively are determined to be u g l i d i n g 0 2 m s w m a x 0 04 m s and θ m a x 0 28 r a d the absolute value is used because the constants w m a x and θ m a x are positive regardless of whether the vehicle is floating up or diving down the t a n h function in 20 handles the sign switch when the vehicle alternates between diving and floating 6 6 4 diving down in gliding mode similarly as in the second case the propeller is turned off and the rest of the inputs are set to zero however in this case the vehicle s mass is set to m m a x so the vehicle is negatively buoyant therefore the inputs u x t 0 k n δ s r 0 r a d δ s l 0 r a d δ r 0 r a d t and m m a x 73 5 k g are applied to 13 consequently the vehicle dives down while moving forward at steady state the vehicle s longitudinal velocity transverse velocity and pitch angle that correspond to u g l i d i n g w m a x and θ m a x in 20 respectively are determined to be u g l i d i n g 0 2 m s w m a x 0 04 m s and θ m a x 0 28 r a d notice that these values are equal to the values measured in the second case the values of the nominal states that are used to linearize the nonlinear model after determining the mode of operation are summarized in table 7 
22724,in this work a six degrees of freedom dof nonlinear kinematic and dynamic model of a hybrid autonomous underwater vehicle h auv is derived for the two modes of locomotion propelled and gliding modes a comprehensive linearization algorithm is developed to include both modes of locomotion starting with a three dimensional time parameterized curve of position history frenet serret frames are used to specify the unknown nominal states which in turn are used to obtain the nominal inputs a linear time variant ltv state space model is obtained and a linear quadratic regulator lqr is designed and applied to the nonlinear model the performance of the devised controller is assessed via a metric that computes the error between the actual and the desired position simulation results show that the lqr provides accurate tracking performance even in the presence of underwater currents with bounded flow velocity moreover the controller autonomously switches modes between propulsion and gliding to ensure minimal trajectory tracking error and energy consumption keywords autonomous underwater vehicle linear time varying state space model trajectory tracking robust control linearization 1 introduction in the last decades the field of marine robotics has witnessed significant development that is motivated by the need for exploring the oceans and collecting scientific data from deep underwater areas recently autonomous underwater vehicles auvs have garnered the interest of several research institutions and they have been developed in many countries the conventional auv has a torpedo shape that is driven by at least one propeller to go forward and control surfaces to change direction and altitude examples of auvs can be seen in prestero 2001 yoerger et al 2007 hagen et al 2008 jun et al 2009 and zhang et al 2017 propelled auvs consume large amounts of energy which limits their continuous operation time to a few hours underwater gliders are another type of underwater vehicles that are driven by varying their buoyancy which is acheived by pumping water in or out of a control chamber and thus controlling the position of the vehicle s center of mass by controlling the vehicle s buoyancy to be greater than or less than that of the sea water the vehicle dives down then floats up while gliding forward in a saw tooth path given its fixed wings and shifted center of mass unlike propelled underwater vehicles gliders consume significantly less energy which makes their operation time last for days mahmoudian et al 2010 examples of underwater gliders can be seen in alvarez 2010 webb et al 2001 eriksen et al 2001 sherman et al 2001 and barker 2012 significant research effort is being invested in the area of motion control of autonomous underwater vehicles in order to allow them to roam the oceans freely and be able to collect scientific data accurately therefore these vehicles should be equipped with advanced control systems that command them to go to their desired destinations while being exposed to the harsh sea environment the motion control problems for underwater vehicles addressed in the literature are divided into three classifications point stabilization path following and trajectory tracking control problems in point stabilization control the vehicle is commanded to be steered to a desired position and orientation from an initial configuration in path following control the vehicle is commanded to converge to and follow a desired geometric path without any temporal specifications trajectory tracking control requires the vehicle to track a desired time parameterized curve in this work a nonlinear six degrees of freedom 6 dof dynamic and kinematic model of a hybrid autonomous underwater vehicle h auv is derived the h auv combines the features of a propelled auv and those of an underwater glider when high speed and dynamic maneuvering are required the vehicle switches to the thrust mode by turning on the propeller when conserving energy and extending battery life are required the vehicle switches to gliding mode by turning off the propeller the aim of this work is to design a single controller for both modes of operation which commands the vehicle to track a trajectory in three dimensional 3d space parameterized with respect to time in the presence of disturbance the controller also determines turning on the propeller when disturbances are encountered in the gliding mode decoupling the nonlinear 6 dof dynamic model of the auv into independent subsystems can simplify the control design problem in healey and lienard 1993 the nonlinear model was decoupled into three independent non interacting subsystems steering diving and speed control each subsystem had multiple states and a single input which were different and independent from those of the other subsystems and each subsystem was linearized about constant operating points a control law for each linearized single input multiple output simo subsystem was derived however when these control laws are applied to the coupled nonlinear model as expected they give unsatisfactory results in this work the control design problem is simplified by linearizing the 6 dof model about a given 3d curve parameterized with respect to time without decoupling and a linear time variant ltv multi input multi output mimo state space model is obtained a single control law is derived taking into account the coupled model in order to overcome the conflict between the control inputs while keeping the control design problem simplified in fryxell 1994 the authors introduce a trajectory tracking problem for an autonomous underwater vehicle where gain scheduled controllers were used to command the vehicle to track a desired trajectory a different approach for solving the problem of path following was first introduced in samson 1992 where the problem of path following for wheeled land robots was solved using lyapunov based nonlinear techniques based on the kinematic model later this work was extended in encarnaçao et al 2000 and encarnaçao and pascoal 2000 to deal with underwater vehicles where a lyapunov based nonlinear controller was developed for the kinematic model then backstepping techniques were used to extend the controller to include the dynamics of the system it is assumed in samson 1992 encarnaçao et al 2000 and encarnaçao and pascoal 2000 that the position of the virtual vehicle should be at the closest point on the desired path to the vehicle this assumption creates a drawback to this path following control approach as it stipulates that the initial position error of the vehicle should be smaller than the smallest radius of curvature in the desired path furthermore this assumption imposes limitations on the shape of the path to be followed where the path should be chosen such that singularities which occur when the distance between the vehicle and the desired path is not well specified are avoided for example when the actual vehicle is positioned exactly at the center of curvature of a circular path this limitation was solved in casalino et al 1995 for wheeled robots by controlling the motion of the virtual target on the desired path which results in introducing an extra degree of freedom in the position error between the actual vehicle and the virtual target later this work was extended in aicardi et al 2001 for the control of underactuated underwater vehicles where the controller was built based on the kinametic model the work in aicardi et al 2001 was further developed in lapierre and soetanto 2007 to extend the controller to include the dynamics of the system using backstepping techniques see also fossen 2011 in zhou et al 2018 a bio inspired model is integrated and backstepping technique is applied to perform three dimensional trajectory tracking for an underactuated auv an adaptive second order sliding mode controller is used in zhang et al 2018 for auv path following control where the adaptive controller estimates the upper bound of disturbance and eliminates chattering effect in the control output trajectory tracking control for a car trailer system was addressed in divelbiss and wen 1997 in which the authors proposed a scheme consisting of three steps a generating a path offline and using it to construct a trajectory by setting the velocity profile to the maximum b linearizing the kinematic model of the car about the generated trajectory and c applying a time varying linear quadratic regulator to track the trajectory in joo and qu 2015 the authors linearized the dynamic model of an underwater glider about two sets of operating points which correspond to the cases when the vehicle dives down and floats up a linear quadratic regulator is then derived to control the depth of the vehicle and command it to move in a saw tooth path the methods in this paper are based on the work in makdah et al 2016 where the control design for the trajectory tracking problem was simplified by linearizing the 6 dof dynamic and kinematic model of the auv about a given optimal 3d trajectory a time varying linear quadratic regulator was designed based on the linear model and applied to the nonlinear model to track the given trajectory the limitation of the vehicle s initial position error with respect to the path was avoided because the given trajectory was generated after specifying the vehicle s initial and final positions and orientations using the work in wehbe et al 2014 2015 2017 the trajectories could be optimal similar to the ones given in hammoud and shammas 2016 while the work in makdah et al 2016 dealt with the thrust mode only this work also includes controling the vehicle in gliding mode the 6 dof model of the h auv is derived for both modes of operation and the model is linearized about a given trajectory to arrive at a linear time varying state space model which is used to design a linear quadratic regulator in makdah et al 2016 frenet serret frames were used to calculate the nominal states about which the nonlinear dynamic and kinematic model was linearized which added an unnecessary restriction on the desired orientation of the vehicle and resulted in increased control effort another contribution of this paper is the design of a single control law that determines the mode of operation based on the type of the given time parameterized curve of position history which avoids the hazards of switching between control laws the controller also determines whether to turn the propeller on during gliding mode in the presence of disturbances furthermore the restriction on the desired vehicle orientation due to frenet serret frames is investigated by recording the trajectory and states which are generated from open loop simulation of the 6 dof nonlinear model when applying known inputs to it the recorded trajectory is considered as the nominal trajectory about which the nonlinear model is linearized the open loop inputs are then compared to the lqr control inputs that are obtained from the linearized system by assigning more weight on the vehicle position and less weight on its orientation the restriction on the desired orientation of the frenet serret frames is relaxed which results in reduced control effort while maintaining accurate tracking of the desired trajectory to quantify the accuracy of the position controller a metric that computes the error between the actual vehicle position and the desired trajectory is introduced in this work the structure of this paper is as follows in section 2 the nonlinear 6 dof dynamic and kinematic model of the h auv is briefly discussed and a model of unknown underwater current is introduced in section 3 the nonlinear model is linearized about a given 3d trajectory to obtain a linear time varying state space model in section 3 4 a time varying linear quadratic regulator is designed based on the linear model the effect of employing frenet serret frames is investigated in section 4 where the performance of the linear quadratic regulator is evaluated in simulation followed by a discussion of the obtained results finally the paper is concluded and future work is discussed in section 5 2 h auv model the underwater vehicle which is developed and is being manufactured at the american university of beirut employs a hybrid design which combines the characteristics of a propelled auv and an underwater glider a computer aided design cad model of the h auv is shown in fig 1 when high speed maneuvers are required the vehicle turns on the propeller and switches to thrust mode when conserving energy and extending battery life are required the vehicle turns off the propeller and switches to gliding mode in gliding mode the vehicle is driven by alternatively changing its density to be greater than or less than that of the sea water by pumping water in and out of an enclosed chamber respectively when water is pumped into the chamber the vehicle s mass increases and its center of mass shifts from its geometric center towards the nose which makes the vehicle negatively buoyant and causes it to pitch down while diving vise versa when water is pumped out of the chamber the vehicle s mass decreases and its center of mass shifts from its geometric center towards the rear which makes the vehicle positively buoyant and causes it to pitch up while floating as the vehicle dives down or floats up it also glides and moves forward due to the effect of the fixed wings hence in gliding mode the vehicle can move forward in a saw tooth pattern by alternatively pumping water in and out of its chamber details about the vehicle s design can be found in wehbe et al 2014 as depicted in fig 1 the h auv has four control surfaces that are attached at the rear end in a cruciform pattern two coupled rudder fins to control the yaw motion and two decoupled stern fins to control the pitch and roll motions a propeller is attached to the rear end of the vehicle to provide thrust force in the surge direction the rest of this section discusses the frames of reference assignment and describes h auv s kinematic and dynamic models 2 1 frames of reference assignment according to the society of naval architects and marine engineers sname sname 1952 two frames of reference are assigned to describe the motion of the h auv 1 an earth fixed coordinate frame s with the origin o s fixed at an arbitrary position on the surface of the ocean and the z s axis pointing towards the center of the earth and 2 a body fixed coordinate frame b with its origin o b placed at the vehicle s geometric center and the x b axis pointing towards the vehicle s nose as shown in fig 2 the sname notation is used to describe

matrix containing the coriolis and centripetal terms which are also derived in fossen 1994 the external forces and moments acting on the vehicle in 6 have the following components 8 τ r b τ h y d r o

and moments generated by the added mass τ d r a g are the drag forces and moments due to skin friction τ l i f t are the lift forces and moments and τ p r o p e l l e r are the thrust force and moment generated by the propeller the derivations of these forces can be found appendix 6 2 4 modeling of the unknown underwater current the robustness of the controller is investigated in the presence of an unknown disturbance which is mainly caused by underwater current in this paper the underwater current is modeled as a velocity flow field and it is expressed with respect to the global frame as follows 9 ν c s u c s v c s w c s where u c s v c s and w c s are underwater current velocities along the direction of the x s y s and z s axes of the global frame respectively the velocity flow field of the underwater current is assumed to have constant uniform magnitude and constant direction with respect to the global frame of reference to include the effect of the unknown underwater current velocity in the 6 dof nonlinear model in 7 it is expressed with respect to the body fixed frame this is done using the linear velocity transformation matrix j 1 from the body fixed frame b to the earth fixed frame s as follows 10 ν c b j 1 1 ν c s j 1 1 u c s v c s w c s the effect of the underwater current velocity is then included in the 6 dof dynamic model by substituting ν with ν r in 7 where 11 ν r ν ν c b since the vehicle exhibits slow dynamics and the flow field of the underwater current is constant in magnitude and direction with respect to the global frame ν c b is negligible and is assumed to be zero the vectorial 6 dof dynamic equation of motion becomes 12 m r b ν c r b ν r ν r τ r b note that the kinematic equations in 2 are not affected by the underwater current terms 3 linearization about a given trajectory and control design in this section the nonlinear model in 7 and 2 is linearized about a given smooth 3d curve parameterized with respect to time γ t x n m t y n m t z n m t which satisfies the following assumptions a 1 the path is smooth and the motion is steady a 2 the path is dynamically feasible in which it does not inherit maneuvers and velocities that cannot be performed by the vehicle a 3 the path is regular in which the arc distance along the curve increases monotonically with time a 4 the desired time parameterized 3d γ t is constructed using planning algorithms such that the initial point of γ t coincides with the actual position of the vehicle the nonlinear model can be written in state space form as 13 χ f χ u m which includes the six dynamic equations of motion in 7 and the six kinematic equations in 2 χ ν η t is the state vector of length 12 u x t δ r δ s r δ s l t is the input vector of length 4 which consists of the thrust force x t provided by the propeller the rudder fins δ r the right stern fin δ s r and the left stern fin δ s l angles and m is the mass of the vehicle it is worth noting that once the desired trajectory is known the mode of operation of the h auv propulsion or gliding is determined thus setting the mass of the vehicle m in 13 in order to linearize the model in 13 about the nominal trajectory the nominal states χ n m t and inputs u n m t which satisfy the desired trajectory γ t must be computed at each time step as well as the desired mass m at the end of this section a linear quadratic regualtor is designed based on the linearized model and the derived control law is applied to the nonlinear model 3 1 calculating the unknown nominal states when a desired three dimensional curve of position history that specifies only a subset of the nominal states namely η 1 n m x n m t y n m t z n m t t with respect to s is given as a function of time the remaining nominal states need to be calculated to calculate the desired vehicle s orientation η 2 n m t ϕ n m t θ n m t ψ n m t t along the trajectory consider the frenet serret fs frame associated with each point on the path at each instant of time with its unit vectors t tangent to the path n normal to the path and pointing towards its center of curvature and b t n as shown in fig 2 the position of the origin of the frenet serret frame o f s with respect to s is the desired position of the vehicle η 1 n m x n m t y n m t z n m t t the desired orientation parametrizes the rotation matrix from the fs frame to the s frame as shown in the following equation 14 r fs s t t s n t s b t s c ψ n m c θ n m s ψ n m c ϕ n m c ψ n m s θ n m s ϕ n m s ψ n m s ϕ n m c ψ n m c ϕ n m s θ n m s ψ n m c θ n m c ψ n m c ϕ n m s ϕ n m s θ n m s ψ n m c ψ n m s ϕ n m s θ n m s ψ n m c ϕ n m s θ n m c θ n m s ϕ n m c θ n m c ϕ n m where the vectors t s n s b s are the unit vectors of the fs expressed with respect to s this notation is in accordance with that introduced in spong et al 2006 to calculate the coordinates of the unit vectors of fs with respect to s the given 3d time parameterized curve of position history γ t is reparameterized with respect to the arc length to get α s x n m s y n m s z n m s the arc length is defined as 15 s γ γ t d t where γ t is the first time derivative of γ t and γ t is the absolute velocity of the curve with respect to s the coordinates of the unit vectors t s and n s with respect to s are calculated by differentiating α s with respect to s once and twice respectively and b s t s n s the vectors are then reparameterized with respect to time for more details about frenet serret frames see carmo 1976 equation 14 is solved to obtain the desired nominal euler angles η 2 n m t following a similar approach as in spong et al 2006 the nominal pitch angle θ n m is calculated using the first element of the third row of the transformation matrix in 14 as follows 16 θ n m sin 1 t z t s where t z t s is the z coordinate of the vector t t s with respect to s since the pitch angle is desired to be near zero degrees the first solution obtained in 16 is chosen the nominal roll angle ϕ n m is then calculated using the second element of the third row of the transformation matrix in 14 as follows 17 ϕ n m sin 1 sec θ n m n z t s where n z t s is the z component of the vector n t s with respect to s similarly as the pitch angle the first solution is chosen for the nominal roll angle the yaw angle is calculated using the first and second elements of the first column of the transformation matrix in 14 as follows 18 ψ n m tan 1 t y t s t x t s k π k n where t x t s and t y t s are the x and y components of the vector t t s with respect to s respectively the nominal yaw angle is not bounded between π π to avoid discontinuity in the numerical simulation the rest of the nominal states ν n m t which represent the nominal linear and angular velocities with respect to s expressed in fs are the velocities that satisfy the given nominal curve of position history γ t and are calculated using the kinematic transformation in 3 as follows 19 ν e q t j ϕ n m θ n m ψ n m 1 η e q t where j ϕ n m θ n m ψ n m 1 is the inverse of the transformation matrix j defined in 4 that is parameterized with respect to the nominal euler angles ϕ n m θ n m and ψ n m and η n m t is the time derivative of η n m t in gliding mode the vehicle is driven by the hydro static forces buoyancy and weight which act about its center therefore when floating up or diving down the x axis of the body fixed frame x b is not necessarily tangent to the desired 3d trajectory while tracking it as is the case in thrust mode hence the longitudinal and transverse velocities u t and w t respectively differ from the nominal values calculated in 19 similarly the vehicle s pitch angle does not equal the nominal pitch angle θ n m calculated in 16 as shown in fig 3 therefore to track these nominal values the vehicle has to exert more control effort and consume more energy which defeats the gliding mode s purpose of energy conservation since the desired trajectory to be tracked in gliding mode is a saw tooth path the nonlinear model is linearized about constant operating points for the pitch angle θ longitudinal velocity u and transverse velocity w and the remaining nominal states calculated in 14 and 19 the gliding mode is divided into two phases diving phase and floating phase in each phase the nominal values for the pitch angle and transverse velocity are considered constant and different from the other phase while the nominal longitudinal velocity is assumed to be constant and fixed for both phases whether the vehicle is desired to dive down or float up is determined based on the nominal pitch angle θ n m calculated in 16 if the nominal pitch angle θ n m is positive the vehicle is desired to float up whereas if the nominal pitch angle θ n m is negative the vehicle is desired to dive down accordingly the nominal longitudnal velocity nominal transverse velocity and the nominal pitch angle in gliding mode are calculated based on the nominal pitch angle θ n m which is calculated from 16 as follows 20 u n m u g l i d i n g m s w n m t w m a x tanh θ n m t ε m s θ n m t θ m a x tanh θ n m t ε r a d where the hyperbolic tangent function tanh is used to avoid the discrete transition between the two values of w n m as well as between the two values of θ n m which occurs when the vehicle switches between the two phases floating up or diving down that is when θ n m t calculated in 16 changes sign note that although computing the nominal transverse velocity and the nominal pitch angle for gliding mode using 20 results in acceptable performance based on the simulation of the vehicle dynamics see section 4 this paper does not provide theoretical guarantees that all pitch over maneuvers can be successfully accomplished u g l i d i n g w m a x and θ m a x are constants that are calculated from open loop simulation for the cases of floating up and diving down in gliding mode as will be discussed in section 6 6 the constant ε is used for both θ n m and w n m to control the rate they each transition between their two phase values the is used to distinguish between the constant nominal longitudinal velocity transverse velocity and pitch angle used for gliding mode instead of the variable nominal longitudinal velocity transverse velocity and pitch angle that are calculated in 19 and 16 3 2 identifying the mode of operation and setting the vehicle s desired mass according to open loop simulation each mode of operation has specific range of longitudinal velocities as it will be shown in section 6 6 the vehicle s longitudinal velocity u in thrust mode is about seven times larger than that when it is in gliding mode the values of the longitudinal velocities at which the vehicle s speed ranges about in thrust mode and gliding mode are denoted as u t h r u s t m s and u g l i d i n g m s respectively it follows that the desired mode of operation is determined based on the velocity profile of the given trajectory if u n m is greater than or equal to a threshold value u t the vehicle switches to thrust mode if u n m is less than u t the vehicle switches to gliding mode the vehicle s desired mass and the x position of its center of gravity x g with respect to the body fixed frame b change according to the mode of operation when the vehicle is in the propelled mode its mass is set to a constant value that renders it neutrally buoyant and the position of its center of gravity is at the origin of the body fixed frame b hence the corresponding nonlinear state space form is written as 21 χ f χ u m n e u t r a l where m n e u t r a l is the mass of the vehicle when its chamber is half full of sea water neutrally buoyant in gliding mode the mass of the vehicle varies between m m i n and m m a x where m m i n is the mass of the vehicle when its chamber is empty of sea water vehicle is positively buoyant and m m a x is the mass of the vehicle when its chamber is full of sea water vehicle is negatively buoyant also the x position of vehicle s center of gravity x g with respect to b varies between x g m i n and x g m a x which are specified by design to simplify the linearization process of the gliding dynamics the mass of the vehicle and the x position of its center of gravity are set to be constant to m m i n and x g m i n respectively when it is floating up and to m m a x and x g m a x respectively when it is diving down as such the nonlinear state space form for the gliding mode is written as χ f χ u m m i n when the vehicle is floating up and χ f χ u m m a x when the vehicle is diving down whether the vehicle is desired to be floating up or diving down is determined by the nominal pitch angle if the nominal pitch angle is positive the vehicle is desired to be floating up to follow the desired trajectory its mass and the x position of its center of gravity with respect to b are set to m m i n and x g m i n respectively whereas if the nominal pitch angle is negative the vehicle is desired to be diving down to track the desired trajectory its mass and the x position of its center of gravity with respect to b are set to m m a x and x g m a x respectively in gliding mode the desired mass is calculated based on the nominal pitch angle θ n m using the following equation 22 m g l i d i n g 1 k g tanh θ n m t ε m n e u t r a l where the hyperbolic tangent function t a n h is used to avoid the discontinuity between m m i n and m m a x when the nominal pitch angle changes from positive to negative the constant ε is used to control the rate of transition between m m i n and m m a x the x position of the vehicle s center of gravity with respect to the body fixed frame b x g is coupled with the mass of the vehicle so when the mass changes between m m i n and m m a x x g changes between x g m i n and x g m a x respectively according to the following relationship 23 x g c g m g l i d i n g m n e u t r a l where c g is a constant equal to x g m a x and m g l i d i n g is calculated in 22 notice that in order to glide forward in gliding mode the vehicle must alternatively switch between ascending and descending gilding motions following this if a horizontal trajectory with a forward velocity less than u t is provided based on the above mentioned method the vehicle will switch to the gliding mode however in this case the vehicle will fail to track the trajectory since in gliding mode the vehicle must have a minimum attainable ascending or descending pitch angle in order to glide forward this case is avoided since the desired trajectory to be tracked is generated while accounting for this limitation consider the additional two assumptions a 5 the desired time parameterized 3d curve generated for the gliding mode should have a forward velocity less than u t and should not have zero pitch angle with zero pitch angular velocity at any given time a 6 the desired time parameterized 3d curve generated for the propelled mode should have a forward velocity greater than or equal to u t remark 1 in this work for the gliding mode only saw tooth trajectory which satisfies assumptions a 1 a 2 a 3 a 4 and a 5 is considered for the analysis and for the controllability check as for the propelled mode the s shaped trajectory see section 4 and the 3d dubin trajectory generated using wehbe et al 2015 wehbe et al 2014 wehbe et al 2017 are studied and considered for the controllability analysis note that the later two trajectories satisfy assumptions a 1 a 2 a 3 a 4 and a 6 it is noted that the work in this paper can be applied to 3d curves that satisfy the stipulated assumptions given that the linearized system is state controllable 3 3 calculating the nominal inputs after determining the nominal states the nominal inputs u n m that satisfy the nominal trajectory need to be calculated to linearize the system about them the nominal inputs are calculated from 13 evaluated at the nominal trajectory 24 χ n m f χ n m u n m m d e s i r e d however the inputs which are included in 13 and 24 do not appear in the kinematic equations therefore only the six dynamic equations in 24 are needed to calculate the nominal inputs the six dynamic equations in 7 evaluated at the nominal states can be written in the following form 25 ν n m f 1 ν n m ϕ n m θ n m u n m m d e s i r e d ν n m ν n m ϕ n m θ n m and m d e s i r e d in 25 are known and only the nominal inputs vector u n m is unknown and needs to be solved for equation 25 is simplified into the following linear form with respect to the unknown nominal inputs vector 26 n u n m b where n is a 6 4 matrix b is a vector of length 6 and both are known the system of equations in 26 is overdetermined since there are six equations and four unknowns nominal inputs x t h r u s t δ r δ s r and δ s l therefore an exact solution for u n m that satisfies the six equations does not exist rather u n m is estimated by minimizing the error e n u n m b in the least mean square lms sense and it can be determined from 27 u n m n t n 1 n t b note that the solution computed using 27 is not the only solution that satisfies the nominal trajectory later in section 4 1 it will be shown that for a given trajectory different input solutions are obtained moreover this method does not guarantee that a set of inputs can be computed for any arbitrary path especially for dynamically infeasible paths now that the nominal states χ n m t nominal inputs u n m t and desired vehicle s mass m d e s i r e d are calculated from the desired time parameterized curve of position history γ t equation 13 can be linearized and written in the following ltv state space form 28 χ t a t χ t b t u t where χ χ χ n m and u u u n m it is noted that the linearization is performed about the nominal solutions that are obtained for the states and inputs given a smooth path and steady motion in which deviations from the prescribed path are assumed negligible a t is a 12 12 matrix and b t is a 12 4 matrix which are calculated from equation 13 as follows de oliveira 2015 29 a t f χ χ χ n m t u u n m t b t f u χ χ n m t u u n m t the output equation of the state space model in 28 is written as follows 30 y t c χ t d u t where c is a 12 12 matrix and d is a 12 4 matrix it is assumed that all states are available for measurement at each instant of time so matrices c and d are given by 31 c i 12 12 d 0 12 4 where i 12 12 is a 12 12 identity matrix the steps for linearization about a given trajectory are summarized in algorithm 1 remark 2 controllability of ltv systems the controllability of the linearized system in 28 is investigated by checking the rank of the following matrix for t t 0 t f 32 w t k 0 t k 1 t k i t where i is a positive integer such that for t t 0 t f b t is i times continuously differentiable a t is i 1 times continuously differentiable and 33 k 0 t b t k j t a t k j 1 t k j 1 t j 1 2 i for the linearized systems that are obtained by linearizing about the 3d curves mentioned in remark 1 and for i 2 w t is full rank through out the history of the trajectories the details of used method can be found in rugh and rugh 1996 algorithm 1 linearization about a given trajectory 3 4 controller design in this subsection a linear quadratic regulator is designed based on the linearized model and the derived control law is applied to the nonlinear model the trajectory tracking problem is transformed into a regulation problem which is achieved by creating a deviation error system whose state space form is given by 28 the details of the used method can be found in chapter 14 of anderson and moore 2007 consider the linear time variant state space model in 28 the feedback lqr control law is written as follows 34 u t k t χ t where u t is the vector of the feedback control inputs of length 4 χ t χ t χ n m t is state error vector of length 12 and k t is a 4 12 matrix containing the control gains which vary with time the control gains of the lqr control law are calculated such that the control law in 34 minimizes the following cost function 35 h 1 2 t 0 t f χ t q χ u t r u d t where t 0 and t f are the initial and the final time of the of the vehicle s mission to track the given 3d curve γ t respectively q is a 12 12 weighing matrix for the states r is 4 4 weighing matrix for the inputs and both matrices are positive semi definite the limits of the integral in 35 also correspond to the initial and final time within which γ t is defined the control gains k that minimize the cost function h are calculated as follows 36 k t r 1 b t t p t where p t is a 12 12 matrix and is calculated by solving the following differential algebraic riccati equation 37 a t t p t p t a t q p t b t r 1 b t t p t p t which is solved numerically at each time step for more details about lqr see kirk 2012 4 simulation in this section the linearization algorithm and the derived controller are investigated via simulation the results of the open loop simulation for the derived nonlinear model can be found in the appendix 4 1 investigating the linearization algorithm to investigate the effect of frenet serret frames that are used to calculate the nominal euler angles and nominal velocities an arbitrary trajectory γ ˆ t x ˆ t y ˆ t z ˆ t t along with its corresponding states χ ˆ o l t are recorded from open loop simulation that involves applying known inputs u ˆ o l to the nonlinear model in 13 two linear systems are derived the first is derived by linearizing 21 about the recorded states χ n m t and the second is derived using algorithm 1 with the recorded curve of position history γ ˆ t as its input a control law is designed for each of the derived linear systems in order to investigate the use of the frenet serret frames in algorithm 1 the performance of the derived control laws u and u to command the vehicle to track the recorded trajectory are compared in simulation when applied to the nonlinear model the method is summarized in the block diagram given in fig 4 and the notations used in the figure are described in table 1 a metric that measures the error between the actual vehicle position and the desired trajectory is derived in order to compare the performance of the two systems the position error is calculated at each time step to be the smallest distance between the actual vehicle position and the desired trajectory consider e τ to be the error between the actual vehicle position at time τ and the time parameterized nominal trajectory given by 38 e τ t η 1 τ η 1 n m t η 1 τ x τ y τ z τ η 1 n m t x n m t y n m t z n m t where η 1 is the vector containing the actual vehicle position and η 1 n m is the vector containing the nominal position since η 1 n m contains the desired position parameterized with respect to time e τ in 38 is also parameterized with respect to time at each instant of time τ the distance between the vehicle s actual position η 1 τ x τ y τ z τ t and the nominal time parameterized curve of positions η 1 n m t x n m t y n m t z n m t t can be expressed as follows 39 d i s t τ t e τ 2 e τ t t e τ t to obtain the shortest distance between the vehicle s actual position at time τ and the time parameterized curve of positions the time that minimizes 39 is solved for 40 t argmin t d i s t τ t which will correspond to the instant of time at which the point on the nominal time parameterized curve of positions η 1 n m t x n m t y n m t z n m t t is the closest to the vehicle s actual position at time τ η 1 τ x τ y τ z τ t the performance of both control systems to track the recorded trajectory is shown in fig 5 where γ t γ ˆ t and γ t are defined in table 1 as observed in the figure both control laws have accurate tracking performance when applied to the nonlinear model to quantitatively compare the tracking performance of the two systems the r m s error between the vehicle s actual position and the position of its corresponding nearest point on the nominal time parameterized curve is calculated at each time step τ as follows 41 r m s τ e τ t t e τ t where e τ is defined in 38 and t is calculated using 40 the r m s error is plotted for each system in fig 6 where r m s and r m s are the root mean square errors that correspond to the control laws u and u that are derived as in fig 4 respectively as observed in fig 6 the r m s position error of both control systems ranges between 0 015 and 0 04 m which is relatively small when compared with the desired path dimensions it is also observed that the r m s errors of the trajectories generated from both control systems are approximately equal fig 7 and fig 8 show the open loop inputs δ ˆ s r δ ˆ s l and δ ˆ r the controlled inputs that are derived based on frenet serret frames δ s r δ s l and δ r and the controlled inputs that are derived based on the recorded states from open loop simulation δ s r δ s l and δ r fig 7 shows how each control law commands disparate inputs which is expected because the system is underactuated i e number of inputs is less than the system s degrees of freedom it is noted that the open loop stern angles δ ˆ s r and δ ˆ s l used to generate the recorded trajectory are considerably different from the controlled stern angles δ s r and δ s l which is due to the fact that more weight is put on the position in the q matrix when designing the lqr in 35 in conclusion simulation results support the feasibility of using frenet serret frames in algorithm 1 for calculating the nominal euler angles and nominal velocities without loss of fidelity 4 2 energy efficiency of the closed loop controller in order to investigate the effect of using frenet serret frames to calculate the nominal euler angles and the nominal velocities on the controlled actuators energy consumption an r m s value of the fins angular velocities is calculated at each time step for the controllers u and u as well as for the open loop inputs u o l this r m s value is denoted as v r m s and is calculated as follows 42 v r m s δ s r 2 δ s l 2 δ r 2 where δ s r δ s l and δ r are the right stern left stern and the rudder angular velocities respectively this metric provides an intuition about the efficiency of the closed loop controllers since the energy provided by the control surfaces actuators is proportional to the control surfaces angular velocities the v r m s values for the closed loop controller generated based on frenet serret frames u the closed loop controller generated based on the recorded states u and the open loop inputs u ˆ o l are shown in fig 9 as observed in the figure closed loop controllers u and u have lower v r m s value than that of the open loop inputs also it is observed in fig 9 that v r m s is lower than v r m s which indicates that the closed loop controller that is generated based on frenet serret frame u consumes less energy than the controller generated based on the recorded states u and the open loop inputs u ˆ o l this is due to the fact that more weight is put on the position in the q matrix when designing the lqr in 35 4 3 closed loop simulation in the presence of bounded unknown underwater current the performance of the linear controller to command the vehicle to track a 3d trajectory is investigated in the presence of unknown underwater current to test the controller three trajectories are used for simulation s shaped trajectory that is recorded from open loop simulation 3d dubin s trajectory to test the controller in thrust mode and a saw tooth trajectory to test the controller in gliding mode in each scenario the desired trajectory is considered as an input for algorithm 1 about which the nonlinear system in 13 is linearized and a linear quadratic regulator is designed accordingly in this work underwater current is modeled as a velocity field expressed with respect to the global reference frame it is noted here that modeling underwater current as a force field yielded unreasonable results in preliminary simulations not included in this work since the model treats the underwater current as a constant force acting only on the center of mass of the vehicle regardless of its outer geometric shape the effect of the underwater current velocity is included in the nonlinear state space model in 13 by substituting χ with χ r where 43 χ r ν r η t and ν r is given in 11 the nonlinear state space model with disturbance is expressed as follows 44 χ r f χ r u m to test the controller s performance in the presence of unknown underwater current the derived lqr is applied to 44 in the database of the surface ocean velocity provided in ocean surface current ana 2017 the average maximum surface velocity is measured to be 0 4 m s knowing that the velocity of seawater is maximum at the surface the value of 0 4 m s is adopted in this paper as the maximum velocity of the underwater current used in simulation fig 10 a shows the tracking of an s shaped trajectory which is recorded from open loop simulation fig 5 in the presence of constant underwater current of 0 7 m s flow velocity which is larger than the measured maximum surface velocity of 0 4 m s as observed in fig 10a the controller shows accurate tracking performance when applied to the nonlinear model in 44 in the presence of unknown underwater current which is applied at 20 s e c o n d s into the simulation whose run time is 100 s e c o n d s the shaded tubular region in fig 10a indicates the portion of the trajectory at which the disturbance is applied fig 10b shows the r m s position error between the actual vehicle position and the nominal trajectory calculated using 38 and 39 the error is approximately zero before the disturbance is applied at t 20 s the light blue shaded region between t 20 s and t 100 s refers to the time interval at which the disturbance is applied the r m s error reaches a maximum value of 2 m at t 40 s in the presence of disturbance which is still within the acceptable range compared with the desired path dimensions the error values between the actual and nominal euler angles are shown in fig 10c which shows error values close to zero before the disturbance is applied at t 20 s after the disturbance is applied the euler angles deviate from their nominal values as shown within the light blue shaded area it is noticed that the vehicle is no longer tangent to the trajectory that it is traversing since it is an underactuated system therefore to counter the side flow of the underwater current the vehicle orients itself with the propeller s thrust force and lift forces generated from the control surfaces which can be seen in fig 10a at t 65 s it is also observed in fig 10c that the actual roll angle deviates from its nominal value after five seconds from the beginning of the simulation at which the vehicle begins to steer this occurs since the vehicle s center of mass is designed to be 5 c m lower than its geometric center which forces the vehicle to bank when steering due to centrifugal forces that act on its center of mass the input signals are shown in fig 10d e and fig 10f as observed in fig 10d before the disturbance is applied at t 20 s the propeller provides a constant force of 0 15 k n after applying the disturbance depicted by the light blue shaded region the thrust force increases to a maximum value of 0 3 k n when the vehicle is moving upstream the underwater current and decreases to a value below 0 15 k n when the vehicle is moving downstream the underwater current in order to maintain the desired longitudinal velocity of 1 5 m s without disturbances the stern and rudder angles in figs 10e and f are similar to the control signals derived from the linearized system shown in figs 7 and 8 after applying the disturbance light blue shaded region the controlled angles of the fins change from their corresponding signals to adjust the vehicle s orientation and counter the underwater current notice that in fig 10a and c the controller prioritizes tracking of the vehicle s position over its orientation which is due to the larger weight that is assigned to position states over the other states in the q matrix in 35 fig 11 a shows the tracking of 3d dubin s trajectory in the presence of constant unknown underwater current with flow velocity of 0 7 m s the desired 3d dubin s trajectory is derived using the method developed in wehbe et al 2015 and it consists of five parts in the following order constant pitch helix variable pitch helix straight line variable pitch helix and a constant pitch helix fig 11a shows that the controller has good tracking performance when applied to the nonlinear model in 44 in the presence of disturbance which is applied at t 20 s the light blue shaded tubular region in the figure refers to the portion of the trajectory at which the disturbance is applied the r m s position error between the actual trajectory and the nominal dubin s trajectory as a function of time is shown in fig 10c which shows that the r m s error is approximately zero before the disturbance is applied and the error increases to a maximum of 0 4 m in the presence of disturbance which is still within the acceptable range compared with the desired path dimensions fig 11c shows error values between the actual and desired euler angles where the euler angles converge to their desired values before the disturbance is applied after applying the disturbance as depicted by the light blue shaded area the angles deviate from their desired values and the vehicle is no longer tangent to the trajectory that it is traversing similar to the s shaped trajectory tracking case in the presence of underwater current the vehicle aligns itself in the most suitable orientation to counter the underwater current with the propeller s thrust force and the lift forces that are generated from the fins while tracking the desired trajectory which can be seen in fig 11a at t 35 s it is also observed in figs 11b and c that the r m s error and the euler angles error values reach steady state when the vehicle is tracking the straight line portion of the trajectory in the presence of constant disturbance and they do not converge to zero in addition upon completing the straight line portion of the dubin s trajectory at t 44 s the error values in figs 11b and c increase and accumulate not being able to achieve zero steady state error is due to the employment of full state feedback which is of the proportional type that possesses this characteristic to drive the steady state error to zero and avoid error accumulation over time an integrator can be added to the control law in 34 the input signals are shown in fig 11d e and fig 11f as observed in fig 11d the propeller provides a constant thrust force of 0 15 k n before applying the disturbance in order to maintain a constant longitudinal velocity of 1 5 m s after the disturbance is applied light blue shaded region the thrust force increases to a maximum value of 0 27 k n when the vehicle moves opposite to the flow direction and decreases when the vehicle moves with the flow direction figs 11e and f show the control signals of the stern and rudder angles respectively the stern and rudder angles have constant values when the vehicle tracks the straight line portion of the dubin s trajectory in the presence of constant disturbance between t 20 s and t 44 s since the vehicle s orientation and velocity reach steady state values since the 3d dubin s trajectory consists of five segments the control inputs in fig 11d e and fig 11f change abruptly during the transition between segments which is due to the kinematic nature of dubin s curves that require instantaneous change in the vehicle s orientation infinite control energy between segments the tracking performance of the controller in gliding mode is shown in fig 11b where the controller commands the vehicle to track a saw tooth trajectory in the presence of underwater current with a flow velocity of 0 26 m s the controller exhibits good tracking performance in the presence of the unknown underwater current which is applied between t 30 s and t 300 s shown in the shaded region the r m s position error between the actual trajectory and the nominal saw tooth trajectory as a function of time is shown in fig 12 a the error is almost zero before the disturbance is applied it increases to a maximum value of 0 51 m in the presence of the disturbance and it decreases to a value of 0 15 m when the disturbance is stopped at t 300 s the light blue shaded region in fig 12b refers to the time interval at which the disturbance is applied the error values between the actual euler angles and their corresponding nominal values are shown in fig 12c as seen the euler angles converge to their desired values before the disturbance is applied with the exception of the pitch angle θ given that the initial orientation of the vehicle is at zero pitch angle whereas the desired pitch angle at time zero is 0 2769 r a d as shown in table 7 in the diving case of the gliding mode when the disturbance is applied between t 30 s and t 300 s light blue shaded region the error values increase and the vehicle orients itself in the most suitable orientation to counter the underwater current with lift forces generated from the fins and the propeller s thrust force which is turned on to overcome the disturbance when the disturbance is stopped at t 300 s the error values of the euler angles converge to zero except for the error in pitch angle which does not converge to zero until it crosses the curved tip of the saw tooth trajectory this occurs since the disturbance is turned off while the vehicle is traversing a straight line portion of the saw tooth trajectory during which the vehicle s orientation and velocity are at steady state when the disturbance is turned off the pitch angle error does not go to zero until the vehicle crosses the curved tip of the saw tooth trajectory at t 400 s the time at which the vehicle s orientation and velocity are no longer at steady state the input control signals are shown in fig 12d e and fig 12f as seen in fig 12d the propeller provides zero thrust force before the disturbance is applied when the disturbance is applied between t 30 s and t 300 s light blue shaded area the propeller turns on and provides an average thrust force of 0 01 k n in order to counter the underwater current and to maintain the desired longitudinal velocity of 0 2 m s when the disturbance is removed the propeller turns off to conserve energy figs 12e and f show the control signals of the stern and rudder angles respectively the stern and rudder angles exhibit oscillatory behavior when the disturbance is applied light blue shaded region while the rudder angle returns to zero when the disturbance is removed the stern angles do not until the vehicle crosses the next curved tip at t 400 s that is attributed to the error in the pitch angle θ which remains after the disturbance is turned off at t 300 s 4 4 testing robustness in this subsection the robustness of the derived control law for gliding mode is investigated in the presence of unknown underwater current with flow velocity that is large enough to render the vehicle unstable and diverge of the nominal trajectory the same saw tooth curve from subsection 4 3 is used in this subsection s simulation similar procedure is used to derive the control law where the time parameterized saw tooth curve is considered an input for algorithm 1 and a linear quadratic regulator is derived based on the linearized model the derived lqr is then applied to the nonlinear model in 44 to command the vehicle to track the saw tooth trajectory in the presence of unknown underwater current the underwater current is applied between t 30 s and t 300 s with flow velocity of 0 27 m s which is rather excessive and is larger than the value used in subsection 4 3 the tracking performance of the controller is shown in fig 13 a as observed in the figure the controller fails to command the vehicle to track the desired trajectory when the disturbance is applied and the vehicle diverges away from the nominal trajectory the input control signals are shown in fig 13b c and fig 13d as seen in fig 13b the propeller provides zero thrust force before the disturbance is applied when the disturbance is applied at t 30 s light blue shaded area the propeller turns on and provides an average thrust force of 0 01 k n in order to counter the underwater current and to maintain the desired longitudinal velocity of 0 2 m s after crossing the first tooth tip at t 134 s the vehicle loses its stability and the thrust force oscillates between 0 k n and 300 k n then it saturates at 300 k n figs 13c and d show the control signals of the stern and rudder angles respectively as observed the stern and rudder angles exhibit oscillatory behavior when the disturbance is applied light blue shaded area 5 conclusions in this work the linearization algorithm that was developed in makdah et al 2016 for the h auv s propulsive mode only is extended to include the gliding dynamics of the vehicle a single trajectory tracking controller which autonomously switches the vehicle s operation mode is derived based on the linearized model the effect of employing frenet serret frames to calculate the nominal euler angles and nominal velocities is investigated simulation results prove the feasibility of using frenet serret frames to calculate the nominal euler angles and the nominal velocities a metric to measure the error between the actual position of the vehicle and the desired trajectory is developed and used to assess the tracking performance of the derived controller the tracking performance is investigated in the presence of unknown underwater current with bounded flow velocity that is applied to the nonlinear model simulation results show that the linear control law provides satisfactory tracking performance in the presence of disturbance and that the controller is robust enough to autonomously switch modes between propulsive and gliding dynamics to ensure minimal tracking error with respect to the desired trajectory in future work the performance of the controller will be investigated on the actual prototype once the hardware manufacturing and assembly

angela masri institute of energy and natural resources the university research board at the american university of beirut and the lebanese national council for scientific research appendix the derivation of the forces acting on the h auv and open loop simulation of the derived nonlinear model are presented below 6 1 hydrostatic forces and moments the hydrostatic forces and moments are the combined effects of the vehicle s weight and buoyancy forces the hydrostatic forces and moments are derived and expressed in the body fixed frame b as 45 x h y d r o s t a t i c w b s i n θ y h y d r o s t a t i c w b c o s θ s i n ϕ z h y d r o s t a t i c w b c o s θ c o s ϕ k h y d r o s t a t i c y g w c o s θ c o s ϕ z g w c o s θ s i n ϕ m h y d r o s t a t i c x g w c o s θ c o s ϕ z g w s i n θ n h y d r o s t a t i c x g w s i n ϕ c o s θ y g w s i n θ where w is the weight force acting on the vehicle s center of mass and b is the buoyancy force acting on the vehicle s geometric center notice that there are no moments contributed from the buoyancy force this is because the origin of the body fixed frame b is placed at the vehicle s geometric center at witch the buoyancy force is acting 6 2 added mass forces and moments added mass as defined in fossen 1994 is a force generated due to inertia added to a body as it moves through a certain fluid as a submerged body accelerates or decelerates through a certain fluid it moves some of the surrounding fluids for simplicity it can be modeled as a mass of the fluid move with the body the added mass forces and moments are derived and written as 46 x a d d e d m a s s x u u z w w q z q q 2 y v v r y r r 2 y a d d e d m a s s y v v y r r x u u r z w w p z q p q z a d d e d m a s s z w w z q q x u u q y v v p y r r p k a d d e d

where the coefficients that are in the form s e s x y z k m n and e u v w p q r are the added mass coefficients this notation is adopted according to sname 1952 and it refers to the added mass coefficient of the force or moment in the s direction due to the acceleration e in the body fixed frame b since most of the time the vehicle is completely submerged underwater the added mass coefficients are assumed to be constant notice that some of the added mass coefficients are neglected and are set to zero e g x v 0 because the vehicle is symmetric with respect to the x b y b and the x b z b planes of the body fixed frame b the added mass coefficients in 46 are calculated analytically calculating the these coefficients in three dimensions is difficult especially for geometries that have complex features in this work the added mass coefficients are calculated using the strip theory in which the outer geometry of the vehicle is divided into a number of strips then 2 dimensional hydrodynamic coefficients for added mass are computed for each strip and integrated over the length of the body to yield the 3 dimensional coefficients the 2 dimensional added mass coefficients for various 2 dimensional shapes can be found in newman 1977 and blevins 1979 the values of the added mass coefficients are presented in table 2 table 2 added mass coefficients table 2

are mainly due to skin friction between the fluid and the vehicle as it moves through the fluid the drag forces and moments are derived and are expressed as 47 x d r a g x u u u u y d r a g y v v v v y r r r r z d r a g z w w w w z q q q q k d r a g k p p p p m d r a g m q q q q m w w w w n d r a g n r r r r n v v v v where the coefficients that are in the form s e e s x y z k m n and e u v w p q r are the drag coefficients this notation denotes to the drag coefficient of the force or moment in the s direction due to the velocity e in the body fixed frame b similarly as the added mass coefficients some of the drag coefficients are neglected and are set to zero e g x v v 0 because the vehicle is symmetric with respect to the x b y b and the x b z b planes of the body fixed frame b the drag coefficients in 47 are calculated using empirical formulas that can be found in triantafyllou lewis 1988 hoerner and borst 1985 and whicker and fehlner 1958 the values of the drag

will cause a flow separation in the fluid creating a pressure difference between the upper and the lower parts of the body this pressure difference generates a lift force that acts on the body s center of mass the lift forces and moments that are acting on the vehicle are contributed from the fins wings and its body the derived and simplified lift forces and moments are written as 48 x l i f

fixed frame b which will be denoted by x t h r u s t also the propeller generates a torque about the x b axis of the body fixed frame b and it is denoted by k p r o p e l l e r 6 6 open loop simulation in order to determine the values of the constants u t u t h r u s t u g l i d i n g w m a x and θ m a x in 20 and algorithm 1 the nonlinear model in 13 is simulated when applying a known set of inputs u x t δ s r δ s l δ r t four cases are simulated the first and the second cases involve turning on the propeller in order to determine the values of u t h r u s t and u t which are the vehicle s longitudinal velocity in thrust mode and the threshold value that is used to determine the mode of operation respectively the third and the fourth cases involve turning off the propeller and changing the vehicle s buoyancy by setting the mass to m m i n and m m a x for each case respectively in the third case the vehicle is floating up while in the fourth case the vehicle is diving down and in both cases the values of u g l i d i n g w m a x and θ m a x are determined 6 6 1 moving forward in thrust mode in this case only the propeller is required to be turned on and the rest of the inputs are set to zero so the inputs u x t 0 15 k n δ s r 0 r a d δ s l 0 r a d δ r 0 r a d t are applied to the nonlinear model in 13 as a result the vehicle moves forward in a straight line as expected when the system reaches steady state the vehicle s longitudinal velocity that corresponds to u t h r u s t is determined to be 1 5 m s 6 6 2 moving forward in thrust mode with minimum thrust force in order to determine the value of u t in algorithm 1 the propeller is turned on with minimum thrust force and the rest of the inputs are set to zero thus the inputs u x t 0 01 k n δ s r 0 r a d δ s l 0 r a d δ r 0 r a d t are applied to the nonlinear model in 13 as expected the vehicle moves forward in a straight line when the system reaches steady state the vehicle s longitudinal velocity u t h r u s t is measured to be 0 39 m s hence the value of u t in algorithm 1 is chosen to be 0 4 m s where if u n m is greater or equal to 0 4 m s the vehicle switches to thrust mode and the propeller is turned on while if u n m is less than 0 4 m s the vehicle switches to gliding mode table 7 nominal states and desired mass table 7 nominalstatesand desiredmass thrust mode gliding mode diving gliding mode floating x n m given from γ t y n m z n m ϕ n m 17 θ n m 16 0 28 r a d 0 28 r a d ψ n m 18 u n m 19 0 2 m s 0 2 m s v n m 19 w n m 19 0 04 m s 0 04 m s p n m 19 q n m r e q u t 0 4 m s

vehicle s mass is set to m m i n so the vehicle is positively buoyant and the rest of the inputs are set to zero hence the inputs u x t 0 k n δ s r 0 r a d δ s l 0 r a d δ r 0 r a d t and m m i n 71 5 k g are applied to 13 the vehicle floats up while moving forward at steady state the vehicle s longitudinal velocity transverse velocity and pitch angle that correspond to u g l i d i n g w m a x and θ m a x in 20 respectively are determined to be u g l i d i n g 0 2 m s w m a x 0 04 m s and θ m a x 0 28 r a d the absolute value is used because the constants w m a x and θ m a x are positive regardless of whether the vehicle is floating up or diving down the t a n h function in 20 handles the sign switch when the vehicle alternates between diving and floating 6 6 4 diving down in gliding mode similarly as in the second case the propeller is turned off and the rest of the inputs are set to zero however in this case the vehicle s mass is set to m m a x so the vehicle is negatively buoyant therefore the inputs u x t 0 k n δ s r 0 r a d δ s l 0 r a d δ r 0 r a d t and m m a x 73 5 k g are applied to 13 consequently the vehicle dives down while moving forward at steady state the vehicle s longitudinal velocity transverse velocity and pitch angle that correspond to u g l i d i n g w m a x and θ m a x in 20 respectively are determined to be u g l i d i n g 0 2 m s w m a x 0 04 m s and θ m a x 0 28 r a d notice that these values are equal to the values measured in the second case the values of the nominal states that are used to linearize the nonlinear model after determining the mode of operation are summarized in table 7
