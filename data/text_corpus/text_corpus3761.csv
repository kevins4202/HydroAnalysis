18805,explosives used in mining operations release reactive nitrogen n that discharge into surrounding waters existing pond systems at mine sites could be used for n removal through denitrification and we investigated capacity in tailings and clarification pond sediments at an iron ore mine site despite differences in microbial community structure in the two ponds the potential denitrification rates were similar although carbon limited therefore a microcosm experiment in which we amended sediment from the clarification pond with acetate cellulose or green algae as possible carbon sources was conducted during 10 weeks under denitrifying conditions algae and acetate treatments showed efficient nitrate removal and increased potential denitrification rates whereas cellulose was not different from the control denitrifiers were overall more abundant than bacteria performing dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium dnra or anaerobic ammonium oxidation although dnra bacteria increased in the algae treatment and this coincided with accumulation of ammonium the algae addition also caused higher emissions of methane ch4 and nitrous oxide n2o the bacterial community in this treatment had a large proportion of bacteroidia sulfate reducing taxa and bacteria known as fermenters functional gene abundances indicated an imbalance between organisms that produce n2o in relation to those that can reduce it with the algae treatment showing the lowest relative capacity for n2o reduction these findings show that pond sediments have the potential to contribute to mitigating nitrate levels in water from mining industry but it is important to consider the type of carbon supply as it affects the community composition which in turn can lead to unwanted processes and increased greenhouse gas emissions graphical abstract image 1 keywords algae clarification pond greenhouse gases nitrate removal tailings pond water treatment 1 introduction high levels of nitrogen n in water from mining industry originating from undetonated ammonium nitrate based explosives is an environmental problem that has not been recognized until the very last decade bailey et al 2013 häyrynen et al 2008 zaitsev et al 2008 ammonium nitrate is easily dissolved in water and cause eutrophication in downstream water bodies to meet the eu water frame directive 2000 60 ec eu comission 2000 requirements of good ecological status in lakes and rivers by 2021 there is a need to reduce n released from mining activities removal of n from mine water can be achieved with a number of physical chemical or biological methods jermakka et al 2015 tailings and clarification ponds in mining areas offer a possibility for biological n removal by denitrification in the sediments taking advantage of the large areas and long hydraulic retention time erbanova et al 2016 nilsson and widerlund 2018 denitrification transforms soluble n compounds to gaseous ones and the complete process is a stepwise reduction of nitrate no3 to dinitrogen gas n2 via the intermediates nitrite no2 nitric oxide no and nitrous oxide n2o this process is carried out by a diverse range of microbial taxa with the majority being heterotrophic bacteria philippot et al 2007 mining ponds typically contain groundwater rock waste leachate and precipitation with low concentrations of organic carbon thurman 1985 and one of the challenges for successful n removal is to achieve sufficient supply of carbon compounds suitable as electron donors for denitrifiers autotrophic denitrification oxidizing sulfur s compounds could also be an option but mainly for acid mine drainage broman et al 2017 in engineered systems addition of methanol or acetate is commonly used to enhance denitrification rates cherchi et al 2009 mohan et al 2016 however this is expensive and using carbon originating from photosynthesis could be an alternative and a more sustainable solution this is in line with n removal in wetlands where root exudates and decaying plant material is used as carbon supply bastviken et al 2005 garcía lledó et al 2011 or bioreactors with solid substrates e g wood chips warneke et al 2011 solutions that have also been evaluated as treatment of no3 polluted mining waters hallin et al 2015 herbert et al 2014 there is limited information of how to support denitrification in mining ponds but recently huang et al 2018 showed that the cyanobacteria microcystis could act as a carbon source to enhance no3 removal in a laboratory experiment with lake sediment when increasing denitrification activity there is always a risk of also increasing the emissions of the greenhouse gas n2o about 40 of all denitrifiers terminate denitrification with n2o as they do not have the genetic capacity for n2o reduction graf et al 2014 and complete denitrifiers which would normally use n2o as an intermediate can also emit n2o under non favorable conditions butterbach bahl et al 2013 firestone et al 1980 moreover addition of carbon will modify the c n ratio which has been shown to affect the relative importance of dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium dnra in aquatic sediments fernandes et al 2012 franklin et al 2017 kim et al 2016 song et al 2014 this would counteract the purpose as it leads to n retention in the form of ammonium nh4 instead of n removal thus effects on microbial community composition and other functional groups than denitrifiers involved in no3 and n2o reduction after addition of plant derived material to mining ponds need to be evaluated especially to ensure a low genetic potential for nh4 and n2o production little is known about microbial communities in sediments of tailings and clarification ponds in mining areas with alkaline mine drainage let alone how they are affected by management our aim was to investigate the possibility of using existing tailings and clarification ponds receiving alkaline mine drainage for no3 removal by denitrification and if the process could be enhanced by addition of plant derived carbon first we conducted a field study at the kiruna iron ore mine site in sweden to characterize the spatial variation of the endogenous denitrification capacity chemical properties in the water and sediments and the bacterial diversity and community composition in the pond sediments at the site this informed us about the overall variability in the system and the environmental conditions and bacterial communities indicative of high vs low denitrification potential the detailed description of the site was our reference for the following microcosm experiment in which we aimed at increasing the denitrification rate in the sediment by addition of carbon in the form of algae cellulose or acetate the microcosm performance was monitored during 10 weeks under denitrifying conditions including the production of n2o methane ch4 and carbon dioxide co2 and the effect of the carbon amendments on the abundance of denitrifiers n2o reducers dnra bacteria and bacteria capable of anaerobic ammonium oxidation anammox as well as on the composition and diversity of the bacterial communities was determined 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description and sampling of sediment and water the kiruna iron ore mine is located in northern sweden lat 67 50 9 long 20 11 7 and is operated by the mining company loussavaara kiirunavaara aktiebolag lkab the annual mean temperature in kiruna is 1 7 c with a mean of 10 c during june august smhi 2018 and the water temperature at the time of sampling was 7 3 c which is close to the annual mean water temperature of 5 8 c 1 5 m above the bottom of the clarification pond a schematic picture of the site is shown in fig s1 in supplementary data ground water is pumped from the mine to the processing plants and from there the water enters a tailings pond 0 63 km2 0 67 106 m3 and subsequently flows to a clarification pond 0 63 km2 2 3 106 m3 surface water runoff precipitation also enters the system precipitation washes out soluble n compounds from the waste rock dumps and this water partly reaches the ground water in the mine via infiltration nilsson and widerlund 2017 most of the water ca 90 is recirculated back from the clarification pond to the processing plant while the rest is discharged to the rakkurijoki system and via the kalix river empties into the bothnian bay baltic sea fig s1 according to the lkab monitoring program 9 10 million m3 of water is annually released into the receiving waters of the rakkurijoki system and the discharged water carries 25 mg n l 1 as no3 the concentration of no3 in the ponds is relatively stable over the year with a mean of 25 mg n l 1 corresponding to a total amount of 16 750 and 57 500 kg n in the tailings and clarification pond respectively the total organic carbon toc in the pond water varies between 2 and 4 mg l 1 for the field study both sediment and water were collected from each of 24 sampling points along depth gradients in the tailings and clarification ponds in september 2014 these samples were collected and analyzed to obtain an initial characterization of the spatial variability of the microbiology and chemistry of the pond system fig 1 coordinates in table s1 for the microcosm experiment additional sediment and water samples were collected from three locations at a representative depth 2 3 m of the clarification pond locations a b c in fig 1 the clarification pond was selected for the microcosm experiment since it is better suited for denitrification due to the higher carbon content to begin with overlaying water was collected from 20 to 30 cm depth at the same locations these three sediment and water samples were pooled separately and hereafter denoted original sediment and microcosm water for collecting the upper 2 5 cm sediment an ekman grab sampler was used and the water samples were collected using a ruttner sampler samples 1 24 in fig 1 or by immersing 20 l plastic containers into the water the microcosm water all sediment samples were kept and transported at 4 8 c before analyses within one week and setting up the microcosm experiment 12 days after sampling the 24 pond water samples were analyzed directly on site for chemical properties lkab accredited analysis laboratory and prepared for chlorophyll a analyses by filtering the filters were transported and kept at 4 c and the microcosm water was shipped to the laboratory by road and frozen upon arrival 2 2 microcosm experiment to allow for respiration of easily available carbon compounds potentially present in the sediment the original sediment was kept at 22 c for 4 days prior to setting up the microcosms for each microcosm 50 g of the original sediment and 150 g of freshly thawed microcosm water was placed in 250 ml bottles to evaluate the effect of different carbon sources 1 ml of sterile solutions containing 18 mg carbon ml 1 corresponding to four times the stoichiometric need for denitrification was added as i sterile algae for preparation see supplementary data ii hydroxyethyl cellulose hec mw 90 000 g mol 1 or iii sodium acetate naac as a control a fourth treatment with only water added was included for each treatment four replicate microcosms were prepared the bottles were sealed with gas tight screw caps with butyl rubber septa and the atmosphere was exchanged to n2 each bottle had a gas outlet via a water trap to a measuring cylinder capturing the gas the microcosms were incubated at a constant temperature of 20 c in a dark room for 69 days to simulate a system with continuous flow and to avoid depletion of no3 or carbon the water was removed twice a week with help of vacuum and replaced by freshly thawed microcosm water stored at 4 c maximum 5 days since frozen and carbon was added as above water chemistry was monitored weekly as described below at the end of the experiment the sediment from each bottle was thoroughly mixed and then divided in four subsamples 2 20 g were stored at 4 c and used within two days for potential denitrification assays 1 2 g were immediately frozen for dna extraction and the rest was used for determining water content 2 3 chemical analyses of sediment and water 2 3 1 pond sediments and water samples the 24 pond sediment samples were analyzed for the total content of the elements n phosphorous p iron fe and s and for organic carbonate and total carbon tc see table s2 for methods dry content of all sediment samples was determined gravimetrically by drying 8 10 g at 105 c the corresponding 24 water samples

alkalinity for chlorophyll a analyses 800 ml of the water were filtered through glass fiber filters see table s1 for methods 2 3 2 microcosm water samples before freezing the water for the microcosm experiment the concentration of the sum of no2 and no3 ions no2 no3 was measured the water sampled weekly from the microcosms was analyzed for ph toc so4 2 nh4 and no2 no3 swedac accredited geochemical laboratory at slu 2 4 gas measurements in the microcosm experiment production of gas was followed daily by noting the total gas volume produced data not shown and twice a week 5 ml of the microcosm head space gas was sampled for analyses of n2o ch4 and co2 the gas samples were analyzed by gas chromatography clarus 500 gc perkinelmer ct usa equipped with electron capture flame ionization and thermal conductivity detectors for n2o ch4 and co2 respectively the gas concentrations were recalculated to production per day taking into account that the microcosms were opened once a week 2 5 potential denitrification rates potential denitrification rates were measured in the 24 pond sediment samples in the original sediment used for the microcosms and in the individual microcosm sediments at the end of the experimental period the rates were determined under anoxic conditions using the acetylene inhibition technique without chloramphenicol pell et al 1996 briefly 20 25 g of wet sediment and 10 ml of sterile deionized water were combined with potassium nitrate kno3 in gas tight bottles to a final concentration of 3 mm the atmosphere was changed to n2 10 v v acetylene was added and the bottles were incubated with constant agitation 175 rpm at 25 c gas samples for n2o analyses were taken at regular intervals during 6 5 h and the potential denitrification rates were calculated from linear regression 3 5 time points of the n2o produced the n2o was analyzed as described in 2 4 activity in the 24 pond sediment samples was determined both with and without carbon addition carbon was added to a final concentration of 210 mg l 1 as a mixture of glucose sodium succinate and sodium acetate molar ratio 2 3 6 in addition potential n2o production rates were determined by incubating the sediments with the carbon mixture but without acetylene in the original sediment used for the microcosms denitrification rates were determined in four replicates under five conditions with i the carbon mixture described above ii iv the three different carbon compounds that was used in the microcosm experiment naac hec sterile algae separately and v with water as a control the activity in microcosm sediments was determined at day 69 under two conditions i with the carbon mixture and ii with the same carbon as it had received during the experimental period 2 6 dna extraction total dna was extracted from 0 4 g of wet sediment using the fastdna spin kit for soil mp biomedicals ca usa following the manufacturer s instructions from two replicates of the original sediment from each of the microcosms at the end of the experiment and from the 24 pond samples the extracted dna was quantified using the broad range double stranded dna kit and the qubit

demonstrated by permutational multivariate analysis of variance permanova followed by pairwise comparisons using adonis and pairwise perm manova to correct for multiple comparisons between groups we used false discovery rate benjamini and hochberg 1995 3 results 3 1 chemical characterization and potential denitrification rates in the pond system the tailings and clarification ponds differed with respect to the measured chemical parameters fig s2 tables s1 and s2 the samples from the tailings pond were characterized by higher levels of ions nh4 no2 no3 f cl and so4 2 and by lower levels of toc in the water compared to the clarification pond t test all p values 0 001 the lower toc in the tailings pond water was also reflected in a lower content of both toc and tc in the sediment t test p 0 04 and 0 04 in the clarification pond the variation among samples were higher than in the tailings pond but three clusters samples 1 5 6 9 and 10 13 could be distinguished each with specific chemical characteristics fig s2 denitrification in the pond sediments were limited by carbon availability fig 2 a and table s2 under unlimited carbon supply the denitrification rates were significantly higher in both the tailings and the clarification pond p 0 015 and 0 049 respectively neither the rates with only endogenous carbon nor with carbon addition differed between ponds p 0 14 and p 0 09 fig 2a the denitrification end product ratio n2o n2o n2 reflecting the net nitrous oxide production in comparison to the potential denitrification activity was much lower than 1 but did not differ between the ponds p 0 13 fig 2b three samples from each of the ponds were excluded from the analyses due to n2o concentrations below detection limit see table s2 3 2 performance of microcosms denitrification rates toc and n dynamics and gas production the original sediment used in the microcosm experiment had similar potential denitrification rates for all carbon types and the mixture fig 2c dashed line fig 2d open boxes after 10 weeks the potential rates obtained with the carbon mixture had increased significantly in the naac and algae treatments and decreased significantly in the water and hec treatments fig 2c p 0 05 the same was observed for the rates obtained with the specific carbon source added to the different microcosms fig 2d p 0 05 the increase in rates in the naac and algae treatments with the specific carbon source was not significantly different from the increased rates with the carbon mixture p 0 49 and p 0 10 respectively the treatment with algae showed effective no3 removal after five weeks the no2 no3 concentrations in the water were similar to those in the naac treatment which was the most effective with more than 99 removal fig 3 a however nh4 was produced and the concentrations in the algae treatment were orders of magnitudes higher than in the other treatments fig 3b the toc concentration in the water differed between treatments and was relatively stable over the microcosm experiment in each treatment but at day 40 toc decreased in the naac treatment and was nearly fully consumed by day 55 fig 3c in the algae microcosms the toc levels were low during the entire period all treatments resulted in lower ph fig s3 and so4 2 levels fig 3d with a more prominent so4 2 reduction from day 40 in all samples throughout the experiment the water control and the hec amended sediments performed similarly fig 3a d the total volume of gas produced in the microcosms was highest in the algae treatment followed by the naac treatment data not shown despite high variation between replicates overall trends in the production of co2 n2o and ch4 could be detected fig 3e h initially n2o was not detectable in the naac treated microcosms but after six weeks the concentrations increased gas concentrations in the samples from the last day were compared and showed that the algae treatment had significantly higher levels of both ch4 and n2o compared to the hec treatment and water control p 0 05 the production of ch4 correlated with n2o and nh4 concentrations r 0 84 and 0 97 and negatively with no2 no3 r 0 84 there was also a negative correlation between n2o and no2 no3 r 0 81 3 3 gene abundances in the microcosm sediments the size of the total bacterial community 16s rrna gene abundance remained the same in all treatments except in the algae where it was significantly higher p 0 05 at the end of the experiment compared to the original sediment table 1 the functional genes responded differently to the treatments table 1 the denitrification genes nirs and nirk decreased in abundance in the naac treatment but remained at the same level in the other two carbon treatments the nitrous oxide reductase gene noszi increased in all carbon treatments whereas noszii remained at the same level in the hec microcosms and decreased in the others the abundance of the anammox marker gene hdh showed the same pattern as noszii finally nrfa in dnra bacteria increased in the algae microcosms decreased in naac and remained at the same level in hec by looking at the ratios between gene abundances we can see the shifts in functional groups relative to each other across the treatments fig 4 the ratio between the genes in the two processes dnra and denitrification that compete for no3 increased significantly in the algae treatment while this treatment at the same time displayed the lowest ratio between genes involved in n2o reduction and denitrification fig 4 the latter suggest increased capacity for n2o production during denitrification the highest nosz to nir gene ratio was instead detected in the naac treatment the genetic potential for anammox showed a small increase in relation to denitrification in the hec and water control where carbon availability was low the abundance of noszi co2 production and potential denitrification rate correlated with each other 0 96 r 0 97 and the abundance of noszii correlated positively with so4 2 r 0 93 3 4 microbial diversity and community composition in pond and microcosm sediments all sediment communities were dominated by bacteria and the number of archaeal reads comprised less than 0 1 of the total reads six otus were classified as archaea however the primers do not pick up all archaea and miss for example the thaumarcheota takahashi et al 2014 the majority of the otus were shared between the ponds and microcosm samples and only 4 were unique for the pond samples alpha diversity in terms of otu richness shannon and 1 simpson did not differ significantly between the ponds but was highly variable between samples p 0 09 0 99 and 0 77 respectively fig 5 a table s4 in the microcosm experiment the naac and algae amendments resulted in lower diversity whereas it was unaffected in the water control and hec treatments fig 5a the community composition in the tailings pond was unique compared to that in the clarification pond and also to all sediments from the microcosm experiment including the original sediment for setting up the microcosms permanova p 0 05 fig 5b pond communities were dominated by pseudomonadales and flavobacteriales fig 5c with the families pseudomonadaceae and moraxellaceae only present in the ponds and flavobacteriaceae in the sample types characterized by low carbon availability table s5 rhodobacter and sulfuritalea were present in high abundances in the tailings pond table s5 the community composition in the clarification pond was similar to the original sediment for the microcosm experiment that was sampled in that pond which confirms that the sediment used in the experiment was representative for the pond since the communities that had developed in the four different microcosms treatments differed significantly from the original sample we can conclude that the treatment effect was stronger than the incubation effect the treatments were also different from each other with the exception of hec treatment and water control the 20 most abundant otus per pond or treatment comprised a total of 70 otus table s5 some of the dominant otus were restricted to only one sample type and none of them was present in all sample types proteobacterial classes dominated in the acetate fed microcosms whereas the algae treatment had a large proportion of bacteroidia fig 5c of which the genus paludibacter could be identified table s5 in the acetate treatment so4 2 reducing bacteria in the orders desulfobacterales and desulforomonadales were enriched fig 5c and in the algae treatment desulfobacteraceae otu 35 was among the 20 most abundant taxa table s5 at family level three taxa were present in nearly all sample types the gammaproteobacteria sinobacteraceae was found in all but the water treatment the acidimicrobiia family c11 in all but the algae treatment and the deltaproteobacteria syntrophobacteraceae in all but the acetate and the algae treatments table s5 the genus rhodoferax was only found in the hec treatment table s5 4 discussion the initial spatial characterization of the pond system at the lkab mining site in kiruna showed that both the tailings and clarification pond harbored bacterial communities capable of denitrification opposite to our expectations there were no differences in the endogenous denitrification potential in the tailings and clarification ponds despite differences in carbon content chemical characteristics in the sediments and water as well as in the microbial community composition however higher denitrification rates were deteced in samples with higher organic carbon content and these communities had a different composition compared to those with a lower content microbial communities in alkaline ponds at mining sites are not well studied and we cannot conclude if the communities at the kiruna site are representative for these type of systems nevertheless both ponds were dominated by the orders pseudomonadales and flavobacteriales and among abundant taxa in the tailings pond were flavobacteriaceae a diverse family common in aquatic environments and with many members isolated from the polar regions and from oligotrophic systems mcbride et al 2014 mucko et al 2018 nam et al 2017 notably this family was also present in samples characterized by low carbon availability in the present study in accordance with the higher levels of so4 2 and low levels of carbon the tailings pond had high abundances of phototrophic rhodobacter and s oxidizing and denitrifying sulfuritalea sulfur cycling is likely more prominent in the tailings pond and denitrifiers capable of using s compounds as electron donors can potentially contribute to no3 removal when carbon availability is low hang et al 2017 the low carbon availability in the ponds limited the heterotrophic denitrifier community to reach its full potential in terms of activity denitrification in alkaline mine impacted sediments is not well explored but carbon limitation was also shown in stream sediment impacted by acid mine drainage baeseman et al 2006 in general no3 polluted groundwater does not contain enough carbon to support heterotrophic denitrification and reach sufficient n removal and therefore denitrification is often enhanced when mixed with water rich in labile organic carbon liu et al 2017 zarnetske et al 2011 stoliker et al 2016 trauth et al 2018 the microcosm experiment further confirmed that the pond sediments could remove no3 more effectively by increasing the amount of available carbon the absolute rates obtained in the microcosm sediment might however not reflect the true potential since the sediment to water ratio was different from that in the clarification pond we only rely on diffusion for transporting nitrate from the water column to the sediment and the higher incubation temperature could have selected for other microorganisms the relative effect across treatments showed that nearly complete no3 removal was achieved in the microcosms fed with acetate or algae and this coincided with increased potential denitrification rates similarly in sediments polluted with n rich acid mine drainage leachate from willow leaves increased the no3 removal rate baeseman et al 2006 the denitrification rate in the hec treated sediment in the present study was significantly lower after 10 weeks than in the original sediment suggesting depletion of endogenous carbon compounds in the sediment the accumulation of toc in the water during the experiment further supports our conclusion that the complex hec molecule was not an efficient electron donor for the denitrifiers present in the sediment however we cannot rule out that a cellulose degrading community would have established after a longer experimental period that would allow for using cheap carbon substrates like saw dust and wood chips which have been used in denitrifying cellulose based bioreactors treating mining water herbert et al 2014 nordström and herbert 2018 in the microcosms the most striking difference in community composition between the two treatments resulting in increased denitrification was the dominance of proteobacterial classes in the acetate fed microcosms compared to the large proportion of bacteroidia in the algae treatment this is not surprising since acetate can be directly used for denitrification whereas the denitrifiers will depend on degradation and fermentation of more complex carbon amendments performed by other bacteria members of bacteroidales have a fermentative metabolism and other fermentative bacteria detected in the algae treatment were clostridales morrison et al 2017 studied the degradation of the green alga chlorella vulgaris and suggested the involvement of a wide range of bacterial lineages in the degradation including different members of the phylum bacteroidetes e g paludibacter and desulfobacteraceae although the algae treatment was meant to mimic an in situ situation with phytoplankton being mineralized on the sediment surface other carbon compunds are probably released in a real setting compared to when adding autoclaved algae and other taxa involved in fermentation could then be more relevant in the ponds paludibacter present in the algae treatment has previously been found in an enrichment culture from acid mine drainage impacted sediment where it was co enriched together with so4 2 reducing bacteria sánchez andrea et al 2013 in agreement with sánchez andrea et al 2013 and morrison et al 2017 desulfobacteraceae otu 35 was also among the 20 most abundant taxa in the algae treatment other even more abundant so4 2 reducing bacteria were enriched in the acetate treatment which coincided with higher so4 2 reduction and a characteristic smell of hydrogen sulfide compared to the other treatments this was likely due to the efficient no3 removal in these microcosms resulting in more reduced conditions at the end of each water batch period the genetic potential for denitrification in terms of nir gene abundance suggest that bacteria with denitrification capacity dominated among the communities that could be involved in no3 reduction in all microcosms after 10 weeks the relative abundance of the anammox marker gene was low and this process likely did not contribute to the overall no3 removal however the abundance of nrfa genes suggest that dnra could be an alternative pathway for no3 reduction occurring simultaneously with denitrification and causing n retention rather than removal similar to natural sediments franklin et al 2017 kim et al 2016 song et al 2014 the genetic potential for this process increased in relation to denitrification in the algae treatment although the genetic potential for denitrification was still higher the degrading algae probably increased the carbon content over time and caused more reduced conditions in the sediment as indicated by the high ch4 production in these microcosms this would explain the relative increase in nrfa abundance as dnra bacteria have been shown to be promoted in estuarine sediments with more reduced conditions and higher c n ratios song et al 2014 and also in soils with higher c no3 ratios putz et al 2018 thus dnra could have contributed to the production of nh4 observed in the algae supplemented microcosms although nh4 probably also originated from mineralization of the algae cells additionally dnra bacteria have a versatile metabolism and some are capable of both dnra and fermentation cole and brown 1980 at high c n ratios it has been shown that the relative importance of fermentative dnra increases van den berg et al 2017 the reduced conditions created in the algae microcosms might be a driver for such reactions although the data in this study does not allow us to make that conclusion irrespective of treatment the genetic potential for n2o reduction was always lower than that for the no2 reduction step in denitrification this indicates an imbalance between organisms that can produce n2o in relation to those that can reduce this potent greenhouse gas such discrepancies have been shown to affect emissions of n2o domeignoz horta et al 2016 philippot et al 2011 the original sediment representing the natural conditions at the site also had low nosz nir gene ratios and the potential n2o production and denitrification rates in the ponds indicate that n2o can constitute 15 of the end product from denitrification similar to our study low nosz nir gene ratios have been observed in a bioreactor treating nitrate rich water from another iron ore mine herbert et al 2014 in the microcosm experiment the nosz nir gene ratio was lowest in the algae treatment and this was also the treatment that had the highest production of n2o during the experiment in the ponds the samples with the highest n2o end product ratio and also high denitrification rates were the shallow samples in the clarification pond samples 6 7 and 8 with the highest amount of toc in the overlaying water the algae microcosms also had the highest ch4 production and overall our results suggest that supporting n removal by using algae could increase emissions of greenhouse gases it will be important to consider how to prevent emissions of both ch4 and n2o when implementing enhanced n removal in ponds treating n polluted mining waters the current no3 removal capacity in the ponds cannot meet the desired effluent standards to support good ecological status of recipient lakes if we assume that there is no denitrification activity in the water column and that denitrification occurs in the upper 2 cm of the sediment denitrification could yearly remove 15 000 and 47 000 kg n in the tailings and clarification pond respectively considering 25 c and unlimited carbon and no3 supply this corresponds to about 90 and 80 of the total amount of n in the ponds however the temperature in the ponds at the mining site is much lower than in our experiment and the actual rates are expected to be lower although denitrification in lake sediments occurs throughout the year e g aalto et al 2018 ahlgren et al 1994 rissanen et al 2011 to speculate reducing the rate to only a fourth because of the 20 difference in water temperature between laboratory and field conditions about 20 av the n could be removed nevertheless the increased denitrification capacity and significant changes in community composition observed in the microcosms after being supplemented with carbon compounds suggest that the sediment could be adapted and perform better this shows that there is a potential for increasing denitrification and n removal capacity in the sediments 5 conclusions talings and clarifications ponds with neutral to alkaline water at iron ore mining sites could increase their nitrate removal capacity via denitrification by allowing adaption of the system to supplemental carbon compounds however the type of carbon supplied needs to be considered as it affected the bacterial community composition and functional groups involved in different nitrate reduction pathways for example green algae as a carbon source for denitrification caused unwanted communities and processes like an increase in dnra bacteria and ammonium accumulation and increased emissions of the greenhouse gases ch4 and n2o overall there was also an imbalance between functional groups capable of truncated denitrification ending with n2o and those capable of n2o reduction in the sediments the risk of swopping nitrate loadings to greenhouse gas emissions should be assessed when implementing

18805,explosives used in mining operations release reactive nitrogen n that discharge into surrounding waters existing pond systems at mine sites could be used for n removal through denitrification and we investigated capacity in tailings and clarification pond sediments at an iron ore mine site despite differences in microbial community structure in the two ponds the potential denitrification rates were similar although carbon limited therefore a microcosm experiment in which we amended sediment from the clarification pond with acetate cellulose or green algae as possible carbon sources was conducted during 10 weeks under denitrifying conditions algae and acetate treatments showed efficient nitrate removal and increased potential denitrification rates whereas cellulose was not different from the control denitrifiers were overall more abundant than bacteria performing dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium dnra or anaerobic ammonium oxidation although dnra bacteria increased in the algae treatment and this coincided with accumulation of ammonium the algae addition also caused higher emissions of methane ch4 and nitrous oxide n2o the bacterial community in this treatment had a large proportion of bacteroidia sulfate reducing taxa and bacteria known as fermenters functional gene abundances indicated an imbalance between organisms that produce n2o in relation to those that can reduce it with the algae treatment showing the lowest relative capacity for n2o reduction these findings show that pond sediments have the potential to contribute to mitigating nitrate levels in water from mining industry but it is important to consider the type of carbon supply as it affects the community composition which in turn can lead to unwanted processes and increased greenhouse gas emissions graphical abstract image 1 keywords algae clarification pond greenhouse gases nitrate removal tailings pond water treatment 1 introduction high levels of nitrogen n in water from mining industry originating from undetonated ammonium nitrate based explosives is an environmental problem that has not been recognized until the very last decade bailey et al 2013 häyrynen et al 2008 zaitsev et al 2008 ammonium nitrate is easily dissolved in water and cause eutrophication in downstream water bodies to meet the eu water frame directive 2000 60 ec eu comission 2000 requirements of good ecological status in lakes and rivers by 2021 there is a need to reduce n released from mining activities removal of n from mine water can be achieved with a number of physical chemical or biological methods jermakka et al 2015 tailings and clarification ponds in mining areas offer a possibility for biological n removal by denitrification in the sediments taking advantage of the large areas and long hydraulic retention time erbanova et al 2016 nilsson and widerlund 2018 denitrification transforms soluble n compounds to gaseous ones and the complete process is a stepwise reduction of nitrate no3 to dinitrogen gas n2 via the intermediates nitrite no2 nitric oxide no and nitrous oxide n2o this process is carried out by a diverse range of microbial taxa with the majority being heterotrophic bacteria philippot et al 2007 mining ponds typically contain groundwater rock waste leachate and precipitation with low concentrations of organic carbon thurman 1985 and one of the challenges for successful n removal is to achieve sufficient supply of carbon compounds suitable as electron donors for denitrifiers autotrophic denitrification oxidizing sulfur s compounds could also be an option but mainly for acid mine drainage broman et al 2017 in engineered systems addition of methanol or acetate is commonly used to enhance denitrification rates cherchi et al 2009 mohan et al 2016 however this is expensive and using carbon originating from photosynthesis could be an alternative and a more sustainable solution this is in line with n removal in wetlands where root exudates and decaying plant material is used as carbon supply bastviken et al 2005 garcía lledó et al 2011 or bioreactors with solid substrates e g wood chips warneke et al 2011 solutions that have also been evaluated as treatment of no3 polluted mining waters hallin et al 2015 herbert et al 2014 there is limited information of how to support denitrification in mining ponds but recently huang et al 2018 showed that the cyanobacteria microcystis could act as a carbon source to enhance no3 removal in a laboratory experiment with lake sediment when increasing denitrification activity there is always a risk of also increasing the emissions of the greenhouse gas n2o about 40 of all denitrifiers terminate denitrification with n2o as they do not have the genetic capacity for n2o reduction graf et al 2014 and complete denitrifiers which would normally use n2o as an intermediate can also emit n2o under non favorable conditions butterbach bahl et al 2013 firestone et al 1980 moreover addition of carbon will modify the c n ratio which has been shown to affect the relative importance of dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium dnra in aquatic sediments fernandes et al 2012 franklin et al 2017 kim et al 2016 song et al 2014 this would counteract the purpose as it leads to n retention in the form of ammonium nh4 instead of n removal thus effects on microbial community composition and other functional groups than denitrifiers involved in no3 and n2o reduction after addition of plant derived material to mining ponds need to be evaluated especially to ensure a low genetic potential for nh4 and n2o production little is known about microbial communities in sediments of tailings and clarification ponds in mining areas with alkaline mine drainage let alone how they are affected by management our aim was to investigate the possibility of using existing tailings and clarification ponds receiving alkaline mine drainage for no3 removal by denitrification and if the process could be enhanced by addition of plant derived carbon first we conducted a field study at the kiruna iron ore mine site in sweden to characterize the spatial variation of the endogenous denitrification capacity chemical properties in the water and sediments and the bacterial diversity and community composition in the pond sediments at the site this informed us about the overall variability in the system and the environmental conditions and bacterial communities indicative of high vs low denitrification potential the detailed description of the site was our reference for the following microcosm experiment in which we aimed at increasing the denitrification rate in the sediment by addition of carbon in the form of algae cellulose or acetate the microcosm performance was monitored during 10 weeks under denitrifying conditions including the production of n2o methane ch4 and carbon dioxide co2 and the effect of the carbon amendments on the abundance of denitrifiers n2o reducers dnra bacteria and bacteria capable of anaerobic ammonium oxidation anammox as well as on the composition and diversity of the bacterial communities was determined 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description and sampling of sediment and water the kiruna iron ore mine is located in northern sweden lat 67 50 9 long 20 11 7 and is operated by the mining company loussavaara kiirunavaara aktiebolag lkab the annual mean temperature in kiruna is 1 7 c with a mean of 10 c during june august smhi 2018 and the water temperature at the time of sampling was 7 3 c which is close to the annual mean water temperature of 5 8 c 1 5 m above the bottom of the clarification pond a schematic picture of the site is shown in fig s1 in supplementary data ground water is pumped from the mine to the processing plants and from there the water enters a tailings pond 0 63 km2 0 67 106 m3 and subsequently flows to a clarification pond 0 63 km2 2 3 106 m3 surface water runoff precipitation also enters the system precipitation washes out soluble n compounds from the waste rock dumps and this water partly reaches the ground water in the mine via infiltration nilsson and widerlund 2017 most of the water ca 90 is recirculated back from the clarification pond to the processing plant while the rest is discharged to the rakkurijoki system and via the kalix river empties into the bothnian bay baltic sea fig s1 according to the lkab monitoring program 9 10 million m3 of water is annually released into the receiving waters of the rakkurijoki system and the discharged water carries 25 mg n l 1 as no3 the concentration of no3 in the ponds is relatively stable over the year with a mean of 25 mg n l 1 corresponding to a total amount of 16 750 and 57 500 kg n in the tailings and clarification pond respectively the total organic carbon toc in the pond water varies between 2 and 4 mg l 1 for the field study both sediment and water were collected from each of 24 sampling points along depth gradients in the tailings and clarification ponds in september 2014 these samples were collected and analyzed to obtain an initial characterization of the spatial variability of the microbiology and chemistry of the pond system fig 1 coordinates in table s1 for the microcosm experiment additional sediment and water samples were collected from three locations at a representative depth 2 3 m of the clarification pond locations a b c in fig 1 the clarification pond was selected for the microcosm experiment since it is better suited for denitrification due to the higher carbon content to begin with overlaying water was collected from 20 to 30 cm depth at the same locations these three sediment and water samples were pooled separately and hereafter denoted original sediment and microcosm water for collecting the upper 2 5 cm sediment an ekman grab sampler was used and the water samples were collected using a ruttner sampler samples 1 24 in fig 1 or by immersing 20 l plastic containers into the water the microcosm water all sediment samples were kept and transported at 4 8 c before analyses within one week and setting up the microcosm experiment 12 days after sampling the 24 pond water samples were analyzed directly on site for chemical properties lkab accredited analysis laboratory and prepared for chlorophyll a analyses by filtering the filters were transported and kept at 4 c and the microcosm water was shipped to the laboratory by road and frozen upon arrival 2 2 microcosm experiment to allow for respiration of easily available carbon compounds potentially present in the sediment the original sediment was kept at 22 c for 4 days prior to setting up the microcosms for each microcosm 50 g of the original sediment and 150 g of freshly thawed microcosm water was placed in 250 ml bottles to evaluate the effect of different carbon sources 1 ml of sterile solutions containing 18 mg carbon ml 1 corresponding to four times the stoichiometric need for denitrification was added as i sterile algae for preparation see supplementary data ii hydroxyethyl cellulose hec mw 90 000 g mol 1 or iii sodium acetate naac as a control a fourth treatment with only water added was included for each treatment four replicate microcosms were prepared the bottles were sealed with gas tight screw caps with butyl rubber septa and the atmosphere was exchanged to n2 each bottle had a gas outlet via a water trap to a measuring cylinder capturing the gas the microcosms were incubated at a constant temperature of 20 c in a dark room for 69 days to simulate a system with continuous flow and to avoid depletion of no3 or carbon the water was removed twice a week with help of vacuum and replaced by freshly thawed microcosm water stored at 4 c maximum 5 days since frozen and carbon was added as above water chemistry was monitored weekly as described below at the end of the experiment the sediment from each bottle was thoroughly mixed and then divided in four subsamples 2 20 g were stored at 4 c and used within two days for potential denitrification assays 1 2 g were immediately frozen for dna extraction and the rest was used for determining water content 2 3 chemical analyses of sediment and water 2 3 1 pond sediments and water samples the 24 pond sediment samples were analyzed for the total content of the elements n phosphorous p iron fe and s and for organic carbonate and total carbon tc see table s2 for methods dry content of all sediment samples was determined gravimetrically by drying 8 10 g at 105 c the corresponding 24 water samples were analyzed for total amounts of organic carbon toc n tn and phosphorous tp respectively for nh4 no2 and no3 and for the anions sulfate so4 2 fluoride f and chloride cl as well as for ph and alkalinity for chlorophyll a analyses 800 ml of the water were filtered through glass fiber filters see table s1 for methods 2 3 2 microcosm water samples before freezing the water for the microcosm experiment the concentration of the sum of no2 and no3 ions no2 no3 was measured the water sampled weekly from the microcosms was analyzed for ph toc so4 2 nh4 and no2 no3 swedac accredited geochemical laboratory at slu 2 4 gas measurements in the microcosm experiment production of gas was followed daily by noting the total gas volume produced data not shown and twice a week 5 ml of the microcosm head space gas was sampled for analyses of n2o ch4 and co2 the gas samples were analyzed by gas chromatography clarus 500 gc perkinelmer ct usa equipped with electron capture flame ionization and thermal conductivity detectors for n2o ch4 and co2 respectively the gas concentrations were recalculated to production per day taking into account that the microcosms were opened once a week 2 5 potential denitrification rates potential denitrification rates were measured in the 24 pond sediment samples in the original sediment used for the microcosms and in the individual microcosm sediments at the end of the experimental period the rates were determined under anoxic conditions using the acetylene inhibition technique without chloramphenicol pell et al 1996 briefly 20 25 g of wet sediment and 10 ml of sterile deionized water were combined with potassium nitrate kno3 in gas tight bottles to a final concentration of 3 mm the atmosphere was changed to n2 10 v v acetylene was added and the bottles were incubated with constant agitation 175 rpm at 25 c gas samples for n2o analyses were taken at regular intervals during 6 5 h and the potential denitrification rates were calculated from linear regression 3 5 time points of the n2o produced the n2o was analyzed as described in 2 4 activity in the 24 pond sediment samples was determined both with and without carbon addition carbon was added to a final concentration of 210 mg l 1 as a mixture of glucose sodium succinate and sodium acetate molar ratio 2 3 6 in addition potential n2o production rates were determined by incubating the sediments with the carbon mixture but without acetylene in the original sediment used for the microcosms denitrification rates were determined in four replicates under five conditions with i the carbon mixture described above ii iv the three different carbon compounds that was used in the microcosm experiment naac hec sterile algae separately and v with water as a control the activity in microcosm sediments was determined at day 69 under two conditions i with the carbon mixture and ii with the same carbon as it had received during the experimental period 2 6 dna extraction total dna was extracted from 0 4 g of wet sediment using the fastdna spin kit for soil mp biomedicals ca usa following the manufacturer s instructions from two replicates of the original sediment from each of the microcosms at the end of the experiment and from the 24 pond samples the extracted dna was quantified using the broad range double stranded dna kit and the qubit

using hdh previously hzo schmid et al 2008 and dnra using nrfa mohan et al 2004 welsh et al 2014 in the microcosm sediments to estimate the abundance of the total bacterial community the 16s ribosomal rna gene was quantified muyzer et al 1993 two 15 μl reactions per gene were analyzed on independent runs using a biorad cfx connect real time system biorad laboratories ca usa each reaction contained

mitochondria or plastids were filtered out the resulting mapping file was converted into biom format mcdonald et al 2012a and the taxonomic assignments as well as the sample metadata were added to allow downstream analyses using the software r after processing 80 of the sequences were recovered and the resulting dataset had 893 930 sequences and a median sequencing depth of 21 311 rarefaction resulted in 550 876 sequences 13 436 per sample corresponding to 2317 otus the sequences were submitted to the ncbi short read archive and are available under bioproject accession numbers prjna509753

used false discovery rate benjamini and hochberg 1995 3 results 3 1 chemical characterization and potential denitrification rates in the pond system the tailings and clarification ponds differed with respect to the measured chemical parameters fig s2 tables s1 and s2 the samples from the tailings pond were characterized by higher levels of ions nh4 no2 no3 f cl and so4 2 and by lower levels of toc in the water compared to the clarification pond t test all p values 0 001 the lower toc in the tailings pond water was also reflected in a lower content of both toc and tc in the sediment t test p 0 04 and 0 04 in the clarification pond the variation among samples were higher than in the tailings pond but three clusters samples 1 5 6 9 and 10 13 could be distinguished each with specific chemical characteristics fig s2 denitrification in the pond sediments were limited by carbon availability fig 2 a and table s2 under unlimited carbon supply the denitrification rates were significantly higher in both the tailings and the clarification pond p 0 015 and 0 049 respectively neither the rates with only endogenous carbon nor with carbon addition differed between ponds p 0 14 and p 0 09 fig 2a the denitrification end product ratio n2o n2o n2 reflecting the net nitrous oxide production in comparison to the potential denitrification activity was much lower than 1 but did not differ between the ponds p 0 13 fig 2b three samples from each of the ponds were excluded from the analyses due to n2o concentrations below detection limit see table s2 3 2 performance of microcosms denitrification rates toc and n dynamics and gas production the original sediment used in the microcosm experiment had similar potential denitrification rates for all carbon types and the mixture fig 2c dashed line fig 2d open boxes after 10 weeks the potential rates obtained with the carbon mixture had increased significantly in the naac and algae treatments and decreased significantly in the water and hec treatments fig 2c p 0 05 the same was observed for the rates obtained with the specific carbon source added to the different microcosms fig 2d p 0 05 the increase in rates in the naac and algae treatments with the specific carbon source was not significantly different from the increased rates with the carbon mixture p 0 49 and p 0 10 respectively the treatment with algae showed effective no3 removal after five weeks the no2 no3 concentrations in the water were similar to those in the naac treatment which was the most effective with more than 99 removal fig 3 a however nh4 was produced and the concentrations in the algae treatment were orders of magnitudes higher than in the other treatments fig 3b the toc concentration in the water differed between treatments and was relatively stable over the microcosm experiment in each treatment but at day 40 toc decreased in the naac treatment and was nearly fully consumed by day 55 fig 3c in the algae microcosms the toc levels were low during the entire period all treatments resulted in lower ph fig s3 and so4 2 levels fig 3d with a more prominent so4 2 reduction from day 40 in all samples throughout the experiment the water control and the hec amended sediments performed similarly fig 3a d the total volume of gas produced in the microcosms was highest in the algae treatment followed by the naac treatment data not shown despite high variation between replicates overall trends in the production of co2 n2o and ch4 could be detected fig 3e h initially n2o was not detectable in the naac treated microcosms but after six weeks the concentrations increased gas concentrations in the samples from the last day were compared and showed that the algae treatment had significantly higher levels of both ch4 and n2o compared to the hec treatment and water control p 0 05 the production of ch4 correlated with n2o and nh4 concentrations r 0 84 and 0 97 and negatively with no2 no3 r 0 84 there was also a negative correlation between n2o and no2 no3 r 0 81 3 3 gene abundances in the microcosm sediments the size of the total bacterial community 16s rrna gene abundance remained the same in all treatments except in the algae where it was significantly higher p 0 05 at the end of the experiment compared to the original sediment table 1 the functional genes responded differently to the treatments table 1 the denitrification genes nirs and nirk decreased in abundance in the naac treatment but remained at the same level in the other two carbon treatments the nitrous oxide reductase gene noszi increased in all carbon treatments whereas noszii remained at the same level in the hec microcosms and decreased in the others the abundance of the anammox marker gene hdh showed the same pattern as noszii finally nrfa in dnra bacteria increased in the algae microcosms decreased in naac and remained at the same level in hec by looking at the ratios between gene abundances we can see the shifts in functional groups relative to each other across the treatments fig 4 the ratio between the genes in the two processes dnra and denitrification that compete for no3 increased significantly in the algae treatment while this treatment at the same time displayed the lowest ratio between genes involved in n2o reduction and denitrification fig 4 the latter suggest increased capacity for n2o production during denitrification the highest nosz to nir gene ratio was instead detected in the naac treatment the genetic potential for anammox showed a small increase in relation to denitrification in the hec and water control where carbon availability was low the abundance of noszi co2 production and potential denitrification rate correlated with each other 0 96 r 0 97 and the abundance of noszii correlated positively with so4 2 r 0 93 3 4 microbial diversity and community composition in pond and microcosm sediments all sediment communities were dominated by bacteria and the number of archaeal reads comprised less than 0 1 of the total reads six otus were classified as archaea however the primers do not pick up all archaea and miss for example the thaumarcheota takahashi et al 2014 the majority of the otus were shared between the ponds and microcosm samples and only 4 were unique for the pond samples alpha diversity in terms of otu richness shannon and 1 simpson did not differ significantly between the ponds but was highly variable between samples p 0 09 0 99 and 0 77 respectively fig 5 a table s4 in the microcosm experiment the naac and algae amendments resulted in lower diversity whereas it was unaffected in the water control and hec treatments fig 5a the community composition in the tailings pond was unique compared to that in the clarification pond and also to all sediments from the microcosm experiment including the original sediment for setting up the microcosms permanova p 0 05 fig 5b pond communities were dominated by pseudomonadales and flavobacteriales fig 5c with the families pseudomonadaceae and moraxellaceae only present in the ponds and flavobacteriaceae in the sample types characterized by low carbon availability table s5 rhodobacter and sulfuritalea were present in high abundances in the tailings pond table s5 the community composition in the clarification pond was similar to the original sediment for the microcosm experiment that was sampled in that pond which confirms that the sediment used in the experiment was representative for the pond since the communities that had developed in the four different microcosms treatments differed significantly from the original sample we can conclude that the treatment effect was stronger than the incubation effect the treatments were also different from each other with the exception of hec treatment and water control the 20 most abundant otus per pond or treatment comprised a total of 70 otus table s5 some of the dominant otus were restricted to only one sample type and none of them was present in all sample types proteobacterial classes dominated in the acetate fed microcosms whereas the algae treatment had a large proportion of bacteroidia fig 5c of which the genus paludibacter could be identified table s5 in the acetate treatment so4 2 reducing bacteria in the orders desulfobacterales and desulforomonadales were enriched fig 5c and in the algae treatment desulfobacteraceae otu 35 was among the 20 most abundant taxa table s5 at family level three taxa were present in nearly all sample types the gammaproteobacteria sinobacteraceae was found in all but the water treatment the acidimicrobiia family c11 in all but the algae treatment and the deltaproteobacteria syntrophobacteraceae in all but the acetate and the algae treatments table s5 the genus rhodoferax was only found in the hec treatment table s5 4 discussion the initial spatial characterization of the pond system at the lkab mining site in kiruna showed that both the tailings and clarification pond harbored bacterial communities capable of denitrification opposite to our expectations there were no differences in the endogenous denitrification potential in the tailings and clarification ponds despite differences in carbon content chemical characteristics in the sediments and water as well as in the microbial community composition however higher denitrification rates were deteced in samples with higher organic carbon content and these communities had a different composition compared to those with a lower content microbial communities in alkaline ponds at mining sites are not well studied and we cannot conclude if the communities at the kiruna site are representative for these type of systems nevertheless both ponds were dominated by the orders pseudomonadales and flavobacteriales and among abundant taxa in the tailings pond were flavobacteriaceae a diverse family common in aquatic environments and with many members isolated from the polar regions and from oligotrophic systems mcbride et al 2014 mucko et al 2018 nam et al 2017 notably this family was also present in samples characterized by low carbon availability in the present study in accordance with the higher levels of so4 2 and low levels of carbon the tailings pond had high abundances of phototrophic rhodobacter and s oxidizing and denitrifying sulfuritalea sulfur cycling is likely more prominent in the tailings pond and denitrifiers capable of using s compounds as electron donors can potentially contribute to no3 removal when carbon availability is low hang et al 2017 the low carbon availability in the ponds limited the heterotrophic denitrifier community to reach its full potential in terms of activity denitrification in alkaline mine impacted sediments is not well explored but carbon limitation was also shown in stream sediment impacted by acid mine drainage baeseman et al 2006 in general no3 polluted groundwater does not contain enough carbon to support heterotrophic denitrification and reach sufficient n removal and therefore denitrification is often enhanced when mixed with water rich in labile organic carbon liu et al 2017 zarnetske et al 2011 stoliker et al 2016 trauth et al 2018 the microcosm experiment further confirmed that the pond sediments could remove no3 more effectively by increasing the amount of available carbon the absolute rates obtained in the microcosm sediment might however not reflect the true potential since the sediment to water ratio was different from that in the clarification pond we only rely on diffusion for transporting nitrate from the water column to the sediment and the higher incubation temperature could have selected for other microorganisms the relative effect across treatments showed that nearly complete no3 removal was achieved in the microcosms fed with acetate or algae and this coincided with increased potential denitrification rates similarly in sediments polluted with n rich acid mine drainage leachate from willow leaves increased the no3 removal rate baeseman et al 2006 the denitrification rate in the hec treated sediment in the present study was significantly lower after 10 weeks than in the original sediment suggesting depletion of endogenous carbon compounds in the sediment the accumulation of toc in the water during the experiment further supports our conclusion that the complex hec molecule was not an efficient electron donor for the denitrifiers present in the sediment however we cannot rule out that a cellulose degrading community would have established after a longer experimental period that would allow for using cheap carbon substrates like saw dust and wood chips which have been used in denitrifying cellulose based bioreactors treating mining water herbert et al 2014 nordström and herbert 2018 in the microcosms the most striking difference in community composition between the two treatments resulting in increased denitrification was the dominance of proteobacterial classes in the acetate fed microcosms compared to the large proportion of bacteroidia in the algae treatment this is not surprising since acetate can be directly used for denitrification whereas the denitrifiers will depend on degradation and fermentation of more complex carbon amendments performed by other bacteria members of bacteroidales have a fermentative metabolism and other fermentative bacteria detected in the algae treatment were clostridales morrison et al 2017 studied the degradation of the green alga chlorella vulgaris and suggested the involvement of a wide range of bacterial lineages in the degradation including different members of the phylum bacteroidetes e g paludibacter and desulfobacteraceae although the algae treatment was meant to mimic an in situ situation with phytoplankton being mineralized on the sediment surface other carbon compunds are probably released in a real setting compared to when adding autoclaved algae and other taxa involved in fermentation could then be more relevant in the ponds paludibacter present in the algae treatment has previously been found in an enrichment culture from acid mine drainage impacted sediment where it was co enriched together with so4 2 reducing bacteria sánchez andrea et al 2013 in agreement with sánchez andrea et al 2013 and morrison et al 2017 desulfobacteraceae otu 35 was also among the 20 most abundant taxa in the algae treatment other even more abundant so4 2 reducing bacteria were enriched in the acetate treatment which coincided with higher so4 2 reduction and a characteristic smell of hydrogen sulfide compared to the other treatments this was likely due to the efficient no3 removal in these microcosms resulting in more reduced conditions at the end of each water batch period the genetic potential for denitrification in terms of nir gene abundance suggest that bacteria with denitrification capacity dominated among the communities that could be involved in no3 reduction in all microcosms after 10 weeks the relative abundance of the anammox marker gene was low and this process likely did not contribute to the overall no3 removal however the abundance of nrfa genes suggest that dnra could be an alternative pathway for no3 reduction occurring simultaneously with denitrification and causing n retention rather than removal similar to natural sediments franklin et al 2017 kim et al 2016 song et al 2014 the genetic potential for this process increased in relation to denitrification in the algae treatment although the genetic potential for denitrification was still higher the degrading algae probably increased the carbon content over time and caused more reduced conditions in the sediment as indicated by the high ch4 production in these microcosms this would explain the relative increase in nrfa abundance as dnra bacteria have been shown to be promoted in estuarine sediments with more reduced conditions and higher c n ratios song et al 2014 and also in soils with higher c no3 ratios putz et al 2018 thus dnra could have contributed to the production of nh4 observed in the algae supplemented microcosms although nh4 probably also originated from mineralization of the algae cells additionally dnra bacteria have a versatile metabolism and some are capable of both dnra and fermentation cole and brown 1980 at high c n ratios it has been shown that the relative importance of fermentative dnra increases van den berg et al 2017 the reduced conditions created in the algae microcosms might be a driver for such reactions although the data in this study does not allow us to make that conclusion irrespective of treatment the genetic potential for n2o reduction was always lower than that for the no2 reduction step in denitrification this indicates an imbalance between organisms that can produce n2o in relation to those that can reduce this potent greenhouse gas such discrepancies have been shown to affect emissions of n2o domeignoz horta et al 2016 philippot et al 2011 the original sediment representing the natural conditions at the site also had low nosz nir gene ratios and the potential n2o production and denitrification rates in the ponds indicate that n2o can constitute 15 of the end product from denitrification similar to our study low nosz nir gene ratios have been observed in a bioreactor treating nitrate rich water from another iron ore mine herbert et al 2014 in the microcosm experiment the nosz nir gene ratio was lowest in the algae treatment and this was also the treatment that had the highest production of n2o during the experiment in the ponds the samples with the highest n2o end product ratio and also high denitrification rates were the shallow samples in the clarification pond samples 6 7 and 8 with the highest amount of toc in the overlaying water the algae microcosms also had the highest ch4 production and overall our results suggest that supporting n removal by using algae could increase emissions of greenhouse gases it will be important to consider how to prevent emissions of both ch4 and n2o when implementing enhanced n removal in ponds treating n polluted mining waters the current no3 removal capacity in the ponds cannot meet the desired effluent standards to support good ecological status of recipient lakes if we assume that there is no denitrification activity in the water column and that denitrification occurs in the upper 2 cm of the sediment denitrification could yearly remove 15 000 and 47 000 kg n in the tailings and clarification pond respectively considering 25 c and unlimited carbon and no3 supply this corresponds to about 90 and 80 of the total amount of n in the ponds however the temperature in the ponds at the mining site is much lower than in our experiment and the actual rates are expected to be lower although denitrification in lake sediments occurs throughout the year e g aalto et al 2018 ahlgren et al 1994 rissanen et al 2011 to speculate reducing the rate to only a fourth because of the 20 difference in water temperature between laboratory and field conditions about 20 av the n could be removed nevertheless the increased denitrification capacity and significant changes in community composition observed in the microcosms after being supplemented with carbon compounds suggest that the sediment could be adapted and perform better this shows that there is a potential for increasing denitrification and n removal capacity in the sediments 5 conclusions talings and clarifications ponds with neutral to alkaline water at iron ore mining sites could increase their nitrate removal capacity via denitrification by allowing adaption of the system to supplemental carbon compounds however the type of carbon supplied needs to be considered as it affected the bacterial community composition and functional groups involved in different nitrate reduction pathways for example green algae as a carbon source for denitrification caused unwanted communities and processes like an increase in dnra bacteria and ammonium accumulation and increased emissions of the greenhouse gases ch4 and n2o overall there was also an imbalance between functional groups capable of truncated denitrification ending with n2o and those capable of n2o reduction in the sediments the risk of swopping nitrate loadings to greenhouse gas emissions should be assessed when implementing

18806,according to the dutch drinking water act of 2011 dutch drinking water suppliers must conduct a quantitative microbial risk assessment qmra for infection by the following index pathogens enterovirus campylobacter cryptosporidium and giardia at least once every four years in order to assess the microbial safety of drinking water the health based target for safe drinking water is set at less than one infection per 10 000 persons per year at evides water company concern has arisen whether their drinking water treatment mainly based on uv inactivation and chlorine dioxide reduces levels of adenovirus adv sufficiently the main objective was therefore to conduct a qmra for adv estimates of the adv concentrations in source water were based on enumeration of total adv by integrated cell culture pcr iccpcr most probable number pcr mpnpcr and quantitative pcr qpcr and on enumeration of adv40 41 by mpnpcr and qpcr adv40 41 represents a large fraction of total adv and only a small fraction of adv is infectious 1 1700 by comparison of literature data and plant scale data somatic coliphages appeared a good conservative indicator for adv disinfection by uv irradiation similarly bacteriophage ms2 appeared to be a good conservative indicator for disinfection by chlorine dioxide literature data on the efficiency of chlorine dioxide disinfection were fitted with the extended hom model chlorine dioxide disinfection at low initial concentrations 0 05 0 1 mg l was found to be the major treatment step providing sufficient treatment on its own for compliance with the health based target uv disinfection of adv at 40 mj cm2 or 73 mj cm2 was insufficient without chlorine dioxide disinfection graphical abstract image 1 keywords adenovirus chlorine dioxide disinfection drinking water pcr qmra 1 introduction according to the dutch drinking water act of 2011 dutch drinking water suppliers must conduct a quantitative microbial risk assessment qmra for the so called index pathogens enterovirus campylobacter cryptosporidium and giardia at least once every four years in order to assess the microbial safety of drinking water anonymous 2011 in this qmra the health based target for microbiologically safe drinking water is set at less than one infection per 10 000 persons per year thereby following the world health organization who guidelines for drinking water quality who 2017 it is not feasible to conduct a qmra for every waterborne pathogen therefore index pathogens were chosen if a drinking water treatment is effective in removing the index pathogens the drinking water is considered to be safe nevertheless in specific situations this might not be the case at evides water company concern has arisen whether their drinking water treatment reduces levels of adenovirus adv sufficiently in the source water water from a storage reservoir that is taken in for drinking water production adv concentrations are highest from january to april adv is known to be more persistent to uv radiation than enteroviruses the selected index viral pathogen hijnen et al 2006 uv radiation and chlorine dioxide final treatment step are the major treatment steps employed by evides at the drinking water treatment plant dwtp berenplaat adv is widespread in nature infecting birds mammals and amphibians to date 90 genotypes of human adenoviruses have been identified based on whole genome sequencing ismail et al 2018 human adenoviruses have been classified into seven groups a g on the basis of their physical chemical and biological properties wold and ison 2013 adenoviruses consist of a double stranded dna genome in a non enveloped icosahedral capsid with a diameter of about 80 nm and unique fibres human adenoviruses cause a wide range of infections with a spectrum of clinical manifestations including the gastrointestinal tract the respiratory tract the urinary tract and the eyes brandt et al 1969 bon et al 1999 oh et al 2003 rodriguez baez et al 2002 serotypes 40 and 41 are a major cause of gastroenteritis worldwide notably in developing communities however little is known about the presence of these enteric adenoviruses in water sources largely because they are not detectable by conventional cell culture who 2017 who 2017 classifies adv as having moderate health significance long persistence moderate resistance to chlorine and high infectivity the main objective was to conduct a qmra for adv in the drinking water produced at dwpt berenplaat in general qmra for a waterborne pathogen in drinking water consists of determining the pathogen concentration in the source water its removal by treatment using data on the removal of the pathogen or of a representative indicator organism using drinking water consumption data and a dose response relationship who 2017 for the adenovirus qmra at berenplaat estimates of the concentrations in source water were based on total adv concentrations as determined by integrated cell culture pcr infectious virus particles and by most probable number pcr and quantitative pcr infectious as well as non infectious virus particles and on adv40 41 concentrations as determined by most probable number pcr and quantitative pcr here it was an additional objective to compare pcr data generated as most probable numbers with those generated as genome copies on the one hand inhibition of polymerase causes underestimation with quantitative pcr but not with most probable number pcr on the other hand aggregates of virus particles cause underestimation with most probable number pcr but not with quantitative pcr in the qmra for enterovirus as is conducted in the netherlands by the drinking water companies f specific rna bacteriophages or somatic coliphages are the default indicator organisms for determining the efficiency of treatment steps in the drinking water production to remove enteroviruses schijven et al 2011 the data on these indicators were used to determine removal efficiency by coagulation followed by sludge blanket clarification and rapid double layered filtration sand anthracite in order to estimate the efficiency of uv radiation somatic coliphage concentration measurements were conducted at plant scale and compared with literature data on disinfection of adv by uv in order to evaluate somatic coliphages as surrogate for uv disinfection of adv in addition the efficiency of medium pressure lamps emitting an uv dose of 40 mj cm2 and 73 mj cm2 were compared estimating the efficiency of chlorine dioxide disinfection relied on data from literature and additional laboratory experiments in order to evaluate ms2 bacteriophage as a surrogate for chlorine dioxide disinfection of adv because of a notable seasonal variation of adv concentrations in the source water and a different dosage of chlorine dioxide during winter time october march and summer time april september all source water concentration data and all treatment data were split into winter and summer time data and distributions were fitted to winter and summer data separately effectivity of the drinking water treatment was evaluated on the basis of the contribution of uv irradiation and chlorine dioxide disinfection to the total treatment 2 drinking water treatment description dwtp berenplaat provides 100 million m³ of drinking water each year and supplies water to a large proportion of rotterdam s homes and companies river meuse water is stored in the biesbosch storage reservoirs with an average retention time of five months to improve its chemical and biological quality by natural processes such as degradation and sedimentation about 12 000 m3 h of this water is transported to dwtp berenplaat where it passes a short water abstraction channel prior to treatment pathogen concentrations in berenplaat petrusplaat the final biesbosch storage reservoir water are the starting point for qmra berenplaat water first passes micro sieves mesh size 35 μm and is then treated by coagulation sludge blanket clarification and rapid double layered filtration the major disinfection takes place in two parallel arrays of medium pressure uv lamps one at 40 mj cm2 and the other at 73 mj cm2 it is assumed that the uv lamps provide a constant dose the setpoint uv dose for the target disinfection capacity is continuously maintained in the reactor by automatic adjustment of the uv lamps power setting i e emission intensity according to variations in operating conditions such as influent water quality uv transmission and flow rate after uv treatment the water passes granular activated carbon filters hijnen et al 2010 found no removal of bacteriophage ms2 by granular activated carbon filters at pilot plant scale at this dwtp hence this treatment step is considered to be irrelevant in the qmra for adv the final treatment consists of disinfection with 0 1 mg l chlorine dioxide in summer and 0 05 mg l chlorine dioxide in winter the finished water is stored in closed reservoirs prior to distribution 3 materials and methods 3 1 adenovirus enumeration throughout this document total adv is referred to as advtot adv40 and adv41 are

enumerations were conducted advtoticc advtotmpn advtotq adv40 41mpn and adv40 41q 3 2 sampling and concentration by uf thirty five samples of water approximately 600 l were collected from the final storage reservoir prior to drinking water treatment and concentrated by a conventional filter adsorption elution method as previously described rutjes et al 2009 briefly magnesium chloride was added to the water sample to a final concentration of 0 05 m to enable the formation of a virus magnesium complex by reducing the ph to 3 8 with 0 5 m hcl these complexes adsorb to a negatively charged cartridge filter with a nominal pore size of 1 2 μm viruses were eluted from the filter with an elution buffer of ph 9 0 and were neutralized with a concentrated acetic acid buffer ph 5 0 resulting in a final eluate with a ph of approximately 7 4 the eluate was further concentrated by ultrafiltration uf using a cellulose acetate filter nmwl 10 000 under high pressure 3 bar rutjes et al 2005 the final uf concentrate volume was usually between 50 and 75 ml and sometimes up to 250 ml the concentrate was stored at 70 c until further use 3 3 advtoticc human adv 2 was kindly provided by the group

analyzed uf concentrate antibiotic mixtures were incubated on a549 cells for 1 h at 37 c with 1 ml inoculum of uf concentrate every time one flask was not inoculated to serve as a negative control then cell cultures were washed 3 times with warmed phosphate buffered saline and 5 ml of warmed 1 mem containing 2 fetal calf serum was added per sample three flasks inoculated with undiluted sample were immediately frozen t0 the other flasks and the negative control flask were further incubated for 5 days at 37 c followed by storage at 70 c until further use for pcr enumeration virus stocks were obtained by three freeze thaw cycles of infected cells and subsequent centrifugation at 1500g for 5 min of each supernatant 140 μl was used for nucleic acid extraction nucleic acid was extracted using the nuclisens minimag magnetic extraction kit biomérieux zaltbommel the netherlands following the manufacturer s instructions with minor modifications in each extraction cycle a negative control

hexon and fiber gene respectively 3 7 somatic coliphages enumeration influent and effluent samples of the first three treatment steps coagulation sludge blanket clarification rapid sand filtration and uv disinfection 40 and 73 mj cm2 were collected weekly to monthly from 2009 to 2012 for enumeration of somatic coliphages according to iso 10705 2 2000 sample sizes varied from 0 03 l to 40 l for coagulation sludge blanket clarification from 0 1 l to 160 l for rapid sand filtration and from 0 1 l to 1900 l for uv disinfection 4 data analysis all computational analyses were conducted using mathematica version 11 1 1 0 wolfram inc illinois 4 1 scenarios twelve risk assessments were conducted namely using the virus source concentrations of advtoticc adv40 41mpn and adv40 41q applying a uv dose of 40 mj cm2 or 73 mj cm2 and with or without chlorine dioxide disinfection 4 2 virus source concentration estimation best estimates of most probable numbers per sample were used to calculate sample concentrations to which subsequently gamma distributions were fitted schijven et al 2011 to the data from qpcr enumeration genome copies per litre a negative binomial distribution was fitted from which a gamma distributed concentration was derived as described by schijven et al 2011 to the paired positive advtoticc and advtotmpn samples as well as to the paired positive advtoticc and advtotq samples beta distributions were fitted as described for determining recovery efficiency by schijven et al 2011 these beta distributions represent the fractions of infectious virus particles based on either mpnpcr or qpcr data for each gamma distribution winter and summer ten thousand monte carlo mc samples were generated mc samples of infectious adv40 41 virus particles were calculated by multiplying the gamma distributed concentration data of adv40 41mpn and adv40 41q with the beta distributed fractions of infectious virus particles based on mpnpcr and qpcr data respectively for comparing with other fractions of infectious virus particles literature data on enumeration of rotavirus by means of iccpcr and mpnpcr in samples from the river meuse rutjes et al 2009 and enterovirus lodder et al 2015 by means of tissue culture and mpnpcr were collected and their ratio was determined by fitting a beta distribution as well as described here above 4 3 estimation of treatment efficiency using plant scale somatic coliphage data for the first three treatment steps coagulation sludge blanket clarification rapid sand filtration and uv disinfection 40 and 73 mj cm2 beta distributions were fitted to the winter and summer influent and effluent unpaired raw data for each of these treatments to characterize the fraction of virus particles passing treatment as described in detail for qmraspot schijven et al 2011 4 4 uv disinfection in order to evaluate somatic coliphage as a surrogate for adv the plant scale disinfection of somatic coliphages was compared with literature data on disinfection of adv the literature data were taken from guo et al 2010 and linden et al 2007 for medium pressure uv lamps the data from guo et al 2010 encompass the uv doses in the range of 65 90 mj cm2 to obtain 4 log10 disinfection the data from linden et al 2007 add log10 disinfection data at the lower uv doses of 13 and 28 mj cm2 the relation between uv dose and log10 disinfection is horizontally asymptotic hence a logistic function was fitted to these data using nonlinearmodelfit in mathematica here it was assumed that the uncertainty of the log10 disinfection followed a normal distribution model prediction provided the distribution parameters for log10 disinfection at uv doses of 40 and 73 mj cm2 4 5 chlorine dioxide disinfection parameter estimation data for virus disinfection by chlorine dioxide were available from thurston enriquez et al 2005 for adv40 41 and from hornstra et al 2011 and from hornstra 2014 for ms2 the data from thurston enriquez et al 2005 were obtained by reading the normalised concentration data from the published graph because the original data were not available anymore to all these data the extended hom model haas and joffe 1994 was fitted 1 l o g 10 n t l o g 10 n 0 k c 0 n t m η l n 10 ε where n t is the virus concentration litre 1 at time t min n 0 is the initial virus concentration litre 1 c 0 is the initial chlorine dioxide concentration mg l k is the virus inactivation rate coefficient min 1 m determines the time dependency of the virus disinfection n is the dependency on the disinfectant concentration and ε represents uncertainty efficiency factor η corrects for the loss of disinfectant 2 η m ψ m γ m 0 ψ where γ is the generalised incomplete gamma function and ψ is 3 ψ n k t where k is the first order rate coefficient of chlorine dioxide decay min 1 all experiments on disinfection of ms2 by hornstra et al 2011 were conducted under identical physico chemical conditions therefore it was assumed that the values for k m and n were the same for all these experiments only c 0 varied 0 005 mg l 0 5 mg l the experimental temperature was 0 c in addition hornstra 2014 conducted disinfection experiments with a c 0 of 0 06 mg l and 0 16 mg l at 5 c using water from the berenplaat the thurston data for adv40 were conducted at c 0 values of about 0 5 mg l at 5 c and 15 c and at ph 6 and 8 for a given c 0 and k one needs to estimate values for k m and n by fitting the extended hom model to virus concentration data decreasing non linearly in time it can easily be shown that there is no unique solution therefore some assumptions needed to be made it is common knowledge that virus inactivation is very much determined by virus type temperature and ph e g bertrand et al 2012 schijven et al 2016 hence k was assumed to depend on virus type ms2 and adv on temperature and on ph accordingly a common k value was estimated for ms2 from the data of hornstra et al 2011 another common k value for ms2 from the data of hornstra 2014 and four k values for the disinfection experiments with adv40 by thurston enriquez et al 2005 furthermore it was assumed that m was dependent only on virus type both viruses have a protein mantle of which the outer chemical groups mainly consist of carboxyl and amino groups suggesting that the reaction mechanism between chlorine dioxide and the virus particles was the same for both viruses and that consequently a common value of n was applicable to all disinfection data subsequently having estimated all these parameter values ms2 was evaluated as a surrogate for chlorine dioxide disinfection of adv by predicting disinfection of both ms2 and adv under the same conditions ph temperature and clo2 concentration finally multivariate regression analysis with temperature and ph as covariates was conducted to develop an empirical formula to predict k for ms2 at 15 c 4 6 prediction of chlorine dioxide disinfection at plant scale the prediction of virus reduction by chlorine dioxide disinfection at plant scale was based on the decay rate of the chlorine dioxide residual at plant scale including its variability at plant scale chlorine dioxide is continuously injected into the effluent of activated carbon filtration the time before the water enters the drinking water storage tanks is on average 4 4 min in summer and 6 3 min in winter because of the continuous injection it is assumed that the chlorine dioxide concentration in the activated carbon effluent remained constant prior to entering the storage tanks in the storage tanks the water follows a labyrinth i e passes the tanks in pulse flow with a shortest residence time of 154 min in summer and 226 min in winter in the storage tanks chlorine dioxide gradually decays chlorine dioxide decay was monitored in berenplaat water at 20 c representing summer time and a c 0 value of 0 103 mg l and proceeded first order 4 l n c t l n c 0 k t parameter k was estimated by means of linear regression chlorine dioxide decay in berenplaat water was also monitored at 5 c to represent winter time this was done for three c 0 values 0 052 0 103 and 0 151 mg l the chlorine dioxide decay proceeded initially faster than thereafter and hence was fitted to a weibull distribution 5 l n c t l n c 0 k t β where β is a shape parameter parameter values were obtained from maximum likelihood estimation for the summer period the logarithmic concentration reduction of virus by chlorine dioxide disinfection was predicted using equations 1 3 for the winter period the logarithmic concentration reduction of virus by chlorine dioxide disinfection was predicted using equations 1 2 and 6 6 ψ n k t β minimal exposure times to chlorine dioxide in summer and in winter were used to predict the logarithmic concentration reduction of virus including uncertainty ε 4 7 exposure and risk of infection exposure to the index pathogens is given as the dose d the number of ingested adenoviruses per person per day and was calculated by multiplying the monte carlo samples of their concentration in berenplaat water c source treatment z i four treatment steps and consumption data w divided by the recovery of the samples r 7 d c s o u r c e 1 r i 1 4 z i w drinking water consumption w was assumed to be lognormal distributed with parameters μ 1 85779 and σ 1 07487 for the netherlands corresponding to a mean of 0 27 l per person per day schijven et al 2011 thus doses were calculated for the winter and summer period the exact beta poisson dose response model was used with sets of parameter values representing uncertainty and variability in the infectivity of ingested adv teunis et al 2016 it was assumed that infectivity of total adv and of adv40 and 41 fit into this generalised dose response relationship 8 p i n f p e r s

uncertainty and variability of infectivity infection risk per person per year was calculated from the monte carlo samples of the daily infection risk by first combining the winter and summer daily infection risks applying equation 7 10 000 times for each day in a year random sample from the combined daily infection risks to obtain 365 monte carlo sample distributions which are then multiplied

concentrations of total adv as enumerated with iccpcr mpnpcr and qpcr as well as of adv40 41 as enumerated with mpnpcr and qpcr clearly in the first quarter of the year 2012 virus concentrations reached peak values during the second and third quarter of the year denoted as summer total adv was detected 4 times using cell culture but was below detection limit for the molecular based detection methods in all summer samples advtot was not detected in only one summer sample viruses were detected using the adv40 41 specific pcr and is line with the theoretical limit of detection lod for these methods based on differences in analyzed volumes detection probability will increase when analyzed volumes increase the theoretical lod by molecular methods is 1 viral dna genome per analyzed volume of sample which varied in our case between 9 ml and 113 ml of source water the volumes studied by iccpcr varied from 52 l to 391 l resulting in a theoretical lod of 1 infectious particle in several hundreds of litres of source waters indicating that the theoretical lod may be orders of magnitude lower also depending on the ratio of infectious particle viral genome also variability between concentrations in qpcr samples is larger than in mpnpcr the qpcr data contain occasionally very high concentration values not found by mpn the latter does not discriminate between a high or a low virus count in a single pcr reaction well table 1 summarizes the corresponding distribution parameter values that describe the gamma distributed virus concentrations for the winter and summer period table 2 lists the distribution parameter values of the beta distributions that describe the fraction of infectious virus particles as determined from the total adv data the fraction of infectious virus particles was on average 5 9 10 4 3 2 log10 or 1 1700 of the virus particles enumerated by mpnpcr as well as by qpcr see also fig 1b and c table 2 also includes the concentrations of infectious adv40 41 as predicted from the total adv concentrations and the corresponding fraction of infectious virus particles for comparison table 2 also includes the parameters of the beta distribution describing the fraction of infectious rotavirus particles iccpcr and mpnpcr as determined by rutjes et al 2009 and of enterovirus cell culture and mpnpcr as determined by lodder et al 2015 on average 1 100 of enumerated rv particles was infectious this is 17 times higher than as estimated for adv the distribution describing the fraction of infectious rv is wider than that of adv on average 1 25 of enumerated enterovirus particles was infectious with distribution similarly wide as that for rv note that the enterovirus samples were collected from different river water locations from 1987 till 2012 table 2 also includes the parameters of the beta distribution describing the fraction of adv40 41 of advtot particles see also fig 1j and k according to the mpnpcr enumeration this fraction was on average 0 5 0 3 log10 varying from 0 2 to 0 8 and according to the qpcr enumeration this fraction was on average 0 36 0 44 log10 varying from 0 008 to 0 9 for being able to fit the beta distribution those data where adv40 41 was detected but advtot not and where the concentration of ad40 41 was higher than advtot were omitted see footnote table 2 near the detection limit a few viruses detected differences in sensitivity of the qpcr using different primers for adv40 41 and advtot may result in finding apparently more adv40 41 than advtot when comparing mpnpcr with qpcr see fig 1f and i it appears only when peak values in the qpcr enumeration occur qpcr concentration values are higher than mpnpcr concentrations otherwise mpnpcr concentration values are about a factor two higher than qpcr concentration values 5 2 coagulation rapid sand filtration table 3 lists the parameter values of the beta distributions that represent the fraction of somatic coliphages that were able to pass these treatments based on enumeration data of somatic coliphages in plant scale samples the first two treatment steps contribute little to virus removal coagulation sludge blanket clarification was more efficient in winter whereas rapid filtration was inefficient in winter 5 3 uv disinfection table 3 also lists the parameter values of the beta distributions that represent the fraction of somatic coliphages that were able to pass uv disinfection either at 40 mj cm2 or 73 mj cm2 based on enumeration data of somatic coliphages in plant scale samples the distribution for the summer data with 73 mj cm2 is very skewed to the left due to more non detects in the effluent water fig 2 predicts the log10 reduction of adv by uv disinfection based on the literature data listed in table 4 at 40 mj cm2 and 73 mj cm2 the predicted log10 reductions are 3 3 0 1 and 4 0 0 1 the reductions of somatic coliphages as determined at plant scale were on average a bit lower suggesting that somatic coliphages may be less sensitive towards uv disinfection than adv or that plant scale conditions were less optimal for uv treatment indicating that the fluence may have been lower than anticipated the beta distribution for the reductions of the somatic coliphages by uv disinfection at plant scale reflects variability the latter in combination with the lower sensitivity towards uv disinfection as well as the uncertainty inherent to the sparse literature data on uv disinfection of adv justified the use of the plant scale somatic coliphage data for the risk assessment 5 4 chlorine dioxide disinfection the conditions and estimated model parameter values for each disinfection experiment are included in fig 3 fig 3 shows the observed and fitted log10 reductions by chlorine dioxide from hornstra et al 2011 that were aimed at determining disinfection of bacteriophage ms2 at low initial chlorine dioxide concentrations c0 is 0 0049 mg l 0 45 mg l all at 0 c and ph 7 2 3a 3h of bacteriophage ms2 at two low initial chlorine dioxide concentrations 0 059 mg l and 0 16 mg l and at 5 c and ph 7 8 to mimic the plant scale conditions in winter 3i and 3j hornstra 2014 and of adv at higher chlorine dioxide concentrations 0 47 mg l 0 53 mg l at 5 c and 15 c and ph 6 and ph 8 3k 3n from thurston enriquez et al 2005 as shown the data were fitted satisfactorily by maximum likelihood estimation at higher temperature disinfection of ms2 increased the two bottom left figures compare disinfection of ms2 with that of adv by predicting ms2 disinfection at the conditions observed for adv and vice versa it shows that ms2 was more persistent to chlorine dioxide than adv extrapolation of adv disinfection at the plant scale conditions was considered too uncertain therefore prediction of disinfection of ms2 as a conservative indicator was applied standard deviation ε was 0 44 the predicted value of k of ms2 at 15 c was 13 7 min 1 in the winter time chlorine dioxide decay in berenplaat water followed a weibull distribution with k 0 065 min 1 and β 0 42 in the summer time the decay proceeded first order with k 0 017 this led to a predicted log10 reduction by chlorine dioxide disinfection of 6 8 5 9 7 6 in winter time and of 14 4 13 5 15 2 in summer time table 3 5 5 total treatment table 3 also includes the means 5 percentiles and 95 percentiles of the log10 reduction of the four total treatment scenarios it clearly shows that chlorine dioxide disinfection is the major treatment step for adv removal 5 6 infection risks fig 4 shows the box whisker plots of the infection risks per person per year for all twelve scenarios four treatments scenarios with advtoticc adv40 41mpn and adv40 41q for the treatment scenarios including chlorine dioxide disinfection risks were far below 10 4 the infection risks with the treatment scenario that includes a uv dose of 40 mj cm2 as well as chlorine dioxide disinfection are for all viral methods at least five orders in magnitude below the 10 4 risk switching to a uv dose of 73 mj cm2 shifts the risks another 1 5 log10 further down in the treatment scenarios without chlorine dioxide disinfection the 10 4 risk level is always exceeded the large range of the box whiskers with the treatment of 73 mj cm2 is a consequence of the wider beta distribution for uv disinfection at this dose with respect to the multibarrier principle on the one hand this indicates that total failure of chlorine dioxide disinfection leads to non compliance with the health based target on the other hand chlorine dioxide disinfection alone provides adequate treatment 6 discussion 6 1 source concentration estimation detection of infectious viral pathogens in environmental samples usually uses mammalian cell culture methods it is generally known that cell culture assays will underestimate the viral concentration in the sample since not all viral strains will be detected with similar efficiencies if detected at all jiang 2006 detecting adenoviruses by cell culture infectivity is usually challenging due to the inconsistent onset of viral induced cytopathic effect which is overcome by combining the use of cell culture with pcr iccpcr as has been used in the current paper although in several papers cell lines have been described that aim to improve detection of enteric adenoviruses polston et al 2015 detection of environmental isolates is still challenging which made us decide to use the approach described in current paper it was estimated that the fraction of infectious adv particles was on average 1 1700 by mpnpcr and qpcr by comparison the fraction of infectious rv was on average 1 100 in mpnpcr rutjes et al 2009 and that for infectious enterovirus was on average 1 25 in mpnpcr lodder et al 2015 the fraction of infectious virus particles may depend on virus type water matrix and time rv was enumerated in samples from the river meuse whereas adv was enumerated in water from a storage reservoir fed with water from the river meuse residence time in the three successive biesbosch storage reservoirs is five months on average the detected adv may therefore have been longer in the environment following discharge with wastewater than the detected rv and hence there was more time for virus inactivation another comparison between qpcr and tissue culture enumeration was made by de roda husman et al 2009 where inactivation of poliovirus 1 and a coxsackie virus b4 was monitored for a period of one year in artificial groundwater and artificial surface water at 4 c and at 22 c the fraction of infectious virus was initially about 1 100 and decreased to 1 10000 or less depending on virus type matrix temperature and time this range encompasses that of the 90 interval estimated for the fraction of infectious total adv qmra based on genome copy concentrations of a virus in the source water may therefore overestimate the risk by two to four orders in magnitude in this study the fraction of infectious total adv particles in total adv particles was used to estimate infectious adv40 41 particle concentrations depending on mpnpcr or qpcr the fraction adv40 41 particles in total adv was estimated to average 0 36 10 0 44 0 50 10 0 30 for the observed ad40 41 concentrations that were lower than the observed total adv concentrations table 2 although this fraction varies given the fact that 90 types of adenoviruses based on whole genome sequencing have been described ismail et al 2018 the fraction of 0 36 0 50 seems surprisingly high the relative high fraction of adv40 41 may be explained by the fact that the enteric group f adenoviruses may be more stable than viruses in other adv groups adv40 41 have been shown to be the dominating serotypes in environmental water samples by hartmann et al 2013 although their results indicate that some other serotypes may be stable enough to be detected up to weeks after contamination as well the fact that in some samples adv40 41 were detected in the absence of advtot may be explained by a combination of the low virus concentrations in the source waters approaching the detection limit and the high fraction of adv40 41 differences in detection limit may also be ascribed to using different target genes for detection of advtot hexon gene and adv40 41 fiber gene quantification of viruses in surface waters or other environmental samples is challenging because of the complex character of the matrix virus concentrations in source waters for drinking water production are known to be generally low and may be close to or below detection levels moreover as reviewed by schrader et al 2012 environmental samples are known to contain substances that may inhibit nucleic acid extraction and pcr inhibitors are a very heterogeneous group of chemical substances one matrix may contain different inhibitory substances and the same inhibitors can be found in many different environmental but also clinical matrices organic as well as inorganic substances which may be dissolved or solid can appear as extraction of pcr inhibitors nucleases may degrade template nucleic acids schrader et al 2012 having a negative effect on the extraction or nucleic acids present in the sample may compete for target rna or dna attachment to the isolating raisin rutjes et al 2005 calcium ions are an example of inorganic substances with inhibitory effects on the pcr however most of the known inhibitors are organic compounds examples are polysaccharides humic acids tannic acid as well as different proteins such as proteinases schrader et al 2012 the presence of these inhibitory substances may complicate quantification based upon a standard curve amplified by pcr in optimal reaction conditions although in theory inhibition could be quantified using proper amplification controls d agostino et al 2011 a qpcr hadv validation study for quantitation of hadv genome copies in berry fruit demonstrated that the level of between laboratory variation was too great to be able to describe the performance characteristics of the method in quantitative terms this is despite the fact that nucleic acid standard solutions were supplied along with the trial materials the high between laboratory variation may be caused by several factors such as the condition in which the standard solutions have reached the partner institutes operational differences between thermocyclers used in the various laboratories but also the differences in berries d agostino et al 2012 this study highlighted the vulnerability of quantification based on an external standard in addition viruses may not be homogeneously distributed in the sample but be present partly as aggregates the occasional high concentrations detected by qpcr suggest this when such aggregates are sampled qpcr may lead to overestimation of virus concentrations although qpcr data appeared to have occasional high outliers not present in the mpnpcr data fig 1d i these outliers appeared to have little or no effect on the final distributions of the infection risks 6 2 uv disinfection comparing literature data on uv disinfection of adv with those of somatic coliphages as determined from plant scale data indicated that the latter were more persistent suggesting that somatic coliphages are a good indicator for uv disinfection of adv although a uv dose of 73 mj cm2 is more efficient than a uv dose of 40 mj cm2 a failing chlorine dioxide disinfection would still lead to insufficient treatment 6 3 chlorine dioxide disinfection literature data on the efficiency of chlorine dioxide to disinfect adv and bacteriophage ms2 were used to predict disinfection of adv at the low concentrations of chlorine dioxide as applied at the dwtp it showed that under the assumption of the same kinetics that disinfection is more efficient at higher temperature and obviously with higher disinfectant concentration and also at higher ph ms2 appeared to be less sensitive than adv because the disinfection data of ms2 were near to the plant scale conditions it is more appropriate to predict ms2 disinfection than adv disinfection and thus to use ms2 as a process indicator clearly a low chlorine dioxide concentration as applied here appeared to be highly efficient and is the major treatment step at this dwtp for the reduction of adv 6 4 risk and uncertainty it may be stated that the risk estimates were conservative because somatic coliphages and bacteriophage ms2 appeared to be more persistent to uv and chlorine dioxide disinfection respectively than adv 7 conclusions adv40 41 represents a large fraction of total adv and only a small fraction of adv is infectious on average 1 1700 somatic coliphages have been shown to be a good indicator for uv disinfection of adv and bacteriophage ms2 for chlorine dioxide disinfection of adv according to the qmra the drinking water at dwtp berenplaat is compliant with the legal health based target for adv this paper provides the first description of the application of chlorine dioxide in drinking water production at the low initial concentrations of 0 05 mg l and 0 1 mg l which nevertheless appeared to be very effective in the reduction of adv chlorine dioxide was the dominant treatment step for adv at this dwtp acknowledgments arno swart and harold van den berg from the

18806,according to the dutch drinking water act of 2011 dutch drinking water suppliers must conduct a quantitative microbial risk assessment qmra for infection by the following index pathogens enterovirus campylobacter cryptosporidium and giardia at least once every four years in order to assess the microbial safety of drinking water the health based target for safe drinking water is set at less than one infection per 10 000 persons per year at evides water company concern has arisen whether their drinking water treatment mainly based on uv inactivation and chlorine dioxide reduces levels of adenovirus adv sufficiently the main objective was therefore to conduct a qmra for adv estimates of the adv concentrations in source water were based on enumeration of total adv by integrated cell culture pcr iccpcr most probable number pcr mpnpcr and quantitative pcr qpcr and on enumeration of adv40 41 by mpnpcr and qpcr adv40 41 represents a large fraction of total adv and only a small fraction of adv is infectious 1 1700 by comparison of literature data and plant scale data somatic coliphages appeared a good conservative indicator for adv disinfection by uv irradiation similarly bacteriophage ms2 appeared to be a good conservative indicator for disinfection by chlorine dioxide literature data on the efficiency of chlorine dioxide disinfection were fitted with the extended hom model chlorine dioxide disinfection at low initial concentrations 0 05 0 1 mg l was found to be the major treatment step providing sufficient treatment on its own for compliance with the health based target uv disinfection of adv at 40 mj cm2 or 73 mj cm2 was insufficient without chlorine dioxide disinfection graphical abstract image 1 keywords adenovirus chlorine dioxide disinfection drinking water pcr qmra 1 introduction according to the dutch drinking water act of 2011 dutch drinking water suppliers must conduct a quantitative microbial risk assessment qmra for the so called index pathogens enterovirus campylobacter cryptosporidium and giardia at least once every four years in order to assess the microbial safety of drinking water anonymous 2011 in this qmra the health based target for microbiologically safe drinking water is set at less than one infection per 10 000 persons per year thereby following the world health organization who guidelines for drinking water quality who 2017 it is not feasible to conduct a qmra for every waterborne pathogen therefore index pathogens were chosen if a drinking water treatment is effective in removing the index pathogens the drinking water is considered to be safe nevertheless in specific situations this might not be the case at evides water company concern has arisen whether their drinking water treatment reduces levels of adenovirus adv sufficiently in the source water water from a storage reservoir that is taken in for drinking water production adv concentrations are highest from january to april adv is known to be more persistent to uv radiation than enteroviruses the selected index viral pathogen hijnen et al 2006 uv radiation and chlorine dioxide final treatment step are the major treatment steps employed by evides at the drinking water treatment plant dwtp berenplaat adv is widespread in nature infecting birds mammals and amphibians to date 90 genotypes of human adenoviruses have been identified based on whole genome sequencing ismail et al 2018 human adenoviruses have been classified into seven groups a g on the basis of their physical chemical and biological properties wold and ison 2013 adenoviruses consist of a double stranded dna genome in a non enveloped icosahedral capsid with a diameter of about 80 nm and unique fibres human adenoviruses cause a wide range of infections with a spectrum of clinical manifestations including the gastrointestinal tract the respiratory tract the urinary tract and the eyes brandt et al 1969 bon et al 1999 oh et al 2003 rodriguez baez et al 2002 serotypes 40 and 41 are a major cause of gastroenteritis worldwide notably in developing communities however little is known about the presence of these enteric adenoviruses in water sources largely because they are not detectable by conventional cell culture who 2017 who 2017 classifies adv as having moderate health significance long persistence moderate resistance to chlorine and high infectivity the main objective was to conduct a qmra for adv in the drinking water produced at dwpt berenplaat in general qmra for a waterborne pathogen in drinking water consists of determining the pathogen concentration in the source water its removal by treatment using data on the removal of the pathogen or of a representative indicator organism using drinking water consumption data and a dose response relationship who 2017 for the adenovirus qmra at berenplaat estimates of the concentrations in source water were based on total adv concentrations as determined by integrated cell culture pcr infectious virus particles and by most probable number pcr and quantitative pcr infectious as well as non infectious virus particles and on adv40 41 concentrations as determined by most probable number pcr and quantitative pcr here it was an additional objective to compare pcr data generated as most probable numbers with those generated as genome copies on the one hand inhibition of polymerase causes underestimation with quantitative pcr but not with most probable number pcr on the other hand aggregates of virus particles cause underestimation with most probable number pcr but not with quantitative pcr in the qmra for enterovirus as is conducted in the netherlands by the drinking water companies f specific rna bacteriophages or somatic coliphages are the default indicator organisms for determining the efficiency of treatment steps in the drinking water production to remove enteroviruses schijven et al 2011 the data on these indicators were used to determine removal efficiency by coagulation followed by sludge blanket clarification and rapid double layered filtration sand anthracite in order to estimate the efficiency of uv radiation somatic coliphage concentration measurements were conducted at plant scale and compared with literature data on disinfection of adv by uv in order to evaluate somatic coliphages as surrogate for uv disinfection of adv in addition the efficiency of medium pressure lamps emitting an uv dose of 40 mj cm2 and 73 mj cm2 were compared estimating the efficiency of chlorine dioxide disinfection relied on data from literature and additional laboratory experiments in order to evaluate ms2 bacteriophage as a surrogate for chlorine dioxide disinfection of adv because of a notable seasonal variation of adv concentrations in the source water and a different dosage of chlorine dioxide during winter time october march and summer time april september all source water concentration data and all treatment data were split into winter and summer time data and distributions were fitted to winter and summer data separately effectivity of the drinking water treatment was evaluated on the basis of the contribution of uv irradiation and chlorine dioxide disinfection to the total treatment 2 drinking water treatment description dwtp berenplaat provides 100 million m³ of drinking water each year and supplies water to a large proportion of rotterdam s homes and companies river meuse water is stored in the biesbosch storage reservoirs with an average retention time of five months to improve its chemical and biological quality by natural processes such as degradation and sedimentation about 12 000 m3 h of this water is transported to dwtp berenplaat where it passes a short water abstraction channel prior to treatment pathogen concentrations in berenplaat petrusplaat the final biesbosch storage reservoir water are the starting point for qmra berenplaat water first passes micro sieves mesh size 35 μm and is then treated by coagulation sludge blanket clarification and rapid double layered filtration the major disinfection takes place in two parallel arrays of medium pressure uv lamps one at 40 mj cm2 and the other at 73 mj cm2 it is assumed that the uv lamps provide a constant dose the setpoint uv dose for the target disinfection capacity is continuously maintained in the reactor by automatic adjustment of the uv lamps power setting i e emission intensity according to variations in operating conditions such as influent water quality uv transmission and flow rate after uv treatment the water passes granular activated carbon filters hijnen et al 2010 found no removal of bacteriophage ms2 by granular activated carbon filters at pilot plant scale at this dwtp hence this treatment step is considered to be irrelevant in the qmra for adv the final treatment consists of disinfection with 0 1 mg l chlorine dioxide in summer and 0 05 mg l chlorine dioxide in winter the finished water is stored in closed reservoirs prior to distribution 3 materials and methods 3 1 adenovirus enumeration throughout this document total adv is referred to as advtot adv40 and adv41 are

enumerations were conducted advtoticc advtotmpn advtotq adv40 41mpn and adv40 41q 3 2 sampling and concentration by uf thirty five samples of water approximately 600 l were collected from the final storage reservoir prior to drinking water treatment and concentrated by a conventional filter adsorption elution method as previously described rutjes et al 2009 briefly magnesium chloride was added to the water sample to a final concentration of 0 05 m to enable the formation of a virus magnesium complex by reducing the ph to 3 8 with 0 5 m hcl these complexes adsorb to a negatively charged cartridge filter with a nominal pore size of 1 2 μm viruses were eluted from the filter with an elution buffer of ph 9 0 and were neutralized with a concentrated acetic acid buffer ph 5 0 resulting in a final eluate with a ph of approximately 7 4 the eluate was further concentrated by ultrafiltration uf using a cellulose acetate filter nmwl 10 000 under high pressure 3 bar rutjes et al 2005 the

uv disinfection 40 and 73 mj cm2 were collected weekly to monthly from 2009 to 2012 for enumeration of somatic coliphages according to iso 10705 2 2000 sample sizes varied from 0 03 l to 40 l for coagulation sludge blanket clarification from 0 1 l to 160 l for rapid sand filtration and from 0 1 l to 1900 l for uv disinfection 4 data analysis all computational analyses were conducted using mathematica version 11 1 1 0 wolfram inc illinois 4 1 scenarios twelve risk assessments were conducted namely using the virus source concentrations of advtoticc adv40 41mpn and adv40 41q applying a uv dose of 40 mj cm2 or 73 mj cm2 and with or without chlorine dioxide disinfection 4 2 virus source concentration estimation best estimates of most probable numbers per sample were used to calculate sample concentrations to which subsequently gamma distributions were fitted schijven et al 2011 to the data from qpcr enumeration genome copies per litre a negative binomial distribution was fitted from which a gamma distributed concentration was derived as described by schijven et al 2011 to the paired positive advtoticc and advtotmpn samples as well as to the paired positive advtoticc and advtotq samples beta distributions were fitted as described for determining recovery efficiency by schijven et al 2011 these beta distributions represent the fractions of infectious virus particles based on either mpnpcr or qpcr data for each gamma distribution winter and summer ten thousand monte carlo mc samples were generated mc samples of infectious adv40 41 virus particles were calculated by multiplying the gamma distributed concentration data of adv40 41mpn and adv40 41q with the beta distributed fractions of infectious virus particles based on mpnpcr and qpcr data respectively for comparing with other fractions of infectious virus particles literature data on enumeration of rotavirus by means of iccpcr and mpnpcr in samples from the river meuse rutjes et al 2009 and enterovirus lodder et al 2015 by means of tissue culture and mpnpcr were collected and their ratio was determined by fitting a beta distribution as well as described here above 4 3 estimation of treatment efficiency using plant scale somatic coliphage data for the first three treatment steps coagulation sludge blanket clarification rapid sand filtration and uv disinfection 40 and 73 mj cm2 beta distributions were fitted to the winter and summer influent and effluent unpaired raw data for each of these treatments to characterize the fraction of virus particles passing treatment as described in detail for qmraspot schijven et al 2011 4 4 uv disinfection in order to evaluate somatic coliphage as a surrogate for adv the plant scale disinfection of somatic coliphages was compared with literature data on disinfection of adv the literature data were taken from guo et al 2010 and linden et al 2007 for medium pressure uv lamps the data from guo et al 2010 encompass the uv doses in the range of 65 90 mj cm2 to obtain 4 log10 disinfection the data from linden et al 2007 add log10 disinfection data at the lower uv doses of 13 and 28 mj cm2 the relation between uv dose and log10 disinfection is horizontally asymptotic hence a logistic function was fitted to these data using nonlinearmodelfit in mathematica here it was assumed that the uncertainty of the log10 disinfection followed a normal distribution model prediction provided the distribution parameters for log10 disinfection at uv doses of 40 and 73 mj cm2 4 5 chlorine dioxide disinfection parameter estimation data for virus disinfection by chlorine dioxide were available from thurston enriquez et al 2005 for adv40 41 and from hornstra et al 2011 and from hornstra 2014 for ms2 the data from thurston enriquez et al 2005 were obtained by reading the normalised concentration data from the published graph because the original data were not available anymore to all these data the extended hom model haas and joffe 1994 was fitted 1 l o g 10 n t l o g 10 n 0 k c 0 n t m η l n 10 ε where n t is the virus concentration litre 1 at time t min n 0 is the initial virus concentration litre 1 c 0 is the initial chlorine dioxide concentration mg l k is the virus inactivation rate coefficient min 1 m determines the time dependency of the virus disinfection n is the dependency on the disinfectant concentration and ε represents uncertainty efficiency factor η corrects for the loss of disinfectant 2 η m ψ m γ m 0 ψ where γ is the generalised incomplete gamma function and ψ is 3 ψ n k t where k is the first order rate coefficient of chlorine dioxide decay min 1 all experiments on disinfection of ms2 by hornstra et al 2011 were conducted under identical physico chemical conditions therefore it was assumed that the values for k m and n were the same for all these experiments only c 0 varied 0 005 mg l 0 5 mg l the experimental temperature was 0 c in addition hornstra 2014 conducted disinfection experiments with a c 0 of 0 06 mg l and 0 16 mg l at 5 c using water from the berenplaat the thurston data for adv40 were conducted at c 0 values of about 0 5 mg l at 5 c and 15 c and at ph 6 and 8 for a given c 0 and k one needs to estimate values for k m and n by fitting the extended hom model to virus concentration data decreasing non linearly in time it can easily be shown that there is no unique solution therefore some assumptions needed to be made it is common knowledge that virus inactivation is very much determined by virus type temperature and ph e g bertrand et al 2012 schijven et al 2016 hence k was assumed to depend on virus type ms2 and adv on temperature and on ph accordingly a common k value was estimated for ms2 from the data of hornstra et al 2011 another common k value for ms2 from the data of hornstra 2014 and four k values for the disinfection experiments with adv40 by thurston enriquez et al 2005 furthermore it was assumed that m was dependent only on virus type both viruses have a protein mantle of which the outer chemical groups mainly consist of carboxyl and amino groups suggesting that the reaction mechanism between chlorine dioxide and the virus particles was the same for both viruses and that consequently a common value of n was applicable to all disinfection data subsequently having estimated all these parameter values ms2 was evaluated as a surrogate for chlorine dioxide disinfection of adv by predicting disinfection of both ms2 and adv under the same conditions ph temperature and clo2 concentration finally multivariate regression analysis with temperature and ph as covariates was conducted to develop an empirical formula to predict k for ms2 at 15 c 4 6 prediction of chlorine dioxide disinfection at plant scale the prediction of virus reduction by chlorine dioxide disinfection at plant scale was based on the decay rate of the chlorine dioxide residual at plant scale including its variability at plant scale chlorine dioxide is continuously injected into the effluent of activated carbon filtration the time before the water enters the drinking water storage tanks is on average 4 4 min in summer and 6 3 min in winter because of the continuous injection it is assumed that the chlorine dioxide concentration in the activated carbon effluent remained constant prior to entering the storage tanks in the storage tanks the water follows a labyrinth i e passes the tanks in pulse flow with a shortest residence time of 154 min in summer and 226 min in winter in the storage tanks chlorine dioxide gradually decays chlorine dioxide decay was monitored in berenplaat water at 20 c representing summer time and a c 0 value of 0 103 mg l and proceeded first order 4 l n c t l n c 0 k t parameter k was estimated by means of linear regression chlorine dioxide decay in berenplaat water was also monitored at 5 c to represent winter time this was done for three c 0 values 0 052 0 103 and 0 151 mg l the chlorine dioxide decay proceeded initially faster than thereafter and hence was fitted to a weibull distribution 5 l n c t l n c 0 k t β where β is a shape parameter parameter values were obtained from maximum likelihood estimation for the summer period the logarithmic concentration reduction of virus by chlorine dioxide disinfection was predicted using equations 1 3 for the winter period the logarithmic concentration reduction of virus by chlorine dioxide disinfection was predicted using equations 1 2 and 6 6 ψ n k t β minimal exposure times to chlorine dioxide in summer and in winter were used to predict the logarithmic concentration reduction of virus including uncertainty ε 4 7 exposure and risk of infection exposure to the index pathogens is given as the dose d the number of ingested adenoviruses per person per day and was calculated by multiplying the monte carlo samples of their concentration in berenplaat water c source treatment z i four treatment steps and consumption data w divided by the recovery of the samples r 7 d c s o u r c e 1 r i 1 4 z i w drinking water consumption w was assumed to be lognormal distributed with parameters μ 1 85779 and σ 1 07487 for the netherlands corresponding to a mean of 0 27 l per person per day schijven et al 2011 thus doses were calculated for the winter and summer period the exact beta poisson dose response model was used with sets of parameter values representing uncertainty and variability in the infectivity of ingested adv teunis et al 2016 it was assumed that infectivity of total adv and of adv40 and 41 fit into this generalised dose response relationship 8 p i n f p e r s o n d a y 1 f 1 1 α α β d where α and β are infectivity parameters and 1f1 is the confluent hypergeometric function parameters α and β are monte carlo sample pairs joint distribution reflecting uncertainty and variability of infectivity infection risk per person per year was calculated from the monte carlo samples of the daily infection risk by first combining the winter and summer daily infection risks applying equation 7 10 000 times for each day in a year random sample from the combined daily infection risks to obtain 365 monte carlo sample distributions which are then multiplied

concentrations of total adv as enumerated with iccpcr mpnpcr and qpcr as well as of adv40 41 as enumerated with mpnpcr and qpcr clearly in the first quarter of the year 2012 virus concentrations reached peak values during the second and third quarter of the year denoted as summer total adv was detected 4 times using cell culture but was below detection limit for the molecular based detection methods in all summer samples advtot was not detected in only one summer sample viruses were detected using the adv40 41 specific pcr and is line with the theoretical limit of detection lod for these methods based on differences in analyzed volumes detection probability will increase when analyzed volumes increase the theoretical lod by molecular methods is 1 viral dna genome per analyzed volume of sample which varied in our case between 9 ml and 113 ml of source water the volumes studied by iccpcr varied from 52 l to 391 l resulting in a theoretical lod of 1 infectious particle in several hundreds of litres of source waters indicating that the theoretical lod may be orders of magnitude lower also depending on the ratio of infectious particle viral genome also variability between concentrations in qpcr samples is larger than in mpnpcr the qpcr data contain occasionally very high concentration values not found by mpn the latter does not discriminate between a high or a low virus count in a single pcr reaction well table 1 summarizes the corresponding distribution parameter values that describe the gamma distributed virus concentrations for the winter and summer period table 2 lists the distribution parameter values of the beta distributions that describe the fraction of infectious virus particles as determined from the total adv data the fraction of infectious virus particles was on average 5 9 10 4 3 2 log10 or 1 1700 of the virus particles enumerated by mpnpcr as well as by qpcr see also fig 1b and c table 2 also includes the concentrations of infectious adv40 41 as predicted from the total adv concentrations and the corresponding fraction of infectious virus particles for comparison table 2 also includes the parameters of the beta distribution describing the fraction of infectious rotavirus particles iccpcr and mpnpcr as determined by rutjes et al 2009 and of enterovirus cell culture and mpnpcr as determined by lodder et al 2015 on average 1 100 of enumerated rv particles was infectious this is 17 times higher than as estimated for adv the distribution describing the fraction of infectious rv is wider than that of adv on average 1 25 of enumerated enterovirus particles was infectious with distribution similarly wide as that for rv note that the enterovirus samples were collected from different river water locations from 1987 till 2012 table 2 also includes the parameters of the beta distribution describing the fraction of adv40 41 of advtot particles see also fig 1j and k according to the mpnpcr enumeration this fraction was on average 0 5 0 3 log10 varying from 0 2 to 0 8 and according to the qpcr enumeration this fraction was on average 0 36 0 44 log10 varying from 0 008 to 0 9 for being able to fit the beta distribution those data where adv40 41 was detected but advtot not and where the concentration of ad40 41 was higher than advtot were omitted see footnote table 2 near the detection limit a few viruses detected differences in sensitivity of the qpcr using different primers for adv40 41 and advtot may result in finding apparently more adv40 41 than advtot when comparing mpnpcr with qpcr see fig 1f and i it appears only when peak values in the qpcr enumeration occur qpcr concentration values are higher than mpnpcr concentrations otherwise mpnpcr concentration values are about a factor two higher than qpcr concentration values 5 2 coagulation rapid sand filtration table 3 lists the parameter values of the beta distributions that represent the fraction of somatic coliphages that were able to pass these treatments based on enumeration data of somatic coliphages in plant scale samples the first two treatment steps contribute little to virus removal coagulation sludge blanket clarification was more efficient in winter whereas rapid filtration was inefficient in winter 5 3 uv disinfection table 3 also lists the parameter values of the beta distributions that represent the fraction of somatic coliphages that were able to pass uv disinfection either at 40 mj cm2 or 73 mj cm2 based on enumeration data of somatic coliphages in plant scale samples the distribution for the summer data with 73 mj cm2 is very skewed to the left due to more non detects in the effluent water fig 2 predicts the log10 reduction of adv by uv disinfection based on the literature data listed in table 4 at 40 mj cm2 and 73 mj cm2 the predicted log10 reductions are 3 3 0 1 and 4 0 0 1 the reductions of somatic coliphages as determined at plant scale were on average a bit lower suggesting that somatic coliphages may be less sensitive towards uv disinfection than adv or that plant scale conditions were less optimal for uv treatment indicating that the fluence may have been lower than anticipated the beta distribution for the reductions of the somatic coliphages by uv disinfection at plant scale reflects variability the latter in combination with the lower sensitivity towards uv disinfection as well as the uncertainty inherent to the sparse literature data on uv disinfection of adv justified the use of the plant scale somatic coliphage data for the risk assessment 5 4 chlorine dioxide disinfection the conditions and estimated model parameter values for each disinfection experiment are included in fig 3 fig 3 shows the observed and fitted log10 reductions by chlorine dioxide from hornstra et al 2011 that were aimed at determining disinfection of bacteriophage ms2 at low initial chlorine dioxide concentrations c0 is 0 0049 mg l 0 45 mg l all at 0 c and ph 7 2 3a 3h of bacteriophage ms2 at two low initial chlorine dioxide concentrations 0 059 mg l and 0 16 mg l and at 5 c and ph 7 8 to mimic the plant scale conditions in winter 3i and 3j hornstra 2014 and of adv at higher chlorine dioxide concentrations 0 47 mg l 0 53 mg l at 5 c and 15 c and ph 6 and ph 8 3k 3n from thurston enriquez et al 2005 as shown the data were fitted satisfactorily by maximum likelihood estimation at higher temperature disinfection of ms2 increased the two bottom left figures compare disinfection of ms2 with that of adv by predicting ms2 disinfection at the conditions observed for adv and vice versa it shows that ms2 was more persistent to chlorine dioxide than adv extrapolation of adv disinfection at the plant scale conditions was considered too uncertain therefore prediction of disinfection of ms2 as a conservative indicator was applied standard deviation ε was 0 44 the predicted value of k of ms2 at 15 c was 13 7 min 1 in the winter time chlorine dioxide decay in berenplaat water followed a weibull distribution with k 0 065 min 1 and β 0 42 in the summer time the decay proceeded first order with k 0 017 this led to a predicted log10 reduction by chlorine dioxide disinfection of 6 8 5 9 7 6 in winter time and of 14 4 13 5 15 2 in summer time table 3 5 5 total treatment table 3 also includes the means 5 percentiles and 95 percentiles of the log10 reduction of the four total treatment scenarios it clearly shows that chlorine dioxide disinfection is the major treatment step for adv removal 5 6 infection risks fig 4 shows the box whisker plots of the infection risks per person per year for all twelve scenarios four treatments scenarios with advtoticc adv40 41mpn and adv40 41q for the treatment scenarios including chlorine dioxide disinfection risks were far below 10 4 the infection risks with the treatment scenario that includes a uv dose of 40 mj cm2 as well as chlorine dioxide disinfection are for all viral methods at least five orders in magnitude below the 10 4 risk switching to a uv dose of 73 mj cm2 shifts the risks another 1 5 log10 further down in the treatment scenarios without chlorine dioxide disinfection the 10 4 risk level is always exceeded the large range of the box whiskers with the treatment of 73 mj cm2 is a consequence of the wider beta distribution for uv disinfection at this dose with respect to the multibarrier principle on the one hand this indicates that total failure of chlorine dioxide disinfection leads to non compliance with the health based target on the other hand chlorine dioxide disinfection alone provides adequate treatment 6 discussion 6 1 source concentration estimation detection of infectious viral pathogens in environmental samples usually uses mammalian cell culture methods it is generally known that cell culture assays will underestimate the viral concentration in the sample since not all viral strains will be detected with similar efficiencies if detected at all jiang 2006 detecting adenoviruses by cell culture infectivity is usually challenging due to the inconsistent onset of viral induced cytopathic effect which is overcome by combining the use of cell culture with pcr iccpcr as has been used in the current paper although in several papers cell lines have been described that aim to improve detection of enteric adenoviruses polston et al 2015 detection of environmental isolates is still challenging which made us decide to use the approach described in current paper it was estimated that the fraction of infectious adv particles was on average 1 1700 by mpnpcr and qpcr by comparison the fraction of infectious rv was on average 1 100 in mpnpcr rutjes et al 2009 and that for infectious enterovirus was on average 1 25 in mpnpcr lodder et al 2015 the fraction of infectious virus particles may depend on virus type water matrix and time rv was enumerated in samples from the river meuse whereas adv was enumerated in water from a storage reservoir fed with water from the river meuse residence time in the three successive biesbosch storage reservoirs is five months on average the detected adv may therefore have been longer in the environment following discharge with wastewater than the detected rv and hence there was more time for virus inactivation another comparison between qpcr and tissue culture enumeration was made by de roda husman et al 2009 where inactivation of poliovirus 1 and a coxsackie virus b4 was monitored for a period of one year in artificial groundwater and artificial surface water at 4 c and at 22 c the fraction of infectious virus was initially about 1 100 and decreased to 1 10000 or less depending on virus type matrix temperature and time this range encompasses that of the 90 interval estimated for the fraction of infectious total adv qmra based on genome copy concentrations of a virus in the source water may therefore overestimate the risk by two to four orders in magnitude in this study the fraction of infectious total adv particles in total adv particles was used to estimate infectious adv40 41 particle concentrations depending on mpnpcr or qpcr the fraction adv40 41 particles in total adv was estimated to average 0 36 10 0 44 0 50 10 0 30 for the observed ad40 41 concentrations that were lower than the observed total adv concentrations table 2 although this fraction varies given the fact that 90 types of adenoviruses based on whole genome sequencing have been described ismail et al 2018 the fraction of 0 36 0 50 seems surprisingly high the relative high fraction of adv40 41 may be explained by the fact that the enteric group f adenoviruses may be more stable than viruses in other adv groups adv40 41 have been shown to be the dominating serotypes in environmental water samples by hartmann et al 2013 although their results indicate that some other serotypes may be stable enough to be detected up to weeks after contamination as well the fact that in some samples adv40 41 were detected in the absence of advtot may be explained by a combination of the low virus concentrations in the source waters approaching the detection limit and the high fraction of adv40 41 differences in detection limit may also be ascribed to using different target genes for detection of advtot hexon gene and adv40 41 fiber gene quantification of viruses in surface waters or other environmental samples is challenging because of the complex character of the matrix virus concentrations in source waters for drinking water production are known to be generally low and may be close to or below detection levels moreover as reviewed by schrader et al 2012 environmental samples are known to contain substances that may inhibit nucleic acid extraction and pcr inhibitors are a very heterogeneous group of chemical substances one matrix may contain different inhibitory substances and the same inhibitors can be found in many different environmental but also clinical matrices organic as well as inorganic substances which may be dissolved or solid can appear as extraction of pcr inhibitors nucleases may degrade template nucleic acids schrader et al 2012 having a negative effect on the extraction or nucleic acids present in the sample may compete for target rna or dna attachment to the isolating raisin rutjes et al 2005 calcium ions are an example of inorganic substances with inhibitory effects on the pcr however most of the known inhibitors are organic compounds examples are polysaccharides humic acids tannic acid as well as different proteins such as proteinases schrader et al 2012 the presence of these inhibitory substances may complicate quantification based upon a standard curve amplified by pcr in optimal reaction conditions although in theory inhibition could be quantified using proper amplification controls d agostino et al 2011 a qpcr hadv validation study for quantitation of hadv genome copies in berry fruit demonstrated that the level of between laboratory variation was too great to be able to describe the performance characteristics of the method in quantitative terms this is despite the fact that nucleic acid standard solutions were supplied along with the trial materials the high between laboratory variation may be caused by several factors such as the condition in which the standard solutions have reached the partner institutes operational differences between thermocyclers used in the various laboratories but also the differences in berries d agostino et al 2012 this study highlighted the vulnerability of quantification based on an external standard in addition viruses may not be homogeneously distributed in the sample but be present partly as aggregates the occasional high concentrations detected by qpcr suggest this when such aggregates are sampled qpcr may lead to overestimation of virus concentrations although qpcr data appeared to have occasional high outliers not present in the mpnpcr data fig 1d i these outliers appeared to have little or no effect on the final distributions of the infection risks 6 2 uv disinfection comparing literature data on uv disinfection of adv with those of somatic coliphages as determined from plant scale data indicated that the latter were more persistent suggesting that somatic coliphages are a good indicator for uv disinfection of adv although a uv dose of 73 mj cm2 is more efficient than a uv dose of 40 mj cm2 a failing chlorine dioxide disinfection would still lead to insufficient treatment 6 3 chlorine dioxide disinfection literature data on the efficiency of chlorine dioxide to disinfect adv and bacteriophage ms2 were used to predict disinfection of adv at the low concentrations of chlorine dioxide as applied at the dwtp it showed that under the assumption of the same kinetics that disinfection is more efficient at higher temperature and obviously with higher disinfectant concentration and also at higher ph ms2 appeared to be less sensitive than adv because the disinfection data of ms2 were near to the plant scale conditions it is more appropriate to predict ms2 disinfection than adv disinfection and thus to use ms2 as a process indicator clearly a low chlorine dioxide concentration as applied here appeared to be highly efficient and is the major treatment step at this dwtp for the reduction of adv 6 4 risk and uncertainty it may be stated that the risk estimates were conservative because somatic coliphages and bacteriophage ms2 appeared to be more persistent to uv and chlorine dioxide disinfection respectively than adv 7 conclusions adv40 41 represents a large fraction of total adv and only a small fraction of adv is infectious on average 1 1700 somatic coliphages have been shown to be a good indicator for uv disinfection of adv and bacteriophage ms2 for chlorine dioxide disinfection of adv according to the qmra the drinking water at dwtp berenplaat is compliant with the legal health based target for adv this paper provides the first description of the application of chlorine dioxide in drinking water production at the low initial concentrations of 0 05 mg l and 0 1 mg l which nevertheless appeared to be very effective in the reduction of adv chlorine dioxide was the dominant treatment step for adv at this dwtp acknowledgments arno swart and harold van den berg from the

18807,receiving water quality simulation in highly urbanised areas requires the integration of several processes occurring at different space time scales these integrated catchment models deliver results with a significant uncertainty level associated still uncertainty analysis is seldom applied in practice and the relative contribution of the individual model elements is poorly understood often the available methods are applied to relatively small systems or individual sub systems due to limitations in organisational and computational resources consequently this work presents an uncertainty propagation and decomposition scheme of an integrated water quality modelling study for the evaluation of dissolved oxygen dynamics in a large scale urbanised river catchment in the netherlands forward propagation of the measured and elicited uncertainty input parametric distributions was proposed and contrasted with monitoring data series prior ranges for river water quality quantity parameters lead to high uncertainty in dissolved oxygen predictions thus the need for formal calibration to adapt to the local dynamics is highlighted after inferring the river process parameters with system measurements of flow and dissolved oxygen combined sewer overflow pollution loads became the dominant uncertainty source along with rainfall variability as a result insights gained in this paper can help in planning and directing further monitoring and modelling efforts in the system when comparing these modelling results to existing national guidelines it is shown that the commonly used concentration duration frequency tables should not be the only metric used to select mitigation alternatives and may need to be adapted in order to cope with uncertainties graphical abstract image 1 keywords uncertainty analysis integrated catchment modelling water quality urban water systems uncertainty decomposition 1 introduction meeting the established environmental regulations e g the water framework directive 2000 60 ec 200 of the european union is still a challenge in many densely urbanised catchments as it often requires the implementation of intensive investment and regulatory plans i e infrastructure construction control systems or user limitations model based decision making is applied more frequently to explore and optimise the effect of different alternatives aiming towards an efficient resource allocation therefore integrated catchment modelling icm has become an essential tool in the water quality management process over the last decades andrés doménech et al 2010 langeveld et al 2013b willems and berlamont 2002 icms are by definition abstractions of highly complex water systems usually constituted by the joint modelling of two or more subsystems of the urban water system keupers and willems 2017 rauch et al 2002 this often involves the joint simulation of sewer hydrodynamics wastewater treatment processes rural hydrology and river physical biochemical dynamics benedetti et al 2013a icms like every other modelling process contain various sources of uncertainty due to the inherent system characteristics complex processes are represented with limited knowledge relationships are calibrated with reduced data sets which may lead to a poorly identifiable parameterisation and linked simulations are carried out over a wide range of spatiotemporal scales also the stepwise process of abstraction from reality to model representation with its necessary simplifications and idealisations of the real systems includes the unavoidable occurrence of uncertainties muschalla et al 2009 these uncertainties encompass the errors introduced by model parameterisation model forcing data e g precipitation model input data e g digital elevation model soil or sewer conduit maps model validation data e g use of incorrect water level rating curves and model structures e g different mathematical representations the definition recognition and consideration of these uncertainties is therefore of the utmost importance for the application of such models and for the interpretation of the hereby obtained results pappenberger and beven 2006 schellart et al 2010 at present however a comprehensive uncertainty analysis is mainly applied in science and less in planning practice kleidorfer 2010 vanrolleghem 2011 several frameworks have been proposed to facilitate the quantification and handling of these uncertainties in integrated urban water systems specifically deletic et al 2012 tscheikner gratl et al 2017 or environmental modelling in general refsgaard et al 2007 the quantification of modelling statistical uncertainties is often carried out by encoding system knowledge through a probabilistic description reichert et al 2015 and sampling i e monte carlo to describe the variability at the targeted output variables additionally the identification of the contribution of each uncertainty source is essential in the system analysis process since it directs the modeller towards a rational reduction of epistemic uncertainties for instance willems 2012 presented a variance decomposition methodology to quantify the partial contribution of uncertainty by source reichert and mieleitner 2009 described the use of time dependent parameters as a proxy to detect temporal windows of structural mismatch pointing therefore at examining particular physical processes yang et al 2018 used glue to extract the sensitivity from process driven parameter structures inline with this gupta et al 2008 discussed the need of diagnosis tools to guide the model conceptualisation process examples of uncertainty analysis applications in integrated catchment modelling for water quality estimation are still scarce tscheickner gratl et al 2019 this is partially due to the significant amount of effort to monitor and set up large scale modelling studies also computational constraints have severely limited the applicability of proposed formal uncertainty analysis methodologies see schellart et al 2010 therefore only few examples are available in literature which deal with relatively small systems freni and mannina 2010 or with individual sub systems dotto et al 2012 radwan et al 2004 consequently this work describes the application of a formal uncertainty analysis scheme to quantify dissolved oxygen modelling uncertainties in a large scale 4400 ha of draining urban areas a 750 000 p e wwtp and a sensitive receiving water body water quality icm study the estimation of the relative contribution of different relevant uncertainty sources is also shown which served towards directing further modelling and monitoring efforts in the system initially the forward propagation of all sources of uncertainty was proposed using the best available literature expert measurement derived parametric input probability ranges this will be therein referred as prior propagation upon analysis of the uncertainty contribution by source river water quality and quantity parameters captured most of the variability of yearly dissolved oxygen do dynamics thus a dedicated inference scheme was proposed to update the river parametric distributions using local flow and do measurements the propagation of all parameter input uncertainties and the updated parameter set for the river submodel is here presented referred as posterior propagation comparison of the forward propagation from both prior posterior uncertainty distributions with system observations along with the current prioritisation of uncertainty sources is presented in this study complementarily the impact of modelling uncertainties in the concentration duration frequency environmental assessment metrics is discussed highlighting the possible implications of using such metrics in the selection of mitigation alternatives in environmental systems the discussion arising from this experience also serves to put into context the applicability of proposed uncertainty analysis techniques in real world scale icm studies 2 materials and methods the dommel is a stream discharge of 4 30 m3 s located in the south of the netherlands it receives the discharge of a wastewater treatment plant wwtp of 750 000 p e population equivalent and the intermittent discharge from 192 combined sewer overflow structures csos the water system covers and area of 800 km2 29 combined sewer systems 4400 ha of urban connected area and roughly 110 km of river tributaries fig 1 provides the layout of the system and the measurement locations pollution loads from the wwtp and cso discharges on the river are relatively common under wet weather conditions this causes oxygen depletion events which deteriorate the water quality status of the receiving water body the dommel water management authorities operate an integrated catchment model aiming to better understand local pollution dynamics and to test alternatives for improving the ecological status this integrated model consists of a a set of lumped urban drainage system models conceptualised as in solvi 2006 characterizing the 29 municipalities sewer gravity and pressurised transport network cso structures were represented by 30 clusters spatially lumping structures which shared the same sewer system section conceptual sewer models were derived using pre existing detailed hydrodynamic urban drainage models which have been checked on systematic errors during a prior model calibration using hydraulic monitoring data of the sewers such lumped structures highly simplify the underlying dynamics and their use should be justified for each application the system under consideration is nevertheless highly controlled and characterised by high in sewer static volumes also the simulation of dissolved oxygen processes at the river scale results in smoothed dynamics and are more sensitive to the overall discharged volume than to small errors in the timing and shape of the discharged hydrograph similar lumped approaches have been presented which correct for different dynamic phenomena e g back water effects or dynamic storage see wolfs et al 2013 or van daal rombouts et al 2016 b a fully detailed wwtp model including primary secondary and tertiary treatment with capacity for 26 000 m3 h and a controlled storm settling tank with a treatment capacity of 9 000 m3 h c a simplified river model consisting of a lumped conceptualisation of well stirred tank volumes as a 65 tank in series scheme which simulates water flow pollutant mass fluxes and conversion rates the physical and biochemical processes modelled at the river scale are presented in table b1 annex b which were adapted from the water quality module of duflow the full integrated model was build using west dhi simulation platform for icms a detailed description of the integrated catchment model structure and its development and validation process can be found at langeveld et al 2013b a description of the main spatial and temporal characteristic scales in the dommel system was reported in moreno rodenas et al 2017a the model structure was revisited sequentially identifying and analysing the major uncertainty sources for each submodel independently this is reported in tscheikner gratl et al 2017 where the application of the quantifying uncertainty in integrated catchment studies quics uncertainty framework was described for the dommel case study 2 1 experimental data integrated catchment studies require extensive observational datasets for their development langeveld et al 2013a table 1 shows the main characteristics of the measurement series made available by the dommel water management authority the wwtp effluent represents roughly 50 of the total river flow during dry weather flow in the summer period benedetti et al 2013b wwtp and csos discharges have the potential to locally saturate the river volume up to 90 of flow contribution at different river sections since urban areas present a faster runoff response than rural areas leading to large pollutant concentration peaks under heavy rainfall conditions up to 10 80 gbod m3 peaks at several sections of the river these heavy urban loads result in low dissolved oxygen concentrations at the receiving water body 5 go2 m3 average during summer and strong dissolved oxygen depletion processes leading to temporary anoxic conditions with recovery time ranging from hours to days cso flow data were estimated from depth measurements at the weir structures and approximated discharge relationships although such estimation may contain significant errors see van daal rombouts et al 2017 additional details on characteristic spatial and temporal scales observed in csos wwtp and the dommel river can be seen in moreno rodenas et al 2017a rainfall data was derived from two main sources a a network of 13 rain gauges mixing tipping buckets and weighting gauges from the dutch national meteorological institute knmi the municipality of eindhoven and the waterboard of the dommel b knmi distributed rainfall estimations from bias corrected single polarisation c band radar overeem et al 2009 2 2 parametric uncertainty table 2 provides the characterised parameter probability distribution for the urban drainage water flow submodel the most influential catchments were selected based on connected area and discharged volume contribution moreno rodenas et al 2017a uncertainties in wetting losses volume and availability total connected area in sewer maximum storage wastewater generation per inhabitant and reservoir constants of the lumped sewer system conceptualisation were considered those uncertainties were derived from expert knowledge in physical plausible constrained ranges table 3 presents the parameter distributions considered at the cso water quality generator this contains four fractionation parameters which were identified as a truncated gaussian distribution range 0 1 with a mean value provided by a non formal expert elicitation and a standard deviation of 10 the mean value modelling in sewer water quality dynamics is still a challenge willems 2006 and sufficient data was not available for a reliable submodel calibration the sewer transport system is characterised by long conduits up to 20 km mixing gravity and pressurised sections and it is heavily controlled thus the measured water quality at the wwtp influent is expected to render a low representativity of the conditions at the csos thus limiting the use of data driven generators keupers and willems 2015 in order to produce a robust estimation a mean pollutant vector multiplier emc was used to approximate cso loads from modelled flow dynamics a monitoring campaign in the dommel system reported measured pollutant series for various water quality variables relevant for the integrated model bod cod and nh4 at several cso events moens et al 2009 this allowed estimating pollutant probability distributions and correlation structures fig 2 a gaussian copula stochastic model was proposed to generate random pollutant event concentrations which respect the non gaussian marginal distributions and its correlation structure the stochastic model was based on the following hypotheses a pollutant mean concentration remains fairly constant over the cso event duration in the system of the dommel reported by van daal rombouts 2017 b the studied cso locations have comparable pollution dynamics over time van daal rombouts 2017 and c the instantaneous pollution concentration was assumed to be spatially independent since we could not establish a clear pattern from the available data these assumptions are case study dependent also the inclusion of a by location correlation could be readily accounted for by the copula joint probability distribution provided additional system measurements would prove its existence a comparison of the measured and copula sampled pollutant estimation can be found in moreno rodenas et al 2017b since no onsite measurements for cso dissolved oxygen concentrations were available literature values were applied boomen and icke 2004 diaz fierros et al 2002 thus cso dissolved oxygen concentrations were characterised by a uniform distribution u 3 6 go2 m3 table a1 and table a2 annex a show the uncertainty distributions associated with the wwtp submodel parameter distributions for the wwtp influent model table a1 were taken from langeveld et al 2017 which used several observed influent time series to estimate the model parameters in a bayesian inference scheme these parameters were described using a normally distributed density function truncated between 0 and 1 with mean the average of each posterior sample chain of the mcmc and standard deviation of 5 from the mean value the full posterior chains were not available so an estimated normal distribution was used to represent the influent parameters around the inferred mean values estimated from langeveld et al 2017 the effect of this approximation in the results of this work was nevertheless considered negligible table 4 shows the prior parameter probability distributions assigned to the hydrologic flow and biochemical process models of the river prior distributions were defined from expert knowledge and literature sediment oxygen demand sod was measured in the system by the waterboard de dommel the river model parameters were later inferred using a bayesian inference scheme from flow and do measurements at the closing section of the catchment between 15 jan 2012 until 04 aug 2012 and validated with additional observations 05 jan 2012 until 31 dec 2012 a polynomial chaos expansion emulator was used to accelerate the sampling of the computationally expensive model during the inference process moreno rodenas et al 2018b this rendered an updated joint parameter distribution set which was later propagated through the full icm by drawing correlated samples from the posterior parameter chains table 5 presents the parameter distributions used for the rural to river baseflow inflow pollutant loads values were estimated by expert elicitation since no measurements were available 2 3 dynamic input uncertainty errors in measured or estimated time dependent inputs were represented as stochastic processes random sampling was applied to generate input realisation ensembles table a3 presents the selected most relevant input processes in the system tscheikner gratl et al 2017 rainfall uncertain realisations were sampled at the 9 largest catchment areas which covered 3 930 ha of a total connected area of 4 400 ha approx 90 rainfall intensity at the spatial block support of each individual catchment was extracted from the knmi corrected radar measurements 1 k m 2 5 min using hourly accumulation moreno rodenas et al 2017a an additive error model dependent on rainfall intensity was applied as proposed by freni and mannina

measured value which parameters were fitted by comparing radar rain gauge series at the same location the comparison between estimated rainfall from rain gauges and radar sources showed large differences especially during heavy convective storm processes see bottom left event at fig a1 annex a this measured difference could not be represented by the additive error structure alone thus a miss detection error structure was also applied the system characteristics cause csos in the area to be usually activated after rainfall volumes larger than 8 10 mm and pumping capacities are designed to empty in sewer storage in 10 12 h therefore rainfall estimation differences were considered large when data sources radar and rain gauge inverse distance weighted interpolated values had a cumulative difference larger than 10 mm within 12 h in such cases the rainfall input ensemble is updated by sampling from a uniform distribution covering both estimations interpolated rain gauge network radar equation 1 figs a1 and a2 annex a show the rainfall input ensemble generated at four characteristic rainfall periods for the municipalities of eindhoven 2000 ha and bergeijk 110 ha biochemical processes at the river stretch are highly influenced by water temperature which results in daily and seasonal variation there were five temperature stations along the river section of interest with hourly measurements a spatially homogeneous gaussian process gp was used to characterize the water temperature input uncertainty 2 t t g p t t σ t with the average temperature between the five sensors t t as the mean of the process and covariance matrix described by a squared exponential structure 3 σ t i j σ t i σ t j e 0 5 t d 24 2 where σ t i is the measured by location temperature standard deviation at time i and j and t d the time lag the river solar radiation input i o m e a s u r e d was measured at the knmi meteorological station at the city of eindhoven this measured data were used as a spatially homogeneous and time dynamic input for the entire river domain an error model consisting in a normally distributed multiplier was used 4 i o i o m e a s u r e d n d μ 1 σ σ i o 2 i water temperature at the wastewater treatment works was measured and used as input in the treatment process model a multiplicative independent gaussian error was implemented as 5 t

the parameters σ i o 0 15 and σ t e m p w w t p 0 05 were assigned based on expected sensor representativity 2 4 forward uncertainty propagation a monte carlo mc based forward uncertainty propagation was performed using measured and expert elicited parametric input uncertainty probability distributions for the full year of 2012 parametric samples were generated from a latin hypercube sampler lhs to generate a low discrepancy set dynamic inputs were sampled independently from the proposed stochastic processes a first set of 600 samples was drawn from the full integrated model in parallel model instances to characterize modelled river flow and dissolved oxygen concentration uncertainties at the closing section of the catchment m 0121 fig 1 using the best available prior knowledge on the system a bayesian inference scheme was used to update the parametric distribution of several hydraulic and biochemical river model parameters table 4 given local observations in the system moreno rodenas et al 2018b first four river flow parameters were inferred using a heteroscedastic independent gaussian log likelihood distribution and drawing 50 000 posterior samples secondly setting the inferred flow parameters an independently identically distributed gaussian log likelihood was used to sample from the posterior distribution of 8 water quality parameters 50 000 samples the posterior residual structure respected the assumptions of the assumed error generating process although a certain residual correlation was still present the updated river submodel parameters was used to generate 600 additional samples from the model by drawing correlated samples from the river submodel inferred parameter mcmc chains from the copula distribution at the cso pollutant stochastic model ensembles from the time dependent inputs and from a lhs for the rest of the parameters both prior and posterior parameter distributions were compared with monitoring data available in the system 2 5 uncertainty analysis by variance decomposition a variance decomposition scheme was proposed following willems 2012 this is based on defining independent groups of submodels or parameter input clusters and analysing its contribution to the total residual error variance seven contributing groups were defined by selecting each submodel most relevant parameters input sources table a4 annex a a period of 2 months 05 aug 2012 07 oct 2012 was simulated which captured several summer oxygen depletion processes representative of the dynamics of interest 15 time points which were temporally independent and represented relevant dynamics were selected to perform the decomposition of variance as 6 σ e y e y 0 2 σ e y r e s t v a r 2 σ e y 0 2 i 1 7 σ e y c l u s t e r i 2 for which σ e y e y 0 2 represent the variance of the model observation residuals which were computed during the forward propagation of all considered stochastic input and parametric uncertainty sources the total residual variance is assumed to be composed of σ e y 0 2 variance of the measurement error σ e y c l u s t e r i 2 the partial variance of each selected parameter input group propagating the effect of the group meanwhile fixing the rest to their average value and a term σ e y r e s t v a r 2 which represents the rest variance not explained by measurement or input parameters σ e y r e s t v a r 2 was computed by estimating all other terms all variances should be homoscedastic a box cox transformation is often applied when data shows variance dependency a very mild heteroscedasticity was found in the do simulated residuals which was corrected using a λ 0 9 box cox a dedicated data quality validation was performed to the do measurement series in this period and the quality was expected to be high tolerances between 3 and 10 are often accepted in do concentration measurements thus a multiplicative random gaussian error σ d o t d o t 0 05 was applied to estimate σ e y 0 2 samples were drawn from a lhs 250 samples varying every parameter input cluster to characterize the partial variance σ e y c l u s t e r i 2 the reader is directed to willems 2012 or freni and mannina 2010 for further detail in the variance decomposition approach 3 results and discussion uncertainty ranges for all relevant parameters and input sources were propagated through the full integrated model structure fig 3 presents the observed series of flow and do at the final section of the system m 0121 fig 1 along with the mean of the simulated series and the 95 uncertainty range steming from the input parametric variability when using all available prior knowledge in the system the proposed model structure captures the flow dynamics in the river submodel which are mainly driven by the baseflow inputs from the rural hydrology and the discharges from the wwtp c a 40 50 of baseflow during summer reasonably well nash sutcliffe efficiency of 0 82 0 86 at the inferred and validation series respectively the prior forward propagation of do dynamics resulted in a relatively large dispersion the 95 interval distance between model samples had a yearly average range of 3 7 go2 m3 σ 0 76 go2 m3 the 95 range was 3 go2 m3 for do concentration lower than 2 5 go2 m3 using the inferred water quality parameters the 95 range was reduced to 1 8 gdo m3 σ 0 42 gdo m3 fig 4 provides the comparison of measured and modelled do using the posterior forward propagation for a time window during the summer period between july and october figure c1 and figure c2 annex c present the simulated rainfall do measured modelled and the bod dynamics at two sections of the river discharged bod can reach high concentrations up to 10 60 gbod m3 at the receiving water body local measurements of bod were not available at this period but a monitoring campaign carried out during 2007 2008 moens et al 2009 reported peaks of the same order of magnitude up to 10 80 gbod m3 consumption of high bod loads is the dominant process in the acute do depletion a fraction of the bod load settles and degrades in the river bed which dominates the speed of the do recovery process which can take between hours to days the depth and recovery pattern of most do depletion processes are captured by the simulated and measured series root mean squared error of 1 25 1 6 go2 m3 during the inferred and validation time periods respectively yet a few events show insufficient depletion in the model fig 4 this can suggest that a certain process might be missing in the model structure description i e insufficient wwtp loads under certain conditions or a stronger rural contribution however not enough system data was available to further validate those hypotheses for instance during the timespan between the 19th and the 29th of november 2012 three acute oxygen depletion processes occurred which were not captured by the model response in both scenarios fig 3 cso discharges were not reported during this time the same depletion process was captured by an upstream do sensor located between the wwtp and the m 0121 sensor but not by other sensors distributed throughout the system during this period only minor inflow c a 12 000 m3 h was recorded at the influent of the wwtp with 35 000 m3 h maximum capacity thus this oxygen depletion events could only be explained either by a major disturbance in the wwtp operations which is not supported by effluent wwtp measurements of tss nh4 or cod or a disturbance in the sediment bed of the river i e dredging or mowing which has been confirmed to have occurred by the waterboard de dommel those processes were not described in the model structure and hence could not be captured by the simulation response this type of events were not reported in monitoring data for previous years thus were neglected in this study yet this can become a relevant source of structural uncertainty and should be further investigated fig 5 presents the cumulative probability density function of the yearly measured and modelled do flow series along with the 95 ranges when performing the posterior propagation after inferring the parameter distributions for the river quantity and quality submodel parameters the uncertainty band was significantly reduced the average 95 uncertainty range was reduced from 3 7 go2 m3 to 1 8 go2 m3 and the two sample kolmogorov smirnov ks test rendered that for 99 5 of the time steps the null hypothesis both forward propagations render the same probability distribution is rejected with p value 0 001 and mean k s value of 0 27 this can be explained by the fact that the ranges attributed to the river parameters prior knowledge where narrowed down by the information provided in river do flow measurements the mean simulated series for flow in both cases represented reasonably well the occurrence probability of high and medium hydrographs yet there was a systematic overestimation of low flows river flow below 3 4 m3 s which is likely caused by an overestimation of the rural dry weather contribution yet this is expected to have a limited influence in do depletion dynamics which occur mainly during wet weather conditions the model exhibited a systematic underestimation of high dissolved oxygen concentration this is seen during winter months fig 3 the seasonal do variation in the model structure was captured by several factors i e a constant sediment oxygen demand sod see table b1 process number 5 and temperature driven inhibition coefficients for oxidation rates and reaeration patterns sod dynamics were estimated from system observations and we tried to respect the reported values the inferred probability distributions for the biochemical river parameters could still not match the high do concentration fig 5 b well enough this suggests that either the base do inflows are underestimated in the current version of the model e g too low wwtp do effluent rural do for which there were not reliable measurements or that there is a structural process missing in the river conceptualisation e g a stronger winter summer sediment oxygen demand variability nonetheless the accurate simulation of high do concentration is of little interest for the model application on the other hand low do level yearly probability was better matched as can be seen in fig 5 the information from modelled observed time series in river water quality assessment studies is often compressed for system evaluation down to a low number of performance indicators a common reporting method for river water quality status within the eu water framework directive compliance is the use of concentration duration frequency cdf tables fwr 2012 limit levels are commonly extracted from an ecological assessment study which defines survival conditions for critical species table b2 presents the environmental cdf tables for three levels of water quality compliance basic critical and salmonid in the river dommel exceedance frequencies are computed and contrasted with the tolerated ones from which five status classes are derived class 1 less than 0 5 times the tolerated frequency class 2 less than 1 time class 3 more than 1 time class 4 more than 1 2 times class 5 more than 2 times the tolerated frequency measured and modelled water quality status classes for three do cdf tables are shown in fig 6 where the black dot refers to the estimated class in the measurement dataset and the histogram shows the modelled status occurrence probability density low frequency i e 0 1 and 1 times year would require a longer time series to be estimated reliably 3 10 years yet the current status of the river presents a fairly low quality status for low frequency high magnitude oxygen depletion processes which was captured in both measured modelled series low magnitude high frequency events with short duration had a higher degree of uncertainty this concurs with the hypothesis that large do events have often a lower degree of uncertainty associated since the system is oversaturated and albeit the uncertainty sources a strong do depletion occurs yet low medium intensity events are often more sensitive to variability also the information compression in the status classes for cdf metrics creates a differential sensitivity class 5 captures a large range of system responses 2 times the allowed frequency meanwhile the occurrence of class 1 to class 4 has a shorter range 0 1 2 times the allowed frequency therefore systems with a poor environmental water quality status class 5 are easier to identify than those falling between good and medium status this implies that environmental status from cdf tables might not be the most appropriate metric to discriminate between the effects of different correction strategies i e when selecting between a new real time control strategy or infrastructure investment to reduce do depletion events a modeller could argue that the model performs well on the current system water quality status poor environmental conditions class 5 but stochastic predictions of system improvements class 1 4 have the potential to result in a wider uncertainty range probably beyond the marginal gain between alternatives 3 1 uncertainty source analysis by variance decomposition a variance decomposition scheme was applied to estimate the uncertainty contribution of different sources to the do simulated series the variance decomposition method provides a picture of the uncertainty contribution by source however it has certain limitations which should be acknowledged and carefully addressed first it provides a lumped variance contribution and thus identification of contribution at characteristic dynamic points proves difficult limiting its diagnostic power secondly it relies on certain hypotheses that might not be always met as independence of error sources or homoscedasticity which have the potential to distort the outcome thus checking their influence is recommended the design of this study tried to minimize the effect of these characteristics following the recommendations of willems 2012 fig 7 provides the relationship between the estimated variance at do and flow series in three representative points and the number of simulation samples this shows that the number of samples selected in the uncertainty decomposition scheme 250 per cluster was sufficient to provide a robust variance estimation the decomposition of the prior parameters and input uncertainty fig 8 shows that the river flow and water quality parameters are the contributors of roughly 70 of the total uncertainty meanwhile rainfall uncertainty and cso pollution parameters accounted for about 10 each on the other hand wwtp parameters and river inputs had a negligible effect on the global do uncertainty this shows that water quality and quantity river parameters captured most of the variability which is caused by a high sensitivity of do dynamics to the in river biological processes and the relative poor knowledge on the actual parameter distributions therefore we proposed a parametric inference process for the river parameters updating the prior assigned pdf s using local do and flow measurements in the river the inference process narrowed down the prior distribution of water quantity and quality parameters in the river thus reducing the contribution of the parametric uncertainty in the river section to 16 this reduction of parametric uncertainty was also transferred to the selected model measurement error model in the likelihood formulation which was captured in the variance decomposition scheme by the increase in the rest uncertainty term 18 in the posterior variance decomposition the contribution of rainfall uncertainty and the cso pollution modules increased to 20 30 respectively this shows that the do dynamics are overall heavily influenced by rainfall driven discharges wwtp and cso and especially by the water quality characteristics of the discharged volumes modelling cso pollution concentrations is a challenge in urban drainage modelling and render highly uncertain results sandoval et al 2018 thus further monitoring and modelling efforts are still required in this area rainfall data uncertainties are shown to be relatively influential in the do dynamics the selected rainfall input error model equation 1 was motivated by the deviations found at rainfall estimations from the radar and the interpolated rain gauge network nevertheless additional efforts should be directed to improve the quality of estimated rainfall inputs in the system the influence of the river submodel parameters is still not negligible 16 which is mostly due to the relatively uncertain river sediment oxygen demand parameter sod urban drainage parameters had a comparatively low contribution to the do variance 7 this might be explained by the fact that ud parameters largely influence cso discharge timing and shape yet have relatively low effect on total discharged volume during large storm events do dynamics in the receiving water body are known to be intensively time buffered by the nature of the process moreno rodenas et al 2017a thus pollutograph timing shape errors are less dominant than errors in volume mass estimation the comparison between lumped and hydrodynamic sewer water quantity modelling structures was not considered in this study the selection of model structure and associated uncertain parameters may affect these results yet it is expected that uncertainties in the water quality routine are significantly larger than those of water quantity for urban drainage modelling dotto et al 2012 the wwtp parameter set rendered a low contribution to the total variance 0 5 wwtp is however a highly relevant process in the system dynamics and its proper conceptualisation and calibration is of foremost importance also uncertainties associated with changes in regulations dominguez and gujer 2006 or operational changes can become dominant in certain scenarios and were here neglected this study only focused on the effect of wwtp influent and fractionation parameters which are reported to be some of the most relevant uncertainty sources belia et al 2009 in wwtp outputs yet wwtp influent fractionation parameters showed little influence in the modelling uncertainty for receiving water body do concentration in the river dommel few other studies exist that deal with uncertainty analysis of do dynamic modelling in urbanised river catchments for instance radwan et al 2004 presented a variance decomposition scheme for the modelling of do in a river catchment in belgium only the receiving water quality was modelled and cso and rural pollution sources were considered as model inputs they showed that roughly 30 of the variance of the process could be attributed to the river water quality parameters whereas the input pollution loads explained 60 of it also freni and mannina 2010 and freni and mannina 2012 performed an uncertainty analysis of a small integrated system containing two urban drainage systems 115 ha 9 000 inhabitants a wwtp and a river section in sicily italy the variance decomposition results showed that wwtp bod discharge uncertainties were dominated by upstream submodels e g sewer system or rainfall whereas wwtp parameters had a lower influence on the other hand they reported that uncertainties in the water quality quantity river parameters and the rest of the upstream submodels contributed 40 and 60 respectively to do uncertainty at the receiving water body willems 2008 also presented a small scale integrated catchment model simulating urban drainage and wwtp but not receiving water in which an uncertainty analysis scheme was proposed for several water quality variables tss ss bod and nh4 reporting that rainfall uncertainty contribution represents 10 20 of the variance in all variables simulated at the outlet of the wwtp although uncertainty contribution is largely a case dependent process our results showed a similar structure as in previously reported studies combined sewer overflow water quality characteristics and rainfall variability are the most relevant sources of uncertainty in do simulation for the river dommel in the studied period provided that a detailed study is directed to identify and calibrate the river water quality dynamic processes the applicability of many uncertainty analysis techniques deletic et al 2012 jakeman and jakeman 2017 is limited when dealing with large scale modelling applications this is mainly due to insufficient observational data and the computational effort required the example provided in this work shows as forward mc and variance decomposition schemes can be readily applied even for a computationally expensive systems i e using code parallelisation and efficient sampling schemes performing bayesian parameter inference is however prohibitive in most real world cases yet if carefully selecting a reduced number of parameters model emulation can be used to accelerate the inference sampling see emulators for hydrology machac et al 2016 machac et al 2018 hydrodynamic modelling moreno rodenas et al 2018a or for urban drainage inference wani et al 2017 in this study the effect of updating prior knowledge in a set of highly influential parameters using the full icm structure on the uncertainty contribution analysis was also shown nevertheless emulation strategies can only deal with low dimensional parameter sets thus inferring the full icm parametric space falls beyond current data and computational capabilities for most real world scale cases in this line muschalla et al 2009 discussed the process of abstracting icm studies reflecting about the need of partially calibrating or inferring sections of the full model based on intermediate measured state variables also available datasets render many processes unidentifiable this lack of knowledge should be accounted for during the uncertainty analysis scheme however process identifiability especially in sewer water quality dynamics still represent a major obstacle in the deployment of functional icms for environmental decision making support 4 conclusions this study presents an uncertainty analysis scheme of a large scale integrated catchment model the selected icm accounts for urban drainage 4400 ha wwtp 750 000 p e and receiving water processes in an intensively urbanised catchment in the south of the netherlands with the aim to simulate dissolved oxygen dynamics for ecological assessment an uncertainty decomposition scheme showed that the river water quality and quantity parameters are responsible for 70 of the uncertainty in do river simulations when using expert elicited literature based river parameter ranges a first reduction of the uncertainty was achieved through inferring the river parameter set using local measurement data which reduced its contribution to 16 cso water quality parameters were the most relevant source of uncertainty 30 indicating that monitoring and modelling efforts should be directed in that direction rainfall uncertainty accounted for roughly 20 of the variance in do simulations which was resultant of the relative disagreement of local rain gauge and radar rainfall estimations for the area our results showed similarities with previous reported studies for do uncertainty analysis in integrated catchment systems however the generalisation of these results to other cases should be performed carefully since the structure and mechanistic relationship of the system may vary significantly and this has the potential to influence the uncertainty distribution by source thus further uncertainty analysis studies in icms are still necessary the forward uncertainty propagation showed that the model structure lacks flexibility to accommodate seasonal winter do levels a suggested approach is to propose a time dependent sediment oxygen demand process yet this requires additional system observations also the study of uncertainty propagation in concentration duration frequency ecological status tables showed as low water quality status systems are easier to identify lower uncertainty associated than good moderate status however good and moderate water quality status are more sensitive to low do variability and thus the uncertainty tends to be larger limiting the identifiability of correction effects this should be acknowledged when reporting modelling results and should be accounted for by decision makers when

18807,receiving water quality simulation in highly urbanised areas requires the integration of several processes occurring at different space time scales these integrated catchment models deliver results with a significant uncertainty level associated still uncertainty analysis is seldom applied in practice and the relative contribution of the individual model elements is poorly understood often the available methods are applied to relatively small systems or individual sub systems due to limitations in organisational and computational resources consequently this work presents an uncertainty propagation and decomposition scheme of an integrated water quality modelling study for the evaluation of dissolved oxygen dynamics in a large scale urbanised river catchment in the netherlands forward propagation of the measured and elicited uncertainty input parametric distributions was proposed and contrasted with monitoring data series prior ranges for river water quality quantity parameters lead to high uncertainty in dissolved oxygen predictions thus the need for formal calibration to adapt to the local dynamics is highlighted after inferring the river process parameters with system measurements of flow and dissolved oxygen combined sewer overflow pollution loads became the dominant uncertainty source along with rainfall variability as a result insights gained in this paper can help in planning and directing further monitoring and modelling efforts in the system when comparing these modelling results to existing national guidelines it is shown that the commonly used concentration duration frequency tables should not be the only metric used to select mitigation alternatives and may need to be adapted in order to cope with uncertainties graphical abstract image 1 keywords uncertainty analysis integrated catchment modelling water quality urban water systems uncertainty decomposition 1 introduction meeting the established environmental regulations e g the water framework directive 2000 60 ec 200 of the european union is still a challenge in many densely urbanised catchments as it often requires the implementation of intensive investment and regulatory plans i e infrastructure construction control systems or user limitations model based decision making is applied more frequently to explore and optimise the effect of different alternatives aiming towards an efficient resource allocation therefore integrated catchment modelling icm has become an essential tool in the water quality management process over the last decades andrés doménech et al 2010 langeveld et al 2013b willems and berlamont 2002 icms are by definition abstractions of highly complex water systems usually constituted by the joint modelling of two or more subsystems of the urban water system keupers and willems 2017 rauch et al 2002 this often involves the joint simulation of sewer hydrodynamics wastewater treatment processes rural hydrology and river physical biochemical dynamics benedetti et al 2013a icms like every other modelling process contain various sources of uncertainty due to the inherent system characteristics complex processes are represented with limited knowledge relationships are calibrated with reduced data sets which may lead to a poorly identifiable parameterisation and linked simulations are carried out over a wide range of spatiotemporal scales also the stepwise process of abstraction from reality to model representation with its necessary simplifications and idealisations of the real systems includes the unavoidable occurrence of uncertainties muschalla et al 2009 these uncertainties encompass the errors introduced by model parameterisation model forcing data e g precipitation model input data e g digital elevation model soil or sewer conduit maps model validation data e g use of incorrect water level rating curves and model structures e g different mathematical representations the definition recognition and consideration of these uncertainties is therefore of the utmost importance for the application of such models and for the interpretation of the hereby obtained results pappenberger and beven 2006 schellart et al 2010 at present however a comprehensive uncertainty analysis is mainly applied in science and less in planning practice kleidorfer 2010 vanrolleghem 2011 several frameworks have been proposed to facilitate the quantification and handling of these uncertainties in integrated urban water systems specifically deletic et al 2012 tscheikner gratl et al 2017 or environmental modelling in general refsgaard et al 2007 the quantification of modelling statistical uncertainties is often carried out by encoding system knowledge through a probabilistic description reichert et al 2015 and sampling i e monte carlo to describe the variability at the targeted output variables additionally the identification of the contribution of each uncertainty source is essential in the system analysis process since it directs the modeller towards a rational reduction of epistemic uncertainties for instance willems 2012 presented a variance decomposition methodology to quantify the partial contribution of uncertainty by source reichert and mieleitner 2009 described the use of time dependent parameters as a proxy to detect temporal windows of structural mismatch pointing therefore at examining particular physical processes yang et al 2018 used glue to extract the sensitivity from process driven parameter structures inline with this gupta et al 2008 discussed the need of diagnosis tools to guide the model conceptualisation process examples of uncertainty analysis applications in integrated catchment modelling for water quality estimation are still scarce tscheickner gratl et al 2019 this is partially due to the significant amount of effort to monitor and set up large scale modelling studies also computational constraints have severely limited the applicability of proposed formal uncertainty analysis methodologies see schellart et al 2010 therefore only few examples are available in literature which deal with relatively small systems freni and mannina 2010 or with individual sub systems dotto et al 2012 radwan et al 2004 consequently this work describes the application of a formal uncertainty analysis scheme to quantify dissolved oxygen modelling uncertainties in a large scale 4400 ha of draining urban areas a 750 000 p e wwtp and a sensitive receiving water body water quality icm study the estimation of the relative contribution of different relevant uncertainty sources is also shown which served towards directing further modelling and monitoring efforts in the system initially the forward propagation of all sources of uncertainty was proposed using the best available literature expert measurement derived parametric input probability ranges this will be therein referred as prior propagation upon analysis of the uncertainty contribution by source river water quality and quantity parameters captured most of the variability of yearly dissolved oxygen do dynamics thus a dedicated inference scheme was proposed to update the river parametric distributions using local flow and do measurements the propagation of all parameter input uncertainties and the updated parameter set for the river submodel is here presented referred as posterior propagation comparison of the forward propagation from both prior posterior uncertainty distributions with system observations along with the current prioritisation of uncertainty sources is presented in this study complementarily the impact of modelling uncertainties in the concentration duration frequency environmental assessment metrics is discussed highlighting the possible implications of using such metrics in the selection of mitigation alternatives in environmental systems the discussion arising from this experience also serves to put into context the applicability of proposed uncertainty analysis techniques in real world scale icm studies 2 materials and methods the dommel is a stream discharge of 4 30 m3 s located in the south of the netherlands it receives the discharge of a wastewater treatment plant wwtp of 750 000 p e population equivalent and the intermittent discharge from 192 combined sewer overflow structures csos the water system covers and area of 800 km2 29 combined sewer systems 4400 ha of urban connected area and roughly 110 km of river tributaries fig 1 provides the layout of the system and the measurement locations pollution loads from the wwtp and cso discharges on the river are relatively common under wet weather conditions this causes oxygen depletion events which deteriorate the water quality status of the receiving water body the dommel water management authorities operate an integrated catchment model aiming to better understand local pollution dynamics and to test alternatives for improving the ecological status this integrated model consists of a a set of lumped urban drainage system models conceptualised as in solvi 2006 characterizing the 29 municipalities sewer gravity and pressurised transport network cso structures were represented by 30 clusters spatially lumping structures which shared the same sewer system section conceptual sewer models were derived using pre existing detailed hydrodynamic urban drainage models which have been checked on systematic errors during a prior model calibration using hydraulic monitoring data of the sewers such lumped structures highly simplify the underlying dynamics and their use should be justified for each application the system under consideration is nevertheless highly controlled and characterised by high in sewer static volumes also the simulation of dissolved oxygen processes at the river scale results in smoothed dynamics and are more sensitive to the overall discharged volume than to small errors in the timing and shape of the discharged hydrograph similar lumped approaches have been presented which correct for different dynamic phenomena e g back water effects or dynamic storage see wolfs et al 2013 or van daal rombouts et al 2016 b a fully detailed wwtp model including primary secondary and tertiary treatment with capacity for 26 000 m3 h and a controlled storm settling tank with a treatment capacity of 9 000 m3 h c a simplified river model consisting of a lumped conceptualisation of well stirred tank volumes as a 65 tank in series scheme which simulates water flow pollutant mass fluxes and conversion rates the physical and biochemical processes modelled at the river scale are presented in table b1 annex b which were adapted from the water quality module of duflow the full integrated model was build using west dhi simulation platform for icms a detailed description of the integrated catchment model structure and its development and validation process can be found at langeveld et al 2013b a description of the main spatial and temporal characteristic scales in the dommel system was reported in moreno rodenas et al 2017a the model structure was revisited sequentially identifying and analysing the major uncertainty sources for each submodel independently this is reported in tscheikner gratl et al 2017 where the application of the quantifying uncertainty in integrated catchment studies quics uncertainty framework was described for the dommel case study 2 1 experimental data integrated catchment studies require extensive observational datasets for their development langeveld et al 2013a table 1 shows the main characteristics of the measurement series made available by the dommel water management authority the wwtp effluent represents roughly 50 of the total river flow during dry weather flow in the summer period benedetti et al 2013b wwtp and csos discharges have the potential to locally saturate the river volume up to 90 of flow contribution at different river sections since urban areas present a faster runoff response than rural areas leading to large pollutant concentration peaks under heavy rainfall conditions up to 10 80 gbod m3 peaks at several sections of the river these heavy urban loads result in low dissolved oxygen concentrations at the receiving water body 5 go2 m3 average during summer and strong dissolved oxygen depletion processes leading to temporary anoxic conditions with recovery time ranging from hours to days cso flow data were estimated from depth measurements at the weir structures and approximated discharge relationships although such estimation may contain significant errors see van daal rombouts et al 2017 additional details on characteristic spatial and temporal scales observed in csos wwtp and the dommel river can be seen in moreno rodenas et al 2017a rainfall data was derived from two main sources a a network of 13 rain gauges mixing tipping buckets and weighting gauges from the dutch national meteorological institute knmi the municipality of eindhoven and the waterboard of the dommel b knmi distributed rainfall estimations from bias corrected single polarisation c band radar overeem et al 2009 2 2 parametric uncertainty table 2 provides the characterised parameter probability distribution for the urban drainage water flow submodel the most influential catchments were selected based on connected area and discharged volume contribution moreno rodenas et al 2017a uncertainties in wetting losses volume and availability total connected area in sewer maximum storage wastewater generation per inhabitant and reservoir constants of the lumped sewer system conceptualisation were considered those uncertainties were derived from expert knowledge in physical plausible constrained ranges table 3 presents the parameter distributions considered at the cso water quality generator this contains four fractionation parameters which were identified as a truncated gaussian distribution range 0 1 with a mean value provided by a non formal expert elicitation and a standard deviation of 10 the mean value modelling in sewer water quality dynamics is still a challenge willems 2006 and sufficient data was not available for a reliable submodel calibration the sewer transport system is characterised by long conduits up to 20 km mixing gravity and pressurised sections and it is heavily controlled thus the measured water quality at the wwtp influent is expected to render a low representativity of the conditions at the csos thus limiting the use of data driven generators keupers and willems 2015 in order to produce a robust estimation a mean pollutant vector multiplier emc was used to approximate cso loads from modelled flow dynamics a monitoring campaign in the dommel system reported measured pollutant series for various water quality variables relevant for the integrated model bod cod and nh4 at several cso events moens et al 2009 this allowed estimating pollutant probability distributions and correlation structures fig 2 a gaussian copula stochastic model was proposed to generate random pollutant event concentrations which respect the non gaussian marginal distributions and its correlation structure the stochastic model was based on the following hypotheses a pollutant mean concentration remains fairly constant over the cso event duration in the system of the dommel reported by van daal rombouts 2017 b the studied cso locations have comparable pollution dynamics over time van daal rombouts 2017 and c the instantaneous pollution concentration was assumed to be spatially independent since we could not establish a clear pattern from the available data these assumptions are case study dependent also the inclusion of a by location correlation could be readily accounted for by the copula joint probability distribution provided additional system measurements would prove its existence a comparison of the measured and copula sampled pollutant estimation can be found in moreno rodenas et al 2017b since no onsite measurements for cso dissolved oxygen concentrations were available literature values were applied boomen and icke 2004 diaz fierros et al 2002 thus cso dissolved oxygen concentrations were characterised by a uniform distribution u 3 6 go2 m3 table a1 and table a2 annex a show the uncertainty distributions associated with the wwtp submodel parameter distributions for the wwtp influent model table a1 were taken from langeveld et al 2017 which used several observed influent time series to estimate the model parameters in a bayesian inference scheme these parameters were described using a normally distributed density function truncated between 0 and 1 with mean the average of each posterior sample chain of the mcmc and standard deviation of 5 from the mean value the full posterior chains were not available so an estimated normal distribution was used to represent the influent parameters around the inferred mean values estimated from langeveld et al 2017 the effect of this approximation in the results of this work was nevertheless considered negligible table 4 shows the prior parameter probability distributions assigned to the hydrologic flow and biochemical process models of the river prior distributions were defined from expert knowledge and literature sediment oxygen demand sod was measured in the system by the waterboard de dommel the river model parameters were later inferred using a bayesian inference scheme from flow and do measurements at the closing section of the catchment between 15 jan 2012 until 04 aug 2012 and validated with additional observations 05 jan 2012 until 31 dec 2012 a polynomial chaos expansion emulator was used to accelerate the sampling of the computationally expensive model during the inference process moreno rodenas et al 2018b this rendered an updated joint parameter distribution set which was later propagated through the full icm by drawing correlated samples from the posterior parameter chains table 5 presents the parameter distributions used for the rural to river baseflow inflow pollutant loads values were estimated by expert elicitation since no measurements were available 2 3 dynamic input uncertainty errors in measured or estimated time dependent inputs were represented as stochastic processes random sampling was applied to generate input realisation ensembles table a3 presents the selected most relevant input processes in the system tscheikner gratl et al 2017 rainfall uncertain realisations were sampled at the 9 largest catchment areas which covered 3 930 ha of a total connected area of 4 400 ha approx 90 rainfall intensity at the spatial block support of each individual catchment was extracted from the knmi corrected radar measurements 1 k m 2 5 min using hourly accumulation moreno rodenas et al 2017a an additive error model dependent on rainfall intensity was applied as proposed by freni and mannina 2010 1 r i t r r a d i t 1 ε r r a d i t a i f 12 h r r g i r r a d i d t 10 m m u 0 9 min r r g i t r r a d i t 1 1 max r r g i t r r a d i t e l s e in which the instantaneous estimated rainfall intensity r r a d i t at each urban drainage location i was corrected by a random normally distributed error ε n μ 0 σ 0 12 for a 0 2323 this error model approximates a normal dispersion around the measured value which parameters were fitted by comparing radar rain gauge series at the same location the comparison between estimated rainfall from rain gauges and radar sources showed large differences especially during heavy convective storm processes see bottom left event at fig a1 annex a this measured difference could not be represented by the additive error structure alone thus a miss detection error structure was also applied the system characteristics cause csos in the area to be usually activated after rainfall volumes larger than 8 10 mm and pumping capacities are designed to empty in sewer storage in 10 12 h therefore rainfall estimation differences were considered large when data sources radar and rain gauge inverse distance weighted interpolated values had a cumulative difference larger than 10 mm within 12 h in such cases the rainfall input ensemble is updated by sampling from a uniform distribution covering both estimations interpolated rain gauge network radar equation 1 figs a1 and a2 annex a show the rainfall input ensemble generated at four characteristic rainfall periods for the municipalities of eindhoven 2000 ha and bergeijk 110 ha biochemical processes at the river stretch are highly influenced by water temperature which results in daily and seasonal variation there were five temperature stations along the river section of interest with hourly measurements a spatially homogeneous gaussian process gp was used to characterize the water temperature input uncertainty 2 t t g p t t σ t with the average temperature between the five sensors t t as the mean of the process and covariance matrix described by a squared exponential structure 3 σ t i j σ t i σ t j e 0 5 t d 24 2 where σ t i is the measured by location temperature standard deviation at time i and j and t d the time lag the river solar radiation input i o m e a s u r e d was measured at the knmi meteorological station at the city of eindhoven this measured data were used as a spatially homogeneous and time dynamic input for the entire river domain an error model consisting in a normally distributed multiplier was used 4 i o i o m e a s u r e d n d μ 1 σ σ i o 2 i water temperature at the wastewater treatment works was measured and used as input in the treatment process model a multiplicative independent gaussian error was implemented as 5 t

the parameters σ i o 0 15 and σ t e m p w w t p 0 05 were assigned based on expected sensor representativity 2 4 forward uncertainty propagation a monte carlo mc based forward uncertainty propagation was performed using measured and expert elicited parametric input uncertainty probability distributions for the full year of 2012 parametric samples were generated from a latin hypercube sampler lhs to generate a low discrepancy set dynamic inputs were sampled independently from the proposed stochastic processes a first set of 600 samples was drawn from the full integrated model in parallel model instances to characterize modelled river flow and dissolved oxygen concentration uncertainties at the closing section of the catchment m 0121 fig 1 using the best available prior knowledge on the system a bayesian inference scheme was used to update the parametric distribution of several hydraulic and biochemical river model parameters table 4 given local observations in the system moreno rodenas et al 2018b first four river flow parameters were inferred using a heteroscedastic independent gaussian log likelihood distribution and drawing 50 000 posterior samples secondly setting the inferred flow parameters an independently identically distributed gaussian log likelihood was used to sample from the posterior distribution of 8 water quality parameters 50 000 samples the posterior residual structure respected the assumptions of the assumed error generating process although a certain residual correlation was still present the updated river submodel parameters was used to generate 600 additional samples from the model by drawing correlated samples from the river submodel inferred parameter mcmc chains from the copula distribution at the cso pollutant stochastic model ensembles from the time dependent inputs and from a lhs for the rest of the parameters both prior and posterior parameter distributions were compared with monitoring data available in the system 2 5 uncertainty analysis by variance decomposition a variance decomposition scheme was proposed following willems 2012 this is based on defining independent groups of submodels or parameter input clusters and analysing its contribution to the total residual error variance seven contributing groups were defined by selecting each submodel most relevant parameters input sources table a4 annex a a period of 2 months 05 aug 2012 07 oct 2012 was simulated which captured several summer oxygen depletion processes representative of the dynamics of interest 15 time points which were temporally independent and represented relevant dynamics were selected to perform the decomposition of variance as 6 σ e y e y 0 2 σ e y r e s t v a r 2 σ e y 0 2 i 1 7 σ e y c l u s t e r i 2 for which σ e y e y 0 2 represent the variance of the model observation residuals which were computed during the forward propagation of all considered stochastic input and parametric uncertainty sources the total residual variance is assumed to be composed of σ e y 0 2 variance of the measurement error σ e y c l u s t e r i 2 the partial variance of each selected parameter input group propagating the effect of the group meanwhile fixing the rest to their average value and a term σ e y r e s t v a r 2 which represents the rest variance not explained by measurement or input parameters σ e y r e s t v a r 2 was computed by estimating all other terms all variances should be homoscedastic a box cox transformation is often applied when data shows variance dependency a very mild heteroscedasticity was found in the do simulated residuals which was corrected using a λ 0 9 box cox a dedicated data quality validation was performed to the do measurement series in this period and the quality was expected to be high tolerances between 3 and 10 are often accepted in do concentration measurements thus a multiplicative random gaussian error σ d o t d o t 0 05 was applied to estimate σ e y 0 2 samples were drawn from a lhs 250 samples varying every parameter input cluster to characterize the partial variance σ e y c l u s t e r i 2 the reader is directed to willems 2012 or freni and mannina 2010 for further detail in the variance decomposition approach 3 results and discussion uncertainty ranges for all relevant parameters and input sources were propagated through the full integrated model structure fig 3 presents the observed series of flow and do at the final section of the system m 0121 fig 1 along with the mean of the simulated series and the 95 uncertainty range steming from the input parametric variability when using all available prior knowledge in the system the proposed model structure captures the flow dynamics in the river submodel which are mainly driven by the baseflow inputs from the rural hydrology and the discharges from the wwtp c a 40 50 of baseflow during summer reasonably well nash sutcliffe efficiency of 0 82 0 86 at the inferred and validation series respectively the prior forward propagation of do dynamics resulted in a relatively large dispersion the 95 interval distance between model samples had a yearly average range of 3 7 go2 m3 σ 0 76 go2 m3 the 95 range was 3 go2 m3 for do concentration lower than 2 5 go2 m3 using the inferred water quality parameters the 95 range was reduced to 1 8 gdo m3 σ 0 42 gdo m3 fig 4 provides the comparison of measured and modelled do using the posterior forward propagation for a time window during the summer period between july and october figure c1 and figure c2 annex c present the simulated rainfall do measured modelled and the bod dynamics at two sections of the river discharged bod can reach high concentrations up to 10 60 gbod m3 at the receiving water body local measurements of bod were not available at this period but a monitoring campaign carried out during 2007 2008 moens et al 2009 reported peaks of the same order of magnitude up to 10 80 gbod m3 consumption of high bod loads is the dominant process in the acute do depletion a fraction of the bod load settles and degrades in the river bed which dominates the speed of the do recovery process which can take between hours to days the depth and recovery pattern of most do depletion processes are captured by the simulated and measured series root mean squared error of 1 25 1 6 go2 m3 during the inferred and validation time periods respectively yet a few events show insufficient depletion in the model fig 4 this can suggest that a certain process might be missing in the model structure description i e insufficient wwtp loads under certain conditions or a stronger rural contribution however not enough system data was available to further validate those hypotheses for instance during the timespan between the 19th and the 29th of november 2012 three acute oxygen depletion processes occurred which were not captured by the model response in both scenarios fig 3 cso discharges were not reported during this time the same depletion process was captured by an upstream do sensor located between the wwtp and the m 0121 sensor but not by other sensors distributed throughout the system during this period only minor inflow c a 12 000 m3 h was recorded at the influent of the wwtp with 35 000 m3 h maximum capacity thus this oxygen depletion events could only be explained either by a major disturbance in the wwtp operations which is not supported by effluent wwtp measurements of tss nh4 or cod or a disturbance in the sediment bed of the river i e dredging or mowing which has been confirmed to have occurred by the waterboard de dommel those processes were not described in the model structure and hence could not be captured by the simulation response this type of events were not reported in monitoring data for previous years thus were neglected in this study yet this can become a relevant source of structural uncertainty and should be further investigated fig 5 presents the cumulative probability density function of the yearly measured and modelled do flow series along with the 95 ranges when performing the posterior propagation after inferring the parameter distributions for the river quantity and quality submodel parameters the uncertainty band was significantly reduced the average 95 uncertainty range was reduced from 3 7 go2 m3 to 1 8 go2 m3 and the two sample kolmogorov smirnov ks test rendered that for 99 5 of the time steps the null hypothesis both forward propagations render the same probability distribution is rejected with p value 0 001 and mean k s value of 0 27 this can be explained by the fact that the ranges attributed to the river parameters prior knowledge where narrowed down by the information provided in river do flow measurements the mean simulated series for flow in both cases represented reasonably well the occurrence probability of high and medium hydrographs yet there was a systematic overestimation of low flows river flow below 3 4 m3 s which is likely caused by an overestimation of the rural dry weather contribution yet this is expected to have a limited influence in do depletion dynamics which occur mainly during wet weather conditions the model exhibited a systematic underestimation of high dissolved oxygen concentration this is seen during winter months fig 3 the seasonal do variation in the model structure was captured by several factors i e a constant sediment oxygen demand sod see table b1 process number 5 and temperature driven inhibition coefficients for oxidation rates and reaeration patterns sod dynamics were estimated from system observations and we tried to respect the reported values the inferred probability distributions for the biochemical river parameters could still not match the high do concentration fig 5 b well enough this suggests that either the base do inflows are underestimated in the current version of the model e g too low wwtp do effluent rural do for which there were not reliable measurements or that there is a structural process missing in the river conceptualisation e g a stronger winter summer sediment oxygen demand variability nonetheless the accurate simulation of high do concentration is of little interest for the model application on the other hand low do level yearly probability was better matched as can be seen in fig 5 the information from modelled observed time series in river water quality assessment studies is often compressed for system evaluation down to a low number of performance indicators a common reporting method for river water quality status within the eu water framework directive compliance is the use of concentration duration frequency cdf tables fwr 2012 limit levels are commonly extracted from an ecological assessment study which defines survival conditions for critical species table b2 presents the environmental cdf tables for three levels of water quality compliance basic critical and salmonid in the river dommel exceedance frequencies are computed and contrasted with the tolerated ones from which five status classes are derived class 1 less than 0 5 times the tolerated frequency class 2 less than 1 time class 3 more than 1 time class 4 more than 1 2 times class 5 more than 2 times the tolerated frequency measured and modelled water quality status classes for three do cdf tables are shown in fig 6 where the black dot refers to the estimated class in the measurement dataset and the histogram shows the modelled status occurrence probability density low frequency i e 0 1 and 1 times year would require a longer time series to be estimated reliably 3 10 years yet the current status of the river presents a fairly low quality status for low frequency high magnitude oxygen depletion processes which was captured in both measured modelled series low magnitude high frequency events with short duration had a higher degree of uncertainty this concurs with the hypothesis that large do events have often a lower degree of uncertainty associated since the system is oversaturated and albeit the uncertainty sources a strong do depletion occurs yet low medium intensity events are often more sensitive to variability also the information compression in the status classes for cdf metrics creates a differential sensitivity class 5 captures a large range of system responses 2 times the allowed frequency meanwhile the occurrence of class 1 to class 4 has a shorter range 0 1 2 times the allowed frequency therefore systems with a poor environmental water quality status class 5 are easier to identify than those falling between good and medium status this implies that environmental status from cdf tables might not be the most appropriate metric to discriminate between the effects of different correction strategies i e when selecting between a new real time control strategy or infrastructure investment to reduce do depletion events a modeller could argue that the model performs well on the current system water quality status poor environmental conditions class 5 but stochastic predictions of system improvements class 1 4 have the potential to result in a wider uncertainty range probably beyond the marginal gain between alternatives 3 1 uncertainty source analysis by variance decomposition a variance decomposition scheme was applied to estimate the uncertainty contribution of different sources to the do simulated series the variance decomposition method provides a picture of the uncertainty contribution by source however it has certain limitations which should be acknowledged and carefully addressed first it provides a lumped variance contribution and thus identification of contribution at characteristic dynamic points proves difficult limiting its diagnostic power secondly it relies on certain hypotheses that might not be always met as independence of error sources or homoscedasticity which have the potential to distort the outcome thus checking their influence is recommended the design of this study tried to minimize the effect of these characteristics following the recommendations of willems 2012 fig 7 provides the relationship between the estimated variance at do and flow series in three representative points and the number of simulation samples this shows that the number of samples selected in the uncertainty decomposition scheme 250 per cluster was sufficient to provide a robust variance estimation the decomposition of the prior parameters and input uncertainty fig 8 shows that the river flow and water quality parameters are the contributors of roughly 70 of the total uncertainty meanwhile rainfall uncertainty and cso pollution parameters accounted for about 10 each on the other hand wwtp parameters and river inputs had a negligible effect on the global do uncertainty this shows that water quality and quantity river parameters captured most of the variability which is caused by a high sensitivity of do dynamics to the in river biological processes and the relative poor knowledge on the actual parameter distributions therefore we proposed a parametric inference process for the river parameters updating the prior assigned pdf s using local do and flow measurements in the river the inference process narrowed down the prior distribution of water quantity and quality parameters in the river thus reducing the contribution of the parametric uncertainty in the river section to 16 this reduction of parametric uncertainty was also transferred to the selected model measurement error model in the likelihood formulation which was captured in the variance decomposition scheme by the increase in the rest uncertainty term 18 in the posterior variance decomposition the contribution of rainfall uncertainty and the cso pollution modules increased to 20 30 respectively this shows that the do dynamics are overall heavily influenced by rainfall driven discharges wwtp and cso and especially by the water quality characteristics of the discharged volumes modelling cso pollution concentrations is a challenge in urban drainage modelling and render highly uncertain results sandoval et al 2018 thus further monitoring and modelling efforts are still required in this area rainfall data uncertainties are shown to be relatively influential in the do dynamics the selected rainfall input error model equation 1 was motivated by the deviations found at rainfall estimations from the radar and the interpolated rain gauge network nevertheless additional efforts should be directed to improve the quality of estimated rainfall inputs in the system the influence of the river submodel parameters is still not negligible 16 which is mostly due to the relatively uncertain river sediment oxygen demand parameter sod urban drainage parameters had a comparatively low contribution to the do variance 7 this might be explained by the fact that ud parameters largely influence cso discharge timing and shape yet have relatively low effect on total discharged volume during large storm events do dynamics in the receiving water body are known to be intensively time buffered by the nature of the process moreno rodenas et al 2017a thus pollutograph timing shape errors are less dominant than errors in volume mass estimation the comparison between lumped and hydrodynamic sewer water quantity modelling structures was not considered in this study the selection of model structure and associated uncertain parameters may affect these results yet it is expected that uncertainties in the water quality routine are significantly larger than those of water quantity for urban drainage modelling dotto et al 2012 the wwtp parameter set rendered a low contribution to the total variance 0 5 wwtp is however a highly relevant process in the system dynamics and its proper conceptualisation and calibration is of foremost importance also uncertainties associated with changes in regulations dominguez and gujer 2006 or operational changes can become dominant in certain scenarios and were here neglected this study only focused on the effect of wwtp influent and fractionation parameters which are reported to be some of the most relevant uncertainty sources belia et al 2009 in wwtp outputs yet wwtp influent fractionation parameters showed little influence in the modelling uncertainty for receiving water body do concentration in the river dommel few other studies exist that deal with uncertainty analysis of do dynamic modelling in urbanised river catchments for instance radwan et al 2004 presented a variance decomposition scheme for the modelling of do in a river catchment in belgium only the receiving water quality was modelled and cso and rural pollution sources were considered as model inputs they showed that roughly 30 of the variance of the process could be attributed to the river water quality parameters whereas the input pollution loads explained 60 of it also freni and mannina 2010 and freni and mannina 2012 performed an uncertainty analysis of a small integrated system containing two urban drainage systems 115 ha 9 000 inhabitants a wwtp and a river section in sicily italy the variance decomposition results showed that wwtp bod discharge uncertainties were dominated by upstream submodels e g sewer system or rainfall whereas wwtp parameters had a lower influence on the other hand they reported that uncertainties in the water quality quantity river parameters and the rest of the upstream submodels contributed 40 and 60 respectively to do uncertainty at the receiving water body willems 2008 also presented a small scale integrated catchment model simulating urban drainage and wwtp but not receiving water in which an uncertainty analysis scheme was proposed for several water quality variables tss ss bod and nh4 reporting that rainfall uncertainty contribution represents 10 20 of the variance in all variables simulated at the outlet of the wwtp although uncertainty contribution is largely a case dependent process our results showed a similar structure as in previously reported studies combined sewer overflow water quality characteristics and rainfall variability are the most relevant sources of uncertainty in do simulation for the river dommel in the studied period provided that a detailed study is directed to identify and calibrate the river water quality dynamic processes the applicability of many uncertainty analysis techniques deletic et al 2012 jakeman and jakeman 2017 is limited when dealing with large scale modelling applications this is mainly due to insufficient observational data and the computational effort required the example provided in this work shows as forward mc and variance decomposition schemes can be readily applied even for a computationally expensive systems i e using code parallelisation and efficient sampling schemes performing bayesian parameter inference is however prohibitive in most real world cases yet if carefully selecting a reduced number of parameters model emulation can be used to accelerate the inference sampling see emulators for hydrology machac et al 2016 machac et al 2018 hydrodynamic modelling moreno rodenas et al 2018a or for urban drainage inference wani et al 2017 in this study the effect of updating prior knowledge in a set of highly influential parameters using the full icm structure on the uncertainty contribution analysis was also shown nevertheless emulation strategies can only deal with low dimensional parameter sets thus inferring the full icm parametric space falls beyond current data and computational capabilities for most real world scale cases in this line muschalla et al 2009 discussed the process of abstracting icm studies reflecting about the need of partially calibrating or inferring sections of the full model based on intermediate measured state variables also available datasets render many processes unidentifiable this lack of knowledge should be accounted for during the uncertainty analysis scheme however process identifiability especially in sewer water quality dynamics still represent a major obstacle in the deployment of functional icms for environmental decision making support 4 conclusions this study presents an uncertainty analysis scheme of a large scale integrated catchment model the selected icm accounts for urban drainage 4400 ha wwtp 750 000 p e and receiving water processes in an intensively urbanised catchment in the south of the netherlands with the aim to simulate dissolved oxygen dynamics for ecological assessment an uncertainty decomposition scheme showed that the river water quality and quantity parameters are responsible for 70 of the uncertainty in do river simulations when using expert elicited literature based river parameter ranges a first reduction of the uncertainty was achieved through inferring the river parameter set using local measurement data which reduced its contribution to 16 cso water quality parameters were the most relevant source of uncertainty 30 indicating that monitoring and modelling efforts should be directed in that direction rainfall uncertainty accounted for roughly 20 of the variance in do simulations which was resultant of the relative disagreement of local rain gauge and radar rainfall estimations for the area our results showed similarities with previous reported studies for do uncertainty analysis in integrated catchment systems however the generalisation of these results to other cases should be performed carefully since the structure and mechanistic relationship of the system may vary significantly and this has the potential to influence the uncertainty distribution by source thus further uncertainty analysis studies in icms are still necessary the forward uncertainty propagation showed that the model structure lacks flexibility to accommodate seasonal winter do levels a suggested approach is to propose a time dependent sediment oxygen demand process yet this requires additional system observations also the study of uncertainty propagation in concentration duration frequency ecological status tables showed as low water quality status systems are easier to identify lower uncertainty associated than good moderate status however good and moderate water quality status are more sensitive to low do variability and thus the uncertainty tends to be larger limiting the identifiability of correction effects this should be acknowledged when reporting modelling results and should be accounted for by decision makers when

18808,differential uv absorbance δa is an important indicator that could allow operators and utility managers to routinely monitor disinfection by product dbp concentrations even in real time applications without the limitations of regulatory sampling and analyses while determination coefficients between differential uv absorbance at a single wavelength often 272 nm and chlorination dbp concentrations are usually very high r2 0 90 the fitting parameters of these relationships vary from one water source to another or vary within the same water source depending on the time of year the objectives of this study are to apply multiple regression models to a rich database of δa and dbps trihalomethanes thms and haloacetic acids haas that was generated from lab experiments using multiple waters with low bromide concentrations in order to identify wavelengths that improve the applicability of dbp δa relationships as well as develop a widely applicable multi wavelength dbp δa relationship the results show that using δa at two wavelengths in addition to initial absorbance a at one wavelength greatly improves the determination coefficients of the relationships when compared with the best possible single wavelength relationships the significant predictors identified are a270 δa270 and δa425 for thms a255 δa255 and δa425 for dcaa a250 δa250 and δa425 for tcaa and a250 δa250 and δa425 for haa6 this paper also discusses the applicability of the models developed for predicting dbps in treatment plants and drinking water as well as their limitations and the required future research to improve their performance keywords disinfection by products differential absorbance chlorination dbp modelling multilinear regression 1 introduction monitoring disinfection by products dbps beyond routine drinking water regulatory requirements has proven to be a challenge because of the costs and amount of labor associated with sampling handling and analyzing samples technologies such as online trihalomethane thm analysers or the hach total thm colorimetric method have provided a way to more frequently monitor the often regulated thms bailey et al 2014 reckhow and dozier 2018 reckhow and pierce 1992 however none of these technologies provide information on other regulated dbps such as the haloacetic acids haas or on unregulated dbps such as haloacetonitriles hans halonitromethanes hnms haloacetamides hams and haloketones hks differential uv absorbance δa has been proposed korshin et al 2002a 1996 yan et al 2014 as an indicator for estimating various regulated and unregulated dbp concentrations korshin et al 2002b most studies have established a linear relationship between dbp concentrations and δa at a single wavelength of 272 nm with very high determination coefficients r2 of usually 0 90 the reason for the choice of this wavelength is that it follows the empirical observation of the maximum differential absorbance around this wavelength korshin et al 2002a although the δa peak may be observed between 250 nm and 280 nm roccaro et al 2008b zhang et al 2010 the uv absorbance of natural waters between 250 and 280 nm is usually considered to be an indicator of the concentration of aromatic structures traina et al 1990 a known chlorine reactive site of natural organic matter nom gallard and von gunten 2002 norwood et al 1980 reckhow et al 1990 power functions using δa at 272 nm have also been used to model dbp δa relationships with better determination coefficients korshin et al 2002b roccaro et al 2011 2008a in power functions the slope of the dbp δa relationships increases with increasing δa this is interpreted as a clue that a significant amount of precursors with absorbance at this wavelength termed fast chromophore must react and form an intermediate product termed slow chromophore that eventually releases the measured dbp the existence of such intermediate product is consistent with results from korshin et al 2007 2004 2000 and roccaro et al 2013 2008a assuming the reaction of the intermediate product is the limiting step the slope of the single wavelength dbp δa relationships increases with increasing δa resulting in a curved relationship linear dbp δa relationships previously reported would simply be part of a curvilinear relationship for which data were collected after the fast chromophore has mostly disappeared nonetheless single wavelength dbp δa relationships have been shown to be specific to location and season beauchamp et al 2018b 2018a korshin and chang 2008 özdemir et al 2013 roccaro et al 2008a roccaro and vagliasindi 2009 in an effort to make the dbp δa relationships more generally applicable yan et al 2014 suggested the use of a dbp δa linear relationship at a wavelength of 350 nm on log transformed absorbance spectra the slopes of the relationships for thms haas and hans were well correlated with the log transformed absorbance at 350 nm before chlorination this method hence results in the use of log transformed absorbance at a single wavelength 350 nm to predict dbp concentrations roccaro et al 2015 also developed a similar approach using log transformed spectra to predict dbp yields μg dbp mg doc that nonetheless requires doc measurements to predict dbp concentrations finally indicators of dbp concentrations based on the fluorescence of nom have also been suggested roccaro et al 2009 yang et al 2015 fluorescence of nom has been studied extensively as a tool to identify nom components yang et al 2015 and to associate these components to dbp formation potential li et al 2016 peleato and andrews 2015 pifer et al 2013 pifer and fairey 2012 however despite the interesting potential of fluorescence only a few studies fabbricino et al 2019 roccaro et al 2009 roccaro and vagliasindi 2010 have so far suggested a differential fluorescence index akin to δa that could be used to predict dbp concentrations an indicator of dbp concentrations solely based on spectrophotometric measurements such as the one developed by yan et al 2014 that is applicable to waters with a wide variety of physicochemical characteristics and that could be applied in real time online uv visible absorbance probes or at a higher frequency than regulatory sampling would be a valuable tool the objectives of the current study were to develop and apply multiple regression models with more than one wavelength to find a more widely applicable relationship between dbp concentrations and δa specific objectives were 1 to identify the wavelengths that will improve and generalize the conventional single wavelength dbp δa model 2 to determine if multi wavelength relationships perform well for different types of waters used in the calibration process of the model unbiased model 3 to determine if the calibrated dbp δa relationships can be applied to different waters without any calibration test the model on a new dataset 2 methodology 2 1 jar tests and chlorination experiment design in order to build the database with results from a variety of source waters and water treatment conditions 6 different surface waters were collected over a period of 16 months including 3 waters from the same source collected at different times of the year see table 1 these waters were subjected to coagulation flocculation in a jar test apparatus with varying coagulant doses and phs filtered through 0 7 μm glass microfiber filters and chlorinated for varying lengths of time between 0 5 and 48 h two artificial waters consisted of different mixtures of nom from the suwannee river usa nom ro isolate 2r101n and fulvic acid standard 3s101f in a milliq water matrix as well as kaolin and sodium bicarbonate for particle and alkalinity components respectively these synthetic waters assure reproducibility if others wish to replicate the experiment the complete detailed recipes of the artificial waters are presented in the supplementary information table s1 and supplementary text 1 jar tests were conducted on a phipps and bird 7790 400 stirrer in order to produce pre treated waters with varying nom quantity and quality as measured by dissolved organic carbon doc and uv absorbance at 254 nm uv254 a total of 45 different pre treated waters made up of different raw waters coagulation phs and coagulant doses were produced table s2 in supplementary information jar tests with water from du nord river were conducted in a controlled temperature basin at the equivalent raw water temperature while other experiments were conducted at room temperature 21 c the temperature of the jaune lake water varied from 5 c in the beginning to 8 c at the end of the jar test experiment because of the absence of a temperature control device square beakers of 2 l each phipps and bird b ker2 were used for the jar tests the coagulant used was alum the desired coagulation ph was achieved using volumes pre determined by titration of 1n solutions of naoh or h2so4 appropriate volumes of a 30 g l alum solution as al2 so4 3 14h2o were added at t 0 to obtain the desired alum dose a volume of 0 25 ml of a 2 g l cationic polymer solution 0 25 mg l dose was added at t 2 min the rotation speed was lowered from 100 rpm to 10 rpm at t 3 min for flocculation the jar tests were stopped at t 13 min and the waters were filtered immediately samples for doc and uv analyses were collected after filtration and the remaining water was put in 500 ml dark glass bottles for chlorination experiments all chlorination experiments were conducted at ph 7 phosphate buffer concentration of 1 5 mm the initial chlorine doses varied from 3 0 to 5 0 mg l and were added as part of a 50 g l stock solution of sodium hypochlorite using a 50 μl syringe chlorination aimed to reproduce the chlorination conditions of a treatment plant taking its raw water from the du nord river specifically the volume of each chlorine dose was determined based on the objective of having a free chlorine residual of 1 00 mg l after 48 h the bottles were closed with a water and air tight cap and incubated in the dark at 23 c except for the two waters collected in the winter which were incubated at 4 c chlorination lasted for approximately 0 5 1 2 6 24 and 48 h although not all reaction times were performed in all chlorination experiments five reaction times were used for water 6 and three reaction times were used for waters 7 and 8 a blank sample consisting of milliq water with phosphate buffer was also chlorinated under the same conditions when the reaction time of a bottle was reached 0 5 1 2 6 24 or 48 h the free chlorine residual concentration was measured then 40 ml glass vials pre dosed with an excess of ammonium chloride quenching agent were filled and sealed for further dbp analyses in the water left in the bottle the free chlorine residual was quenched with a stoichiometric volume of a 10 g l solution of sodium sulphite 1 mol na2so3 mol cl2 in order to avoid uv interference from free chlorine and from extra sulphite as explained elsewhere beauchamp et al 2018b uv visible absorbance spectra were measured after at least 20 min to allow the quenching agent to reduce the free chlorine completely a total of 230 post chlorination uv visible absorbance spectra were obtained as a result of the 45 different pre treated waters chlorinated at different contact times 2 2 analytical procedures free chlorine residuals were measured using the dpd colorimetric method with a hach dr 900 colorimeter 0 02 mg l and ph was measured using a thermo scientific orion 8157bnumd ross ph meter uv visible absorbance of the filtered samples between wavelengths of 200 and 600 nm were obtained using 1 5 or 10 cm quartz cells and a double beam agilent cary 100 uv vis spectrophotometer at a spectral bandwith of 2 nm 0 002 absorbance units blanks and baseline samples consisted of milliq water doc analysis was conducted with a sievers 5310c laboratory toc analyser and thm and haa analyses were conducted by gas chromatography with electrical current detection gc ecd based on the methods and procedures described elsewhere beauchamp et al 2018b the analysed thms included the usual chlorinated and brominated ones thm4 and the haas included the five us regulated chlorinated and brominated haas haa5 plus bromochloroacetic acid the recoveries for thms and haas were between 80 and 120 2 3 data analysis and regression methodology differential absorbance at a given wavelength was calculated by the initial absorbance minus the final absorbance at that wavelength for each of the 230 samples a database consisting of pre treated water absorbance spectra differential absorbance spectra and thm and haa concentrations was built 2 3 1 wavelength selection in order to find the best wavelength for dbp δa relationships on the complete database a linear regression with differential absorbance at one wavelength was performed at all possible wavelengths 200 600 nm for every individual dbp measured and for the commonly used sum of regulated dbp concentrations thm4 and haa5 multilinear regression was applied to all possible pairs of differential absorbance values in order to identify the wavelength pair that performs the best at predicting dbp concentrations finally based on the previous results a third wavelength was added to the wavelength pair that performed the best to see if it could further improve the prediction of dbp concentrations this approach is different from the previous approach that lead to the selection of predictors based on observations of the features peaks slopes etc of the differential absorbance spectra in a sense the choice of the predictors in previous literature is initially biased toward observable features of the spectra while the approach proposed in this paper is only guided by model performance absorbance of the water before chlorination a was also tested in the regression to see if it could improve the dbp δa relationships one might expect different dbp yields from two waters with the same δa but with a different a hence the inclusion of a in the models the predictors a and δa were considered significant when their p value testing the null hypothesis that the parameter value is 0 with t test was less than 0 01 however because δa at different wavelengths can be highly correlated the regression parameters βn of a multilinear regression obtained using equation 1 can be very high and extremely sensitive to the data used in the regression equation 2 a and b where x is an n x 2 matrix of independent variables y is the column vector of n dependant variable observations x 1y and x 2y are the elements of the x y vector and r is the correlation coefficient between two independent variables show that for a linear regression with 2 coefficients β1 and β2 when r2 12 1 the uncertainty on regression parameters βn and on predictions made by the obtained relationship is in these cases very large 1 β x x 1 x y 2a β 1 x 1 y r 12 x 2 y 1 r 12 2 2b β 2 x 2 y r 12 x 1 y 1 r 12 2 one method to avoid this high sensitivity is to use the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator lasso regression tibshirani 1996 this linear regression method does not seek to minimize only the sum of square errors sse as multilinear regression does but rather has an objective function in the form of equation 3 where the vector β is the vector of the p regression parameters and λ represents the regularization parameter the lasso regression objective function is a compromise between prediction performance minimizing sse and small regression parameters minimizing the norm of vector β where λ represents the emphasis put on the second objective filzmoser et al 2012 tibshirani 1996 at the extremes λ 0 yields the same result as a multilinear regression that uses the same p independent variables and λ yields all regression parameters equal to zero β 0 except for the constant term of the regression which would equal the mean of the dependent variable observations in this case the choice of the λ parameter is crucial in determining β 3 β λ a r g m i n β ℝ p s s e λ j 1 p β j because high correlations are observed between the δa at various wavelengths see section 3 3 and figure s1 in the supplementary information the lasso regression was used the lasso regression was first used for the selection of predictors among a large amount of correlated predictors with this technique all possible predictors which in this study are all a and δa are fed into the lasso algorithm and with the increase of the regularization parameter λ there is a shrinking of some regression parameters β to 0 until there are only a few predictors left these predictors correspond to the wavelength of interest for predicting dbp concentrations another predictor termed δa272ini δa at a wavelength of 272 nm after a reaction time of 30 min was also used in the predictor selection step indeed in a study of δa of model compounds beauchamp et al 2019 concluded that the initial δa at 272 nm could be related to the initial rapid formation of dbps while δa250 represented the slower ongoing formation of dbps including a272ini in the predictor selection step allows the conclusion of beauchamp et al 2019 to be tested and can shed light on whether or not a272ini is an important predictor of dbp concentrations not only at 30 min but at all reaction times 2 3 2 calibration and testing of the multilinear model in this second step the two sets of predictors i e those identified by conventional multilinear regression and by lasso regression were compared calibration of the models using both sets of predictors was conducted with conventional multilinear regressions on the data from the samples from 7 of the raw waters calibration dataset the resulting equation was tested on the samples from the raw water left out of the calibration process test dataset this procedure allows for the evaluation of the model s generalization capacity the performance of a dbp δa relationship was assessed using the r2 for the calibration dataset and the root of the mean square error rmse was used for the calibration and test dataset finally because high correlations between predictors resulted in regression parameters of high absolute values and of opposite signs as suggested by equation 2 the lasso regression was used on the test dataset in an effort to shrink the regression parameters and improve the performance measures because lasso regression requires the determination of parameter λ this time the database needed to be divided into three datasets a calibration dataset used to conduct the regression at various values of λ typically for 100 different λ values logarithmically spaced between 0 and the smallest value of λ that results in all regression parameters being 0 a validation dataset used to identify the λ value that minimizes the prediction error in this study the rmse associated with this dataset and a test dataset used to assess the performance of the chosen lasso regression model on new data not used during the calibration or validation steps the calibration dataset was built with the data generated from 6 of the 8 different raw waters the data from one of the remaining raw waters formed the calibration dataset and the data from the last remaining raw water formed the test dataset see table s3 in the supplementary information for all dataset combinations all possible combinations of datasets based on the raw waters were used in this process in order to meet specific objectives 2 and 3 as described in section 1 3 results low bromide concentrations 15 μg l have been reported for the water source of waters 1 to 3 beauchamp et al 2018b and bromide concentrations are supposed in the same order of magnitude for all of the waters studied because very few brominated dbps were measured for thms only bromodichloromethane bdcm was detected 0 7 μg l but never in a mass proportion higher than 10 3 μg bdcm l to 30 μg thm4 l the same can be said of haas for which only monobromoacetic acid mbaa and bromochloroacetic acid bcaa were detected at very low concentrations 1 3 μg l monochloroacetic acid mcaa concentrations were also very low 1 3 μg l regression analyses were conducted on thm4 concentrations 3 203 μg l as they differ only slightly from chloroform concentrations 3 203 μg l and on dichloroacetic acid dcaa 2 75 μg l trichloroacetic acid tcaa 2 197 μg l and haa6 concentrations 4 272 μg l 3 1 selection of the best predictors 3 1 1 linear regression with δa at one wavelength fig 1 shows r2 of the simple linear regression between dbps and δa for all possible wavelengths the first noticeable characteristic is that the wavelength with the highest r2 is slightly different for each dbp thm4 seems to be better predicted with δa at wavelengths between 260 and 275 nm which is in accordance with previous studies which identify 272 nm as the wavelength of choice korshin et al 2002a however r2 peaks between 245 and 250 nm for tcaa between 250 and 260 nm for dcaa and at 250 nm for haa6 although relationships with wavelengths other than 272 nm are found in the literature for thms korshin et al 1997 yan et al 2014 zhang et al 2010 it is the first time this wavelength range has been shown to be specifically suited for predicting haas this is true despite the fact that the wavelengths of the observed δa peaks in all waters chlorinated in this experiment were in the range of 262 271 nm the second noticeable characteristic is that thm4 prediction using a simple linear regression worked moderately well r2 0 59 while the prediction of haas is much better tcaa r2 0 73 dcaa r2 0 84 haa6 r2 0 78 the low prediction performance for thm4 is an expected result as single wavelength dbp δa relationships have been shown to be water specific beauchamp et al 2018b 2018a korshin and chang 2008 özdemir et al 2013 roccaro et al 2008a roccaro and vagliasindi 2009 in contrast r2 for haa δa relationships are high despite the variety of waters populating the database although not as high as relationships developed using only one raw water source beauchamp et al 2018a this might mean that δa in the range of wavelengths identified is a good universal predictor of haa concentrations especially dcaa 3 1 2 multilinear regression with δa and a at one wavelength fig 2 shows that a linear regression using not only δa at a single wavelength but also using a improves the thm4 and tcaa δa relationships significantly r2 0 82 and 0 84 respectively the dcaa and haa6 δa relationships are only marginally improved r2 0 87 and 0 86 respectively this seems to indicate that thm and tcaa production proceeds via pathways different from the one that produces dcaa which is in accordance with previous studies korshin et al 2004 liang and singer 2003 noticeably the wavelength with the highest r2 is not impacted by adding a to the regression analysis yan et al 2014 also developed a model solely based on a and δa with the absorbance expressed on a log transformed scale lna and δlna their model uses a wavelength of 350 nm for both predictors and takes the form of a linear dbp δlna350 relationship where the slope is predicted by lna350 using multilinear regression with lna and δlna at one wavelength was attempted figure s2 in the supplementary information however the results show that determination coefficients are slightly lower with log transformed spectra compared to the original spectra and therefore this approach was not taken further either for predictor selection or model calibration 3 1 3 multilinear regression with δa and a at various wavelengths fig 3 shows the r2 of thm4 δa relationships for multilinear regressions for all possible pairs of wavelengths between 200 and 500 nm using a and δa for each wavelength therefore they represent linear regressions using 4 predictors ax δax ay δay the analysis was conducted between 200 and 500 nm leaving out the data between 500 and 600 nm for computational efficiency and because a and δa values at these wavelengths fall within the range of uncertainty for our measurements the highest r2 reached with multilinear regression is 0 89 in the area defined by the wavelengths between 260 and 275 nm on the x axis and 400 and 450 nm on the y axis this represents only a small improvement compared to the linear regression at a single wavelength with a and δa r2 0 89 vs 0 82 the same can be said for dcaa tcaa and haa6 δa relationships using 4 predictors at 2 wavelengths as can be seen in table 2 and in the supplementary information figures s3 to s5 a second region of high r2 is shown for tcaa on figure s4 in the supplementary information this region of the graph is located between 300 and 340 nm for the first wavelength and 470 500 nm for the second wavelength interestingly these wavelengths were not identified in the previous steps see sections 3 1 1 and 3 1 2 table 2 shows the p values of the 4 predictors used in the multilinear regression with the highest r2 for each dbp a and δa at the first wavelength between 250 and 270 nm are both significant predictors of dbp concentrations p 0 01 the p value of a255 for dcaa is rounded to 0 01 so the variable was kept in the calibration step contrary to the first wavelength a at the second wavelength does not significantly improve the prediction for thm4 and dcaa the second wavelength reported for tcaa and haa6 is 500 nm although using this as the second wavelength yielded the highest r2 its routine use is not recommended because the very low absorbance at this wavelength 0 001 cm 1 implies large uncertainties 20 100 for both a and δa using a and δa at a wavelength of 425 nm for which the absorbance is about 10 times higher than at 500 nm only marginally reduced r2 however just like for thm4 and dcaa the p values of a425 in table 2 are higher than 0 01 for tcaa and haa6 adding a third wavelength multilinear regression with 6 predictors did not improve the r2 of any of the dbp δa relationships results not shown the set of 3 predictors identified with multilinear regression shown in table 2 is referred to as set 1 in the rest of the text 3 1 4 selection using lasso fig 4 provides an example of the selection of predictors for tcaa concentrations as can be seen in fig 4a at low values of the regularization parameter there are many non zero regression parameters as the regularization parameter increases various regression parameters are shrunk to zero as seen by the many lines converging to zero in fig 4b the rmse of the calibration dataset as a function of the regularization parameter is shown although the lowest rmse for calibration dataset waters 2 4 8 is obtained with a regularization parameter of about 3 0 10 2 the regularization parameter is chosen to minimize the rmse of the validation dataset water 1 result not shown in this case the chosen regularization parameter λ is 4 572 10 1 and results in the selection of 4 predictors δa250 δa450 a225 and δa272ini table 3 provides the lasso selected predictors and their p values when used in a conventional multilinear regression as can be seen in table 3 all selected predictors have p values lower than 0 01 which means that all 4 or 5 predictors significantly contribute to the regression also the δa and a predictors selected by the lasso procedure are not necessarily at the same wavelength e g δa260 and a310 for predicting thm4 which is an unforeseen result that explains why such multilinear regressions were not assessed in section 3 1 3 this might reflect the fact that the wavelength with the initial absorbance most correlated to the concentration of dbp precursors is not necessarily the same as the one where δa changes the most during the reaction of these precursors this was observed previously by beauchamp et al 2019 the set of 4 predictors for tcaa and 5 predictors for the other dbps identified with lasso regression and shown in table 3 is referred to as set 2 in the rest of the text 3 2 model calibration and testing table 4 presents the performance of the models showing the r2 values and the rmse for the calibration dataset and the rmse for the test dataset for both sets of predictors 1 and 2 tables s4 and s5 in the supplemental information provide the regression parameters and their associated uncertainties 95 confidence intervals intercepts are reported although in many cases their p values are much higher than 0 01 according to their associated uncertainty their true value could be zero in many cases 3 2 1 multilinear regression using predictors of set 1 for thm4 and dcaa no matter what dataset is used as the test dataset the rmse of the test dataset is always very close to the rmse of the calibration dataset which means that the relationship performs equally well on data that were not used in the calibration process the sole exception to this is the model calibrated without the data from artificial water a 7 this exception also occurs in the tcaa model this is because the dataset from this water has the highest δa250 δa425 and dbp concentrations when these data are not used in the calibration process the model needs to extrapolate during testing and it does so less efficiently than it interpolates see figure s6 in the supplementary information of course this problem affects the haa6 model as well overall the regression parameters remain remarkably stable when changes are made to the calibration dataset with most of the uncertainty ranges intersecting each other however the percent uncertainty associated with the a255 regression parameter for the dcaa models is quite high varying between 28 and 46 this along with a p value of 0 01 for the a255 predictor and a small improvement on r2 compared to a relationship that does not include it as a predictor confirms that it might not be a significant predictor of dcaa for tcaa and haa6 the stability and performance of the model is also remarkable except when the data from artificial water a is used as the test dataset another exception to the high performance stability of tcaa and haa6 is when water from the du nord river summer jar test 2 is used for testing surprisingly in this case the tcaa regression parameter for δa425 and therefore the same regression parameter for the haa6 data becomes highly uncertain more than 100 uncertainty and its p value becomes much higher than 0 01 tcaa in this particular case could be modeled using only the initial and differential absorbance at 250 nm the du nord river summer dataset contains the lowest δa425 values again it is hypothesized that the calibrated model does not perform well when extrapolating outside the range of δa that is used for calibration in all other cases the uncertainty of the regression parameter δa425 in tcaa models is still high between 36 and 42 indicating that it might not be a meaningful predictor for tcaa in summary the following predictors have well defined regression parameters a270 δa270 and δa425 for thm4 models δa255 and δa425 for dcaa models a250 and δa250 for tcaa models and a250 δa250 and δa425 for haa6 models 3 2 2 multilinear regression using predictors of set 2 the rmse of the test dataset for the models using the set 2 predictors are sometimes higher 17 and sometimes lower 15 than the rmse of the test dataset using set 1 globally it can be said that the models developed using either sets of predictors performed comparably despite p values lower than 0 01 and improvements in the performance of the calibration dataset the 2 extra predictors in set 2 do not significantly enhance the test performance of the models regression parameters δa260 δa425 and a310 for the thm4 models δa255 and δa425 for the dcaa models and δa250 δa450 and δa272ini for the tcaa and haa6 models are well defined and have relatively low uncertainties 30 clearly these are significant predictors as mentioned in section 3 1 2 dcaa predictors are different from tcaa predictors reinforcing the fact that they are formed from different reaction pathways tcaa and haa6 predictors are identical mostly because tcaa contributes the most to the sum of the haa specie concentrations measured about 65 70 also because δa at close wavelengths are usually highly correlated the best predictors of tcaa can somewhat be used as substitutes for the predictors of dcaa δa250 for δa255 δa450 for δa425 and still result in good predictions of dcaa concentrations and hence haa6 concentrations finally these well defined predictors are identical to the ones in set 1 for dcaa models and quite similar to the ones in set 1 for thm4 models for tcaa and haa6 models the main difference between the two sets of well defined predictors is that δa272ini replaces a250 in set 2 considering δa425 and δa450 as equivalent given their very high correlation coefficient r 0 99 in a sense δa272ini and a250 are both indirect measurements of the amount of tcaa precursors that react rapidly as identified by beauchamp et al 2019 hence their relative equivalence in sets 1 and 2 given the similar performance and equivalence of the predictors used the following step of the methodology parameter shrinkage using lasso was conducted only on the predictors in set 1 prior to parameter shrinkage the recommended dbp δa relationships are presented in the following equations regression parameters and uncertainties rounded to 2 significant digits in these equations dbps are expressed in μg l and δa in cm 1 4 t h m 4 2 7 2 4 1000 100 a 270 6900 400 δ a 270 7100 1200 δ a 425 5 d c a a 0 7 0 8 90 30 a 255 2000 130 δ a 255 2800 400 δ a 425 6 t c a a 0 9 0 8 430 70 a 250 4470

highly correlated r δa270 δa425 0 86 r δa255 δa425 0 87 and r δa250 δa425 0 87 see figure s1 in the supplementary information and therefore the regression parameters are highly volatile with a similar absolute value with opposite signs lasso regression was therefore used to address this issue this time the lasso algorithm was used with only the 3 predictors of set 1 to assess if it was possible to improve the model s performance on the test dataset by shrinking the regression parameters the shrunken regression parameters obtained by the lasso regression were considered better than the ones from the conventional regression only if the performance of the test dataset improved in other words if the rmse was reduced table 5 provides the information on the performance of the models for the calibration validation and test datasets for which the performance improved table s6 shows the shrunken reduction parameters for each test dataset where shrinkage improved the performance as seen in table 5 it was not possible to shrink the parameters to improve the performance with all test datasets however when the performance improved the regression parameters were remarkably similar for the thm4 dcaa and tcaa models as seen with conventional multilinear regression with the du nord river summer data used as the test dataset section 3 2 1 the tcaa model does not use δa425 as a predictor its regression parameter being shrunken to zero for the haa6 models it was possible to shrink the parameters but the extent of the shrinkage varied depending on the test dataset used this explains the high uncertainty of the regression parameters in equation 11 the improved dbp δa relationships after this last step of model calibration are presented by the following equations 8 t h m 4 4 4 1 9 1000

seems that using a single predictor is not sufficient to avoid the site specific and season specific relationships previously reported beauchamp et al 2018b korshin and chang 2008 özdemir et al 2013 roccaro et al 2008a roccaro and vagliasindi 2009 all dbp δa relationships were improved by using 3 predictors with thm4 and tcaa showing the most improvement and dcaa showing the least improvement interestingly δa425 was identified as an important predictor in the models for all the dbps studied this wavelength is in the visible range and is usually associated with the yellowish color of water this is in accordance with previous research where dbp yields have been related to color oliver and thurman 1983 reckhow et al 1990 also the wavelengths where δa was most highly correlated to dcaa and tcaa concentrations δa255 and δa250 respectively differ from the usual δa272 that has been previously reported this is in accordance with results from beauchamp et al 2019 where this wavelength was closely associated with the continuous reaction of activated aromatics thm4 concentrations are most highly correlated with δa270 which is consistent with previous literature the final important predictor which is also a novel aspect of the current study is the use of pre chlorination absorbance a270 a255 and a250 for thm4 dcaa and tcaa respectively this meaningfully improves the prediction performances of thm4 and tcaa but only marginally for dcaa indeed dcaa formation seems to be very well predicted with the use of a single predictor δa255 despite the wide range of water quality and chlorination conditions tested see table 1 and table s2 also the wavelengths used to predict dcaa and tcaa i e 255 and 250 nm are very close to the familiar 254 nm which is very often monitored at full scale facilities using a and δa at 254 nm which are of course highly correlated with a255 a250 δa255 and δa250 might facilitate the adoption of differential uv absorbance in drinking water facilities to estimate dbp concentrations this is the first time that dbp δa relationships were not only calibrated with different waters but also tested in a different dataset generated using different waters the performance of the models on the test datasets are usually as good as the performance on the calibration dataset as long as the predictors a and δa fall within the same range in both datasets this suggests that universal or widely applicable dbp δa relationships are achievable it is recommended that someone interested in developing relationships for specific waters or a particular facility use the full range of water qualities found at that specific location in the experiments to generate the calibration dataset finally using the lasso regression made it possible to circumvent the issue of using two or more highly correlated predictors although some regression parameters remained somewhat high after shrinkage the predictive performance using the test dataset was improved in many cases 4 2 limits of applicability the dbp δa relationships have been developed using waters that generated very few brominated dbps it is known that bromide concentrations over 0 2 mg l impact thm4 δa relationships although it has not been shown to impact total haa δa relationships korshin et al 2004 bromide concentrations lower than 0 2 mg l can also impact the relationships between individual dbps and δa therefore it is not recommended to use thm4 δa relationships on waters with bromide concentrations higher than 0 2 mg l and relationships for individual dbps on waters producing significant amounts of brominated dbps also the ph of the water during chlorination has a substantial effect on the speciation of thms and haas specifically tcaa krasner et al 1989 liang and singer 2003 singer and chang 1989 here all chlorination experiments were conducted at close to neutral phs 6 7 7 6 it is likely that the regression parameters of the tcaa and thm models would have been different if the experiment had been conducted at a different ph as reported in previous literature korshin et al 2002b li et al 1998 özdemir et al 2013 however these observations were reported for models using a single predictor usually δa272 it remains unknown whether or not the regression parameters for the 3 predictor relationships would be influenced by the chlorination ph this should be addressed in future research the filtration technique used in the study also limits the applicability of the relationships particularly in full scale experiments the 0 7 μm fiberglass filtration prior to chlorination removes all particulate and colloidal nom larger than 0 7 μm left in the water after the coagulation flocculation step while full scale rapid granular filters do not remove all particulate and colloidal nom in fact the lowest particle attachment and removal efficiency for granular media filtration is known to be for particles of about 1 2 μm in diameter yao et al 1971 the contribution of particulate and colloidal nom to dbp concentrations in waters filtrated on granular media would likely impact the dbp δa relationships by increasing the amount of dbps formed the extent of the impact of granular filtration should be evaluated in future research other issues associated with scaling up of the approach have been discussed elsewhere beauchamp et al 2018b implementing the method at full scale treatment facilities using online uv probes would add the challenge of removing interference from particles hu and wang 2017 and free chlorine hypochlorous acid and hypochlorite ion because pretreatment of the samples such as filtration and dechlorination is not possible nor practical when using online probes despite the fact that temperature can affect dbp speciation roccaro et al 2008a has shown that dbp δa relationships are not impacted by changes in chlorination temperature the results presented herein are consistent with this study indeed the performance of the test dataset for the waters chlorinated at low temperatures jaune lake and du nord river in the winter are just as good as the ones for the other waters chlorinated at higher temperatures most of the waters used in the chlorination experiments were coagulated and had a suva below 2 0 which is associated with hydrophilic nom edzwald 1993 only 21 of the 230 data points come from chlorinated waters with a suva higher than 2 0 nonetheless the prediction of the dbp concentrations for these waters were not associated with reduced performance it seems that testing the model on a dataset with δa and dbp concentrations outside the range used in the calibration process resulted in worse performance when compared to testing the model on waters with a higher suva this suggests that the suva of water prior to chlorination does not limit the applicability of the models but this claim should be extensively tested in future research finally this study did not investigate the use of power functions to model dbp δa relationships the authors hypothesize that the multiple wavelengths used in the regression analyses quantify the contribution of distinct chromophores to dbp yields and hence circumvent the issue explained in the introduction of using a power function instead of a linear function future research should seek to test this hypothesis by comparing the single wavelength power function approach with the multiple wavelength approach and see if the gradually changing slope of single wavelength power functions can be attributed to the contribution of a second chromophore 5 conclusions the objective of this study to find a widely applicable dbp δa relationship by using more predictors than the single δa272 previously used has been met the main findings are the important predictors are a and δa at a first wavelength 270 nm for thm4 255 nm for dcaa and 250 nm for tcaa and haa6 and δa425 for all the dbps examined using these wavelengths made it possible to develop relationships that performed well as assessed by r2 and rmse in both the calibration and the test datasets the relationships are applicable to a wide range of water qualities doc uv254 suva temperature as long as the predictors a and δa of the water for which predictions are required are in the same range as the ones used to calibrate the regression parameters future research should test the applicability of multilinear relationships for chlorination conducted at various phs and the use of rapid granular filtration instead of lab filtration using fiberglass filters the procedure described in this paper should also be developed and applied in the future to unregulated and emerging dbps declaration of interests the authors declare that they have

18808,differential uv absorbance δa is an important indicator that could allow operators and utility managers to routinely monitor disinfection by product dbp concentrations even in real time applications without the limitations of regulatory sampling and analyses while determination coefficients between differential uv absorbance at a single wavelength often 272 nm and chlorination dbp concentrations are usually very high r2 0 90 the fitting parameters of these relationships vary from one water source to another or vary within the same water source depending on the time of year the objectives of this study are to apply multiple regression models to a rich database of δa and dbps trihalomethanes thms and haloacetic acids haas that was generated from lab experiments using multiple waters with low bromide concentrations in order to identify wavelengths that improve the applicability of dbp δa relationships as well as develop a widely applicable multi wavelength dbp δa relationship the results show that using δa at two wavelengths in addition to initial absorbance a at one wavelength greatly improves the determination coefficients of the relationships when compared with the best possible single wavelength relationships the significant predictors identified are a270 δa270 and δa425 for thms a255 δa255 and δa425 for dcaa a250 δa250 and δa425 for tcaa and a250 δa250 and δa425 for haa6 this paper also discusses the applicability of the models developed for predicting dbps in treatment plants and drinking water as well as their limitations and the required future research to improve their performance keywords disinfection by products differential absorbance chlorination dbp modelling multilinear regression 1 introduction monitoring disinfection by products dbps beyond routine drinking water regulatory requirements has proven to be a challenge because of the costs and amount of labor associated with sampling handling and analyzing samples technologies such as online trihalomethane thm analysers or the hach total thm colorimetric method have provided a way to more frequently monitor the often regulated thms bailey et al 2014 reckhow and dozier 2018 reckhow and pierce 1992 however none of these technologies provide information on other regulated dbps such as the haloacetic acids haas or on unregulated dbps such as haloacetonitriles hans halonitromethanes hnms haloacetamides hams and haloketones hks differential uv absorbance δa has been proposed korshin et al 2002a 1996 yan et al 2014 as an indicator for estimating various regulated and unregulated dbp concentrations korshin et al 2002b most studies have established a linear relationship between dbp concentrations and δa at a single wavelength of 272 nm with very high determination coefficients r2 of usually 0 90 the reason for the choice of this wavelength is that it follows the empirical observation of the maximum differential absorbance around this wavelength korshin et al 2002a although the δa peak may be observed between 250 nm and 280 nm roccaro et al 2008b zhang et al 2010 the uv absorbance of natural waters between 250 and 280 nm is usually considered to be an indicator of the concentration of aromatic structures traina et al 1990 a known chlorine reactive site of natural organic matter nom gallard and von gunten 2002 norwood et al 1980 reckhow et al 1990 power functions using δa at 272 nm have also been used to model dbp δa relationships with better determination coefficients korshin et al 2002b roccaro et al 2011 2008a in power functions the slope of the dbp δa relationships increases with increasing δa this is interpreted as a clue that a significant amount of precursors with absorbance at this wavelength termed fast chromophore must react and form an intermediate product termed slow chromophore that eventually releases the measured dbp the existence of such intermediate product is consistent with results from korshin et al 2007 2004 2000 and roccaro et al 2013 2008a assuming the reaction of the intermediate product is the limiting step the slope of the single wavelength dbp δa relationships increases with increasing δa resulting in a curved relationship linear dbp δa relationships previously reported would simply be part of a curvilinear relationship for which data were collected after the fast chromophore has mostly disappeared nonetheless single wavelength dbp δa relationships have been shown to be specific to location and season beauchamp et al 2018b 2018a korshin and chang 2008 özdemir et al 2013 roccaro et al 2008a roccaro and vagliasindi 2009 in an effort to make the dbp δa relationships more generally applicable yan et al 2014 suggested the use of a dbp δa linear relationship at a wavelength of 350 nm on log transformed absorbance spectra the slopes of the relationships for thms haas and hans were well correlated with the log transformed absorbance at 350 nm before chlorination this method hence results in the use of log transformed absorbance at a single wavelength 350 nm to predict dbp concentrations roccaro et al 2015 also developed a similar approach using log transformed spectra to predict dbp yields μg dbp mg doc that nonetheless requires doc measurements to predict dbp concentrations finally indicators of dbp concentrations based on the fluorescence of nom have also been suggested roccaro et al 2009 yang et al 2015 fluorescence of nom has been studied extensively as a tool to identify nom components yang et al 2015 and to associate these components to dbp formation potential li et al 2016 peleato and andrews 2015 pifer et al 2013 pifer and fairey 2012 however despite the interesting potential of fluorescence only a few studies fabbricino et al 2019 roccaro et al 2009 roccaro and vagliasindi 2010 have so far suggested a differential fluorescence index akin to δa that could be used to predict dbp concentrations an indicator of dbp concentrations solely based on spectrophotometric measurements such as the one developed by yan et al 2014 that is applicable to waters with a wide variety of physicochemical characteristics and that could be applied in real time online uv visible absorbance probes or at a higher frequency than regulatory sampling would be a valuable tool the objectives of the current study were to develop and apply multiple regression models with more than one wavelength to find a more widely applicable relationship between dbp concentrations and δa specific objectives were 1 to identify the wavelengths that will improve and generalize the conventional single wavelength dbp δa model 2 to determine if multi wavelength relationships perform well for different types of waters used in the calibration process of the model unbiased model 3 to determine if the calibrated dbp δa relationships can be applied to different waters without any calibration test the model on a new dataset 2 methodology 2 1 jar tests and chlorination experiment design in order to build the database with results from a variety of source waters and water treatment conditions 6 different surface waters were collected over a period of 16 months including 3 waters from the same source collected at different times of the year see table 1 these waters were subjected to coagulation flocculation in a jar test apparatus with varying coagulant doses and phs filtered through 0 7 μm glass microfiber filters and chlorinated for varying lengths of time between 0 5 and 48 h two artificial waters consisted of different mixtures of nom from the suwannee river usa nom ro isolate 2r101n and fulvic acid standard 3s101f in a milliq water matrix as well as kaolin and sodium bicarbonate for particle and alkalinity components respectively these synthetic waters assure reproducibility if others wish to replicate the experiment the complete detailed recipes of the artificial waters are presented in the supplementary information table s1 and supplementary text 1 jar tests were conducted on a phipps and bird 7790 400 stirrer in order to produce pre treated waters with varying nom quantity and quality as measured by dissolved organic carbon doc and uv absorbance at 254 nm uv254 a total of 45 different pre treated waters made up of different raw waters coagulation phs and coagulant doses were produced table s2 in supplementary information jar tests with water from du nord river were conducted in a controlled temperature basin at the equivalent raw water temperature while other experiments were conducted at room temperature 21 c the temperature of the jaune lake water varied from 5 c in the beginning to 8 c at the end of the jar test experiment because of the absence of a temperature control device square beakers of 2 l each phipps and bird b ker2 were used for the jar tests the coagulant used was alum the desired coagulation ph was achieved using volumes pre determined by titration of 1n solutions of naoh or h2so4 appropriate volumes of a 30 g l alum solution as al2 so4 3 14h2o were added at t 0 to obtain the desired alum dose a volume of 0 25 ml of a 2 g l cationic polymer solution 0 25 mg l dose was added at t 2 min the rotation speed was lowered from 100 rpm to 10 rpm at t 3 min for flocculation the jar tests were stopped at t 13 min and the waters were filtered immediately samples for doc and uv analyses were collected after filtration and the remaining water was put in 500 ml dark glass bottles for chlorination experiments all chlorination experiments were conducted at ph 7 phosphate buffer concentration of 1 5 mm the initial chlorine doses varied from 3 0 to 5 0 mg l and were added as part of a 50 g l stock solution of sodium hypochlorite using a 50 μl syringe chlorination aimed to reproduce the chlorination conditions of a treatment plant taking its raw water from the du nord river specifically the volume of each chlorine dose was determined based on the objective of having a free chlorine residual of 1 00 mg l after 48 h the bottles were closed with a water and air tight cap and incubated in the dark at 23 c except for the two waters collected in the winter which were incubated at 4 c chlorination lasted for approximately 0 5 1 2 6 24 and 48 h although not all reaction times were performed in all chlorination experiments five reaction times were used for water 6 and three reaction times were used for waters 7 and 8 a blank sample consisting of milliq water with phosphate buffer was also chlorinated under the same conditions when the reaction time of a bottle was reached 0 5 1 2 6 24 or 48 h the free chlorine residual concentration was measured then 40 ml glass vials pre dosed with an excess of ammonium chloride quenching agent were filled and sealed for further dbp analyses in the water left in the bottle the free chlorine residual was quenched with a stoichiometric volume of a 10 g l solution of sodium sulphite 1 mol na2so3 mol cl2 in order to avoid uv interference from free chlorine and from extra sulphite as explained elsewhere beauchamp et al 2018b uv visible absorbance spectra were measured after at least 20 min to allow the quenching agent to reduce the free chlorine completely a total of 230 post chlorination uv visible absorbance spectra were obtained as a result of the 45 different pre treated waters chlorinated at different contact times 2 2 analytical procedures free chlorine residuals were measured using the dpd colorimetric method with a hach dr 900 colorimeter 0 02 mg l and ph was measured using a thermo scientific orion 8157bnumd ross ph meter uv visible absorbance of the filtered samples between wavelengths of 200 and 600 nm were obtained using 1 5 or 10 cm quartz cells and a double beam agilent cary 100 uv vis spectrophotometer at a spectral bandwith of 2 nm 0 002 absorbance units blanks and baseline samples consisted of milliq water doc analysis was conducted with a sievers 5310c laboratory toc analyser and thm and haa analyses were conducted by gas chromatography with electrical current detection gc ecd based on the methods and procedures described elsewhere beauchamp et al 2018b the analysed thms included the usual chlorinated and brominated ones thm4 and the haas included the five us regulated chlorinated and brominated haas haa5 plus bromochloroacetic acid the recoveries for thms and haas were between 80 and 120 2 3 data analysis and regression methodology differential absorbance at a given wavelength was calculated by the initial absorbance minus the final absorbance at that wavelength for each of the 230 samples a database consisting of pre treated water absorbance spectra differential absorbance spectra and thm and haa concentrations was built 2 3 1 wavelength selection in order to find the best wavelength for dbp δa relationships on the complete database a linear regression with differential absorbance at one wavelength was performed at all possible wavelengths 200 600 nm for every individual dbp measured and for the commonly used sum of regulated dbp concentrations thm4 and haa5 multilinear regression was applied to all possible pairs of differential absorbance values in order to identify the wavelength pair that performs the best at predicting dbp concentrations finally based on the previous results a third wavelength was added to the wavelength pair that performed the best to see if it could further improve the prediction of dbp concentrations this approach is different from the previous approach that lead to the selection of predictors based on observations of the features peaks slopes etc of the differential absorbance spectra in a sense the choice of the predictors in previous literature is initially biased toward observable features of the spectra while the approach proposed in this paper is only guided by model performance absorbance of the water before chlorination a was also tested in the regression to see if it could improve the dbp δa relationships one might expect different dbp yields from two waters with the same δa but with a different a hence the inclusion of a in the models the predictors a and δa were considered significant when their p value testing the null hypothesis that the parameter value is 0 with t test was less than 0 01 however because δa at different wavelengths can be highly correlated the regression parameters βn of a multilinear regression obtained using equation 1 can be very high and extremely sensitive to the data used in the regression equation 2 a and b where x is an n x 2 matrix of independent variables y is the column vector of n dependant variable observations x 1y and x 2y are the elements of the x y vector and r is the correlation coefficient between two independent variables show that for a linear regression with 2 coefficients β1 and β2 when r2 12 1 the uncertainty on regression parameters βn and on predictions made by the obtained relationship is in these cases very large 1 β x x 1 x y 2a β 1 x 1 y r 12 x 2 y 1 r 12 2 2b β 2 x 2 y r 12 x 1 y 1 r 12 2 one method to avoid this high sensitivity is to use the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator lasso regression tibshirani 1996 this linear regression method does not seek to minimize only the sum of square errors sse as multilinear regression does but rather has an objective function in the form of equation 3 where the vector β is the vector of the p regression parameters and λ represents the regularization parameter the lasso regression objective function is a compromise between prediction performance minimizing sse and small regression parameters minimizing the norm of vector β where λ represents the emphasis put on the second objective filzmoser et al 2012 tibshirani 1996 at the extremes λ 0 yields the same result as a multilinear regression that uses the same p independent variables and λ yields all regression parameters equal to zero β 0 except for the constant term of the regression which would equal the mean of the dependent variable observations in this case the choice of the λ parameter is crucial in determining β 3 β λ a r g m i n β ℝ p s s e λ j 1 p β j because high correlations are observed between the δa at various wavelengths see section 3 3 and figure s1 in the supplementary information the lasso regression was used the lasso regression was first used for the selection of predictors among a large amount of correlated predictors with this technique all possible predictors which in this study are all a and δa are fed into the lasso algorithm and with the increase of the regularization parameter λ there is a shrinking of some regression parameters β to 0 until there are only a few predictors left these predictors correspond to the wavelength of interest for predicting dbp concentrations another predictor termed δa272ini δa at a wavelength of 272 nm after a reaction time of 30 min was also used in the predictor selection step indeed in a study of δa of model compounds beauchamp et al 2019 concluded that the initial δa at 272 nm could be related to the initial rapid formation of dbps while δa250 represented the slower ongoing formation of dbps including a272ini in the predictor selection step allows the conclusion of beauchamp et al 2019 to be tested and can shed light on whether or not a272ini is an important predictor of dbp concentrations not only at 30 min but at all reaction times 2 3 2 calibration and testing of the multilinear model in this second step the two sets of predictors i e those identified by conventional multilinear regression and by lasso regression were compared calibration of the models using both sets of predictors was conducted with conventional multilinear regressions on the data from the samples from 7 of the raw waters calibration dataset the resulting equation was tested on the samples from the raw water left out of the calibration process test dataset this procedure allows for the evaluation of the model s generalization capacity the performance of a dbp δa relationship was assessed using the r2 for the calibration dataset and the root of the mean square error rmse was used for the calibration and test dataset finally because high correlations between predictors resulted in regression parameters of high absolute values and of opposite signs as suggested by equation 2 the lasso regression was used on the test dataset in an effort to shrink the regression parameters and improve the performance measures because lasso regression requires the determination of parameter λ this time the database needed to be divided into three datasets a calibration dataset used to conduct the regression at various values of λ typically for 100 different λ values logarithmically spaced between 0 and the smallest value of λ that results in all regression parameters being 0 a validation dataset used to identify the λ value that minimizes the prediction error in this study the rmse associated with this dataset and a test dataset used to assess the performance of the chosen lasso regression model on new data not used during the calibration or validation steps the calibration dataset was built with the data generated from 6 of the 8 different raw waters the data from one of the remaining raw waters formed the calibration dataset and the data from the last remaining raw water formed the test dataset see table s3 in the supplementary information for all dataset combinations all possible combinations of datasets based on the raw waters were used in this process in order to meet specific objectives 2 and 3 as described in section 1 3 results low bromide concentrations 15 μg l have been reported for the water source of waters 1 to 3 beauchamp et al 2018b and bromide concentrations are supposed in the same order of magnitude for all of the waters studied because very few brominated dbps were measured for thms only bromodichloromethane bdcm was detected 0 7 μg l but never in a mass proportion higher than 10 3 μg bdcm l to 30 μg thm4 l the same can be said of haas for which only monobromoacetic acid mbaa and bromochloroacetic acid bcaa were detected at very low concentrations 1 3 μg l monochloroacetic acid mcaa concentrations were also very low 1 3 μg l regression analyses were conducted on thm4 concentrations 3 203 μg l as they differ only slightly from chloroform concentrations 3 203 μg l and on dichloroacetic acid dcaa 2 75 μg l trichloroacetic acid tcaa 2 197 μg l and haa6 concentrations 4 272 μg l 3 1 selection of the best predictors 3 1 1 linear regression with δa at one wavelength fig 1 shows r2 of the simple linear regression between dbps and δa for all possible wavelengths the first noticeable characteristic is that the wavelength with the highest r2 is slightly different for each dbp thm4 seems to be better predicted with δa at wavelengths between 260 and 275 nm which is in accordance with previous studies which identify 272 nm as the wavelength of choice korshin et al 2002a however r2 peaks between 245 and 250 nm for tcaa between 250 and 260 nm for dcaa and at 250 nm for haa6 although relationships with wavelengths other than 272 nm are found in the literature for thms korshin et al 1997 yan et al 2014 zhang et al 2010 it is the first time this wavelength range has been shown to be specifically suited for predicting haas this is true despite the fact that the wavelengths of the observed δa peaks in all waters chlorinated in this experiment were in the range of 262 271 nm the second noticeable characteristic is that thm4 prediction using a simple linear regression worked moderately well r2 0 59 while the prediction of haas is much better tcaa r2 0 73 dcaa r2 0 84 haa6 r2 0 78 the low prediction performance for thm4 is an expected result as single wavelength dbp δa relationships have been shown to be water specific beauchamp et al 2018b 2018a korshin and chang 2008 özdemir et al 2013 roccaro et al 2008a roccaro and vagliasindi 2009 in contrast r2 for haa δa relationships are high despite the variety of waters populating the database although not as high as relationships developed using only one raw water source beauchamp et al 2018a this might mean that δa in the range of wavelengths identified is a good universal predictor of haa concentrations especially dcaa 3 1 2 multilinear regression with δa and a at one wavelength fig 2 shows that a linear regression using not only δa at a single wavelength but also using a improves the thm4 and tcaa δa relationships significantly r2 0 82 and 0 84 respectively the dcaa and haa6 δa relationships are only marginally improved r2 0 87 and 0 86 respectively this seems to indicate that thm and tcaa production proceeds via pathways different from the one that produces dcaa which is in accordance with previous studies korshin et al 2004 liang and singer 2003 noticeably the wavelength with the highest r2 is not impacted by adding a to the regression analysis yan et al 2014 also developed a model solely based on a and δa with the absorbance expressed on a log transformed scale lna and δlna their model uses a wavelength of 350 nm for both predictors and takes the form of a linear dbp δlna350 relationship where the slope is predicted by lna350 using multilinear regression with lna and δlna at one wavelength was attempted figure s2 in the supplementary information however the results show that determination coefficients are slightly lower with log transformed spectra compared to the original spectra and therefore this approach was not taken further either for predictor selection or model calibration 3 1 3 multilinear regression with δa and a at various wavelengths fig 3 shows the r2 of thm4 δa relationships for multilinear regressions for all possible pairs of wavelengths between 200 and 500 nm using a and δa for each wavelength therefore they represent linear regressions using 4 predictors ax δax ay δay the analysis was conducted between 200 and 500 nm leaving out the data between 500 and 600 nm for computational efficiency and because a and δa values at these wavelengths fall within the range of uncertainty for our measurements the highest r2 reached with multilinear regression is 0 89 in the area defined by the wavelengths between 260 and 275 nm on the x axis and 400 and 450 nm on the y axis this represents only a small improvement compared to the linear regression at a single wavelength with a and δa r2 0 89 vs 0 82 the same can be said for dcaa tcaa and haa6 δa relationships using 4 predictors at 2 wavelengths as can be seen in table 2 and in the supplementary information figures s3 to s5 a second region of high r2 is shown for tcaa on figure s4 in the supplementary information this region of the graph is located between 300 and 340 nm for the first wavelength and 470 500 nm for the second wavelength interestingly these wavelengths were not identified in the previous steps see sections 3 1 1 and 3 1 2 table 2 shows the p values of the 4 predictors used in the multilinear regression with the highest r2 for each dbp a and δa at the first wavelength between 250 and 270 nm are both significant predictors of dbp concentrations p 0 01 the p value of a255 for dcaa is rounded to 0 01 so the variable was kept in the calibration step contrary to the first wavelength a at the second wavelength does not significantly improve the prediction for thm4 and dcaa the second wavelength reported for tcaa and haa6 is 500 nm although using this as the second wavelength yielded the highest r2 its routine use is not recommended because the very low absorbance at this wavelength 0 001 cm 1 implies large uncertainties 20 100 for both a and δa using a and δa at a wavelength of 425 nm for which the absorbance is about 10 times higher than at 500 nm only marginally reduced r2 however just like for thm4 and dcaa the p values of a425 in table 2 are higher than 0 01 for tcaa and haa6 adding a third wavelength multilinear regression with 6 predictors did not improve the r2 of any of the dbp δa relationships results not shown the set of 3 predictors identified with multilinear regression shown in table 2 is referred to as set 1 in the rest of the text 3 1 4 selection using lasso fig 4 provides an example of the selection of predictors for tcaa concentrations as can be seen in fig 4a at low values of the regularization parameter there are many non zero regression parameters as the regularization parameter increases various regression parameters are shrunk to zero as seen by the many lines converging to zero in fig 4b the rmse of the calibration dataset as a function of the regularization parameter is shown although the lowest rmse for calibration dataset waters 2 4 8 is obtained with a regularization parameter of about 3 0 10 2 the regularization parameter is chosen to minimize the rmse of the validation dataset water 1 result not shown in this case the chosen regularization parameter λ is 4 572 10 1 and results in the selection of 4 predictors δa250 δa450 a225 and δa272ini table 3 provides the lasso selected predictors and their p values when used in a conventional multilinear regression as can be seen in table 3 all selected predictors have p values lower than 0 01 which means that all 4 or 5 predictors significantly contribute to the regression also the δa and a predictors selected by the lasso procedure are not necessarily at the same wavelength e g δa260 and a310 for predicting thm4 which is an unforeseen result that explains why such multilinear regressions were not assessed in section 3 1 3 this might reflect the fact that the wavelength with the initial absorbance most correlated to the concentration of dbp precursors is not necessarily the same as the one where δa changes the most during the reaction of these precursors this was observed previously by beauchamp et al 2019 the set of 4 predictors for tcaa and 5 predictors for the other dbps identified with lasso regression and shown in table 3 is referred to as set 2 in the rest of the text 3 2 model calibration and testing table 4 presents the performance of the models showing the r2 values and the rmse for the calibration dataset and the rmse for the test dataset for both sets of predictors 1 and 2 tables s4 and s5 in the supplemental information provide the regression parameters and their associated uncertainties 95 confidence intervals intercepts are reported although in many cases their p values are much higher than 0 01 according to their associated uncertainty their true value could be zero in many cases 3 2 1 multilinear regression using predictors of set 1 for thm4 and dcaa no matter what dataset is used as the test dataset the rmse of the test dataset is always very close to the rmse of the calibration dataset which means that the relationship performs equally well on data that were not used in the calibration process the sole exception to this is the model calibrated without the data from artificial water a 7 this exception also occurs in the tcaa model this is because the dataset from this water has the highest δa250 δa425 and dbp concentrations when these data are not used in the calibration process the model needs to extrapolate during testing and it does so less efficiently than it interpolates see figure s6 in the supplementary information of course this problem affects the haa6 model as well overall the regression parameters remain remarkably stable when changes are made to the calibration dataset with most of the uncertainty ranges intersecting each other however the percent uncertainty associated with the a255 regression parameter for the dcaa models is quite high varying between 28 and 46 this along with a p value of 0 01 for the a255 predictor and a small improvement on r2 compared to a relationship that does not include it as a predictor confirms that it might not be a significant predictor of dcaa for tcaa and haa6 the stability and performance of the model is also remarkable except when the data from artificial water a is used as the test dataset another exception to the high performance stability of tcaa and haa6 is when water from the du nord river summer jar test 2 is used for testing surprisingly in this case the tcaa regression parameter for δa425 and therefore the same regression parameter for the haa6 data becomes highly uncertain more than 100 uncertainty and its p value becomes much higher than 0 01 tcaa in this particular case could be modeled using only the initial and differential absorbance at 250 nm the du nord river summer dataset contains the lowest δa425 values again it is hypothesized that the calibrated model does not perform well when extrapolating outside the range of δa that is used for calibration in all other cases the uncertainty of the regression parameter δa425 in tcaa models is still high between 36 and 42 indicating that it might not be a meaningful predictor for tcaa in summary the following predictors have well defined regression parameters a270 δa270 and δa425 for thm4 models δa255 and δa425 for dcaa models a250 and δa250 for tcaa models and a250 δa250 and δa425 for haa6 models 3 2 2 multilinear regression using predictors of set 2 the rmse of the test dataset for the models using the set 2 predictors are sometimes higher 17 and sometimes lower 15 than the rmse of the test dataset using set 1 globally it can be said that the models developed using either sets of predictors performed comparably despite p values lower than 0 01 and improvements in the performance of the calibration dataset the 2 extra predictors in set 2 do not significantly enhance the test performance of the models regression parameters δa260 δa425 and a310 for the thm4 models δa255 and δa425 for the dcaa models and δa250 δa450 and δa272ini for the tcaa and haa6 models are well defined and have relatively low uncertainties 30 clearly these are significant predictors as mentioned in section 3 1 2 dcaa predictors are different from tcaa predictors reinforcing the fact that they are formed from different reaction pathways tcaa and haa6 predictors are identical mostly because tcaa contributes the most to the sum of the haa specie concentrations measured about 65 70 also because δa at close wavelengths are usually highly correlated the best predictors of tcaa can somewhat be used as substitutes for the predictors of dcaa δa250 for δa255 δa450 for δa425 and still result in good predictions of dcaa concentrations and hence haa6 concentrations finally these well defined predictors are identical to the ones in set 1 for dcaa models and quite similar to the ones in set 1 for thm4 models for tcaa and haa6 models the main difference between the two sets of well defined predictors is that δa272ini replaces a250 in set 2 considering δa425 and δa450 as equivalent given their very high correlation coefficient r 0 99 in a sense δa272ini and a250 are both indirect measurements of the amount of tcaa precursors that react rapidly as identified by beauchamp et al 2019 hence their relative equivalence in sets 1 and 2 given the similar performance and equivalence of the predictors used the following step of the methodology parameter shrinkage using lasso was conducted only on the predictors in set 1 prior to parameter shrinkage the recommended dbp δa relationships are presented in the following equations regression parameters and uncertainties rounded to 2 significant digits in these equations dbps are expressed in μg l and δa in cm 1 4 t h m 4 2 7 2 4 1000 100 a 270 6900 400 δ a 270 7100 1200 δ a 425 5 d c a a 0 7 0 8 90 30 a 255 2000 130 δ a 255 2800 400 δ a 425 6 t c a a 0 9 0 8 430 70 a 250 4470

highly correlated r δa270 δa425 0 86 r δa255 δa425 0 87 and r δa250 δa425 0 87 see figure s1 in the supplementary information and therefore the regression parameters are highly volatile with a similar absolute value with opposite signs lasso regression was therefore used to address this issue this time the lasso algorithm was used with only the 3 predictors of set 1 to assess if it was possible to improve the model s performance on the test dataset by shrinking the regression parameters the shrunken regression parameters obtained by the lasso regression were considered better than the ones from the conventional regression only if the performance of the test dataset improved in other words if the rmse was reduced table 5 provides the information on the performance of the models for the calibration validation and test datasets for which the performance improved table s6 shows the shrunken reduction parameters for each test dataset where shrinkage improved the performance as seen in table 5 it was not possible to shrink the parameters to improve the performance with all test datasets however when the performance improved the regression parameters were remarkably similar for the thm4 dcaa and tcaa models as seen with conventional multilinear regression with the du nord river summer data used as the test dataset section 3 2 1 the tcaa model does not use δa425 as a predictor its regression parameter being shrunken to zero for the haa6 models it was possible to shrink the parameters but the extent of the shrinkage varied depending on the test dataset used this explains the high uncertainty of the regression parameters in equation 11 the improved dbp δa relationships after this last step of model calibration are presented by the following equations 8 t h m 4 4 4 1 9 1000

seems that using a single predictor is not sufficient to avoid the site specific and season specific relationships previously reported beauchamp et al 2018b korshin and chang 2008 özdemir et al 2013 roccaro et al 2008a roccaro and vagliasindi 2009 all dbp δa relationships were improved by using 3 predictors with thm4 and tcaa showing the most improvement and dcaa showing the least improvement interestingly δa425 was identified as an important predictor in the models for all the dbps studied this wavelength is in the visible range and is usually associated with the yellowish color of water this is in accordance with previous research where dbp yields have been related to color oliver and thurman 1983 reckhow et al 1990 also the wavelengths where δa was most highly correlated to dcaa and tcaa concentrations δa255 and δa250 respectively differ from the usual δa272 that has been previously reported this is in accordance with results from beauchamp et al 2019 where this wavelength was closely associated with the continuous reaction of activated aromatics thm4 concentrations are most highly correlated with δa270 which is consistent with previous literature the final important predictor which is also a novel aspect of the current study is the use of pre chlorination absorbance a270 a255 and a250 for thm4 dcaa and tcaa respectively this meaningfully improves the prediction performances of thm4 and tcaa but only marginally for dcaa indeed dcaa formation seems to be very well predicted with the use of a single predictor δa255 despite the wide range of water quality and chlorination conditions tested see table 1 and table s2 also the wavelengths used to predict dcaa and tcaa i e 255 and 250 nm are very close to the familiar 254 nm which is very often monitored at full scale facilities using a and δa at 254 nm which are of course highly correlated with a255 a250 δa255 and δa250 might facilitate the adoption of differential uv absorbance in drinking water facilities to estimate dbp concentrations this is the first time that dbp δa relationships were not only calibrated with different waters but also tested in a different dataset generated using different waters the performance of the models on the test datasets are usually as good as the performance on the calibration dataset as long as the predictors a and δa fall within the same range in both datasets this suggests that universal or widely applicable dbp δa relationships are achievable it is recommended that someone interested in developing relationships for specific waters or a particular facility use the full range of water qualities found at that specific location in the experiments to generate the calibration dataset finally using the lasso regression made it possible to circumvent the issue of using two or more highly correlated predictors although some regression parameters remained somewhat high after shrinkage the predictive performance using the test dataset was improved in many cases 4 2 limits of applicability the dbp δa relationships have been developed using waters that generated very few brominated dbps it is known that bromide concentrations over 0 2 mg l impact thm4 δa relationships although it has not been shown to impact total haa δa relationships korshin et al 2004 bromide concentrations lower than 0 2 mg l can also impact the relationships between individual dbps and δa therefore it is not recommended to use thm4 δa relationships on waters with bromide concentrations higher than 0 2 mg l and relationships for individual dbps on waters producing significant amounts of brominated dbps also the ph of the water during chlorination has a substantial effect on the speciation of thms and haas specifically tcaa krasner et al 1989 liang and singer 2003 singer and chang 1989 here all chlorination experiments were conducted at close to neutral phs 6 7 7 6 it is likely that the regression parameters of the tcaa and thm models would have been different if the experiment had been conducted at a different ph as reported in previous literature korshin et al 2002b li et al 1998 özdemir et al 2013 however these observations were reported for models using a single predictor usually δa272 it remains unknown whether or not the regression parameters for the 3 predictor relationships would be influenced by the chlorination ph this should be addressed in future research the filtration technique used in the study also limits the applicability of the relationships particularly in full scale experiments the 0 7 μm fiberglass filtration prior to chlorination removes all particulate and colloidal nom larger than 0 7 μm left in the water after the coagulation flocculation step while full scale rapid granular filters do not remove all particulate and colloidal nom in fact the lowest particle attachment and removal efficiency for granular media filtration is known to be for particles of about 1 2 μm in diameter yao et al 1971 the contribution of particulate and colloidal nom to dbp concentrations in waters filtrated on granular media would likely impact the dbp δa relationships by increasing the amount of dbps formed the extent of the impact of granular filtration should be evaluated in future research other issues associated with scaling up of the approach have been discussed elsewhere beauchamp et al 2018b implementing the method at full scale treatment facilities using online uv probes would add the challenge of removing interference from particles hu and wang 2017 and free chlorine hypochlorous acid and hypochlorite ion because pretreatment of the samples such as filtration and dechlorination is not possible nor practical when using online probes despite the fact that temperature can affect dbp speciation roccaro et al 2008a has shown that dbp δa relationships are not impacted by changes in chlorination temperature the results presented herein are consistent with this study indeed the performance of the test dataset for the waters chlorinated at low temperatures jaune lake and du nord river in the winter are just as good as the ones for the other waters chlorinated at higher temperatures most of the waters used in the chlorination experiments were coagulated and had a suva below 2 0 which is associated with hydrophilic nom edzwald 1993 only 21 of the 230 data points come from chlorinated waters with a suva higher than 2 0 nonetheless the prediction of the dbp concentrations for these waters were not associated with reduced performance it seems that testing the model on a dataset with δa and dbp concentrations outside the range used in the calibration process resulted in worse performance when compared to testing the model on waters with a higher suva this suggests that the suva of water prior to chlorination does not limit the applicability of the models but this claim should be extensively tested in future research finally this study did not investigate the use of power functions to model dbp δa relationships the authors hypothesize that the multiple wavelengths used in the regression analyses quantify the contribution of distinct chromophores to dbp yields and hence circumvent the issue explained in the introduction of using a power function instead of a linear function future research should seek to test this hypothesis by comparing the single wavelength power function approach with the multiple wavelength approach and see if the gradually changing slope of single wavelength power functions can be attributed to the contribution of a second chromophore 5 conclusions the objective of this study to find a widely applicable dbp δa relationship by using more predictors than the single δa272 previously used has been met the main findings are the important predictors are a and δa at a first wavelength 270 nm for thm4 255 nm for dcaa and 250 nm for tcaa and haa6 and δa425 for all the dbps examined using these wavelengths made it possible to develop relationships that performed well as assessed by r2 and rmse in both the calibration and the test datasets the relationships are applicable to a wide range of water qualities doc uv254 suva temperature as long as the predictors a and δa of the water for which predictions are required are in the same range as the ones used to calibrate the regression parameters future research should test the applicability of multilinear relationships for chlorination conducted at various phs and the use of rapid granular filtration instead of lab filtration using fiberglass filters the procedure described in this paper should also be developed and applied in the future to unregulated and emerging dbps declaration of interests the authors declare that they have

18809,treated wastewater discharged into the environment acts as a disturbance of the natural microbial communities in terms of taxonomic composition and of functional gene pool including antibiotic resistance genes we tested whether stochastic and heterogeneous site specific trajectories or generalities potentially driven by deterministic processes control the fate of allochthonous bacteria from anthropogenic sources and the persistence of their functional traits in freshwater finding generalities would allow the identification of wastewater treatments that could be effective in abating determinants of antibiotic resistance we analysed the short term response of native bacterial communities in waters exposed to the disturbance of wastewater at different dilutions using a metagenomic approach that revealed both microbial community composition and the scope and abundance of the resistome that can pose indirect risks to human health we found that the taxonomic composition of the communities after the disturbance was driven by case specific stochastic processes whereas the resistome had a deterministic trajectory rapidly stabilising its functional traits with higher proportions of wastewater effluents regardless of differences in taxonomic composition richness of antibiotic resistance genes and of bacterial taxa phenotypic features of the bacterial communities and type of wastewater treatment the observed deterministic proliferation of resistomes in freshwater bodies receiving wastewater effluents suggests that this process may contribute to the global propagation of antibiotic resistance and thus calls for new legislations promoting alternative tertiary treatments for the wastewater reuse and targeting bacterial functional traits and not only bacterial abundances graphical abstract image 1 keywords aquatic microbiome antibiotic resistome resistance genes wastewater effluent ratio stability 1 introduction antibiotic resistance genes args are considered contaminants of emerging concern pruden et al 2006 because their release into the environment promotes their establishment di cesare et al 2015 and their potential transmission to human pathogens manaia 2017 the spread of args is documented in many environments when they are affected by human activities allen 2014 allen et al 2010 czekalski et al 2014 di cesare et al 2017 nesme and simonet 2015 wastewater treatment plants wwtps represent one of the most common sources of args pollution in aquatic systems rizzo et al 2013 the response of natural microbial communities in aquatic habitats to the introduction of args from wwtp effluents is still not clear munck et al 2015 conventional wwtps have limited efficiency in args removal karaolia et al 2018 and with the use of specific treatments they can co select resistances di cesare et al 2016a increasing thus the abundance of args in the receiving waters furthermore even when antibiotics are cautiously used the decrease of resistances in the environment is not immediately visible because of the buffering effect of environmental reservoirs for such genes berendonk et al 2015 thus understanding the fate of the args released into aquatic environments by wwtps is of primary importance in assessing the cycle of resistance and its capability of transmission to pathogens the quantitative impact of a wwtp on the receiving water is variable in space and time rivers have seasonal variations in discharge while dilution rates in seas and lakes are stable through time amos et al 2014 discharge of wwtp effluents into freshwater bodies is a stress factor that can result in disruption of natural conditions shifting them to alternative equilibria different scenarios can be hypothesised regarding the stability and resilience of the taxonomic composition in the bacterial communities and of their functional traits shade et al 2012 a disturbance introduces a novel combination of taxa and traits and as they both can face ecological limitations and extinction specific traits may or may be not be linked to specific taxa and ecological niches can be opened rykiel 1985 scheffer and carpenter 2003 the disturbance can then favour the establishment of allochthonous organisms from wwtps and of their new ecological functional traits including args of anthropogenic origin posing an indirect risk for human health manaia 2017 yet it is not clear whether deterministic processes will drive the changes at the community level with a common subset of dominant bacterial taxa and or ecological traits or if stochastic processes will dominate with new stresses producing a different taxonomic composition and or a different set of co occurring traits deterministic or stochastic processes may also affect functional traits independently of the taxonomic composition in order to address the hypothesis of deterministic versus stochastic processes at the taxonomic and functional levels we tested the short term response of different aquatic model systems after the exposure to the actual wwtp effluents that the communities would encounter in the field the results were achieved by comparing the variations in microbial community composition resistome phylogenetic distribution bacterial abundances and bacterial fitness over time and between the beginning and the end of manipulation experiments under a dilution gradient we hypothesise that higher levels of disturbance namely a higher ratio of wwtp to environmental water should affect the taxonomic composition and the functional traits of the resistome more intensely but we cannot predict whether taxonomic composition and functional traits will respond similarly and consistently under different conditions we used water from different environments river and lake from wwtps using different disinfection treatments chlorination peracetic acid uv radiation on different inflows urban urban and hospital urban and industrial which also differ in several aspects of chemical and physical water conditions thus consistent results from different treatments would allow generalizations on the spread of args in the environment if common patterns are found regardless of the intrinsic differences between waters and wwtps and regardless of the natural stochasticity of the response of bacterial communities to perturbations 2 materials and methods 2 1 sampling sites starting samples were collected as 24 h integrated sample mixing equal aliquots sampled every 3 h starting at 12 00 a m in november december 2015 and january 2016 at the

28 e 110000 pe and in the receiving water bodies about 200 m before the inflow of the effluent same dates but single sampling point lake maggiore for cannobio and verbania agogna river for novara in order to generalise our results we selected three wwtps characterized by different size treatment design and final disinfection process as required by the italian legislation chlorination in verbania peracetic acid treatment in cannobio and uv radiation in novara the detailed descriptions of the wwtps are shown elsewhere di cesare et al 2016c 2016b the weather conditions in january 2016 were with typical winter temperatures of air 3 1 7 6 c and water 7 2 c in the lake 6 3 c in the river 12 5 13 3 c for the effluents and without important rain events before and during the sampling campaign for each sampling point 10 l of water were collected in dna free bottles the samples of lake maggiore were taken at about 10 m from the shore and the first 10 m of vertical water column was integrated the sample of the river agogna was taken from a bridge integrating the upper 1 5 m of water column and carefully avoiding potential sediment contamination all collected samples were immediately transferred at 4 c in dark boxes and transported to the laboratory the experiments always started within 3 h from the initial sampling 2 2 experimental design the experiments one for each wwtp fig 1 were carried out in triplicate batch cultures final concentration 1 l in 3 l erlenmeyer flask sterile aerated forming a dilution gradient in five steps 100 wwtp effluent 90 10 50 50 10 90 100 receiving environment water without supplementing any additional nutrient all bacterial communities were prefiltered through a 30 μm net to remove large particles and zooplanktonic predators while nano predators protists remained given the impossibility to define a dilution rate of the effluents in lake maggiore the experimental setup was designed to be comparable to the dilution of the effluent of the novara wwtp in the river agogna ranging between 1 1 drought periods to 1 10 1 15 the experiments ran for 96 h for novara and for 144 h for cannobio and verbania in order to obtain comparable growth conditions abundances of the microbial communities under controlled climate conditions dark 10 c to reproduce the temperature of the effluents once merged in the receiving waters samples for microbiological analyses 10 ml were collected from each flask every 24 h while samples for metagenomics analysis 500 ml were collected at the beginning and at the end of the dilution experiments filtered on 0 22 μm polycarbonate filters and stored at 20 c until molecular processing subsamples for microscopy and overall microbial counts at the flow cytometer were fixed in formaldehyde 1 final concentration while samples for the assessment of intact damaged cells were immediately processed 2 3 dna extraction and quantitative pcr the filters for dna extraction from the sampling stations time 0 and the experimental end point were processed in triplicates by using the ultraclean microbial dna isolation kit mobio laboratories following the manufacturer s instructions with minor modification as described elsewhere di cesare et al 2015 dna was then checked for quality via agarose gel electrophoresis and quantified with a fluorimeter qubit invitrogen to verify the reproducibility between replicates for each sample in terms of args abundance qpcr assays targeting the 16s rrna gene and three selected args i e teta ermb and qnrs against tetracycline erythromycin and quinolones respectively commonly quantifiable in the effluents from the selected wwtps di cesare et al 2016b were carried out the details of the qpcr protocols and programmes have been previously described di cesare et al 2016c 2015 the specificity of the qpcr products was verified by the melting profile analysis and electrophoresis run mean and standard deviation values of the efficiency and r2 for all the runs carried out to quantify the tested genes were 105 95 9 17 and 0 99 0 01 respectively the limits of quantification were calculated as described by bustin et al 2009 they were 156 121 51 217 copies μl 1 for 16s rrna gene teta ermb and qnrs respectively the potential inhibition of pcr due to the nature of the analysed sample was tested by the dilution method di cesare et al 2013 and no inhibition was observed based on the high similarity between replicates in terms of bacterial number and fitness expressed as number of living cells proportion of living cells and number of aggregates and args presence inferred by qpcr see results the replicate with intermediate bacterial abundance was selected for metagenomic analyses 2 4 high throughput sequencing bioinformatic analyses and data availability aliquots of about 10 μg of dna from each selected sample were submitted to lgc genomics berlin germany for shotgun metagenomic sequencing sequence libraries of 150 bp dna paired end fragments were prepared and sequenced using an illumina nextseq 500 v2 the generated sequences were demultiplexed using illumina bcl2fastq 2 17 1 14 software and adaptors were removed reads containing three or more ambiguous nucleotides or with quality score below 30 were removed before data analysis illumina reads were deposited in the ncbi https www ncbi nlm nih gov genbank under the project prjna413894 srp119748 and accession numbers srr6158301 321 arg like sequences in the sequencing data were identified by args oap as previous described yang et al 2016 a read was annotated as an arg like sequence when the threshold of amino acid sequences was higher than 90 and the sequence alignment length was higher than 25 aa yang et al 2013 gene fragments not only related to antibiotic resistance were excluded from further analyses the abundance of args was presented using the unit of copies cell 1 as previously demonstrated yang et al 2016 taxonomic classification and relative quantification was performed using metaphlan2 by mapping the reads against the unique clade specific marker genes identified from the reference genomes truong et al 2015 single taxonomic units were designed as otus 2 5 bacterial abundances and morphological distribution daily collected aliquots from each flask were used to measure bacterial abundance and size distribution and the proportion of intact damaged cells all variables were assessed by flow cytometry accuri c6 bd biosciences and confirmed by epifluorescence microscopy axioplan zeiss bacterial abundance and size distribution were obtained from aliquots of 1 ml for each sample stained with sybr green i life technologies solution 1 for 15 min in the dark counts on triplicate samples were set to a minimum of 2 106 events within the gate set for single bacterial cells and 5 102 events when possible in the gate set for bacterial aggregates horňák and corno 2012 the subdivision single cells aggregates in the cytograms was validated by the periodical check of 3 5 selected samples in epifluorescence microscopy on dapi stained bacteria collected on 0 2 μm polycarbonate filters millipore the nucleic acid double staining procedure to assess the relative proportion of intact damaged bacterial cells was done by simultaneous staining by membrane permeable nucleic acid dye sybr green i final concentration

2009 gates design and events enumeration per ml for every sample were carried out with the accuri c6 resident analysis software bd biosciences 2 6 statistical analyses diversity indices were assessed for args and for otus for the 36 samples 3 original from the environment 3 original from the wwtp effluents 15 at the end and 15 at the beginning of the 5 experiments of 0 100 10 90 50 50 90 10 and 100 0 proportions environment wwtp effluent for each of the 3 sites we analysed 1 total richness expressed as number of otus or args 2 composition expressed as differences in abundance based occurrence of otus and args between samples 3 indicator values expressed as the otus or args that are typical of groups of samples and 4 changes through time in the experimental dilutions all analyses were performed in r 3 3 3 crawley 2013 r core team 2017 in order to minimise the possibility of false inference in type i error rejecting the null hypothesis of no relationship when it is actually true we considered a conservative alpha level for significance of 0 01 instead of the commonly used 0 05 crawley 2013 we compared the arg and otu diversity parameters between those found at the end of the experiment and those set at the beginning of the experiment for the different dilutions in total 15 original samples and 15 final samples were compared 5 dilutions 0 100 10 90 50 50 90 10 and 100 0 proportions environment wwtp effluent in 3 sites cannobio novara verbania in order to minimise the confounding factor of genes that are not strictly related to antibiotic resistance all genes that fell into the category of multi drug resistance mdr were excluded from the statistical analyses the first test we performed was on richness using a paired t test we checked that the number of args and of otus did not change then we tested whether the differences in arg and otu composition between the beginning and the end of the experiment assessed with abundance based bray curtis dissimilarity distance was influenced by the effect of the different proportion of wwtp effluent and environmental water for this test we used a linear model with differences in composition between the beginning and the end of the experiment as a function of the level of dilution and the site of origin including their interaction richness was simply counted as number of args and otus in each of the samples given that arg and otu numbers are count data we log transformed the response variable in all analyses we tested whether richness was significantly different 1 between sites cannobio novara verbania due to differences in the receiving environment river or lake wastewater origin urban and industrial urban only and treatment uv chlorine peracetic acid disinfection and types of surrounding habitats mainly flatland and agricultural or mainly hills mountains and woodland and 2 between types of water original environment original wwtp effluent or at the end of the five dilution experiments we used two way anova to address this issue and additionally performed tukey honestly significant difference test tukeyhsd in cases of significant results from anova model fit was assessed by a visual inspection of the distribution of the model residuals of the q q plot and of cook s distances to exclude the presence of single influential values for the relationships crawley 2013 in addition limiting the analyses only to the experiments we tested whether at the end of the experiment there was any effect of the level of dilution 0 100 10 90 50 50 90 10 and 100 0 proportions environment wwtp effluent including potential differences between sites in linear regression models with dilution and site of origin as explanatory variables abundance based differences in arg and otu composition between samples were measured as bray curtis metrics the obtained matrices of pairwise distances were then used in permutational analyses of variances with the adonis function in vegan v2 4 3 oksanen et al 2017 to test if the differences could be explained by the site of origin cannobio novara verbania the type of water original environment original wwtp effluent or at the end of the dilution experiments and their interaction limiting the analyses only to the experiments we tested whether at the end of the experiment there was any effect of the level of dilution 0 100 10 90 50 50 90 10 and 100 0 proportions environment wwtp effluent including potential differences between sites in adonis with dilution and site of origin as explanatory variables in order to identify which args or otus could be considered typical of each type of water or site of origin we used a statistical approach similar to what ecologists use to identify indicator species in communities dufrêne and legendre 1997 thus we applied the indval function of the r package labdsv v1 8 0 roberts 2016 for bacterial abundances abundance of living cells proportion of living cells and abundance of aggregates we implemented linear models with level of dilution site of origin experimental sampling time and the interaction between these terms as explanatory variables and calculated the adjusted r squared for each model a similar approach was implemented for the assessment of reproducibility for the four molecular markers 16s rrna gene teta ermb and qnrs using site of origin and level of dilution in linear models calculating the adjusted r squared for the model for each marker the rationale was that a high adjusted r squared would mean a low variability between replicates 3 results the resistome of the bacterial communities revealed that the differences in args composition measured as abundance based bray curtis differences between the end and the beginning of each experiment 15 experiments five rates of dilution from 0 to 100 wwtp effluents each from three paired sites environment wwtp fig 1 were significantly influenced by the dilution lm as anova output f1 9 11 5 p 0 008 fig 2 a meaning that a lower proportion of wwtp effluents produced resistomes that were rather different from those of the effluent and of the receiving open water before the mixing whereas a higher proportion of wwtp effluents stabilised a homogeneous resistome more similar as composition of args to the original one the differences in the resistomes between the beginning and the end of the experiments were not affected by differences between the sites of origin of the water and the wwtp effluent cannobio lake novara river verbania lake f2 9 0 9 p 0 429 nor by the interaction term between dilution and site of origin meaning that the effect of dilution on args composition was the same in all types of waters and wwtps f2 9 1 8 p 0 224 thus the resistome was more stable in its composition of args at higher proportions of water from wwtp effluents suggesting a stabilising effect of the intensity of the perturbation of wwtp effluents regardless of the differences in disinfection treatment between wwtps of the origin of the treated waters and of the type of receiving waters for details see supplementary file 1 the effluents of wwtps seem to promote the rapid stabilization of the newly established environmental resistome yet such args alteration could be alternatively explained as a by product of a stabilization in the taxonomic composition of the microbial communities if a species specific association with specific taxa that carry specific args is present we tested for such confounding factor by analysing the bacterial community composition and richness throughout the experiments differences in operational taxonomic unit otu composition between the end and the beginning of the experiments were not influenced by the analysed variables neither the level of dilution f1 9 3 6 p 0 090 fig 2b nor differences between sites of origin f2 9 1 2 p 0 345 nor the interaction between these terms f2 9 0 5 p 0 598 had any effect on taxonomic composition in addition richness in otus did not change between the beginning and the end of the experiments paired t test t 1 8 p 0 090 the same pattern was found when analysing composition and diversity at the level of order or class supplementary file 1 in the microbiome of all the analysed communities either collected in the field or measured in the experiments differences in otu richness were not influenced by differences between the sites of origin f2 12 1 0 p 0 387 and were only marginally influenced by the types of water f2 12 4 5 p 0 034 with a limited interaction between sites of origin and water types f2 12 3 5 p 0 040 suggesting that the number of taxa in bacterial communities was somehow but not extremely different between wwtp effluents and the environment supplementary fig 1 an alternative explanation for the stabilization of the antibiotic resistome could be accounted by changes in args richness during the experiments for example with only few args surviving at higher doses of wwtps effluents yet richness in args did not change between the beginning and the end of the experiments paired t test t 0 6 p 0 556 moreover in the resistomes of the communities analysed at the end of the experiment the number of args was not related to the levels of dilution f1 9 0 66 p 0 436 neither to the differences between sites of origin f2 9 0 04 p 0 961 supplementary fig 2 regarding the taxonomic classification obtained from metagenomic data metaphlan2 only 24 otus were exclusive of the microbiome of the receiving water bodies while 150 were exclusive of wwtp effluents and 94 were shared between the two types of water four otus aeromonas arcobacter deinococcus and brevibacterium resulted to be statistically defining indval the wwtp effluents and three pseudomonas limnohabitans and sphingobium the experiments supplementary table 1 the geographical distribution of the otus supplementary fig 3 evidenced the peculiarity of the site of novara with about 50 of the overall detected otus uniquely present here the remaining 50 was shared among the three sites with a limited amount of otus present only in verbania 19 and even fewer otus solely detected in cannobio 4 the resistome was marginally different between the three main types of water we analysed environment wwtp or experiment adonis r2 0 16 p 0 0126 and more strongly different between the site of origin r2 0 17 p 0 0038 with novara being the site that was different from the other two the interaction between the two terms was not significant p 0 0715 at the end of the dilution experiments the drivers of the differences in args composition between treatments were the site of origin adonis r2 0 26 p 0 0006 and the percentage of dilution r2 0 20 p 0 0001 within this study we recognized 350 different args of which 38 resulted to be exclusive of the receiving water bodies and 94 of the wwtp effluents the shared resistome genes present in both environment and effluents were 84 accounting for about 40 of the overall args no additional args were detected in the experimental settings in comparison to the original waters from the environment and the wwtp effluents confirming the reliability of the approach and the fact that no undetected args in the original waters became detectable in the dilution experiments the most diverse genes were those conferring resistance against beta lactams with 115 different args types 53 9 exclusively present in the wwtp effluents among them the well represented groups of oxa and tem genes resulted to be particularly interesting being the former typical of wwtp effluents 27 gene variants out of 38 and the latter more environmental 28 gene variants out of 30 are either exclusively environmental or shared table 1 other families of args e g tet and sul genes resulted to be mostly shared between the different waters the geographical distribution of the detected args supplementary fig 3 revealed a large part of the resistome almost half of the detected genes shared between all the three locations while only a third of them was specific for a single site six args resulted to be statistically defining indval the environmental water bodies cat against chloramphenicol bla tem 75 and a generic metallo beta lactamase tlcc and vata macrolide lincosamide streptogramin group and aph3 iib against aminoglycosides while three args resulted to be typical of wwtp effluents bla oxa 1 and bla fox 4 against beta lactams and aac2 i against aminoglycosides supplementary table 2 considering the most relevant args families supplementary fig 4 and analysing whether they were more abundant in the environment or in the wwtp effluents the number of genes resulted to be significantly lower in the environment for aminoglycoside tukeyhsd test p 0 0034 and beta lactams p 0 0069 whereas no significant differences were detected for the other args groups the dynamics of single args from the beginning to the end of the experiments supplementary fig 5 revealed a reduction in abundances in the treatments with only environmental waters and 10 wwtp effluent for the most common genes while no clear trends could be detected for the least abundant args or for the other dilution treatments at the same time contradictory scenarios characterized the different isotypes of the same genes e g bla tem bla oxa with no clear selection in favour of a specific form or of their origin bacterial abundances fitness and phenotypic distribution fig 3 supplementary fig 6 were affected by the applied disinfection treatment and their recovery when mixed with the natural communities varied in time and numbers the end of each experimental gradient treatment was set up according to bacterial abundances and before the complete depletion of nutrients in the culture media thus at the end of the stationary bacterial growth phase the wwtp effluents were characterized by microbial abundances from less than 1 106 cells ml 1 in cannobio and verbania to almost 4 106 cells ml 1 in novara while abundances in the receiving water bodies were all less than 1 106 cells ml 1 and they resulted especially low in the river agogna where they were less than 0 2 106 cells ml 1 the mixed communities proportions adjusted to the water volumes were composed of approximately equal proportion of cells from the two original sources in cannobio and verbania while the treatments with 10 50 and 90 wwtp effluent in novara were composed predominantly of cells originating from the wwtp the number of bacteria in 0 and 10 wwtp effluent remained stable during the whole experiment in verbania whilst it rose rapidly in cannobio and novara for the first part of the experiment before decreasing in response to the reduction in nutrients fig 3 for all these treatments the proportion of intact cells remained very high generally above 90 for the whole experiment whereas the number of large aggregates was constant during the experiment supplementary fig 6 the bacterial abundance in 90 and 100 wwtp effluent dropped almost to 0 in verbania potentially due to the remaining effect of chlorination but it then rose again to about 7 106 cells ml 1 at the end of the experiment with a proportion of intact cells that rose as well from less than 10 90 wwtp effluent in novara 90 and 100 wwtp effluent the number of cells remained stable for 48 h and then rapidly dropped and the proportion of intact cells followed a comparable trend in cannobio 90 and 100 wwtp effluent treatments the number of bacterial cells as well as the proportion of intact cells remained stable during the whole experiment for cell number and measurements of viability number of living cells proportion of living cells and number of aggregates the amount of variance due to variability between replicates was negligible in comparison to the differences between treatments the adjusted r2 values for statistical models including site of origin dilution treatment day of the experiment and their interaction went from 0 98 to 0 99 this means that less than 2 of the variability in the models was due to differences between replicates by comparing data on bacterial abundances fitness and size distribution we demonstrated a high degree of similarity between replicates for each level of each factor fig 3 supplementary fig 6 we then selected the replicate with intermediate values of bacterial abundance for metagenomic analyses in addition as a further control on the reproducibility of the genetic distribution between each of the three replicates for each analysed level four markers were tested by quantitative pcr qpcr the 16s rrna gene and three args teta ermb and qnrs characterized by different distributional patterns between samples different molecular weight base composition and length for all of the markers the amount of variance due to variability between replicates was negligible in comparison to the differences between treatments the adjusted r2 values for statistical models including site of origin dilution treatment and their interaction went from 0 89 for teta to 0 91 for ermb 0 95 for qnrs and 0 96 for 16s rrna gene this means that less than 11 of the variability in the worst model and only 4 in the best model were due to differences between replicates supporting the reliable use of only one replicate for the metagenomic analyses we performed 4 discussion natural environments are generally considered as essentially stable resistant and resilient ecosystems the resident bacterial communities are composed by taxa that occupy ecological niches almost redundantly incrementing the intrinsic resistance to disturbances through the complexity of the ecological interactions between organisms and the redundancy of nodes and connections allison and martiny 2008 fenchel and finlay 2004 the intensity of a disturbance is a driving factor in determining the effect of the disturbance itself on the ecosystem mackey and currie 2001 and thus the possibility for the ecosystem to preserve its former state or to recover it miller et al 2011 in our study by experimentally varying the intensity of the anthropogenic disturbance caused by the introduction of wwtp effluents in waters of the receiving environments we could modulate the responses by the local resident communities opening a number of questions that need to be addressed for a correct understanding of the impact of wwtp effluents on the environment the most relevant consequence suggested by our experimental output is that an increase in the proportion of wwtp effluents into the receiving environment might promote the stabilization of the resistome namely the group of all the args detected in a given system mostly deriving from the wwtp effluents in the newly formed microbial communities yet no evidence was found of taxa that could drive the process at the same time no statistically significant temporal trend could be detected for the overall bacterial taxonomic composition which varied without clear patterns often independently of the wwtp effluents dilution the concomitant contrasting trends of the microbiomes not showing any clear trajectory and the resistomes revealing a common homogenising pattern regardless of differences between treatments and receiving water suggest that the stabilization of the args as a functional trait in disturbed communities can occur even if the bacterial composition is not stable our experiment suggests that such a phenomenon may be happening in a variety of receiving environments since we used waters with very different properties a highly impacted river river agogna italy where the local resident bacterial community is simplified and generally pretty unstable crump and hobbie 2005 and a large subalpine lake lake maggiore italy where the microbial community is complex and stable callieri et al 2009 2014 the fact that the microbial communities developed stochastically in each experiment without producing a similar community at the end of the experiment neither in taxonomic composition nor in bacterial fitness or abundances seems to exclude adaptation to lab conditions as a confounding factor in the interpretation of the results furthermore the stabilization of the resistomes in terms of arg composition independently of their respective microbiome with increasing proportion of wwtp effluent might be valid for different types of wwtp effluents in this study we used effluents of urban wastewater treatment plants with novara and cannobio and without verbania a proportion of industrial wastewater the applied disinfection treatment varied among the studied wwtps uv radiation in novara chlorination in verbania peracetic acid disinfection in cannobio and caused long term effects on the experimental communities e g the presence for a few hours of toxic by products of chlorination or of peracetic acid the presence of intact but dead or inactive cells after uv disinfection etc di cesare et al 2016c such differences could have been the cause of the contrasting trends detected in bacterial composition abundances and fitness zhang et al 2015 sharma et al 2016 yet independently of such differences in treated waters and disinfection technologies the stabilization lower dissimilarity in the composition of args with increasing proportion of wwtp effluent was a common pattern and may represent a deterministic process in the system the same functional traits expressed as the same args were selected by the disturbance regardless of which bacterial taxa may survive the disturbance the antibiotic resistome of sewage waters of 17 large cities in china evidenced a large pool of args commonly and steadily shared within the different microbial communities su et al 2017 the same study suggested dilution of the sewage as a potential factor determining the composition of the resistome as well as seasonality although the impact of seasonality on the spread and the persistence in environment of args has been deeply investigated proving the influence of winter antibiotic consumption natural microbial successions and temperature caucci et al 2016 martínez 2008 novo et al 2013 the impacts of the dilution of wwtp effluents on the environmental microbiome and resistome was unknown most studies on the effect of wwtp effluents dilution on determinants of antibiotic resistance in natural waters focused on the potential impact of antibiotics at low concentrations davies et al 2006 kümmerer 2009 without analysing the ecological fate of resistance genes within the newly formed communities our study is the first one to support the suggestion of a major role of the dilution rate in stabilising the arg composition another recent study munck et al 2015 demonstrated a long term 7 years stability of the microbiome and of the resistome of microbial communities within urban wwtps in denmark the study evidenced the specificity of the resistome of microbial communities in wwtps confirming earlier evidence yang et al 2013 and suggested a correlation between a stable microbial community and a stable resistome in our study the general stabilization of the resistome functional stability with high inputs of wwtp effluents occurred independently of the stabilization of the overall microbiome compositional stability implying the resistome generally carried on mobile or mobilisable parts of the bacterial genomes as an early assessed feature of the newly establishing community after the disturbance allison and martiny 2008 rodriguez mozaz et al 2015 the reasons underlying this fact are debatable as a number of coinciding disturbing factors are acting on the natural communities once the wwtp effluent and its microbial load are introduced into the environment for sure increasing the proportion of effluent promotes a general increment in nutrients in most environments and thus the selection towards fast growing bacteria typical of eutrophic systems and possibly of allochthonous origin in case of non eutrophic receiving water bodies lekunberri et al 2018 at the same time in both the wwtp effluents and in human impacted receiving waters the presence of heavy metals pharmaceuticals and other pollutants could favour phenomena of co selection of resistances eckert et al 2018 all these conditions could promote the persistence of args and their spread into the newly formed communities but none of them alone could justify the stabilization of the original resistomes besides the overall microbiome and the resistome did not change likewise implying that the stabilization of the resistome may happen with high proportions of effluent independently of the development of the overall bacterial taxonomic composition additional conditions could favour the stabilization of the composition in args ecological factors controlling the bacterial abundances e g viral lysis and selective predation by nano flagellates and larger planktonic organisms thingstad 2000 also promote a large release of dna fragments into waters which may include args at the same time wwtp effluents also release together with the treated wastewater and the resident microbial community a large amount of free dna including that of antibiotic resistant bacteria and pathogens killed by disinfection zhang et al 2018 in the not uncommon case of wwtp effluents discharge in water bodies with natural bacterial communities encompassing competent bacteria such dna could enter through horizontal or vertical transfer within the newly formed microbial communities thus promoting the stabilization of the microbiome of the wwtp in surface waters furthermore cell free dna usually abundant in wwtp effluents after a tertiary treatment zhang et al 2018 could potentially bind to organic matter or clay particles in the water and remain stable in the system here the suggested stabilization of the composition in args at higher proportions of wwtp effluent calls for a much more careful use and reuse of wastewaters implementing new quality parameters including dilution and molecular markers of resistance either resistance genes or specific dna fragments as proxies of resistance independently of the underlying ecological mechanisms environments like lakes or seas might in general be less affected by the phenomenon of stabilising resistomes thanks to the massive dilution of the wwtp effluents discharged there even if heavily impacted lakes and waters can still show important gradients of decreasing contamination from the pollution sources ma et al 2017 the situation is different for water bodies like rivers or irrigational channels which can receive important loads of wwtp effluents accounting for up to 90 of their running water in some periods of the year the natural conditions of the river agogna in january 2016 were for example of very limited discharge 0 4 1 4 m3 s 1 data provided by the regional agency for environmental protection arpa piemonte while the effluent of the wwtp of novara was stable around 0 45 m3 s 1 thus providing a significant proportion of the river water 25 55 after discharging in it our experimental study demonstrated the direct impact of the dilution rate of wwtp effluents on the immediate stabilization of the resistome in open waters independently of its relative microbiome the consequences in the environment can be even enhanced when compared to our study in our short term experiment we tested the development of the newly formed mixed communities for a period of a few days after an initial inoculum whereas in nature the disturbance provided by a wwtp effluent is constant and can be defined as a continuous press disturbance this may reduce the resilience of the disturbed community requiring complex pathways towards the re establishment of a stable community glasby and underwood 1996 opening niche opportunities shea and chesson 2002 to allochthonous bacteria and genes and thus to the establishment of resistances of allochthonous origin lekunberri et al 2018 this is particularly true for communities that are not stable through time e g those of small rivers and or not able to counteract the effect of point disturbances by long term resilience as demonstrated for agricultural soils frenk et al 2014 5 conclusions our experimental study demonstrates the potential threat posed by the release of uncontrolled dilution of wwtp effluents into open waters our results suggest the implementation of controls and limitations in the proportion of treated wwtp effluents released in surface waters in order to keep high dilution rates at least until new treatments efficiently removing determinants of resistance will be applied to wastewater the need to obtain wastewater with a limited load of resistance genes is important because with the expected increase of treated wastewater reuse in agriculture in the next decade cisneros

18809,treated wastewater discharged into the environment acts as a disturbance of the natural microbial communities in terms of taxonomic composition and of functional gene pool including antibiotic resistance genes we tested whether stochastic and heterogeneous site specific trajectories or generalities potentially driven by deterministic processes control the fate of allochthonous bacteria from anthropogenic sources and the persistence of their functional traits in freshwater finding generalities would allow the identification of wastewater treatments that could be effective in abating determinants of antibiotic resistance we analysed the short term response of native bacterial communities in waters exposed to the disturbance of wastewater at different dilutions using a metagenomic approach that revealed both microbial community composition and the scope and abundance of the resistome that can pose indirect risks to human health we found that the taxonomic composition of the communities after the disturbance was driven by case specific stochastic processes whereas the resistome had a deterministic trajectory rapidly stabilising its functional traits with higher proportions of wastewater effluents regardless of differences in taxonomic composition richness of antibiotic resistance genes and of bacterial taxa phenotypic features of the bacterial communities and type of wastewater treatment the observed deterministic proliferation of resistomes in freshwater bodies receiving wastewater effluents suggests that this process may contribute to the global propagation of antibiotic resistance and thus calls for new legislations promoting alternative tertiary treatments for the wastewater reuse and targeting bacterial functional traits and not only bacterial abundances graphical abstract image 1 keywords aquatic microbiome antibiotic resistome resistance genes wastewater effluent ratio stability 1 introduction antibiotic resistance genes args are considered contaminants of emerging concern pruden et al 2006 because their release into the environment promotes their establishment di cesare et al 2015 and their potential transmission to human pathogens manaia 2017 the spread of args is documented in many environments when they are affected by human activities allen 2014 allen et al 2010 czekalski et al 2014 di cesare et al 2017 nesme and simonet 2015 wastewater treatment plants wwtps represent one of the most common sources of args pollution in aquatic systems rizzo et al 2013 the response of natural microbial communities in aquatic habitats to the introduction of args from wwtp effluents is still not clear munck et al 2015 conventional wwtps have limited efficiency in args removal karaolia et al 2018 and with the use of specific treatments they can co select resistances di cesare et al 2016a increasing thus the abundance of args in the receiving waters furthermore even when antibiotics are cautiously used the decrease of resistances in the environment is not immediately visible because of the buffering effect of environmental reservoirs for such genes berendonk et al 2015 thus understanding the fate of the args released into aquatic environments by wwtps is of primary importance in assessing the cycle of resistance and its capability of transmission to pathogens the quantitative impact of a wwtp on the receiving water is variable in space and time rivers have seasonal variations in discharge while dilution rates in seas and lakes are stable through time amos et al 2014 discharge of wwtp effluents into freshwater bodies is a stress factor that can result in disruption of natural conditions shifting them to alternative equilibria different scenarios can be hypothesised regarding the stability and resilience of the taxonomic composition in the bacterial communities and of their functional traits shade et al 2012 a disturbance introduces a novel combination of taxa and traits and as they both can face ecological limitations and extinction specific traits may or may be not be linked to specific taxa and ecological niches can be opened rykiel 1985 scheffer and carpenter 2003 the disturbance can then favour the establishment of allochthonous organisms from wwtps and of their new ecological functional traits including args of anthropogenic origin posing an indirect risk for human health manaia 2017 yet it is not clear whether deterministic processes will drive the changes at the community level with a common subset of dominant bacterial taxa and or ecological traits or if stochastic processes will dominate with new stresses producing a different taxonomic composition and or a different set of co occurring traits deterministic or stochastic processes may also affect functional traits independently of the taxonomic composition in order to address the hypothesis of deterministic versus stochastic processes at the taxonomic and functional levels we tested the short term response of different aquatic model systems after the exposure to the actual wwtp effluents that the communities would encounter in the field the results were achieved by comparing the variations in microbial community composition resistome phylogenetic distribution bacterial abundances and bacterial fitness over time and between the beginning and the end of manipulation experiments under a dilution gradient we hypothesise that higher levels of disturbance namely a higher ratio of wwtp to environmental water should affect the taxonomic composition and the functional traits of the resistome more intensely but we cannot predict whether taxonomic composition and functional traits will respond similarly and consistently under different conditions we used water from different environments river and lake from wwtps using different disinfection treatments chlorination peracetic acid uv radiation on different inflows urban urban and hospital urban and industrial which also differ in several aspects of chemical and physical water conditions thus consistent results from different treatments would allow generalizations on the spread of args in the environment if common patterns are found regardless of the intrinsic differences between waters and wwtps and regardless of the natural stochasticity of the response of bacterial communities to perturbations 2 materials and methods 2 1 sampling sites starting samples were collected as 24 h integrated sample mixing equal aliquots sampled every 3 h starting at 12 00 a m in november december 2015 and january 2016 at the

order to generalise our results we selected three wwtps characterized by different size treatment design and final disinfection process as required by the italian legislation chlorination in verbania peracetic acid treatment in cannobio and uv radiation in novara the detailed descriptions of the wwtps are shown elsewhere di cesare et al 2016c 2016b the weather conditions in january 2016 were with typical winter temperatures of air 3 1 7 6 c and water 7 2 c in the lake 6 3 c in the river 12 5 13 3 c for the effluents and without important rain events before and during the sampling campaign for each sampling point 10 l of water were collected in dna free bottles the samples of lake maggiore were taken at about 10 m from the shore and the first 10 m of vertical water column was integrated the sample of the river agogna was taken from a bridge integrating the upper 1 5 m of water column and carefully avoiding potential sediment contamination all collected samples were immediately transferred at 4 c in dark boxes and transported to the laboratory the experiments always started within 3 h from the initial sampling 2 2 experimental design the experiments one for each wwtp fig 1

receiving environment water without supplementing any additional nutrient all bacterial communities were prefiltered through a 30 μm net to remove large particles and zooplanktonic predators while nano predators protists remained given the impossibility to define a dilution rate of the effluents in lake maggiore the experimental setup was designed to be comparable to the dilution of the effluent of the novara wwtp in the river agogna ranging between 1 1 drought periods to 1 10 1 15 the experiments ran for 96 h for novara and for 144 h for cannobio and verbania in order to obtain comparable growth conditions abundances of the microbial communities under controlled climate conditions dark 10 c to reproduce the temperature of the effluents once merged in the receiving waters samples for microbiological analyses 10 ml were collected from each flask every 24 h while samples for metagenomics analysis 500 ml were collected at the beginning and at the end of the dilution experiments filtered on 0 22 μm polycarbonate filters and stored at 20 c until molecular processing subsamples for microscopy and overall microbial counts at the flow cytometer were fixed in formaldehyde 1 final concentration while samples for the assessment of intact damaged cells were immediately processed 2 3 dna extraction and quantitative pcr the filters for dna extraction from the sampling stations time 0 and the experimental end point were processed in triplicates by using the ultraclean microbial dna isolation kit mobio laboratories following the manufacturer s instructions with minor modification as described elsewhere di cesare et al 2015 dna was then checked for quality via agarose gel electrophoresis and quantified with a fluorimeter qubit invitrogen to verify the reproducibility between replicates for each sample in terms of args abundance qpcr assays targeting the 16s rrna gene and three selected args i e teta ermb and qnrs against tetracycline erythromycin and quinolones respectively commonly quantifiable in the effluents from the selected wwtps di cesare et al 2016b were carried out the details of the qpcr protocols and programmes have been previously described di cesare et al 2016c 2015 the specificity of the qpcr products was verified by the melting profile analysis and electrophoresis run mean and standard deviation values of the efficiency and r2 for all the runs carried out to quantify the tested genes were 105 95 9 17 and 0 99 0 01 respectively the limits of quantification were calculated as described by bustin et al 2009 they were 156 121 51 217 copies μl 1 for 16s rrna gene teta ermb and qnrs respectively the potential inhibition of pcr due to the nature of the analysed sample was tested by the dilution method di cesare et al 2013 and no inhibition was observed based on the high similarity between replicates in terms of bacterial number and fitness expressed as number of living cells proportion of living cells and number of aggregates and args presence inferred by qpcr see results the replicate with intermediate bacterial abundance was selected for metagenomic analyses 2 4 high throughput sequencing bioinformatic analyses and data availability aliquots of about 10 μg of dna from each selected sample were submitted to lgc genomics berlin germany for shotgun metagenomic sequencing sequence libraries of 150 bp dna paired end fragments were prepared and sequenced using an illumina nextseq 500 v2 the generated sequences were demultiplexed using illumina bcl2fastq 2 17 1 14 software and adaptors were removed reads containing three or more ambiguous nucleotides or with quality score below 30 were removed before data analysis illumina reads were deposited in the ncbi https www ncbi nlm nih gov genbank under the project prjna413894 srp119748 and accession numbers srr6158301 321 arg like sequences in the sequencing data were identified by args oap as previous described yang et al 2016 a read was annotated as an arg like sequence when the threshold of amino acid sequences was higher than 90 and the sequence alignment length was higher than 25 aa yang et al 2013 gene fragments not only related to antibiotic resistance were excluded from further analyses the abundance of args was presented using the unit of copies cell 1 as previously demonstrated yang et al 2016 taxonomic classification and relative quantification was performed using metaphlan2 by mapping the reads against the unique clade specific marker genes identified from the reference genomes truong et al 2015 single taxonomic units were designed as otus 2 5 bacterial abundances and morphological distribution daily collected aliquots from each flask were used to measure bacterial abundance and size distribution and the proportion of intact damaged cells all variables were assessed by flow cytometry accuri c6 bd biosciences and confirmed by epifluorescence microscopy axioplan zeiss bacterial abundance and size distribution were obtained from aliquots of 1 ml for each sample stained with sybr green i life technologies solution 1 for 15 min in the dark counts on triplicate samples were set to a minimum of 2

cytograms was validated by the periodical check of 3 5 selected samples in epifluorescence microscopy on dapi stained bacteria collected on 0 2 μm polycarbonate filters millipore the nucleic acid

occurrence of otus and args between samples 3 indicator values expressed as the otus or args that are typical of groups of samples and 4 changes through time in the experimental dilutions all analyses were performed in r 3 3 3 crawley 2013 r core team 2017 in order to minimise the possibility of false inference in type i error rejecting the null hypothesis of no relationship when it is actually true we considered a conservative alpha level for significance of 0 01 instead of the commonly used 0 05 crawley 2013 we compared the arg and otu diversity parameters between those found at the end of the experiment and those set at the beginning of the experiment for the different dilutions in total 15 original samples and 15 final samples were compared 5 dilutions 0 100 10 90 50 50 90 10 and 100 0 proportions environment wwtp effluent in 3 sites cannobio novara verbania in order to minimise the confounding factor of genes that are not strictly related to antibiotic resistance all genes that fell into the category of multi drug resistance mdr were excluded from the statistical analyses the first test we performed was on richness using a paired t test we checked that the number of args and of otus did not change then we tested whether the differences in arg and otu composition between the beginning and the end of the experiment assessed with abundance based bray curtis dissimilarity distance was influenced by the effect of the different proportion of wwtp effluent and environmental water for this test we used a linear model with differences in composition between the beginning and the end of the experiment as a function of the level of dilution and the site of origin including their interaction richness was simply counted as number of args and otus in each of the samples given that arg and otu numbers are count data we log transformed the response variable in all analyses we tested whether richness was significantly different 1 between sites cannobio novara verbania due to differences in the receiving environment river or lake wastewater origin urban and industrial urban only and treatment uv chlorine peracetic acid disinfection and types of surrounding habitats mainly flatland and agricultural or mainly hills mountains and woodland and 2 between types of water original environment original wwtp effluent or at the end of the five dilution experiments we used two way anova to address this issue and additionally performed tukey honestly significant difference test tukeyhsd in cases of significant results from anova model fit was assessed by a visual inspection of the distribution of the model residuals of the q q plot and of cook s distances to exclude the presence of single influential values for the relationships crawley 2013 in addition limiting the analyses only to the experiments we tested whether at the end of the experiment there was any effect of the level of dilution 0 100 10 90 50 50 90 10 and 100 0 proportions environment wwtp effluent including potential differences between sites in linear regression models with dilution and site of origin as explanatory variables abundance based differences in arg and otu composition between samples were measured as bray curtis metrics the obtained matrices of pairwise distances were then used in permutational analyses of variances with the adonis function in vegan v2 4 3 oksanen et al 2017 to test if the differences could be explained by the site of origin cannobio novara verbania the type of water original environment original wwtp effluent or at the end of the dilution experiments and their interaction limiting the analyses only to the experiments we tested whether at the end of the experiment there was any effect of the level of dilution 0 100 10 90 50 50 90 10 and 100 0 proportions environment wwtp effluent including potential differences between sites in adonis with dilution and site of origin as explanatory variables in order to identify which args or otus could be considered typical of each type of water or site of origin we used a statistical approach similar to what ecologists use to identify indicator species in communities dufrêne and legendre 1997 thus we applied the indval function of the r package labdsv v1 8 0 roberts 2016 for bacterial abundances abundance of living cells proportion of living cells and abundance of aggregates we implemented linear models with level of dilution site of origin experimental sampling time and the interaction between these terms as explanatory variables and calculated the adjusted r squared for each model a similar approach was implemented for the assessment of reproducibility for the four molecular markers 16s rrna gene teta ermb and qnrs using site of origin and level of dilution in linear models calculating the adjusted r squared for the model for each marker the rationale was that a high adjusted r squared would mean a low variability between replicates 3 results the resistome of the bacterial communities revealed that the differences in args composition measured as abundance based bray curtis differences between the end and the beginning of each experiment 15 experiments five rates of dilution from 0 to 100 wwtp effluents each from three paired sites environment wwtp fig 1 were significantly influenced by the dilution lm as anova output f1 9 11 5 p 0 008 fig 2 a meaning that a lower proportion of wwtp effluents produced resistomes that were rather different from those of the effluent and of the receiving open water before the mixing whereas a higher proportion of wwtp effluents stabilised a homogeneous resistome more similar as composition of args to the original one the differences in the resistomes between the beginning and the end of the experiments were not affected by differences between the sites of origin of the water and the wwtp effluent cannobio lake novara river verbania lake f2 9 0 9 p 0 429 nor by the interaction term between dilution and site of origin meaning that the effect of dilution on args composition was the same in all types of waters and wwtps f2 9 1 8 p 0 224 thus the resistome was more stable in its composition of args at higher proportions of water from wwtp effluents suggesting a stabilising effect of the intensity of the perturbation of wwtp effluents regardless of the differences in disinfection treatment between wwtps of the origin of the treated waters and of the type of receiving waters for details see supplementary file 1 the effluents of wwtps seem to promote the rapid stabilization of the newly established environmental resistome yet such args alteration could be alternatively explained as a by product of a stabilization in the taxonomic composition of the microbial communities if a species specific association with specific taxa that carry specific args is present we tested for such confounding factor by analysing the bacterial community composition and richness throughout the experiments differences in operational taxonomic unit otu composition between the end and the beginning of the experiments were not influenced by the analysed variables neither the level of dilution f1 9 3 6 p 0 090 fig 2b nor differences between sites of origin f2 9 1 2 p 0 345 nor the interaction between these terms f2 9 0 5 p 0 598 had any effect on taxonomic composition in addition richness in otus did not change between the beginning and the end of the experiments paired t test t 1 8 p 0 090 the same pattern was found when analysing composition and diversity at the level of order or class supplementary file 1 in the microbiome of all the analysed communities either collected in the field or measured in the experiments differences in otu richness were not influenced by differences between the sites of origin f2 12 1 0 p 0 387 and were only marginally influenced by the types of water f2 12 4 5 p 0 034 with a limited interaction between sites of origin and water types f2 12 3 5 p 0 040 suggesting that the number of taxa in bacterial communities was somehow but not extremely different between wwtp effluents and the environment supplementary fig 1 an alternative explanation for the stabilization of the antibiotic resistome could be accounted by changes in args richness during the experiments for example with only few args surviving at higher doses of wwtps effluents yet richness in args did not change between the beginning and the end of the experiments paired t test t 0 6 p 0 556 moreover in the resistomes of the communities analysed at the end of the experiment the number of args was not related to the levels of dilution f1 9 0 66 p 0 436 neither to the differences between sites of origin f2 9 0 04 p 0 961 supplementary fig 2 regarding the taxonomic classification obtained from metagenomic data metaphlan2 only 24 otus were exclusive of the microbiome of the receiving water bodies while 150 were exclusive of wwtp effluents and 94 were shared between the two types of water four otus aeromonas arcobacter deinococcus and brevibacterium resulted to be statistically defining indval the wwtp effluents and three pseudomonas limnohabitans and sphingobium the experiments supplementary table 1 the geographical distribution of the otus supplementary fig 3 evidenced the peculiarity of the site of novara with about 50 of the overall detected otus uniquely present here the remaining 50 was shared among the three sites with a limited amount of otus present only in verbania 19 and even fewer otus solely detected in cannobio 4 the resistome was marginally different between the three main types of water we analysed environment wwtp or experiment adonis r2 0 16 p 0 0126 and more strongly different between the site of origin r2 0 17 p 0 0038 with novara being the site that was different from the other two the interaction between the two terms was not significant p 0 0715 at the end of the dilution experiments the drivers of the differences in args composition between treatments were the site of origin adonis r2 0 26 p 0 0006 and the percentage of dilution r2 0 20 p 0 0001 within this study we recognized 350 different args of which 38 resulted to be exclusive of the receiving water bodies and 94 of the wwtp effluents the shared resistome genes present in both environment and effluents were 84 accounting for about 40 of the overall args no additional args were detected in the experimental settings in comparison to the original waters from the environment and the wwtp effluents confirming the reliability of the approach and the fact that no undetected args in the original waters became detectable in the dilution experiments the most diverse genes were those conferring resistance against beta lactams with 115 different args types 53 9 exclusively present in the wwtp effluents among them the well represented groups of oxa and tem genes resulted to be particularly interesting being the former typical of wwtp effluents 27 gene variants out of 38 and the latter more environmental 28 gene variants out of 30 are either exclusively environmental or shared table 1 other families of args e g tet and sul genes resulted to be mostly shared between the different waters the geographical distribution of the detected args supplementary fig 3 revealed a large part of the resistome almost half of the detected genes shared between all the three locations while only a third of them was specific for a single site six args resulted to be statistically defining indval the environmental water bodies cat against chloramphenicol bla tem 75 and a generic metallo beta lactamase tlcc and vata macrolide lincosamide streptogramin group and aph3 iib against aminoglycosides while three args resulted to be typical of wwtp effluents bla oxa 1 and bla fox 4 against beta lactams and aac2 i against aminoglycosides supplementary table 2 considering the most relevant args families supplementary fig 4 and analysing whether they were more abundant in the environment or in the wwtp effluents the number of genes resulted to be significantly lower in the environment for aminoglycoside tukeyhsd test p 0 0034 and beta lactams p 0 0069 whereas no significant differences were detected for the other args groups the dynamics of single args from the beginning to the end of the experiments supplementary fig 5 revealed a reduction in abundances in the treatments with only environmental waters and 10 wwtp effluent for the most common genes while no clear trends could be detected for the least abundant args or for the other dilution treatments at the same time contradictory scenarios characterized the different isotypes of the same genes e g bla tem bla oxa with no clear selection in favour of a specific form or of their origin bacterial abundances fitness and phenotypic distribution fig 3 supplementary fig 6 were affected by the applied disinfection treatment and their recovery when mixed with the natural communities varied in time and numbers the end of each experimental gradient treatment was set up according to bacterial abundances and before the complete depletion of nutrients in the culture media thus at the end of the stationary bacterial growth phase the wwtp effluents were characterized by microbial abundances from less than 1 106 cells ml 1 in cannobio and verbania to almost 4 106 cells ml 1 in novara while abundances in the receiving water bodies were all less than 1 106 cells ml 1 and they resulted especially low in the river agogna where they were less than 0 2 106 cells ml 1 the mixed communities proportions adjusted to the water volumes were composed of approximately equal proportion of cells from the two original sources in cannobio and verbania while the treatments with 10 50 and 90 wwtp effluent in novara were composed predominantly of cells originating from the wwtp the number of bacteria in 0 and 10 wwtp effluent remained stable during the whole experiment in verbania whilst it rose rapidly in cannobio and novara for the first part of the experiment before decreasing in response to the reduction in nutrients fig 3 for all these treatments the proportion of intact cells remained very high generally above 90 for the whole experiment whereas the number of large aggregates was constant during the experiment supplementary fig 6 the bacterial abundance in 90 and 100 wwtp effluent dropped almost to 0 in verbania potentially due to the remaining effect of chlorination but it then rose again to about 7 106 cells ml 1 at the end of the experiment with a proportion of intact cells that rose as well from less than 10 90 wwtp effluent in novara 90 and 100 wwtp effluent the number of cells remained stable for 48 h and then rapidly dropped and the proportion of intact cells followed a comparable trend in cannobio 90 and 100 wwtp effluent treatments the number of bacterial cells as well as the proportion of intact cells remained stable during the whole experiment for cell number and measurements of viability number of living cells proportion of living cells and number of aggregates the amount of variance due to variability between replicates was negligible in comparison to the differences between treatments the adjusted r2 values for statistical models including site of origin dilution treatment day of the experiment and their interaction went from 0 98 to 0 99 this means that less than 2 of the variability in the models was due to differences between replicates by comparing data on bacterial abundances fitness and size distribution we demonstrated a high degree of similarity between replicates for each level of each factor fig 3 supplementary fig 6 we then selected the replicate with intermediate values of bacterial abundance for metagenomic analyses in addition as a further control on the reproducibility of the genetic distribution between each of the three replicates for each analysed level four markers were tested by quantitative pcr qpcr the 16s rrna gene and three args teta ermb and qnrs characterized by different distributional patterns between samples different molecular weight base composition and length for all of the markers the amount of variance due to variability between replicates was negligible in comparison to the differences between treatments the adjusted r2 values for statistical models including site of origin dilution treatment and their interaction went from 0 89 for teta to 0 91 for ermb 0 95 for qnrs and 0 96 for 16s rrna gene this means that less than 11 of the variability in the worst model and only 4 in the best model were due to differences between replicates supporting the reliable use of only one replicate for the metagenomic analyses we performed 4 discussion natural environments are generally considered as essentially stable resistant and resilient ecosystems the resident bacterial communities are composed by taxa that occupy ecological niches almost redundantly incrementing the intrinsic resistance to disturbances through the complexity of the ecological interactions between organisms and the redundancy of nodes and connections allison and martiny 2008 fenchel and finlay 2004 the intensity of a disturbance is a driving factor in determining the effect of the disturbance itself on the ecosystem mackey and currie 2001 and thus the possibility for the ecosystem to preserve its former state or to recover it miller et al 2011 in our study by experimentally varying the intensity of the anthropogenic disturbance caused by the introduction of wwtp effluents in waters of the receiving environments we could modulate the responses by the local resident communities opening a number of questions that need to be addressed for a correct understanding of the impact of wwtp effluents on the environment the most relevant consequence suggested by our experimental output is that an increase in the proportion of wwtp effluents into the receiving environment might promote the stabilization of the resistome namely the group of all the args detected in a given system mostly deriving from the wwtp effluents in the newly formed microbial communities yet no evidence was found of taxa that could drive the process at the same time no statistically significant temporal trend could be detected for the overall bacterial taxonomic composition which varied without clear patterns often independently of the wwtp effluents dilution the concomitant contrasting trends of the microbiomes not showing any clear trajectory and the resistomes revealing a common homogenising pattern regardless of differences between treatments and receiving water suggest that the stabilization of the args as a functional trait in disturbed communities can occur even if the bacterial composition is not stable our experiment suggests that such a phenomenon may be happening in a variety of receiving environments since we used waters with very different properties a highly impacted river river agogna italy where the local resident bacterial community is simplified and generally pretty unstable crump and hobbie 2005 and a large subalpine lake lake maggiore italy where the microbial community is complex and stable callieri et al 2009 2014 the fact that the microbial communities developed stochastically in each experiment without producing a similar community at the end of the experiment neither in taxonomic composition nor in bacterial fitness or abundances seems to exclude adaptation to lab conditions as a confounding factor in the interpretation of the results furthermore the stabilization of the resistomes in terms of arg composition independently of their respective microbiome with increasing proportion of wwtp effluent might be valid for different types of wwtp effluents in this study we used effluents of urban wastewater treatment plants with novara and cannobio and without verbania a proportion of industrial wastewater the applied disinfection treatment varied among the studied wwtps uv radiation in novara chlorination in verbania peracetic acid disinfection in cannobio and caused long term effects on the experimental communities e g the presence for a few hours of toxic by products of chlorination or of peracetic acid the presence of intact but dead or inactive cells after uv disinfection etc di cesare et al 2016c such differences could have been the cause of the contrasting trends detected in bacterial composition abundances and fitness zhang et al 2015 sharma et al 2016 yet independently of such differences in treated waters and disinfection technologies the stabilization lower dissimilarity in the composition of args with increasing proportion of wwtp effluent was a common pattern and may represent a deterministic process in the system the same functional traits expressed as the same args were selected by the disturbance regardless of which bacterial taxa may survive the disturbance the antibiotic resistome of sewage waters of 17 large cities in china evidenced a large pool of args commonly and steadily shared within the different microbial communities su et al 2017 the same study suggested dilution of the sewage as a potential factor determining the composition of the resistome as well as seasonality although the impact of seasonality on the spread and the persistence in environment of args has been deeply investigated proving the influence of winter antibiotic consumption natural microbial successions and temperature caucci et al 2016 martínez 2008 novo et al 2013 the impacts of the dilution of wwtp effluents on the environmental microbiome and resistome was unknown most studies on the effect of wwtp effluents dilution on determinants of antibiotic resistance in natural waters focused on the potential impact of antibiotics at low concentrations davies et al 2006 kümmerer 2009 without analysing the ecological fate of resistance genes within the newly formed communities our study is the first one to support the suggestion of a major role of the dilution rate in stabilising the arg composition another recent study munck et al 2015 demonstrated a long term 7 years stability of the microbiome and of the resistome of microbial communities within urban wwtps in denmark the study evidenced the specificity of the resistome of microbial communities in wwtps confirming earlier evidence yang et al 2013 and suggested a correlation between a stable microbial community and a stable resistome in our study the general stabilization of the resistome functional stability with high inputs of wwtp effluents occurred independently of the stabilization of the overall microbiome compositional stability implying the resistome generally carried on mobile or mobilisable parts of the bacterial genomes as an early assessed feature of the newly establishing community after the disturbance allison and martiny 2008 rodriguez mozaz et al 2015 the reasons underlying this fact are debatable as a number of coinciding disturbing factors are acting on the natural communities once the wwtp effluent and its microbial load are introduced into the environment for sure increasing the proportion of effluent promotes a general increment in nutrients in most environments and thus the selection towards fast growing bacteria typical of eutrophic systems and possibly of allochthonous origin in case of non eutrophic receiving water bodies lekunberri et al 2018 at the same time in both the wwtp effluents and in human impacted receiving waters the presence of heavy metals pharmaceuticals and other pollutants could favour phenomena of co selection of resistances eckert et al 2018 all these conditions could promote the persistence of args and their spread into the newly formed communities but none of them alone could justify the stabilization of the original resistomes besides the overall microbiome and the resistome did not change likewise implying that the stabilization of the resistome may happen with high proportions of effluent independently of the development of the overall bacterial taxonomic composition additional conditions could favour the stabilization of the composition in args ecological factors controlling the bacterial abundances e g viral lysis and selective predation by nano flagellates and larger planktonic organisms thingstad 2000 also promote a large release of dna fragments into waters which may include args at the same time wwtp effluents also release together with the treated wastewater and the resident microbial community a large amount of free dna including that of antibiotic resistant bacteria and pathogens killed by disinfection zhang et al 2018 in the not uncommon case of wwtp effluents discharge in water bodies with natural bacterial communities encompassing competent bacteria such dna could enter through horizontal or vertical transfer within the newly formed microbial communities thus promoting the stabilization of the microbiome of the wwtp in surface waters furthermore cell free dna usually abundant in wwtp effluents after a tertiary treatment zhang et al 2018 could potentially bind to organic matter or clay particles in the water and remain stable in the system here the suggested stabilization of the composition in args at higher proportions of wwtp effluent calls for a much more careful use and reuse of wastewaters implementing new quality parameters including dilution and molecular markers of resistance either resistance genes or specific dna fragments as proxies of resistance independently of the underlying ecological mechanisms environments like lakes or seas might in general be less affected by the phenomenon of stabilising resistomes thanks to the massive dilution of the wwtp effluents discharged there even if heavily impacted lakes and waters can still show important gradients of decreasing contamination from the pollution sources ma et al 2017 the situation is different for water bodies like rivers or irrigational channels which can receive important loads of wwtp effluents accounting for up to 90 of their running water in some periods of the year the natural conditions of the river agogna in january 2016 were for example of very limited discharge 0 4 1 4 m3 s 1 data provided by the regional agency for environmental protection arpa piemonte while the effluent of the wwtp of novara was stable around 0 45 m3 s 1 thus providing a significant proportion of the river water 25 55 after discharging in it our experimental study demonstrated the direct impact of the dilution rate of wwtp effluents on the immediate stabilization of the resistome in open waters independently of its relative microbiome the consequences in the environment can be even enhanced when compared to our study in our short term experiment we tested the development of the newly formed mixed communities for a period of a few days after an initial inoculum whereas in nature the disturbance provided by a wwtp effluent is constant and can be defined as a continuous press disturbance this may reduce the resilience of the disturbed community requiring complex pathways towards the re establishment of a stable community glasby and underwood 1996 opening niche opportunities shea and chesson 2002 to allochthonous bacteria and genes and thus to the establishment of resistances of allochthonous origin lekunberri et al 2018 this is particularly true for communities that are not stable through time e g those of small rivers and or not able to counteract the effect of point disturbances by long term resilience as demonstrated for agricultural soils frenk et al 2014 5 conclusions our experimental study demonstrates the potential threat posed by the release of uncontrolled dilution of wwtp effluents into open waters our results suggest the implementation of controls and limitations in the proportion of treated wwtp effluents released in surface waters in order to keep high dilution rates at least until new treatments efficiently removing determinants of resistance will be applied to wastewater the need to obtain wastewater with a limited load of resistance genes is important because with the expected increase of treated wastewater reuse in agriculture in the next decade cisneros
