13905,water quality of river tel and bank filtrate at belgaon india were studied for a period of 12 months to assess the effectiveness of river bank filtration rbf escherichia coli e coli were found to be successfully removed from surface water during river bank filtration as limited work has been done regarding the use of two models i e soil conservation service curve number scs cn approach and filtration coefficient fc approach for water quality modelling and monitoring these models have been utilized to correlate the influent source water and effluent filtrate water concentration at belgaon the model indicates that filtration coefficient is linearly related to the natural logarithm of the influent concentration cn is also found well correlated with the influent concentration variations both scs cn approach and filtration coefficient approach was also found well correlated with variations in the river water quality at other established rbf sites i e river upper krishna southern india and river yamuna palla nizamuddin delhi from the study it can be concluded that it is possible to simulate the observed filtrate effluent for e coli quality using both scs cn and filtration coefficient approach keywords scs cn river bank filtration filtration coefficient e coli simulate 1 introduction escherichia coli e coli is a microorganism that is usually found in the intestinal tract of warm blooded animals as e coli is usually released to the environment through deposition of fecal material it can be used as indicator of fecal contamination of water bodies 1 during the year 1989 e coli became a reportable disease in ontario the major cause of hemolytic uremic syndrome in children was found to be due to the presence of e coli 2 diseases like gastrointestinal illness including non bloody or bloody diarrhea and hemorrhagic colitis are usually caused by e coli 3 river water is usually consumed for various purposes like drinking and agriculture etc the impact of river water contamination depends mainly on water uses as well as the concentration of pathogens in water 4 drawing of water from the river lake etc through the hydraulically connected aquifer is termed as riverbank filtration rbf rbf is a cost effective filtration technology for water purification riverbank filtration helps in attenuation of pollutants like suspended solids turbidity microbial contaminants pesticides organic carbon organic and inorganic chemicals nitrate and other pollutants 5 7 13 14 16 movement of bacteria in soil includes both vadose and saturated zone flow movement of bacteria in unsaturated condition for soil is more complex 17 and retains greater potential to attenuate bacteria 18 21 the critical removal mechanism is straining or physical filtration by the solid matrix 22 the proper location of an infiltration gallery reduces the concentration of microbial pathogens in huge magnitude shende and chau 6 this removal is caused by mechanisms like dispersion and decay which occurs during the passage of infiltrated water in the riverbank soil media 23 24 various models under transport conditions for pathogen and other contaminants removal were established considering dispersion and decay for assessment of water quality 25 34 parameters like flow condition and soil depth had substantial impacts on the bacterial filtration coefficient and noticeable bacterial removal was found due to clogging of the continuous pores of the soil subsurface layer by bacterial cells 35 mcgechan and lewis 36 studied on colloid and microorganism trapping in soil and found that it is dependent on the relative sizes of the colloids as well as on the water filled soil pores ojha and thakur 37 have developed a model to relate influent source water and effluent filtrate concentration during riverbank filtration where the filtration coefficient was found to be linearly related to the natural logarithm of the influent concentration and other water quality parameters thakur et al 38 found that the methodology like the filtration coefficient approach had the potential of simulating variation in turbidity and pathogens in river water and bank filtrate for the model development performance of schmutzdecke layer developed on filter bed has been assumed to be insignificant development of this layer accelerates the pollutant removal capability of the aquifer however e coli removal in the schmutzdecke layer was not permanent 39 hence this model can be suitable for prediction of removal of e coli during rbf the soil conservation service curve number scs cn rainfall runoff technique is an established method which is usually used for computation of runoff from total event rainfall it is a simple method in which only basic descriptive inputs are usually used after conversion into a numeric value which is required for estimation of watershed direct runoff volume 40 a parameter named curve

professionals like hydrologists engineers and watershed managers it is also employed in the computation of runoff estimating component in many complex watershed models such as agricultural non point source 41 hence a conclusion can be made that the scs cn method is a vital and application oriented tool which is available to the scientific community scs cn method is among those user friendly acceptance models which can tackle real world problems it is a simple predictable and stable conceptual method its calculations are straightforward and intuitively logical 53 mostly scs cn approach is used to determine parameters like runoff rainfall intensity and infiltration limited work is done regarding the usage of scs cn approach in sediment and water quality monitoring base flow and discharge and urban hydrology present study highlights the importance of the use of scs cn approach in water quality modelling and monitoring in light of the above considerations the objectives of this study have been decided as follows i to assess the effectiveness of rbf in e coli removal during river bank filtration at odisha india ii to check the suitability of scs cn approach and filtration coefficient fc approach for simulating e coli removal during river bank filtration at odisha india iii to test both the models for three rbf sites i e at village 3 near upper krishna river

to p or p ia as the water enters the bed and there is no abstraction of water so ia has been assumed as zero output loading from the system has been considered as vf ce which is analogous to q in eq 4 by using eqs 1b 4 and 5 following equation has been derived 6a c n 1000 r 10 r 1 r i n p u t this equation can be expressed as 6b c n 1000 c e c o 10 c e c o 1 c e c o v f c o 3 river bank filtration sites 3 1 river bank filtration site in odisha study was carried out at river tel perennial river at belgaon town site 1 which is in balangir district in the state of odisha india fig 1 it is one of the nearest rbf site to the place of study water from the production well pw1 located on river bank was supplied to the belgaon town the town is located at 20 19 08 8 n 83 18 57 5 e and at an elevation of 161 m from mean sea level production well was constructed on the bank of the river within 2 m from river and is of 20 m deep and 2 m diameter the water from production well which is getting water through rbf is pumped and supplied to belgaon town water quality monitoring was done in fifteen phases for 12 months water samples were collected five times each in the monsoon period july september post monsoon period october january and summer period february june for the year 2018 19 water samples were collected from river tel rw1 surface water production well pw1 riverbank filtered water and one deep bore well which is at a distance of more than 1 km from the tel river gw1 groundwater at belgaon the sampling locations are given in fig 1 soil samples were collected at every four meters from the aquifer at river tel up to the depths of 22 m methods stated in the standard methods by american public health association 46 were used for collection of the water samples preservation with suitable reagents and analysis for water quality parameters methods stated in the indian standard 47 were used for analysis of soil sample to find grain size distribution using dry sieving and also to determine porosity of the soil the aquifer at the study site mainly consists of stream deposits which includes fine sand and silt to medium sand and gravel this layer is extended upto a depth of 21 m below the ground the aquifer at the study site can be considered as a single layer system there is a good and direct hydraulic contact between the aquifer and the river during low flow in the river during summer water level in the production well gets reduced and during high flow in the river during monsoon the water level in the production well gets raised establishing hydraulically connectivity between the river and production well through the aquifer although the e coli present in river water varied notably during the monitoring period 16 000 110 000 mpn 100 ml the e coli present in the production well water was between 300 360 mpn 100 ml reduction in e coli in riverbank filtered water were noticeable fig 2 the water from production wells showed 1 6 2 6 log reduction of e coli processes like mechanical filtration advection dispersion and ground water dilution affects the fate and transport of certain water quality parameters such as suspended particles turbidity and bacteria during the passage of water through the aquifer out of above processes mechanical filtration contributes the most in the reduction of bacteria from the river water when it infiltrates through the aquifer to the production well 48 49 hydraulic conductivity which was found from the data from grain size analysis was calculated as 4 05 10 4 m s the travel time and velocity of flow between the river and the production well are significant parameters for removal of turbidity and bacteria 8 for this field study velocity of flow was calculated by using darcy s law with the help of observed water level in the production well as well as of the river the average travel time and velocity of flow was computed as 48 2 h and 1 16 0 05 10 4 m s respectively which were used in

site 3 and nizamuddin site 4 delhi india they found that at palla site the share of bank filtrate was between 30 60 and no faecal contamination was found in that well similarly at nizamuddin site under the given field conditions 3 log10 removal of somatic bacteriophages was seen after 1 m of travel distance important observed value of e coli for river and rbf well water at palla and nizamuddin has been redrawn and given at figs 4 and 5 respectively from the literature studies it can be noted that e coli is attenuated from surface water during river bank filtration the travel time considered in the study is 30 1 days and 50 1 days for palla site 3 and nizamuddin site 4 respectively from the aquifer parameters 54 the average velocity of flow was calculated as 0 135 0 005 10 4 m s for both the sites which was used in the models along with the concerned travel times 4 application of models to different rbf sites 4 1 application of filtration coefficient approach using the observed data i e influent concentration c0 and effluent concentration ce at four rbf sites filtration coefficients corresponding to each observed data have been computed using eq 3 computed filtration coefficients with respect to influent concentrations ln c0 are plotted and are shown in fig 6 a d for site 1 2 3 4 respectively the relationship between the filtration coefficient and ln c0 at four rbf sites are given below 7 site 1 λ 0 0488 ln c 0 0 2758 r 2 0 988 8 site 2 λ 0 0236 ln c 0 0 013 r 2 0 888 9 site 3 λ 0 0189 ln c 0 0 0133 r 2 0 601 10 site 4 λ 0 0168 ln c 0 0 0168 r 2 0 637 where r2 is the coefficient of determination at the point when coefficient of determination is unity it speaks to an ideal fit among observed and computed values at all sites linear relationship was seen between filtration coefficient and ln co 4 2 application of scs cn approach using the observed data i e influent concentration c0 and effluent concentration ce at four rbf sites curve number cn corresponding

well at the rbf sites prescribing an accurate value of cn is perhaps the most important part in scs cn methodology for accurate estimation of output value the smaller the values of cn the larger are the effects of the variation of input value on output value 50 for all the four rbf sites cn is found well correlated with the source water quality variations the polynomial relationship between cn and c0 can be seen in all the four graphs for all the four sites r value was found to be in the range of 0 89 0 99 where r2 is the coefficient of determination 4 3 comparison between simulated and observed value the observed values the computed value using fc approach and scs cn approach have been compared which are shown in fig 8 a d for site 1 2 3 4 respectively from the figures it can be seen that except few observed value most of the simulated values are in agreement with the observed values in addition to it it can be observed that simulated values computed by scs cn approach is found to be slightly more than the values computed by fc approach for all the four rbf sites the most difficult part of field engineers at the rbf water supply schemes is to predict the abstracted water quality due to fluctuation in river water quality so in those conditions the utilisation of fc approach or scs cn approach will help in future predictions of abstracted water quality for known aquifer condition such as flow velocity and travel time water should be free from any fecal contamination to be fit for drinking purpose as per indian standard 51 as well as who drinking water guideline in addition to it in india water to be chlorinated should not have mpn 50 100 ml 52 so the filtrate quality which will be computed using fc approach as well as scs cn approach in the field for different river water quality and aquifer condition can be utilized to decide future treatment option additional treatment requirement to meet the drinking water quality criteria standard the outcome of the study exhibited that both the approaches i e scs cn approach and filtration coefficient approach has enormous undiscovered potential that should be investigated through future examinations successful validation of the present work suggested that the approaches like scs cn and filtration coefficient can be used for exploring suitable sites that support rbf 5 conclusions in the present study an attempt is made to look into the potential of scs cn approach and filtration coefficient approach in rbf modelling on the basis of this study the following conclusions can be made a significant reduction in the e coli has been observed in rbf water with respect to the river water at river tel belgaon rbf study site at belgaon rbf site variation of filtration coefficient with natural log of river water quality was found cn is found well correlated with the influent concentration variations both scs cn approach and filtration coefficient approach was found well correlated with variations in the river water quality at other rbf sites i e river upper krishna southern india and river yamuna palla nizamuddin delhi cn and filtration coefficient are both related to the efficiency output to input ratio of water quality parameter it is possible to simulate the observed filtrate effluent for e coli quality using both scs cn and filtration coefficient approach filtration is the governing mechanism for the removal of e coli as both the models are filtration kinetic models these can be suitably used for prediction of e coli removal at the rbf sites as filtration kinetics model of iwasaki 44 depends on parameters like t travel time vf flow velocity and dl thickness of layer the rbf sites possessing high travel time greater thickness of aquifer and low flow velocity will result in better removal of e coli as well as precise prediction of effluent e coli both the models can be also used for future predictions of abstracted water quality for known

natural log of river water quality was found cn is found well correlated with the influent concentration variations both scs cn approach and filtration coefficient approach was found well correlated with variations in the river water quality at other rbf sites i e river upper krishna southern india and river yamuna palla nizamuddin delhi cn and filtration coefficient are both related to the efficiency output to input ratio of water quality parameter it is possible to simulate the observed filtrate effluent for e coli quality using both scs cn and filtration coefficient approach filtration is the governing mechanism for the removal of e coli as both the models are filtration kinetic models these can be suitably used for prediction of e coli removal at the rbf sites as filtration kinetics model of iwasaki 44 depends on parameters like t travel time vf flow velocity and dl thickness of layer the rbf sites possessing high travel time greater thickness of aquifer and low flow velocity will result in better removal of e coli as well as precise prediction of effluent e coli both the models can be also used for future predictions of abstracted water quality for known aquifer condition such as flow velocity and travel time in other rbf sites located at various parts of world by performing extensive field studies declaration of competing interest the authors declare

13906,the generation of liquid effluents with high organic and inorganic load in the petroleum industry requires proper treatment in order to prevent environmental pollution commonly refractory organic compounds which are not easily degraded by conventional methods require an advanced treatment step in addition the inorganic content may negatively interfere with the treatment process due to scaling formation derived from the precipitation of low solubility compounds primarily strontium and calcium based salts the present study aims at the removal of fouling metals such as calcium and strontium and refractory organic matter from the oil industry effluent by electrocoagulation associated with adsorption using coconut husk carbon considering the context of zero liquid discharge simultaneous electrocoagulation associated with adsorption presented an economy of the treatment time and capital cost in relation to the process carried out by individual steps of adsorption followed by electrocoagulation because the efficiencies were similar the treatment resulted in a residual of 25 mg o2 l 1 52 removal of organic matter measured as cod 88 of calcium removal residual of 6 0 mg l 1 and 72 of strontium removal residual of 0 4 mg l 1 which improved the quality of the recovered water in addition it is noted that the adsorption process removed the organic compounds preferably while the metals were removed by electrocoagulation keywords simultaneous adsorption and electrocoagulation oil refinery wastewater calcium strontium organic compounds coconut husk carbon 1 introduction the wide use and consumption of petroleum products and their derivatives makes petroleum industry one of the main sources of environmental pollution several contaminants present in its these effluents can be released due to processing transportation distribution and storage of oil 1 3 the treatment of wastewater from oil refineries is well established however if zero liquid discharge zld is desired the development and establishment of additional treatment and water reuse technologies are necessary 4 several kinds of treatments have been proposed in this context including advanced oxidation process aop 5 flotation 6 coagulation 7 ultrafiltration 8 electrochemical process 9 and adsorption 10 among these processes electrodialysis has been used to recover water to the industrial systems however the presence of scaling forming metals such as calcium and strontium causes the need of frequent cleaning of the membranes 11 the subsequent process the evaporative crystallization step is also negatively affected by the presence of these elements as well as by organic compounds that accumulates in the crystallizer 12 organic contaminants such as long chain hydrocarbons and aromatic compounds such as benzene and phenolic ones amines and amides have been identified in an industrial concentrate from electrodialysis unit 12 14 these contaminants cannot be significantly reduced in conventional wastewater treatment methods because most of these compounds are persistent organic pollutants pops it means they present high stability to sunlight resistance to microbial attack and temperature thus advanced techniques are required to this purpose 15 17 according to nigri et al 18 the inorganic content in the concentrate under investigation may adversely interfere with the treatment process due to the formation of incrustation derived from the precipitation of low solubility compounds basically strontium and calcium based salts precipitation ion exchange membrane separation and adsorption have been used to treat wastewater containing toxic metal ions 19 22 which can also be used to reduce the potential of scaling fig 1 shows the water treatment process used in the oil refinery where the study was carried out electrocoagulation ec is a water treatment technology that has experienced great popularity and technical improvements the advantages of ec include high removal efﬁciency a compact treatment facility relatively low cost the possibility of complete automation treatment of potable water and used water integration of oxidation coagulation precipitation conducting to minimal capital costs decreased requirement for chemicals substituted with metal electrodes reduced hazard of ancillary contamination minimal sludge formation without moving parts reduced power needs and feasibility of solar energy use 23 27 one of the disadvantages of ec is the generation of sludge containing a wide range of components such as organic and inorganic matter bacteria and viruses oil and grease nutrients like nitrogen and phosphorus toxic and trace metals 28 29 however some works involving sludge management have been done to goal the residues application in building and agriculture industries 29 30 the main chemical reactions in the electrocoagulation process with aluminum electrodes are represented by eqs 1 3 31 33 1 a l

current while the simultaneous evolution of hydrogen gas on the cathode may allow the pollutants removal by flotation the aluminum hydroxide flocs also can act as adsorbents for ionic species 34 according to brahmi et al 35 and thirugnanasambandham et al 36 in the ec process the destabilization mechanism of the contaminants particles suspension and breaking of emulsions can be summarized as three successive steps 1 compression of the diffuse double layer around the charged species by the interactions of ions generated by oxidation of the sacriﬁcial anode 2 charge neutralization of the ionic species present in wastewater by counter ions produced by the electrochemical dissolution of the sacriﬁcial anode and 3 flocs formation that creates a sludge blanket that entraps and bridges colloidal particles that are remaining in the aqueous medium due to reaction 3 ph usually increases several studies have shown a removal of contaminants through electrocoagulation such as organic compounds phenols textile dyes heavy metals fluorides 33 37 41 however electrocoagulation has been used for high cod and in the case of low cod its performance has not been proved on the other hand for low contaminants concentration adsorption has higher potential with several studies in the literature 42 50 adsorption is a process of easy implementation usually cheap if compared to other methods the simple operating system if associated to a low cost adsorbent can make adsorption implementation attractive for many systems 42 46 among all of the adsorbents carbon is a unique and very versatile element which is capable of forming different architectures at the nanoscale 47 48 in addition carbon has been widely used in the treatment of various industrial effluents due to their high specific surface area and well developed porous structure 18 45 49 50 the activated carbon has a strong affinity for organic molecules and contains oxygenated functional groups on the entire surface which are capable of organic contaminants attraction 51 normally activated carbons are synthesized from carbonaceous materials and as an environmentally friendly alternative coal can be prepared from biomass residues or industrial wastes 46 52 54 studies of electrocoagulation in association with adsorption are still few table 1 summarizes the most outstanding published research in this field considering the presence of organic compounds and low solubility salts in the feed of the electrodialysis and their concentration in the electrodialysis concentrate as described by becheleni et al 12 this paper aims at reducing its scaling potential by reducing the contents of calcium and strontium and also organic matter by electrocoagulation simultaneous to adsorption by activated carbon in a real effluent from the oil industry this can improve the subsequent process of electrodialysis and subsequent crystallization decreasing operation times and contributing to form a less impure solid product the main novelty of this work is related to the evaluation of simultaneous removal of scaling elements like ca and sr and residual cod by associated ec ad system considering the context of zero liquid discharge in oil refineries 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials 2 1 1 activated carbon coconut husk carbon code cns 1240 produced by ac carbone canada inc saint jean sur richelieu qc the adsorbent was pulverized in a grinder grinder machine pulverizing ore model hsm 100 and sieved in a 38 μm sieve before its use 2 1 2 effluent the effluent in this study comes from an industrial wastewater treatment plant of an oil refinery located in betim mg brazil the effluent was collected in 20 l containers after the conventional treatment fig 1 2 2 adsorption experiments adsorption experiments were carried out with erlenmeyers 250 ml stirred in the shaker at 120 rpm with a carbon effluent ratio in the range of 0 60 g l 1 the isotherm curve was built after determination of the equilibrium time in experiments ranging from 0 to 24 h the adsorption capacity per mass of activated carbon was determined by eq 1 1 q v c 0 c m where q is the activated carbon adsorption capacity mg

this work the originpro8 software was used to obtain the parameters of the fit of models used in this study besides that to measure the adsorption curves adjustment the nonlinear chi square test x2

electrocoagulation experiments the electrocoagulation reactor fig 2 consisted of a square base prism cell in acrylic with a height of 15 5 cm and a base edge of 12 0 cm aluminum electrodes plates with 1 5 mm thickness base of 10 cm and submerged height of 10 cm were connected to a digital dc power supply fa 3005 instrutherm 0 30 v 0 5 a in the electrocoagulation experiments the parameters current density set up of electrodes configuration bipolar or monopolar arrangement number of electrodes and distance between the electrodes were evaluated the batch experiments were carried out with effluent volume of 1 5 l at room temperature with sampling at times of 5 10 20 30 40 60 and 120 min approximately 20 ml of sample were collected and filtered in a 0 45 μm syringe filter for further analysis mixing was obtained by magnetic stirrer lucadema model 01 09 with speed 3 the aluminum plates were previously dipped into 0 1 mol l 1 of hcl washed and dried at 60 c before each test the mass of the electrodes was measured before and after each test that were performed in duplicate the current density was determined by eq 3 3 δ i a where δ is the current density ma cm 2 i is the current ma and a is the submerged area of the electrode anode cm2 the energy consumption was calculated by eq 4 4 c u i t v where c is the energy consumed wh u is the electric tension v i is the current a t is time h and v is the treated effluent volume l the amount of metal consumed in the plates depends on the amount of electricity passing through the electrocoagulation cell and the dwell time of treatment it can be calculated by the faraday s law represented on eq 5 68 70 5 m i t w n f where m is the mass of the electrode consumed g i is the current density ma cm 1 t is time s w is the molar mass of the electrode material g mol 1 n is the number of electrons in the redox reaction and f is the faraday constant 96 485c differently from adsorption tests in which it is possible to fix the amount of adsorbent this is not possible in the electrocoagulation batch tests therefore in order to evaluate the kinetic models of reaction first order and second order equations were used table 4 2 4 associated adsorption electrocoagulation experiments after the determination of the optimal parameters in the adsorption and electrocoagulation process separately adsorption tests were carried out prior to electrocoagulation ones the effluent treated by the adsorption process was filtered and subsequently treated by the electrocoagulation another experiment was carried out simultaneously with the addition of activated carbon into the electrocoagulation cell in all experiments the removals of chemical oxygen demand cod calcium and strontium were determined the experiments were performed in duplicate 2 5 solids and solution characterization the content of dissolved organic compounds was quantified indirectly by chemical oxygen demand cod closed reflux colorimetric method for low cod range 71 an analytical standard curve was built with potassium biphthalate 10 20 30 40 50 60 and 70 mg l 1 previously filtered using 0 45 μm membrane millipore millex gv hydrophilic pvdf and the absorbance was measured in a hach dr 2800 spectrophotometer at a wavelength of 420 nm table 5 presents the analytical methods used for effluent characterization 71 samples of fresh activated carbon the loaded activated carbon the residue of the electrocoagulation process and the residue from the simultaneous adsorption and electrocoagulation process were dried at 60 c for 24 h and stored for further analysis solids characterization was performed through x ray fluorescence xrf panalytical pw2400 fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir bruker alpha model attenuated total reflection atr and diffuse reflectance drift a thorough morphological study by sem eds scanning electron microscope model 6360 l v dispersive spectrometer coupled to an in eds wavelength was also carried out the specific surface area and porosity were obtained from quantachrome device model nova 1000 nitrogen gas adsorption condensation both for fresh and loaded adsorption coconut husk carbon 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization table 6 presents the parameters of the effluent used in the study the cod of approximately 54 mg o2 l 1 is due to the presence of refractory organic compounds as pointed out by mesquita et al 13 it is observed that the effluent presents 71 mg l 1 of calcium and a low strontium concentration of 3 3 mg l 1 it is also observed a high concentration of chlorides of 539 8 mg l 1 despite of relatively good quality it has to be considered that the focus of the present work is the zld zero liquid discharge the effluent is already supersaturated for scaling salts such as caco3 and baso4 and after electrodialysis supersaturation will be reached for srso4 and srco3 in the concentrate causing scaling problems additionally according to the study of becheleni et al 12 in the next step of salt crystallization the organics substances accumulate in the crystallizer and contaminate the solid formed here the use of the recovered water cooling towers is aimed which corresponds to higher water consumption in refineries 12 the specific surface area and porosity from fresh activated carbon and activated carbon after adsorption process are shown in table 7 after the adsorption process it was possible to observe a reduction in the specific surface area from 891 5 694 7 m2 g 1 and a slightly reduction in the total pore volume from 0 46 to 0 40 cm3 g 1 which can be attributed to the adsorption of organic compounds on the surface of activated carbon the average pore diameter obtained is compatible with mesoporous structure according to iupac 20 500 å 72 sem eds analysis was performed to assess the samples morphology in the back scattered electron images a b c and d fig 3 several irregularities and porosity variations and size discrepancy between grains may be observed it is not possible to identify differences between samples of fresh activated carbon and loaded carbon the e and f images fig 3 present features of the homogeneous residue from electrocoagulation process and in the g and h images fig 3 carbon grains darker regions contained in the electrocoagulation residue are observed based on eds table 8 analysis no differences between the sample of fresh activated carbon and the loaded activated carbon were observed these being predominantly carbon containing traces of sulfur the residues from electrocoagulation exhibit the predominance of aluminum as a result of the dissolution process of the anode the presence of traces of calcium and strontium highlight the removal of these elements from the effluent the presence of sulfur chlorine and sodium is also observed derived from the treated effluent the final residue from the ec process associated with adsorption shows a slightly increase carbon amount table 8 when compared to the ec process which does not represent a critical element in the management of the generated sludge adyel et al 29 and morozesk et al 30 have already reported positive use of ec sludge applications in building and agriculture industries the ca and sr elemental analysis by x ray fluorescence analysis ca and sr for all solids are shown in fig 4 the calcium band in fig 4 a b exhibit an intensity below 0 3kcps and no signal of strontium was detected for both fresh and loaded activated carbon any variation in band intensity was detected which can suggest that coconut activated carbon was not able to remove calcium and strontium from the effluent however the spectra of solids from electrocoagulation show an increase of the ca and sr signal fig 4 c d which indicates the effectiveness of electrocoagulation in removing these elements fig 5 presents the ftir analysis of solids as expected no band for fresh activated carbon was identified the displacement of the band from 3500 cm 1 to 3280 cm 1 refers to the hoh stretch of water and the new band detected on 3080 cm 1 possibly refers to the adsorption of organic compounds 73 75 the band at 1640 cm 1 represents the hydroxyl and water oh flexion 15 76 and at 1500 cm 1 is attributed to aromatic cc functionality 15 77 it is also possible to find bands associated with aluminum connections at 1399 cm 1 the stretching in alh is observed 78 at 1066 cm 1 the stretching of alo 79 and the band at 587 cm 1 can be attributed to the stretching of aloh 78 however the band at 1066 cm 1 can also indicate the symmetrical stretch and at 1399 cm 1 the asymmetric stretch of c o 80 81 the bands 897 cm 1 and 724 cm 1 are due to the presence of co3 2 80 81 and the bands at 428 cm 1 and 468 cm 1 indicate the presence of sulfates 82 3 2 adsorption 3 2 1 kinetics fig 6 presents the experimental data and the adjusted kinetic models of pseudo first pseudo second and elovich the parameters obtained are presented at table 6 the removal of organic compounds cod by adsorption with coconut husk carbon reached equilibrium in 240 min with a reduction of approximately 50 in cod using 0 5 g l 1 of coconut husk calcium and strontium were not adsorbed the organics adsorption stabilizes after 240 min similar to the time obtained by nigri et al 18 for bone char however the kinetics adsorption on coconut husk carbon follows the elovich model while kinetics adsorption on bone char fits better to the pseudo second order kinetics model 18 the adsorption capacity in cod terms was 53 93 mg o2 g 1 corresponds to 50 of cod removal with a residual concentration of cod of 25 mg o2 l 1 this results is superior than the value obtained by mesquita et al 13 and nigri et al 18 who obtained approximately 45 of cod removal using 10 g l 1 of bone char it is worthy to note that the coconut husk carbon has a higher cod removal capacity 53 93 mg o2 g 1 than bone char cod removal capacity 2 35 mg o2 g 1 in nigri et al 18 this is probably due to the greater affinity of organic compounds to the main composition of carbon in coconut husk carbon in contrast bone char is mainly composed of hydroxyapatite ca10 po4 6 oh 2 in addition coconut husk carbon has a greater specific surface area ssabet 891 5 m2 g 1 7 5 times higher than the ssabet of the bone char ssabet 119 3 m2 g 1 83 the second order model presented a value of qe 53 93 mg o2 g 1 close to the value obtained experimentally 53 67 mg o2 g 1 and the data fit better to the elovich model with adjustment of 0 98 table 9 3 2 2 adsorption isotherms the effect of adsorbent dosage on the residual cod is shown in fig 7 there is an increase in the removal of organic compounds up to 0 5 g l 1 of activated carbon concentration this means that some organic compounds are not prompt to be adsorbed by the carbon 3 3 electrocoagulation 3 3 1 electrocoagulation parameters evaluation fig 8 shows the effect of process parameters and configuration of electrocoagulation system such as current density electrodes configuration bipolar and monopolar electrodes distance in monopolar configuration and also the variation of the number of electrodes current density voltage power and electrodes consumption ph variation and conductivity from electrocoagulation tests are show in table 10 the application of the current density of 7 5 ma cm 2 presents similar removal of calcium and strontium to those obtained with the use of 17 5 ma cm 2 while a worse result was obtained lowering the current density to 2 5 ma cm 2 fig 8a and table 10 however no change was observed in the removal of ca and sr due to modifications in electrodes configuration as bipolar or monopolar fig 8b nevertheless 30 of reduction in energy consumption was observed for the monopolar arrangement 16 4 kw h m 3 against 23 2 kw h m 3 for the bipolar configuration table 10 the increase in distance between electrodes from 0 5 to 1 0 cm was adverse to the removal of ca and sr fig 8c and it increased the energy consumption from 16 4 22 4 kw h m 3 table 10 twice the number of electrodes from 2 to 4 produced treated wastewater with half concentration for both ca and sr from 13 5 6 5 mg l 1 and 1 0 to 0 5 mg l 1 respectively fig 8d and table 10 table 10 shows that the energy and electrodes consumption rise with the increasing current density the current density of 7 5 ma cm 2 has shown specific energy consumption of 23 2 kw h m 3 there was not any removal by electrocoagulation possibly due to the low content of organics asselin et al 84 studied the electrocoagulation to the treatment of an effluent containing 2620 mg o2 l 1 cod which reached a final value of 616 mg o2 l 1 however these values are much higher than the effluent treated in the present work it is also observed that the increase of current leads a slightly increase of the final ph being 9 31 9 38 and 9 76 for current densities of 2 5 7 5 and 17 5 ma cm 2 respectively 57 85 in addition according to özyurt and camcıoğlu 86 electrocoagulation ec is an inefficient method for removing stable and dissolved organic pollutants as expected an increase in ph during the development of electrocoagulation was observed which is similar to previous works of ghosh et al 87 and babu and goel 88 the increase in ph is due to the formation of a higher concentration of hydroxyl ions in the ec bath due to water electrolysis the best electrocoagulation configuration was a monopolar with 4 electrodes distant 0 5 cm and the current density of 7 5 ma cm 2 this configuration produced an effluent with 5 8 mg l 1 of calcium and 0 4 mg l 1 of strontium with the specific energy consumption of 16 4 kw h m 3 table 10 according to hakizimana et al 89 lower amounts of energy are consumed by reducing the space between the electrodes as the distance between the electrodes becomes shorter the amount of gas bubbles generated increases leading to high mass transfer and a high reaction rate between coagulants and pollutant in his work mook et al 90 assesses the possibility of using renewable energy from alternative sources in electrochemical systems in wastewater treatment which would minimize the cost of the process the operating cost of the ec are mainly composed by energy electrode maintenance and labor 91 92 to estimate the costs involved in this work the cost of electricity of 0 0678 kwh 1 93 was considered and the cost of aluminum electrodes has been taken at 1459 93 ton 1 94 maintenance costs were not taken into account based on these values it would be 4 84 m 3 of treated effluent 3 3 2 kinetics and isotherms of electrocoagulation similarly to adsorption the removal capacities of calcium and strontium by electrocoagulation were determined initially the equilibrium time was found fig 9 in monopolar configuration current of 3 0a 4 electrodes and current density 7 5 ma cm 2 the pseudo first and second order adjustment parameters table 11 presented values of 0 99 and 0 98 respectively for removal of calcium and 0 98 and 0 97 respectively for removal of strontium previous works in the literature have found distinct best fits for kinetics of adsorption secula et al 56 observed kinetics of the pseudo first order however isa et al 95 nariyan et al 69 and murthy and parmar 92 had found kinetics of pseudo second order in addition adeogun and balakrishnan 96 indicate better data fits for elovich and pseudo second order kinetics models fig 10 shows the fitting of the langmuir freundlich redlich peterson sips and temkin models to experimental data on the removal of calcium and strontium by electrocoagulation the parameters obtained from these data fitting are shown in table 12 langmuir isotherm presents the best fit 0 9841 to the calcium removal data followed by the redlich peterson isotherm with a determination coefficient of 0 9816 for strontium removal the freundlich model presents the best correlation coefficient being of 0 8892 followed by the langmuir model with fit of 0 8621 table 12 in contrast the works from nariyan et al 69 and ghalwa et al 97 exhibited data fits for freundlich s model while data from adeogun and balakrishnan 96 were better suited to the sips model 3 4 adsorption with electrocoagulation table 13 shows the applied and obtained parameters from simultaneous and sequential processes of adsorption and electrocoagulation tests considering the equilibrium time for adsorption of 240 min in the simultaneous experiment the activated carbon was added to reactor and stirred 120 min before to the start of the electrocoagulation process therefore the complete time required for adsorption was reached since the electrocoagulation process time was complete in 120 min there were no significant differences between the parameters obtained from the sequential or the simultaneous operation in fig 11 the cod removal gives similar residual cod value of 25 33 and 25 96 mg o2 l 1 for sequential and simultaneous operation respectively however it is observed an improvement of process time to 120 min which contribute to reduce the costs it is also possible to see that the electrocoagulation process was not effective to remove the residual organic compounds which is coherent with the ec previous results similar performance was observed for the sequential and simultaneous operation with a calcium concentration of 5 98 and 7 5 mg l 1 and strontium 0 92 and 0 74 mg l 1 respectively fig 12 it is also possible to see that during the sequential operations calcium and strontium were not removed which corroborate that the removal of these metals occurs only by electrocoagulation the mechanism of calcium and strontium removal by ec is probably due to the precipitation of carbonates the increase in ph favors the growth in the co3 2 carbonate species concentration instead of hco3 2 bicarbonates causing a supersaturation condition and allowing the calcium and strontium carbonates to precipitate further be coagulated by the positive hydroxy aluminum species this mechanism is coherent with the results from ftir fig 5 which indicated the presence of carbonate groups in the solid residue from ec associated with the carbon 4 conclusions electrocoagulation associated with adsorption presented an economy of treatment time in relation to the process in stages of adsorption followed by electrocoagulation because the results were similar the ideal dosage of coconut husk carbon in the process was 0 5 g l 1 with an equilibrium time of 240 min monopolar configuration with 4 electrodes 0 5 cm of distance between electrodes and the current density of 7 5 ma cm 2 in 120 min presented the best result with specific energy consumption of 16 4 kw h m 3 the treatment resulted in a residual concentration of cod organic matter of 25 mg o2 l 1 c a 50 of removal 6 0 mg l 1 of calcium removal of 88 and 0 4 mg l 1 of strontium removal of 72 this significantly reduced the potential of scaling of the feed of electrodialysis in addition it is noted that the adsorption process preferably removed organic compounds while electrocoagulation process preferentially removed metals declaration of competing

for low contaminants concentration adsorption has higher potential with several studies in the literature 42 50 adsorption is a process of easy implementation usually cheap if compared to other methods the simple operating system if associated to a low cost adsorbent can make adsorption implementation attractive for many systems 42 46 among all of the adsorbents carbon is a unique and very versatile element which is capable of forming different architectures at the nanoscale 47 48 in addition carbon has been widely used in the treatment of various industrial effluents due to their high specific surface area and well developed porous structure 18 45 49 50 the activated carbon has a strong affinity for organic molecules and contains oxygenated functional groups on the entire surface which are capable of organic contaminants attraction 51 normally activated carbons are synthesized from carbonaceous materials and as an environmentally friendly alternative coal can be prepared from biomass residues or industrial wastes 46 52 54 studies of electrocoagulation in association with adsorption are still few table 1 summarizes the most outstanding published research in this field considering the presence of organic compounds and low solubility salts in the feed of the electrodialysis and their concentration in the electrodialysis concentrate as described by becheleni et al 12 this paper aims at reducing its scaling potential by reducing the contents of calcium and strontium and also organic matter by electrocoagulation simultaneous to adsorption by activated carbon in a real effluent from the oil industry this can improve the subsequent process of electrodialysis and subsequent crystallization decreasing operation times and contributing to form a less impure solid product the main novelty of this work is related to the evaluation of simultaneous removal of scaling elements like ca and sr and residual cod by associated ec ad system considering the context of zero liquid discharge in oil refineries 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials 2 1 1 activated carbon coconut husk carbon code cns 1240 produced by ac carbone canada inc saint jean sur richelieu qc the adsorbent was pulverized in a grinder grinder machine pulverizing ore model hsm 100 and sieved in a 38 μm sieve before its use 2 1 2 effluent the effluent in this study comes from an industrial wastewater treatment plant of an oil refinery located in betim mg brazil the effluent was collected in 20 l containers after the conventional treatment fig 1 2 2 adsorption experiments adsorption experiments were carried out with erlenmeyers 250 ml stirred in the shaker at 120 rpm with a carbon effluent ratio in the range of 0 60 g l 1 the isotherm curve was built after determination of the equilibrium time in experiments ranging from 0 to 24 h the adsorption capacity per mass of activated carbon was determined by eq 1 1 q v c 0 c m where q is the activated carbon adsorption capacity mg

adsorption tests using activated carbon the isotherms models shown in table 3 freundlich langmuir redlich peterson sips and temkin models in their general form were used to evaluate the results in this work the originpro8 software was used to obtain the parameters of the fit of models used in this study besides that to measure the adsorption curves adjustment the nonlinear chi square test x2 was used lower values of x calculated by eq 2 indicate their similarities while larger values represent the variation of the experimental data 2 x 2 i 1 n q e c a l c q e m e a s 2 q e m e a s 2 3 electrocoagulation experiments the electrocoagulation reactor fig 2 consisted of a square base prism cell in acrylic with a height of 15 5 cm and a base edge of 12 0 cm aluminum electrodes plates with 1 5 mm thickness base of 10 cm and submerged height of 10 cm were connected to a digital dc power supply fa 3005 instrutherm 0 30 v 0 5 a in the electrocoagulation experiments the parameters current density set up of electrodes configuration bipolar or monopolar arrangement number of electrodes and distance between the electrodes were evaluated the batch experiments were carried out with effluent volume of 1 5 l at room temperature with sampling at times of 5 10 20 30 40 60 and 120 min approximately 20 ml of sample were collected and filtered in a 0 45 μm syringe filter for further analysis mixing was obtained by magnetic stirrer lucadema model 01 09 with speed 3 the aluminum plates were previously dipped into 0 1 mol l 1 of hcl washed and dried at 60 c before each test the mass of the electrodes was measured before and after each test that were performed in duplicate the current density was determined by eq 3 3 δ i a where δ is the current density ma cm 2 i is the current ma and a is the submerged area of the electrode anode cm2 the energy consumption was calculated by eq 4 4 c u i t v where c is the energy consumed wh u is the electric tension v i is the current a t is time h and v is the treated effluent volume l the amount of metal consumed in the plates depends on the amount of electricity passing through the electrocoagulation cell and the dwell time of treatment it can be calculated by the faraday s law represented on eq 5 68 70 5 m i t w n f where m is the mass of the electrode consumed g i is the current density ma cm 1 t is time s w is the molar mass of the electrode material g mol 1 n is the number of electrons in the redox reaction and f is the faraday constant 96 485c differently from adsorption tests in which it is possible to fix the amount of adsorbent this is not possible in the electrocoagulation batch tests therefore in order to evaluate the kinetic models of reaction first order and second order equations were used table 4 2 4 associated adsorption electrocoagulation experiments after the determination of the optimal parameters in the adsorption and electrocoagulation process separately adsorption tests were carried out prior to electrocoagulation ones the effluent treated by the adsorption process was filtered and subsequently treated by the electrocoagulation another experiment was carried out simultaneously with the addition of activated carbon into the electrocoagulation cell in all experiments the removals of chemical oxygen demand cod calcium and strontium were determined the experiments were performed in duplicate 2 5 solids and solution characterization the content of dissolved organic compounds was quantified indirectly by chemical oxygen demand cod closed reflux colorimetric method for low cod range 71 an analytical standard curve was built with potassium biphthalate 10 20 30 40 50 60 and 70 mg l 1 previously filtered using 0 45 μm membrane millipore millex gv hydrophilic pvdf and the absorbance was measured in a hach dr 2800 spectrophotometer at a wavelength of 420 nm table 5 presents the analytical methods used for effluent characterization 71 samples of fresh activated carbon the loaded activated carbon the residue of the electrocoagulation process and the residue from the simultaneous adsorption and electrocoagulation process were dried at 60 c for 24 h and stored for further analysis solids characterization was performed through x ray fluorescence xrf panalytical pw2400 fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir bruker alpha model attenuated total reflection atr and diffuse reflectance drift a thorough morphological study by sem eds scanning electron microscope model 6360 l v dispersive spectrometer coupled to an in eds wavelength was also carried out the specific surface area and porosity were obtained from quantachrome device model nova 1000 nitrogen gas adsorption condensation both for fresh and loaded adsorption coconut husk carbon 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization table 6 presents the parameters of the effluent used in the study the cod of approximately 54 mg o2 l 1 is due to the presence of refractory organic compounds as pointed out by mesquita et al 13 it is observed that the effluent presents 71 mg l 1 of calcium and a low strontium concentration of 3 3 mg l 1 it is also observed a high concentration of chlorides of 539 8 mg l 1 despite of relatively good quality it has to be considered that the focus of the present work is the zld zero liquid discharge the effluent is already supersaturated for scaling salts such as caco3 and baso4 and after electrodialysis supersaturation will be reached for srso4 and srco3 in the concentrate causing scaling problems additionally according to the study of becheleni et al 12 in the next step of salt crystallization the organics substances accumulate in the crystallizer and contaminate the solid formed here the use of the recovered water cooling towers is aimed which corresponds to higher water consumption in refineries 12 the specific surface area and porosity from fresh activated carbon and activated carbon after adsorption process are shown in table 7 after the adsorption process it was possible to observe a reduction in the specific surface area from 891 5 694 7 m2 g 1 and a slightly reduction in the total pore volume from 0 46 to 0 40 cm3 g 1 which can be attributed to the adsorption of organic compounds on the surface of activated carbon the average pore diameter obtained is compatible with mesoporous structure according to iupac 20 500 å 72 sem eds analysis was performed to assess the samples morphology in the back scattered electron images a b c and d fig 3 several irregularities and porosity variations and size discrepancy between grains may be observed it is not possible to identify differences between samples of fresh activated carbon and loaded carbon the e and f images fig 3 present features of the homogeneous residue from electrocoagulation process and in the g and h images fig 3 carbon grains darker regions contained in the electrocoagulation residue are observed based on eds table 8 analysis no differences between the sample of fresh activated carbon and the loaded activated carbon were observed these being predominantly carbon containing traces of sulfur the residues from electrocoagulation exhibit the predominance of aluminum as a result of the dissolution process of the anode the presence of traces of calcium and strontium highlight the removal of these elements from the effluent the presence of sulfur chlorine and sodium is also observed derived from the treated effluent the final residue from the ec process associated with adsorption shows a slightly increase carbon amount table 8 when compared to the ec process which does not represent a critical element in the management of the generated sludge adyel et al 29 and morozesk et al 30 have already reported positive use of ec sludge applications in building and agriculture industries the ca and sr elemental analysis by x ray fluorescence analysis ca and sr for all solids are shown in fig 4 the calcium band in fig 4 a b exhibit an intensity below 0 3kcps and no signal of strontium was detected for both fresh and loaded activated carbon any variation in band intensity was detected which can suggest that coconut activated carbon was not able to remove calcium and strontium from the effluent however the spectra of solids from electrocoagulation show an increase of the ca and sr signal fig 4 c d which indicates the effectiveness of electrocoagulation in removing these elements fig 5 presents the ftir analysis of solids as expected no band for fresh activated carbon was identified the displacement of the band from 3500 cm 1 to 3280 cm 1 refers to the hoh stretch of water and the new band detected on 3080 cm 1 possibly refers to the adsorption of organic compounds 73 75 the band at 1640 cm 1 represents the hydroxyl and water oh flexion 15 76 and at 1500 cm 1 is attributed to aromatic cc functionality 15 77 it is also possible to find bands associated with aluminum connections at 1399 cm 1 the stretching in alh is observed 78 at 1066 cm 1 the stretching of alo 79 and the band at 587 cm 1 can be attributed to the stretching of aloh 78 however the band at 1066 cm 1 can also indicate the symmetrical stretch and at 1399 cm 1 the asymmetric stretch of c o 80 81 the bands 897 cm 1 and 724 cm 1 are due to the presence of co3 2 80 81 and the bands at 428 cm 1 and 468 cm 1 indicate the presence of sulfates 82 3 2 adsorption 3 2 1 kinetics fig 6 presents the experimental data and the adjusted kinetic models of pseudo first pseudo second and elovich the parameters obtained are presented at table 6 the removal of organic compounds cod by adsorption with coconut husk carbon reached equilibrium in 240 min with a reduction of approximately 50 in cod using 0 5 g l 1 of coconut husk calcium and strontium were not adsorbed the organics adsorption stabilizes after 240 min similar to the time obtained by nigri et al 18 for bone char however the kinetics adsorption on coconut husk carbon follows the elovich model while kinetics adsorption on bone char fits better to the pseudo second order kinetics model 18 the adsorption capacity in cod terms was 53 93 mg o2 g 1 corresponds to 50 of cod removal with a residual concentration of cod of 25 mg o2 l 1 this results is superior than the value obtained by mesquita et al 13 and nigri et al 18 who obtained approximately 45 of cod removal using 10 g l 1 of bone char it is worthy to note that the coconut husk carbon has a higher cod removal capacity 53 93 mg o2 g 1 than bone char cod removal capacity 2 35 mg o2 g 1 in nigri et al 18 this is probably due to the greater affinity of organic compounds to the main composition of carbon in coconut husk carbon in contrast bone char is mainly composed of hydroxyapatite ca10 po4 6 oh 2 in addition coconut husk carbon has a greater specific surface area ssabet 891 5 m2 g 1 7 5 times higher than the ssabet of the bone char ssabet 119 3 m2 g 1 83 the second order model presented a value of qe 53 93 mg o2 g 1 close to the value obtained experimentally 53 67 mg o2 g 1 and the data fit better to the elovich model with adjustment of 0 98 table 9 3 2 2 adsorption isotherms the effect of adsorbent dosage on the residual cod is shown in fig 7 there is an increase in the removal of organic compounds up to 0 5 g l 1 of activated carbon concentration this means that some organic compounds are not prompt to be adsorbed by the carbon 3 3 electrocoagulation 3 3 1 electrocoagulation parameters evaluation fig 8 shows the effect of process parameters and configuration of electrocoagulation system such as current density electrodes configuration bipolar and monopolar electrodes distance in monopolar configuration and also the variation of the number of electrodes current density voltage power and electrodes consumption ph variation and conductivity from electrocoagulation tests are show in table 10 the application of the current density of 7 5 ma cm 2 presents similar removal of calcium and strontium to those obtained with the use of 17 5 ma cm 2 while a worse result was obtained lowering the current density to 2 5 ma cm 2 fig 8a and table 10 however no change was observed in the removal of ca and sr due to modifications in electrodes configuration as bipolar or monopolar fig 8b nevertheless 30 of reduction in energy consumption was observed for the monopolar arrangement 16 4 kw h m 3 against 23 2 kw h m 3 for the bipolar configuration table 10 the increase in distance between electrodes from 0 5 to 1 0 cm was adverse to the removal of ca and sr fig 8c and it increased the energy consumption from 16 4 22 4 kw h m 3 table 10 twice the number of electrodes from 2 to 4 produced treated wastewater with half concentration for both ca and sr from 13 5 6 5 mg l 1 and 1 0 to 0 5 mg l 1 respectively fig 8d and table 10 table 10 shows that the energy and electrodes consumption rise with the increasing current density the current density of 7 5 ma cm 2 has shown specific energy consumption of 23 2 kw h m 3 there was not any removal by electrocoagulation possibly due to the low content of organics asselin et al 84 studied the electrocoagulation to the treatment of an effluent containing 2620 mg o2 l 1 cod which reached a final value of 616 mg o2 l 1 however these values are much higher than the effluent treated in the present work it is also observed that the increase of current leads a slightly increase of the final ph being 9 31 9 38 and 9 76 for current densities of 2 5 7 5 and 17 5 ma cm 2 respectively 57 85 in addition according to özyurt and camcıoğlu 86 electrocoagulation ec is an inefficient method for removing stable and dissolved organic pollutants as expected an increase in ph during the development of electrocoagulation was observed which is similar to previous works of ghosh et al 87 and babu and goel 88 the increase in ph is due to the formation of a higher concentration of hydroxyl ions in the ec bath due to water electrolysis the best electrocoagulation configuration was a monopolar with 4 electrodes distant 0 5 cm and the current density of 7 5 ma cm 2 this configuration produced an effluent with 5 8 mg l 1 of calcium and 0 4 mg l 1 of strontium with the specific energy consumption of 16 4 kw h m 3 table 10 according to hakizimana et al 89 lower amounts of energy are consumed by reducing the space between the electrodes as the distance between the electrodes becomes shorter the amount of gas bubbles generated increases leading to high mass transfer and a high reaction rate between coagulants and pollutant in his work mook et al 90 assesses the possibility of using renewable energy from alternative sources in electrochemical systems in wastewater treatment which would minimize the cost of the process the operating cost of the ec are mainly composed by energy electrode maintenance and labor 91 92 to estimate the costs involved in this work the cost of electricity of 0 0678 kwh 1 93 was considered and the cost of aluminum electrodes has been taken at 1459 93 ton 1 94 maintenance costs were not taken into account based on these values it would be 4 84 m 3 of treated effluent 3 3 2 kinetics and isotherms of electrocoagulation similarly to adsorption the removal capacities of calcium and strontium by electrocoagulation were determined initially the equilibrium time was found fig 9 in monopolar configuration current of 3 0a 4 electrodes and current density 7 5 ma cm 2 the pseudo first and second order adjustment parameters table 11 presented values of 0 99 and 0 98 respectively for removal of calcium and 0 98 and 0 97 respectively for removal of strontium previous works in the literature have found distinct best fits for kinetics of adsorption secula et al 56 observed kinetics of the pseudo first order however isa et al 95 nariyan et al 69 and murthy and parmar 92 had found kinetics of pseudo second order in addition adeogun and balakrishnan 96 indicate better data fits for elovich and pseudo second order kinetics models fig 10 shows the fitting of the langmuir freundlich redlich peterson sips and temkin models to experimental data on the removal of calcium and strontium by electrocoagulation the parameters obtained from these data fitting are shown in table 12 langmuir isotherm presents the best fit 0 9841 to the calcium removal data followed by the redlich peterson isotherm with a determination coefficient of 0 9816 for strontium removal the freundlich model presents the best correlation coefficient being of 0 8892 followed by the langmuir model with fit of 0 8621 table 12 in contrast the works from nariyan et al 69 and ghalwa et al 97 exhibited data fits for freundlich s model while data from adeogun and balakrishnan 96 were better suited to the sips model 3 4 adsorption with electrocoagulation table 13 shows the applied and obtained parameters from simultaneous and sequential processes of adsorption and electrocoagulation tests considering the equilibrium time for adsorption of 240 min in the simultaneous experiment the activated carbon was added to reactor and stirred 120 min before to the start of the electrocoagulation process therefore the complete time required for adsorption was reached since the electrocoagulation process time was complete in 120 min there were no significant differences between the parameters obtained from the sequential or the simultaneous operation in fig 11 the cod removal gives similar residual cod value of 25 33 and 25 96 mg o2 l 1 for sequential and simultaneous operation respectively however it is observed an improvement of process time to 120 min which contribute to reduce the costs it is also possible to see that the electrocoagulation process was not effective to remove the residual organic compounds which is coherent with the ec previous results similar performance was observed for the sequential and simultaneous operation with a calcium concentration of 5 98 and 7 5 mg l 1 and strontium 0 92 and 0 74 mg l 1 respectively fig 12 it is also possible to see that during the sequential operations calcium and strontium were not removed which corroborate that the removal of these metals occurs only by electrocoagulation the mechanism of calcium and strontium removal by ec is probably due to the precipitation of carbonates the increase in ph favors the growth in the co3 2 carbonate species concentration instead of hco3 2 bicarbonates causing a supersaturation condition and allowing the calcium and strontium carbonates to precipitate further be coagulated by the positive hydroxy aluminum species this mechanism is coherent with the results from ftir fig 5 which indicated the presence of carbonate groups in the solid residue from ec associated with the carbon 4 conclusions electrocoagulation associated with adsorption presented an economy of treatment time in relation to the process in stages of adsorption followed by electrocoagulation because the results were similar the ideal dosage of coconut husk carbon in the process was 0 5 g l 1 with an equilibrium time of 240 min monopolar configuration with 4 electrodes 0 5 cm of distance between electrodes and the current density of 7 5 ma cm 2 in 120 min presented the best result with specific energy consumption of 16 4 kw h m 3 the treatment resulted in a residual concentration of cod organic matter of 25 mg o2 l 1 c a 50 of removal 6 0 mg l 1 of calcium removal of 88 and 0 4 mg l 1 of strontium removal of 72 this significantly reduced the potential of scaling of the feed of electrodialysis in addition it is noted that the adsorption process preferably removed organic compounds while electrocoagulation process preferentially removed metals declaration of competing

13907,this work presents experimental results on the catalytic effect of volcanic sand on the simultaneous removal of naproxen ketoprofen and cimetidine by ozonation catalyst characterization included xrd edx xrf sem and physisorption analysis removal assays at laboratory scale in a semi batch reactor showed enhanced removal by the presence of the catalyst at ph 4 but no difference was found at higher ph values furthermore the immobilization of different amounts of tio2 2 5 and 5 0 on the sand surface revealed that tio2 exerted an adverse effect on the catalytic activity at ph 4 lowering ketoprofen removal by up to 41 3 likewise the highest and fastest removal at ph 4 was obtained using a catalyst dose of 1 g l and dosing ozone at 15 mg l 72 5 ketoprofen 90 7 total pharmaceuticals reaching more than 80 total elimination after only one minute of treatment catalyst reusability evaluated over 5 cycles demonstrated efficient elimination of the pharmaceuticals with only slight decrease in ketoprofen elimination finally heterogeneous catalytic ozonation of ketoprofen was applied in a real wastewater matrix obtaining a removal of 75 9 after 40 min of reaction this represents a similar efficiency to that achieved in synthetic wastewater keywords pharmaceuticals ozone heterogeneous catalysis volcanic sand 1 introduction pharmaceutical products are considered emerging environmental pollutants of wide and increased use in human and veterinary medicine 1 their highest concentrations are found in hospital and municipal wastewaters however current legislation regarding their concentrations in effluents or the environment is still mostly lacking worldwide 2 3 among pharmaceutical compounds naproxen and ketoprofen are two non steroidal anti inflammatory drugs commonly detected in influents and effluents of wastewater treatment plants wwtps as well as in surface waters 1 4 5 high environmental risk has been demonstrated for the presence of these compounds in such water streams 6 moreover cimetidine is a histamine h2 receptor antagonist used for the treatment of gastrointestinal disorders 7 partial removal capability of wwtps has resulted in its detection in surface waters 8 ecotoxicological studies report adverse effects of cimetidine on invertebrate aquatic populations 9 and potential endocrine disruption alterations following long term exposure 7 for these reasons the search for technologies capable of removing pharmaceutical compounds is a matter of environmental relevance advanced oxidation processes aops have been developed in a wide variety of applications within the field of wastewater treatment these processes are based on the generation and use of transient species with high oxidizing potential mainly the hydroxyl radical oh resulting in efficient removal of diverse pharmaceuticals as reviewed elsewhere 10 11 heterogeneous catalytic ozonation belongs to the group of non photochemical aops it enhances the ozonation of organic pollutants through the formation of hydroxyl radicals generated from the decomposition of ozone on the surface of a solid heterogeneous catalyst 12 catalysts so far evaluated in this process include activated carbon and metals supported on activated carbon 13 14 biochar 15 16 zeolite 17 18 and even volcanic sand 19 in particular volcanic sand represents a low cost option to the high cost activated carbon commonly employed in these processes moreover this material permits the immobilization of metal oxides such as tio2 which might additionally enhance the elimination outcome 20 the removal of cimetidine 21 ketoprofen 22 and naproxen 23 by ozonation has shown promising results nonetheless heterogeneous ozonation processes have been scarcely explored for these compounds and there are reports for ketoprofen 24 and naproxen 23 but not for cimetidine although none of the studies employed sand as the catalyst this work aimed to evaluate the efficiency of volcanic sand as a catalyst for the heterogeneous catalytic ozonation of naproxen ketoprofen and cimetidine pharmaceutical products commonly found in wastewater the effect of different conditions i e ph tio2 immobilization on the volcanic sand catalyst load and ozone dosage on pharmaceuticals degradation was examined particular interest was focused on low ph conditions considering that i ozonation is usually favored at high ph contrary to this volcanic sand which showed better performance at low ph and ii acidic effluents of environmental relevance such as leachates from young landfills 25 are less commonly studied the use of volcanic sand results in an environmentally friendly low cost easy to separate and non toxic catalyst 26 for catalytic ozonation processes 2 materials and methods 2 1

volcanic sand were 0 00244 cm3 g 17 31 nm and 0 473 m2 g respectively for the sand with immobilized tio2 the values were 0 001981 cm3 g 22 03 nm and 0 360 m2 g respectively from these results it can be concluded that these materials have mesoporous characteristics low pore volume surface area and microporosity moreover that tio2 immobilization has little effect on these properties sands usually present low surface areas being the grain shape and surface roughness the main contribution to this property for example blott et al 31 reported values between 0 093 6 722 m2 g for river sands attributing these low values to the high percentage of rounded and smoothed grains of these materials the pzc experiment revealed that the volcanic sand has a phpzc 7 this means that the catalyst surface is negatively charged at ph 7 mainly because of deprotonated oh groups of metal oxides and has a positive charge at ph 7 where a portion of surface ohs on the metal oxides are protonated m oh2 preliminary experiments showed that the volcanic sand has a high capacity to adsorb several pharmaceutical products in fact other drugs including the beta blocker atenolol and the veterinary pharmaceutical florfenicol were 100 absorbed by the catalyst data not shown probably favored by the high iron content of the sand 32 33 these results suggest that the volcanic sand itself could be further studied as a potential adsorbent for the removal of pharmaceuticals and other organic pollutants adsorption experiments ph 4 catalyst concentration 1 0 g l were performed to determine the contact time at which the prepared catalyst and the model pharmaceuticals reached adsorption equilibrium after 45 min data showed adsorptions of 2 3 29 6 and 30 3 for cimetidine ketoprofen and naproxen respectively since stable concentrations were obtained after 20 min a contact time of 30 min was employed prior to every catalytic removal experiment to ensure that the adsorption equilibrium was reached adsorption studies of pharmaceuticals using sands have been reported elsewhere 34 moreover the adsorption of the target molecule to the catalyst surface represents a key factor in their role in heterogeneous catalysis 35 3 2 effect of initial ph on non catalytic and catalytic ozonation regardless of the ph applied 4 7 8 or 10 the elimination of cimetidine and naproxen took place at rates so fast that at least 93 5 of naproxen and 96 8 of cimetidine were degraded within one minute of treatment such behavior was observed both in the non catalytic and catalytic ozonation experiments throughout all the operational conditions explored therefore most of the discussion of results is focused on the effects of the operating variables on ketoprofen removal which limited the total elimination of pharmaceuticals in the system the fast elimination of naproxen has also been reported for non catalytic and catalytic ozonation using tio2 even in real wastewater 23 36 37 similarly the elimination of cimetidine in wastewater was previously reported by non catalytic ozonation 21 but not for catalytic ozonation ozonation and o3 uv processes used for ketoprofen removal have reported the formation of 3 1 hydroxyethyl benzophenone 3 1 hydroperoxyethyl benzophenone 1 3 benzoylphenyl ethanone and 3 ethylbenzophenone which combined seemed to be of higher toxicity than the parent compound as their peak concentrations correlated with the increased ecotoxicity of treated water towards several benchmark organisms daphnia magna microcrustacean vibrio fischeri bacteria and raphidocelis subcapitata microalgae 22 similarly the intermediates produced from naproxen degradation by advanced oxidation particularly phototransformation have shown higher toxicity than the parental molecule 38 39 on the contrary tio2 solar photocatalysis successfully decreased the toxicity towards earthworms eisenia andrei in a process that produced 1 6 methoxynaphthalene 2 yl ethylhydroperoxide 2 ethyl 6 methoxynaphthalene 1 6 methoxynaphthalen 2 yl ethanol 1 6 methoxynapthalen 2 yl ethanone and malic acid as intermediates 40 ozonation is a process largely dependent on ph as ozone decomposition in water takes place at higher rates with increasing ph values but also because the ph value influences the properties of the catalyst surface such as its charge which has a direct effect on the adsorption capacity towards organic molecules 41 this trend was clearly observed in the non catalytic ozonation of ketoprofen see fig 3 a which exhibited a rather poor elimination at ph 4 27 0 after 30 min but increased to indistinguishable high removal rates at ph values of 7 8 and 10 95 5 mean removal after 30 min also when analyzing the results for the total removal of pharmaceuticals in the mixture see fig 3b operation at ph 4 resulted in a 21 9 lower performance on the other hand the catalytic ozonation of ketoprofen did not follow the trend of increased removal at increased ph as faster ketoprofen elimination was achieved at ph 7 compared to ph 8 see fig 4 moreover other interesting findings were observed when comparing non catalytic and catalytic ozonation of ketoprofen first at ph values of 7 and 10 ketoprofen elimination profiles were indistinguishable in both processes second at ph 8 a better removal was achieved with the non catalytic ozonation and third the catalytic ozonation was better only at ph 4 better performance was expected at increased ph values as decomposition reactions of ozone to form free radicals are enhanced at high ph by the presence of hydroxide ions thus resulting in overall faster rates than at low ph 42 however it has to be also considered that at ph 7 both catalyst phpzc 7 and target molecule pka 3 88 are negatively charged inducing repulsion forces among them and as a consequence lower catalytic activity the overall effect of ph on catalytic ozonation reaction is a mix of the relative importance of the aforementioned effects valdes et al 19 achieved an enhancement in benzothiazol removal when applying volcanic sand at every single ph assayed the effect of the catalyst was ascribed in that case to the presence of metal oxides in volcanic sand which might catalyze ozone decomposition into more active radicals 19 42 such effects linked to volcanic sand and ozone interactions could have been the ones explaining the best removal of ketoprofen at ph 4 with respect to the non catalytic process particularly the major presence of iron oxides in the sand since iron oxides have been reported to significantly increase the ozone oxidation of organic compounds in water especially at low ph values 20 43 44 this behavior has been attributed to the generation of oxidant species mainly oh via interaction of o3 with the protonated iron oxide surface sites however organics oxidation occurs mostly at the solid liquid interface and or in bulk solution with adsorption playing little role in the overall oxidation process 44 taking into account that at ph 4 ketoprofen is negatively charged pka 3 88 and the catalyst positively charged phpzc 7 interactions of ketoprofen at volcanic sand surface level could also be favoring the process compared to the non catalytic ozonation this finding is of great interest for the application of ozone as a method to treat acidic effluents usually overlooked due to the fact that ozonation processes are favored at high ph and that pharmaceutical containing effluents such as those from wwtps usually have ph values over 6 such acidic effluents include the leachates from young landfills known to contain important concentrations of pharmaceutical compounds 45 for these reasons at this point the work was focused on assaying the best operating conditions for the removal of the selected pharmaceuticals at ph 4 using volcanic sand as a heterogeneous catalyst 3 3 effect of tio2 concentration catalyst concentration and ozone dosage on pharmaceuticals degradation at low ph the effect of operating conditions on the removal of pharmaceuticals was evaluated at ph 4 first the effect of the amount of tio2 immobilized on the sand catalyst was assayed results are shown in fig 5 a b after 30 min of treatment the highest removal was achieved using sand without tio2 ketoprofen 72 5 total pollutants 90 7 significantly higher than the performance of the catalyst containing tio2 at 5 0 ketoprofen 31 2 total pollutants 85 3 it was clear that the presence of tio2 in the catalyst exerted an adverse effect mostly on the removal of ketoprofen but not so significant on the elimination of cimetidine and naproxen these findings suggest that the volcanic sand alone seems to be an efficient catalyst for the transformation of pharmaceuticals presumably the excess in tio2 content hinders the activity of sand due to its accumulation on the surface obstructing the access of ozone molecules to the iron oxides on the sand surface and as a consequence less oh radicals can be formed in addition bet measurements revealed that tio2 immobilization somehow reduced the available surface area for the heterogeneous reaction and as previously mentioned adsorption of ketoprofen molecules might also play a key role in its degradation at ph 4 similar findings by cooper and burch 46 showed that surface modification of alumina with tio2 did not necessarily result in the increase of oxalic acid removal by catalytic ozonation as the lack of tio2 in the catalyst resulted in better removals the volcanic sand alone was used to evaluate the other parameters the effect of catalyst load concentration in the reaction slurry is shown in fig 5c d the highest and fastest removal was obtained using a sand concentration of 1 g l 72 5 ketoprofen 90 7 total pollutants after 30 min reaching more than 80 of total elimination after only one minute of treatment the performance of lower 0 5 g l and higher 2 g l sand concentrations resulted in less efficient pharmaceutical removal total removal 86 4 and 80 0 respectively given that cimetidine and naproxen are still being fastly removed the difference was more critical on ketoprofen whose elimination dropped to 51 2 catalyst 0 5 g l and 40 2 catalyst 2 g l increasing catalyst concentration between 0 1 g l resulted in higher ozone decay rates due to its interaction with more metal oxide sites in the sand which act as strong lewis acids and the subsequent enhancement of radicals production and reaction rate 19 42 increasing catalyst concentration beyond 1 g l decreased the removal performance of the system indicating that at high catalyst load aggregation of sand particles might decrease the availability of surface active sites 47 the effect of the ozone dosage was finally assessed using the volcanic sand at a concentration of 1 g l results in fig 5e f revealed that using 15 mg l achieves the highest elimination 72 5 ketoprofen 90 7 total pollutants after 30 min a lower dose 5 mg l decreased the efficiency to 56 1 ketoprofen and 85 6 total pollutants better performance at 15 mg l is likely due to the increase in dissolved ozone in water which consequently will decompose in the presence of the catalyst 48 the use of a higher ozone dose 25 mg l failed to significantly enhance the removal efficiency and actually resulted in slightly lower elimination of ketoprofen 70 1 and of total pharmaceuticals 89 7 the small effect of using high ozone doses on pollutant removal has been reported by others 36 for pharmaceuticals such as naproxen and ibuprofen moreover the elimination of several pharmaceuticals was not significantly increased with ozone doses over 10 mg l 49 nonetheless those studies were performed under non catalytic conditions similarly hansen et al 49 demonstrated that the increase in ph results in increased doses of ozone required to achieve the removal of several pharmaceuticals in non catalytic ozonation of wastewater in this respect working at low ph values would represent lower ozone consumption an apparent kinetic model for ketoprofen elimination at best conditions ph 4 0 tio2 1 g l catalyst load and 15 mg l ozone dose was determined by a non linear regression method assuming a power law reaction rate equation and constant dissolved ozone concentration 50 the calculations revealed a fourth order apparent reaction with k 0 53 mg 3 l 3 min 1 r2 0 991 furthermore the reusability of the catalyst was evaluated at best conditions considering the total pharmaceuticals removal the catalyst exhibited outstanding reusability over five consecutive cycles 91 0 average removal however a slight decrease was observed from 79 9 to 67 6 when ketoprofen removal alone was considered see fig 6 3 4 removal of ketoprofen from real wastewater by catalytic ozonation the catalytic ozonation process was applied to treat real wastewater collected from a wwtp serving a dentistry facility using the best operating conditions found in this study the wastewater sample was enriched with ketoprofen to 1 mg l as it was the most persistent compound of this research the results shown in fig 7 revealed an average degradation of 75 9 after 40 min of reaction this represents a similar efficiency to that obtained using synthetic wastewater this finding suggests a low matrix effect exerted by the real water on ketoprofen removal even considering the radical scavenging effect of organic matter contained in the wastewater finally the toc reduction produced by the catalytic ozonation process in real wastewater was determined obtaining on average 8 13 6 4 mg l of toc removal considering that 1 mg l of ketoprofen represents only 0 76 mg toc l it can be concluded that the ozonation process mineralizes not only an important portion of the ketoprofen present in solution but also many other organic compounds not identified it is known that ozonation alone achieves limited mineralization of organic micropollutants and cod in water 51 however better mineralization is usually achieved through heterogeneous catalytic ozonation 35 4 conclusions in this study the heterogeneous catalytic ozonation of naproxen ketoprofen and cimetidine over volcanic sand was investigated under various operating conditions including initial ph immobilization of tio2 on the sand catalyst load and ozone concentration in inlet gas the results showed that both non catalytic and catalytic ozonation were extremely efficient and fast to remove cimetidine and naproxen regardless of the ph employed while ketoprofen was not as easily eliminated the performance of non catalytic and catalytic ozonation was quite similar for all compounds and ph values studied except for ketoprofen at ph 4 where the catalytic process produced better eliminations consequently volcanic sand seems to be a better catalyst at low ph further research at ph 4 showed that the immobilization of tio2 on the sand surface lowers the catalytic activity operating conditions of 1 g l of suspended sand and ozone inlet concentration of 15 mg l were the conditions determined for better removal of the selected pharmaceuticals ecotoxicological monitoring of the treated water is strongly encouraged to estimate the potential formation of toxic transformation products and the environmental feasibility of the process the additional evidence that ketoprofen was removed from real wastewater samples at similar rates as in synthetic wastewater the relative stability of the catalyst during several use cycles and the easy and low cost availability of volcanic sand make it an

13907,this work presents experimental results on the catalytic effect of volcanic sand on the simultaneous removal of naproxen ketoprofen and cimetidine by ozonation catalyst characterization included xrd edx xrf sem and physisorption analysis removal assays at laboratory scale in a semi batch reactor showed enhanced removal by the presence of the catalyst at ph 4 but no difference was found at higher ph values furthermore the immobilization of different amounts of tio2 2 5 and 5 0 on the sand surface revealed that tio2 exerted an adverse effect on the catalytic activity at ph 4 lowering ketoprofen removal by up to 41 3 likewise the highest and fastest removal at ph 4 was obtained using a catalyst dose of 1 g l and dosing ozone at 15 mg l 72 5 ketoprofen 90 7 total pharmaceuticals reaching more than 80 total elimination after only one minute of treatment catalyst reusability evaluated over 5 cycles demonstrated efficient elimination of the pharmaceuticals with only slight decrease in ketoprofen elimination finally heterogeneous catalytic ozonation of ketoprofen was applied in a real wastewater matrix obtaining a removal of 75 9 after 40 min of reaction this represents a similar efficiency to that achieved in synthetic wastewater keywords pharmaceuticals ozone heterogeneous catalysis volcanic sand 1 introduction pharmaceutical products are considered emerging environmental pollutants of wide and increased use in human and veterinary medicine 1 their highest concentrations are found in hospital and municipal wastewaters however current legislation regarding their concentrations in effluents or the environment is still mostly lacking worldwide 2 3 among pharmaceutical compounds naproxen and ketoprofen are two non steroidal anti inflammatory drugs commonly detected in influents and effluents of wastewater treatment plants wwtps as well as in surface waters 1 4 5 high environmental risk has been demonstrated for the presence of these compounds in such water streams 6 moreover cimetidine is a histamine h2 receptor antagonist used for the treatment of gastrointestinal disorders 7 partial removal capability of wwtps has resulted in its detection in surface waters 8 ecotoxicological studies report adverse effects of cimetidine on invertebrate aquatic populations 9 and potential endocrine disruption alterations following long term exposure 7 for these reasons the search for technologies capable of removing pharmaceutical compounds is a matter of environmental relevance advanced oxidation processes aops have been developed in a wide variety of applications within the field of wastewater treatment these processes are based on the generation and use of transient species with high oxidizing potential mainly the hydroxyl radical oh resulting in efficient removal of diverse pharmaceuticals as reviewed elsewhere 10 11 heterogeneous catalytic ozonation belongs to the group of non photochemical aops it enhances the ozonation of organic pollutants through the formation of hydroxyl radicals generated from the decomposition of ozone on the surface of a solid heterogeneous catalyst 12 catalysts so far evaluated in this process include activated carbon and metals supported on activated carbon 13 14 biochar 15 16 zeolite 17 18 and even volcanic sand 19 in particular volcanic sand represents a low cost option to the high cost activated carbon commonly employed in these processes moreover this material permits the immobilization of metal oxides such as tio2 which might additionally enhance the elimination outcome 20 the removal of cimetidine 21 ketoprofen 22 and naproxen 23 by ozonation has shown promising results nonetheless heterogeneous ozonation processes have been scarcely explored for these compounds and there are reports for ketoprofen 24 and naproxen 23 but not for cimetidine although none of the studies employed sand as the catalyst this work aimed to evaluate the efficiency of volcanic sand as a catalyst for the heterogeneous catalytic ozonation of naproxen ketoprofen and cimetidine pharmaceutical products commonly found in wastewater the effect of different conditions i e ph tio2 immobilization on the volcanic sand catalyst load and ozone dosage on pharmaceuticals degradation was examined particular interest was focused on low ph conditions considering that i ozonation is usually favored at high ph contrary to this volcanic sand which showed better performance at low ph and ii acidic effluents of environmental relevance such as leachates from young landfills 25 are less commonly studied the use of volcanic sand results in an environmentally friendly low cost easy to separate and non toxic catalyst 26 for catalytic ozonation processes 2 materials and methods 2 1

the catalyst surfaces are shown in fig 2d e the comparison between images of the sand and tio2 immobilized sand suggests that both have smooth non porous surfaces whitish tio2 nanoparticle clusters typical of aeroxide p25 tio2 are clearly observed in fig 2e this morphology is a result of the preparation method utilized which produces a composite material by fixing tio2 particle clusters to the sand grain surface by heat treatment edx mapping of various elements si fe and ti present in the tio2 immobilized sand grains are shown in fig 2f i it can be noticed that element dispersion in the grains is homogeneous for the case of ti a few large clusters can be identified but that is a consequence of the immobilization method utilized as previously discussed nitrogen adsorption desorption isotherms were used to investigate the bet surface area pore volume and pore size of the sand and the sand with 2 5 immobilized tio2 the adsorption desorption isotherms for both catalysts are presented in fig s1 and can be categorized as type iv isotherms with type h3 hysteresis loops according to the iupac classification the average pore volume pore size and bet surface area of the volcanic sand were 0 00244 cm3 g 17 31 nm and 0 473 m2 g respectively for the sand with immobilized tio2 the values were 0 001981 cm3 g 22 03 nm and 0 360 m2 g respectively from these results it can be concluded that these materials have mesoporous characteristics low pore volume surface area and microporosity moreover that tio2 immobilization has little effect on these properties sands usually present low surface areas being the grain shape and surface roughness the main contribution to this property for example blott et al 31 reported values between 0 093 6 722 m2 g for river sands

naproxen respectively since stable concentrations were obtained after 20 min a contact time of 30 min was employed prior to every catalytic removal experiment to ensure that the adsorption equilibrium

of ketoprofen molecules might also play a key role in its degradation at ph 4 similar findings by cooper and burch 46 showed that surface modification of alumina with tio2 did not necessarily result in the increase of oxalic acid removal by catalytic ozonation as the lack of tio2 in the catalyst resulted in better removals the volcanic sand alone was used to evaluate the other parameters the effect of catalyst load concentration in the reaction slurry is shown in fig 5c d the highest and fastest removal was obtained using a sand concentration of 1 g l 72 5 ketoprofen 90 7 total pollutants after 30 min reaching more than 80 of total elimination after only one minute of treatment the performance of lower 0 5 g l and higher 2 g l sand concentrations resulted in less efficient pharmaceutical removal total removal 86 4 and 80 0 respectively given that cimetidine and naproxen are still being fastly removed the difference was more critical on ketoprofen whose elimination dropped to 51 2 catalyst 0 5 g l and 40 2 catalyst 2 g l increasing catalyst concentration between 0 1 g l resulted in higher ozone decay rates due to its interaction with more metal oxide sites in the sand which act as strong lewis acids and the subsequent enhancement of radicals production and reaction rate 19 42 increasing catalyst concentration beyond 1 g l decreased the removal performance of the system indicating that at high catalyst load aggregation of sand particles might decrease the availability of surface active sites 47 the effect of the ozone dosage was finally assessed using the volcanic sand at a concentration of 1 g l results in fig 5e f revealed that using 15 mg l achieves the highest elimination 72 5 ketoprofen 90 7 total pollutants after 30 min a lower dose 5 mg l decreased the efficiency to 56 1 ketoprofen and 85 6 total pollutants better performance at 15 mg l is likely due to the increase in dissolved ozone in water which consequently will decompose in the presence of the catalyst 48 the use of a higher ozone dose 25 mg l failed to significantly enhance the removal efficiency and actually resulted in slightly lower elimination of ketoprofen 70 1 and of total pharmaceuticals 89 7 the small effect of using high ozone doses on pollutant removal has been reported by others 36 for pharmaceuticals such as naproxen and ibuprofen moreover the elimination of several pharmaceuticals was not significantly increased with ozone doses over 10 mg l 49 nonetheless those studies were performed under non catalytic conditions similarly hansen et al 49 demonstrated that the increase in ph results in increased doses of ozone required to achieve the removal of several pharmaceuticals in non catalytic ozonation of wastewater in this respect working at low ph values would represent lower ozone consumption an apparent kinetic model for ketoprofen elimination at best conditions ph 4 0 tio2 1 g l catalyst load and 15 mg l ozone dose was determined by a non linear regression method assuming a power law reaction rate equation and constant dissolved ozone concentration 50 the calculations revealed a fourth order apparent reaction with k 0 53 mg 3 l 3 min 1 r2 0 991 furthermore the reusability of the catalyst was evaluated at best conditions considering the total pharmaceuticals removal the catalyst exhibited outstanding reusability over five consecutive cycles 91 0 average removal however a slight decrease was observed from 79 9 to 67 6 when ketoprofen removal alone was considered see fig 6 3 4 removal of ketoprofen from real wastewater by catalytic ozonation the catalytic ozonation process was applied to treat real wastewater collected from a wwtp serving a dentistry facility using the best operating conditions found in this study the wastewater sample was enriched with ketoprofen to 1 mg l as it was the most persistent compound of this research the results shown in fig 7 revealed an average degradation of 75 9 after 40 min of reaction this represents a similar efficiency to that obtained using synthetic wastewater this finding suggests a low matrix effect exerted by the real water on ketoprofen removal even considering the radical scavenging effect of organic matter contained in the wastewater finally the toc reduction produced by the catalytic ozonation process in real wastewater was determined obtaining on average 8 13 6 4 mg l of toc removal considering that 1 mg l of ketoprofen represents only 0 76 mg toc l it can be concluded that the ozonation process mineralizes not only an important portion of the ketoprofen present in solution but also many other organic compounds not identified it is known that ozonation alone achieves limited mineralization of organic micropollutants and cod in water 51 however better mineralization is usually achieved through heterogeneous catalytic ozonation 35 4 conclusions in this study the heterogeneous catalytic ozonation of naproxen ketoprofen and cimetidine over volcanic sand was investigated under various operating conditions including initial ph immobilization of tio2 on the sand catalyst load and ozone concentration in inlet gas the results showed that both non catalytic and catalytic ozonation were extremely efficient and fast to remove cimetidine and naproxen regardless of the ph employed while ketoprofen was not as easily eliminated the performance of non catalytic and catalytic ozonation was quite similar for all compounds and ph values studied except for ketoprofen at ph 4 where the catalytic process produced better eliminations consequently volcanic sand seems to be a better catalyst at low ph further research at ph 4 showed that the immobilization of tio2 on the sand surface lowers the catalytic activity operating conditions of 1 g l of suspended sand and ozone inlet concentration of 15 mg l were the conditions determined for better removal of the selected pharmaceuticals ecotoxicological monitoring of the treated water is strongly encouraged to estimate the potential formation of toxic transformation products and the environmental feasibility of the process the additional evidence that ketoprofen was removed from real wastewater samples at similar rates as in synthetic wastewater the relative stability of the catalyst during several use cycles and the easy and low cost availability of volcanic sand make it an

13908,in this investigation an attempt has been made to evaluate the performance of a novel semifluidized bed adsorption column for the removal of divalent heavy metal ions from synthetic wastewater low cost low density adsorbent has been synthesized from sugarcane bagasse based biochar and na alginate the biochar has specific surface area of 391 42 m2 g and it s composite has 200 14 m2 g respectively major operating parameters for the system were adsorbent bed height initial solute concentration and feed flow rate the optimum condition of the process for maximum percentage removal of metal ions was analysed by response surface methodology technique the satisfactory values of correlation coefficients ensure the suitability of the model from process optimization the optimum conditions for zn2 cu2 and ni2 were of same values having initial adsorbent bed height 12 97 cm initial solute concentration 14 05 mg l and feed flow rate of 2 81 lpm liter per minute and maximum percentage removal were found to be 87 56 88 89 and 84 31 respectively a real time dynamic mass transfer model based on solid liquid mass balance has also been developed and validated with all the experimental data solid liquid interphase mass transfer coefficient along with the axial dispersion coefficient for individually packed and a fluidized section of bed was also estimated from the developed model the axial dispersion coefficient was calculated as 5 1 0 3 10 11 m2 s for packed section and 4 8 0 3 10 6 m2 s for fluidized section mass transfer coefficient for zn2 cu2 and ni2 were

great threat over the last decades these heavy metals laden wastewater are generally resulting from rapid industrialization and urbanization 1 according to the united states environmental protection agency usepa 129 organic and inorganic chemical elements are listed as priority pollutants 2 in this list zinc copper nickel are also found these heavy metals are non biodegradable carcinogenic in nature and tend to accumulate in living organisms therefore treatment of such heavy metal containing wastewater is a matter of great concern in recent days various technologies have already been used and some are under research to find a sustainable one some of the traditional technologies which are in practice over the years are ion exchange 3 chemical precipitation 4 coagulation filtration membrane etc 5 however these conventional methods face a lot of drawbacks such as high operational cost difficulties in operation a lot of chemical by products discharge etc 6 in recent years adsorption based separation process has become most popular among the researchers due to many advantages over the other technologies 1 7 8 however most of the reported adsorption based wastewater treatment methods are still in the batch scale for example some of the low cost bio adsorbents which are successfully used are hardwood char 9 corn straw char 10 empty fruit branch magnetic biochar 11 dairy manure char 12 rice husk cellulosic materials fly ash sawdust pine bark tea industry waste bagasse cone biomass and many more for removal of zn2 cu2 and ni2 13 from the aqueous solution therefore it is a challenging task to develop the adsorption based separation process in a continuous system which is applicable in a real industrial situation in this research direction there are few reported results on established liquid solid contacting equipment like fixed bed reactor and fluidized bed reactors 14 16 in a very small lab scale despite having many advantages fluidized bed adsorption column was used for removal of pb2 cd2 cu2 and zn2 by biochar and other low cost adsorbents 17 20 those reported results were experimental as well as model based analysis studies on packed bed adsorption column are comparatively higher packed bed adsorption column has been studied for removal of various heavy metals like pb2 cr 4 cd2 21 25 and readers are encouraged to go through review articles by afroze and sen 1 where up to date compilation was made on packed bed adsorption column and its applications in the removal of aqueous phase inorganics organics removal by adsorption from the extensive literature review it is evident that in recent years studies on the packed or fixed bed column is more than the fluidized bed on the other hand packed bed and fluidized bed both have some specific drawbacks like a high pressure drop less utilization of adsorbent material back mixing adsorbent washout and low conversion 26 29 therefore there is some research gap still to be addressed to accomplish some extensive work to overcome such drawbacks and increase the separation efficiency hence this present study has been undertaken to develop a novel semifluidized bed reactor sfbr which is a fixed bed followed by a fluidized bed in the same reacting column and tested its effectiveness in the removal of heavy metal ions from wastewater in continuous mode of operation though the concept of semifluidization is not new still its application in industrial as well as lab based system is very minimal this type of novel reactor is reported by some researchers describing its advantages and can overcome some drawbacks of individual reactors partially moreover the adsorbent used as bed material and fluidizing materials in this investigation is immobilized biochar in ca alginate biopolymer this novel adsorbent prevents the particle washout from the system during continuous operation and hence reduces the extra cost for liquid solid separation and makes the process easier to implement therefore the overall aims to analyse the performance of a novel semifluidized bed column for heavy metals removal from wastewater as per our knowledge no such studies have been reported to date along with the experimental analysis the optimum conditions for maximizing the percentage removal was also investigated a real time dynamic mathematical mass transfer model has been developed based on solid liquid mass balance and accordingly validated with the experimental data for the scale up of such novel process for future applications in wastewater treatment 2 materials and method the synthetic wastewater solution of zn2 cu2 ni2 were prepared by dissolving a calculated amount of zn no3 2 6h2o cu no3 6h2o ni no3 2 6h2o respectively in double distilled water the stock solutions were prepared with a concentration of 1000 mg l the working solutions of various concentration were prepared by s dilution method the ph of the working solution was adjusted by 0 1 m hno3 and 0 1 m naoh using a pre calibrated digital ph meter all the chemicals used here are of laboratory reagent grade and procured from sigma aldrich pvt ltd 2 1 adsorbent preparation a novel adsorbent as well as the solid phase of the semifluidized bed were synthesized from biochar and sodium alginate biopolymer detailed synthesis method was discussed in our earlier publications 7 27 briefly sugarcane bagasse which is agricultural waste biomass was collected from the local market it was rinsed with clean water and dried in open sunlight followed by overnight oven drying the proximate and ultimate analysis of the dried sugarcane bagasse found that the precursor has fixed carbon 17 68 45 volatile matter 1 1 moisture and 1 32 ash and total carbon 84 dried biomass was crushed into small pieces and pyrolysis was undergone in a muffle furnace at 500 c for 2 h in the n2 flow rate of 1 ml min an alginate biochar solution was prepared by dissolving 4 1 wt and drop casting was done in chilled 3 cacl2 solution to get the beads the beads were kept overnight to be hardened washed with distilled water thoroughly to remove excess ca2 ions na alginate used for the beads sysnthesis is commercial grade and procured from loba cheme pvt ltd and cacl2 2h2o purchased from sigma aldrich pvt ltd 2 2 semifluidized bed adsorption column operation a novel semifluidized bed adsorption column has been used here to evaluate its performance for the removal of zn2 cu2 ni2 individually from its aqueous solution in a closed circuit mode the experimental setup is a perspex tube having an inner diameter of 5 cm and a height of 25 cm a gas liquid distributor has been placed at the bottom of the column and a top restraint is there to restrict the solid phase at a certain fluid velocity to create a packed zone across the top restraint a weighted amount of hybrid adsorbent beads was loaded in the column to obtain a certain bed height in this investigation bed heights were taken 5 10 and 15 cm respectively the feed flow rate was controlled by a single phase mono block centrifugal pump at a variable flow rate 2 6 lpm by a pre calibrated rotameter a constant airflow rate was maintained at 0 5 lpm from an air pump feed concentration for both the metal ions was varied from 10 30 mg l a sampling point is there in the setup to collect the effluent sample after a specific time interval residual concentration for all the metal ions was measured by aas all the experiments were conducted at room temperature with an error between 5 6 the actual view of experimental setup under operation has been given in fig 1 the range of experiments are given in table 1 three different heavy metals zinc zn2 copper cu2 and nickel ni2 were chosen simultaneously for every set of experiment a predetermined solution concentration was prepared and ph was adjusted the column was filled with fresh adsorbent and checked whether any kind of leakage with distilled water is present or not after each set for the run the column was washed thoroughly with deionized water for 2 3 h to ensure the removal of any trace of metal from the previous experiments the system was operated at room temperature and ph was maintained at the optimum value obtained from the batch study there are few assumptions which have been taken care of for the experimental investigation the assumptions are 30 31 the bed materials or the adsorbents are uniform in size the wall effect on bed performance has been neglected and column to particle diameter assumed constant 25 the radial concentration gradient has been assumed to negligible adsorption rate is determined from the linear driving force model based on batch kinetics data the system equilibrium is determined by the langmuir model dispersion of adsorbate in the solid phase has not been accounted the distribution of solid adsorbent is uniform in the fluidized zone the liquid phase is described by the axial dispersion model each section will behave like individual pfdr reactors in series a packed section followed by the fluidized section 28 29 the adsorption capacity of the bed has been calculated from the following equation 23 1 q t o t a l q 1000 t 0 t t t o t a l c a d d t here q t o t a l is the total amount of dye adsorbed throughout the operation q is the feed flow rate l min c a d amount of dye adsorbed on the adsorbent surface mg 2 3 process optimization by rsm rsm is a composition of several statistical processes and analytical methods this kind of statistical or numerical technique is generally beneficial for the demographic analysis modelling and optimization of the process variables the primary objective of an optimization technique mainly illustrates the regression model on this basis and accordingly optimises the resultant variable also referred to as response the responses are ruled or governed by several input variables that are independent by nature several experimental runs were performed by varying the input data the rsm technique supports cost reduction or minimization of the cost of high rated analysis cfd analysis finite element process and noise analysis include some of the prime examples of such category of expensive studies one of the most standard methods of rsm technology or technique is central composite design ccd which caters the proper estimation or calculation of second degree polynomial 32 this kind of second degree polynomial helps in relating the independent as well as the dependent variables accordingly it also provides the information of interaction between the variables based on dependent parameters 33 in general the ccd methodology is mainly composed of 2n factorial run or set of experiments conducted which is generally associated with 2n axial set of runs and accordingly several centres run nc are used to measure the experimental errors the design of experiments mainly comprises of 2n factorial designs containing 1 notation codes further consisting of 2n axial points a 0 0 0 0 a 0 0 0 0 a 0 and nc centre points 0 0 0 0 34 in this case n counts to be the number of process variables that are controllable in nature a equals to nf 1 4 and nf is the total number of points utilized in factorial position 2n some of the selected variables that are independent by nature which are used in the experiments the experimental coding for the group of selected independent variables were calculated according to the following eq 2 2 x i x i x i δ x i where xi is the ith dimensionless independent variable xi is the uncoded value of an ith independent variable xi is the centre point uncoded value of the ith independent variable δxi states the step change value 4 it is being observed that the variables of independence in any experiment are generally monitored by the number of experiments performed in an error free manner the continuous nature of the independent variables involved in experimental design helps in optimizing the response variables z it is always better to develop a correlation approximation between response surfaces and several variables of independence factor 5 several experimental runs or repetitions were performed to minimize the error and impact of uncontrollable parameters accordingly an empirical model was developed with the assistance of the responses which forms a correlation with the experimental variables bearing a second degree polynomial eq 3 3 y β 0 i 1 n β i x i i 1 n β i i x i i 2 i 1 n j i 1 n β i j x i x j ε where y is denoted as the predicted response β0 is coefficient of constant βi is the coefficient of linearity βii is noted as the quadratic coefficient βij is the coefficient of interaction n counts to be the total number of optimized and observed factors xi xj are coded variable values for heavy metal removal process from wastewater ε denotes the error function in the present study there is the existence of three independent variables which gives a statistical analysis and design of experiments accordingly it depends on the following independent variable parameters like bed height x1 cm heavy metal concentration x2 mg l and liquid flow rate x3 lpm based on experimental design percentage removal is considered to be the dependent parameter where all the independent varies with some minimum to maximum ranges and level factorials 4 z f x1 x2 x3 xn where z is the response of the system or the dependent variable here z resembles with removal of heavy metal ions whereas x denotes several independent variable parameters or factors 5 n 2n 2n nc 23 2 3 6 20 eq 4 shows eight factorial points six axial points and six number of replicates which are needed to design a ccd when there are three independent variables a conceptual view is given in fig 2 in this entire experimental study and analysis model fitting and statistical analysis were done by anova analysis of variance the anova technique helps in observation and study of graphical analysis of several experimental data showing a clear correlation between the dependent and independent variables regression analysis was done with the help and assistance of several statistical software kits like design expert stay ease etc here to draw contour plot or plotting of response surfaces at best optimized condition above mentioned software packages were used the desired accuracy of the polynomial model was found out with the coefficient of r2 values the statistical process significance was determined and f test having a particular probability value or p value giving its confidence interval of approximately 95 in table 2 the relationship between the coded variables and actual variables are tabulated detail range of experimental scope has been given in tables 3 and 4 experimental runs for central composite design with factor values in coded form and respective responses are given 2 4 real time dynamic mass transfer model development based on solid liquid mass balance the dynamic model of any system depicts the behaviour of the process mathematically to develop any novel system for large scale application its dynamic behaviour must be studied therefore in this study a real time dynamic model has been developed based on the solid liquid mass balance of the system the performance curve from the model and the experiments were compared to justify the model accuracy performance curves are the illustrations of saturation of a given amount of adsorbent or catalyst loaded in the reactor column with a certain amount of adsorbate passes through the bed at a fixed flow rate at a constant temperature though the performance curves are empirical and depend upon all the process parameters that have some persistence a whether the adsorbent is efficient for the successful separation of target solute b to find out the saturation point based on some criteria the dynamic model for the system can be developed based on mass balance for the adsorbate over a fixed volume of adsorbent which is continuously percolated by the adsorbate containing liquid in this investigation the system is the recycling type to ensure maximum utilization of the adsorbent the prime hypothesis followed during the model development are the system is assumed to be isothermal throughout the operation the heat of adsorption is also neglected the feed flow rate or the liquid velocity for a particular set of the experiment will remain constant the velocity profile of the liquid as a dispersed plug flow for the fluidized bed regime dispersion is more compared to the packed zone hence the reactor is termed as pfdr plug flow dispersion reactor having different dispersion coefficient for the different section there is no chemical reaction occurs between the adsorbate and the adsorbent eddy mixing is neglected bed porosity is uniform and constant for both the section respectively under the above conditions the solute or the adsorbate mass conservation of the process can be written as per the following convective diffusion equation 6 d z 2 c z 2 u c z c t 1 ε ε c a t where d z is the axial dispersion coefficient this value has been found different for a different section fluidized has a higher dispersion and the packed bed has very low dispersion value t is operation time ε is the bed porosity and c a is the adsorbate concentration on adsorbate u is superficial liquid velocity eq 5 can be rewritten as 7 d z ε 2 c z 2 u ε c z ε c t ρ a 1 ε q t where ρ a is the density of the adsorbent material and q defined previously is the actual concentration of adsorbate in the adsorbent as a matter of fact ρ a 1 ε is the density of the adsorbent bed symbolized simply by ρ thus eq 7 becomes 8 d z ε 2 c z 2 u ε c z ε c t ρ a q t since diffusion is generally a slow process compared to the bulk flow present in fixed bed adsorption systems the first term in eq 7 can be neglected giving 9 u ε c z ε c t ρ a q t 0 the initial and boundary conditions associated with eq 8 are 10 t 0 c c 0 0 z hsf 11 t 0 c c f z 0 and c z 0 z hsf where hsf is the height of the semifluidized bed and c f is the concentration of adsorbate in the liquid in the bed feed stream the total bed height can be expressed as 12 h s f h p h f where h p and h f are the height of the packed and fluidized section respectively this height can be obtained from experimental data at different operating conditions the adsorption rate of the adsorbate in eq 8 has been simplified the adsorption rate has been expressed in the form of overall liquid phase mass transfer coefficient k l as follows 13 ρ a q t ε k l a c c by substituting eq 13 in eq 8 we obtain 14 d z ε 2 c z 2 u ε c z ε c t ε k l a c c eq 13 is a second order partial differential equation which can be solved numerically with the given initial and boundary condition to obtain the concentration profile eq 14 will be solved individually for both the packed and fluidized sections the final boundary condition for the fluidized section will be the same as the initial boundary condition for the packed section eq 10 2 5 solution for the developed model the partial differential equation eq 14 was solved numerically using matlab 2019 simulation tool with pdpe function the unknown parameters like axial dispersion coefficient d z for both packed and fluidized section and mass transfer coefficient k l were obtained from the optimization route initially the values were assumed and it was changed until the calculated value of concentration is much closer to the experimental values and the error was minimum between the experimental and model predicted values 3 results and discussion the synthesized adsorbent exhibited excellent removal efficiency for various heavy metals for which batch adsorption results were reported in our earlier publications 7 8 therefore the same adsorbent was used as bed materials during the sfbr system operation to analyse column performance under various operating conditions the material characterization are discussed here in brief the composite adsorbent has fixed carbon of 29 78 and total carbon 77 27 the bet analysis exhibit that the material has a specific surface area of 200 14 m2 g bulk density 0 39 g cm3 average pore volume is 0 24 cm g3 and average pore diameter is 1 41 nm the ft ir analysis shows that it has some distinct weak peak at 3446 cm 1 indicates the presence of the nh stretching group the medium peak from 2854 2925 cm 1 for ch and nh group and some week peaks from 996 1631 cm 1 are for cc and c h groups in the case of sb biochar and its composite many small peaks are observed from 500 to 759 cm 1 represent the presence of cc bending the ft ir signal data of raw and spent adsorbent has been represented in fig 3 a the surface morphology of the adsorbent has been determined by fesem and eds the raw adsorbent is found highly porous in nature fig 3b the spent adsorbent after the interaction of metalions the surface morphology change is very significant the surface structure has changed from porous to nonporous and some lump has been observed after metal ion adsorption fig 3c e the eds is a quantitive analysis which confirms the presence of metal ions on the adsorbent surface 3 1 effect of operating parameters on bed efficiency 3 1 1 effect of adsorbent bed depth adsorbent bed depth or initial adsorbent bed height is one of the major parameters for the design and application of adsorption based separation process therefore the performance of such a novel reactor highly depends on the bed depth of adsorbent or amount of adsorbent used height of initial bed height has several significances at high adsorbent bed height the solute molecules got more active available adsorbent sites level of competition reduces between molecules and the system reaches equilibrium faster moreover high adsorbent increases the peclet no pe of the system 35 peclet no pe is defined as the ratio of axial convection rate to the axial dispersion rate at higher adsorbent bed depth the packed bed formation is higher and the for packed bed dispersion coefficient is less and the convection rate is high hence the peclet no of system increases and the percentage removal also increases however the experimental data when plotted shows that the characteristic of all the adsorbent adsorbate system is the same the only difference in the value of outlet concentration at a different time due to difference in adsorbate adsorbent interaction and mass transfer coefficient the outlet concentration profile and percentage removal of various heavy metal at bed depth of 5 10 15 cm have been given in fig 4 a c at the initial bed height of 5 cm and initial metal ion concentration of 20 mg l zn2 has removal efficiency of 64 36 cu2 has 74 45 ni2 has 77 9 when bed height increased from 5 to 15 cm percentage removal increased to 77 5 82 75 and 81 75 for zn2 cu2 and ni2 respectively from the performance analysis it is anticipated that cu2 has a maximum mass transfer coefficient and which got later confirmation from the model validations similar behavious of the system was also found for mb dye removal in sfbr 30 and treatment of groundwater in aclosed lood fixed bed system 36 3 1 2 effect of initial solute concentration initial solute concentration has a very strong effect on the determination of the performance of a novel adsorption based separation technique initial solute concentration decides the adsorption capacity of the system this is very much significant for scaling up the system therefore in this study the initial concentration range was chosen based on the reported data of various industries releasing such heavy metals moreover in a lab scale reactor the metal concentration should be chosen carefully to avoid any difficulties in contaminated water disposal however in this investigation the initial metal concentration was 10 20 and 30 mg l for all the metal ions the total solution used was 15 l in a closed circuit mode to keep the bed depth at 10 cm and feed flow rate at 2 lpm throughout the operation low concentration of zn2 having 10 20 mg l reached equilibrium around 120 min but for high concentration having 30 mg l took 240 300 min to reach equilibrium for 10 mg l initial concentration maximum percentage removal was 82 and for 20 and 30 mg l percentage removal reduced to 72 36 and 69 83 for cu2 metal the equilibrium time is comparatively faster for all the concentration the initial concentration of 10 mg l having equilibrium time of 60 min and for 20 and 30 mg l 360 min were required to reach equilibrium it has been observed that ni2 needs more time to reach equilibrium even at the lowest concentration around 180 min was required when initial concentration was 10 mg l and more than 360 min was required for the concentration of 20 and 30 mg l in these experiments it was also found that percentage removal was reduced from 72 to 70 43 over the specified concentration range the concentration profile has been presented in fig 5 a c at different initial solute concentration for different heavy metals the similar trend also found for a semifluidized bed system for mb dye removal and heavy metalcontaing wastewater 30 37 at low concentration the competition between the solute molecules are less for the adsorption site and therefore the concentration depletion is higher when the initial concentration is higher the competition is higher as the active sites are fixed or limited however the amount of adsorbed solute is higher due to the higher driving force and lesser resistance offered by the boundary layer still the percentage of removal is less in this case 3 1 3 effect of feed flow rate the feed flow rate of a system is another important parameter for obtaining the optimum condition the feed flow rate decides the hydraulic retention time of solute inside the reactor and decides the mass transfer coefficient indirectly at low feed flow the solute molecules get more time to interact with the adsorbent surface and overcome the mass transfer resistance the phenomenon can be explained from biot no of the system biot no bi of the system is defined as film diffusion to intraparticle diffusion 35 at high feed flow rate film diffusion will increase but intraparticle will be less as a result intraparticle diffusion will be rate controlling and overall mass transfer will reduce significantly 30 therefore a low flow rate results in faster equilibrium therefore a low flow rate is recommended for such a reactor but for semifluidized bed system a certain velocity must be maintained to form the top packed section though the high flow rate increases the formation of packed bed due to the fast movement of the solute molecule through the bed prohibit the whole system attains a higher removal efficiency the performance curves for the individual system at different feed flow rates are represented in fig 6 a c the experimental data were plotted as outlet concentration against operation time and percentage removal against time at flow rate of 2 lpm percentage removals were 75 78 4 and 72 6 for zn2 cu2 and ni2 respectively at high flow rate of 6 lpm percentage removal drop down to 62 5 52 62 3 respectively 3 2 optimization of the system 3 2 1 anova results and analysis central composite design ccd analysis was performed over three independent process parameters and percentage removal response of various heavy metals from synthetic wastewater in a novel semifluidized bed reactor system the anova results are presented in table 5 the model equations obtained based on the analysis of variance are presented in eqs 15 17 for zn2 cu2 and ni2 respectively the percentage removal of zn2 in terms of coded variables 15 y 71 65 5 65 x 1

1 2 0 86 x 2 2 1 03 x 3 2 the fit summary results indicate that the quadratic model is the best fitting for all the heavy metals that got removed in the sfbr the experimental data analysed in ccd presented in table 5 explain the statistical significance of individual term as well as the interacting effect from the analysis it has been found that each term has significant fisher s f value and low probability values 0 005 hence it is clear that the model for all the three heavy metals is significant p value of the model found 0 001 and ci confidence interval of 99 the p values for lack of fit are 0 288 0 242 and 0 363 for zn2 cu2 and ni2 respectively which are insignificant moreover the anova results predict that the linear coefficient x 1 x 2 and x 3 are significant for all three heavy metals the interaction effect x 1 x 2 x 2 x 3 x 1 x 3 and quadratic effects x 1 2 x 2 2 x 3 2 are not significant for all the cases for example x 1 x 2 and x 2 2 are significant for zn2 x 1 x 3 and x 2 2 are significant for cu2 removal and x 1 x 2 and x 1 2 are significant for ni2 removal however all the quadratic models were found to yield high values of r 2 0 91 0 093 and adjusted r 2 0 88 0 91 which indicated a high correlation between the experimental and model predicted values of metal removal in sfbr thus good agreements demonstrate that all the developed model equations can predict the experimental results 3 2 2 model accuracy study the normal probability plot of residuals and experimental vs predicted plots for zn2 cu2 and ni2 are presented in figs 6a b 7 a b and 8 a b the graphical representation postulate that the residuals follow a satisfactory straight line and have a normal distribution these results confirm the adequacy and validity of the predicted models the deviation between the actual response percentage removal of heavy metals and model prediction will be less the effect of noise is also very small in the developed model 3 2 3 studies on operating parameters interaction and process optimization the interacting effect of the operating parameters has been investigated that contributes to the removal efficiency of the semifluidized bed reactor for this investigation two parameters were varied keeping another constant at centre point or zero levels the contour plot and 3d plot at optimum condition have been presented here in figs 7c d 8 c d and 9 c d for zn2 cu2 and ni2 respectively the green zone in the plot indicates the adverse effect of the parameter where efficiency of the process is minimum and the red zone signifies the condition of the parameter where maximum removal of the process is achieved from the 3d surface analysis and the experimental data it is evident that among all the parameters the initial bed height or the adsorbent bed depth x 1 is the most effective parameter for the performance of the system the percentage removal of metal ions increases significantly with the increase in adsorbent bed depth from 5 to 15 cm at a constant feed flow rate and a particular initial solute concentration it is reasonable to obtain an increased removal efficiency by increasing adsorbent as the metal binding sites and active functional groups are increased however the increment of adsorbent bed depth is very high and may impact negatively 38 at an optimum adsorbent dose the intercellular distance is greater and facilitates the adsorption process 39 by optimizing the electrostatic force between the solute and sorbet cells at a bed depth of 15 cm the bed efficiency reaches to 77 5 82 75 and 81 75 for zn2 cu2 and ni2 respectively at 20 mg l initial solute concentration and bed efficiency of 64 36 74 45 and 77 9 at bed depth of 5 cm respectively the metal ion dose or solute concentration plays a negative role in the performance evaluation of the semifluidized bed system for removal of zn2 cu2 and ni2 as the solute concentration increases the competition between them increases and the total available binding site reduces as a result the overall performance or percentage removal reduces however at high solute concentration the driving force between the liquid solid increases due to high competition and accordingly many solute molecules remain unabsorbed from table 5 it is also evident that the effect of solute concentration is very effective with the other two parameters individually but the combined effect is not much significant except zn2 and ni2 however in this investigation the initial metal concentration was 10 20 and 30 mg l for all the metal ions the total solution used was 15 l in a closed circuit mode keeping the bed depth at 10 cm and feed flow rate at 2 lpm percentage removal reduced from 86 to 70 for zn2 88 to 76 for cu2 and 78 to 72 for ni2 the results indicate that solute concentration has a strong effect on zn2 and cu2 adsorption than ni2 apart from these two variables another parameter that very significantly determines the sfbr performance is the feed flow rate the feed flow rate in another word can be described as the retention time of the solute in the system or bed at low feed flow rate the solute retention time will be more and the interaction between the solid liquid will be more and more mass transfer will occur from bulk phase to surface of the adsorbent therefore at the high flow rate bed efficiency reduces percentage removal reduced from 71 to 64 for zn2 77 to 51 for cu2 and 72 to 62 35 for ni2 this data depicts that the significant effect of flow rate over concentration cu2 has most significantly affected this variable to predict the optimum condition the variables were set in the range and the percentage removal which is the response in this study has been set to maximize different conditions were suggested by the software based on the data analysis and predicted output the condition at which the desirability reaches near unity was chosen as the optimum operating condition to optimize the process the rsm followes few steps such as i selection of independent variables ii choice of the experimental design based on selected experimentl matrix iii mathematic statistical treatment of the experimental data through a polynomial function fitting iv evaluation of the polynomial model v performaing a displacement in direction to the optimal region and vi obtain the optimum values for each studied parameter later the surface generate a model liner or quadratic which used to indicate the direction at which the original design must be displaced to obtain the optimal condition 40 the optimum conditions and the predicted and experimental values of response have been tabulated in table 6 3 3 comparision of sfbr results with individual fixed and fluidized bed system some literature based investigation has been done in this study to find out the superior performance of a semifluidized bed adsorption column over normal packed bed fixed bed and fluidized bed adsorption column at very similar experimental conditions the performance has been analysed based on operation time the total volume of effluent treated initial concentration and percentage removal it has been found that most of the packed bed reactors required very long operational time and less amount of water treated further it was found that at 50 of the total operation time the bed efficiency reaches below 50 for packed bed as shown in table 7 therefore 500 ml 1 l of solution have over 80 removal efficiency which is very low in comparison with actalscenario on the other hand very few reported studied were found for the fluidized bed adsorption column with very high operation time and low bed efficiency some examples are provided in table 7 however the studies reported that in fluidized bed percent removal is less though the operation time is also high in contrast to the individual system the present system which is a combination of both fixed and fluidized bed achieved around 80 removal for 15 l of effluent within 240 360 min few reported results have been represented in table 7 3 4 dynamic model validation over the last few years several numbers of mathematical techniques have been developed to simulate the system in many studies the authors have fitted the experimental data in some well established model like thomas model 44 adams bohart y n model 45 and calculate the model parameters but these models have some limitations and assumptions beyond that the models cannot be applied therefore it is better to develop a model based on the basic principle or first principle method in this study the soluble metal removal process is modelled based on advection and axial dispersion followed by mass transfer from liquid to the surface of the adsorbent the degree of axial mixing or the axial dispersion coefficient for both the section individually evaluated as d a x f and d a x p the mass transfer coefficient k f is considered the same for both the sections as it is the property of the solute ions and the surface of the adsorbent in the model these two parameters are evaluated rest are known therefore some initial values from some reported studies have been assumed and the eq 13 got solved if the calculated concentration over the time range is not close with the experimental data new values for the axial dispersion and mass transfer coefficient were changed by trial and error basis once the concentration values of calculated and experimental techniques were very close the mass transfer coefficient and dispersion coefficient were noted an error function test also adopted in term of χ 2 test from eq 18 to estimate the error between the calculated values from the model and the experimental values the enuation inserted in the code and directly give the value of errors 18 χ 2 q e e x p q e c a l 2 q e c a l the model fitted well in line with the experimental for most of the cases with an error 5 it has been observed that the mass transfer coefficient value k f was changed with the operating parameters like initial metal ion concentration adsorbent bed depth and feed flow rate example of the model fitted vs experimental data for each metal ion at a particular parameter are represented in figs 10 12 all the model predicted data are tabulated in table 8 hence from the elaborate analysis it can be anticipated that the developed model for the novel system is very accurate with a high correlation coefficient from the developed model the scale up of the system can be possible in future research work table 8 4 conclusion from a concise and in depth study it has been found that the novel semifluidized bed adsorption column has been performed very efficiently for the removal of different divalent heavy metal ions simultaneously the low cost and lightweight hybrid adsorbent make the operation very easy in terms of low pumping cost and got fluidized at very low velocity moreover the material has a very high affinity for the metal ions due to the presence of various functional groups and porous structure the adsorbent material has specific surfacearea 200 14 m2 g average pore diameter of 1 41 nm and average pore volume 0 24 cm g3 which indicate that the adsorbent can capture ion molecules from the aqueous solution various operating variables and their effect on bed performance have been analysed in details and outlined it is being observed that how significantly they are influencing the removal efficiency both experimentally and statistically the interactive effect of the operating parameters was also investigated by response surface methodology quadratic equation for the system has been developed which predicts the experimental results very well with a high correlation coefficient maximum efficiency by the sfbr was achieved as 2 81 lpm flow rate 14 05 mg l metal concentration and 12 97 cm of adsorbent bed depth maximum percent removal for zn2 was 87 86 cu2 was 88 89 and ni2 was 84 31 a real time dynamic model for the novel system was developed by assuming the system as a pfdr based on solute phase mass balance various mass transfer parameters for the system was also obtained from the developed model and accordingly validated with the experimental data the model data which was well in line with the experimental data along with an error in 5 6 in most of the cases for a few points the error is more due to some instability in the three phase experiment nevertheless the novel system exhibited satisfactorily for heavy metals removal from industrial wastewater based on this present investigation further studies can be done for the scaling up of such novel system and can be implemented as large scale operation in future declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper 
13908,in this investigation an attempt has been made to evaluate the performance of a novel semifluidized bed adsorption column for the removal of divalent heavy metal ions from synthetic wastewater low cost low density adsorbent has been synthesized from sugarcane bagasse based biochar and na alginate the biochar has specific surface area of 391 42 m2 g and it s composite has 200 14 m2 g respectively major operating parameters for the system were adsorbent bed height initial solute concentration and feed flow rate the optimum condition of the process for maximum percentage removal of metal ions was analysed by response surface methodology technique the satisfactory values of correlation coefficients ensure the suitability of the model from process optimization the optimum conditions for zn2 cu2 and ni2 were of same values having initial adsorbent bed height 12 97 cm initial solute concentration 14 05 mg l and feed flow rate of 2 81 lpm liter per minute and maximum percentage removal were found to be 87 56 88 89 and 84 31 respectively a real time dynamic mass transfer model based on solid liquid mass balance has also been developed and validated with all the experimental data solid liquid interphase mass transfer coefficient along with the axial dispersion coefficient for individually packed and a fluidized section of bed was also estimated from the developed model the axial dispersion coefficient was calculated as 5 1 0 3 10 11 m2 s for packed section and 4 8 0 3 10 6 m2 s for fluidized section mass transfer coefficient for zn2 cu2 and ni2 were

great threat over the last decades these heavy metals laden wastewater are generally resulting from rapid industrialization and urbanization 1 according to the united states environmental protection agency usepa 129 organic and inorganic chemical elements are listed as priority pollutants 2 in this list zinc copper nickel are also found these heavy metals are non biodegradable carcinogenic in nature and tend to accumulate in living organisms therefore treatment of such heavy metal containing wastewater is a matter of great concern in recent days various technologies have already been used and some are under research to find a sustainable one some of the traditional technologies which are in practice over the years are ion exchange 3 chemical precipitation 4 coagulation filtration membrane etc 5 however these conventional methods face a lot of drawbacks such as high operational cost difficulties in operation a lot of chemical by products discharge etc 6 in recent years adsorption based separation process has become most popular among the researchers due to many advantages over the other technologies 1 7 8 however most of the reported adsorption based wastewater treatment methods are still in the batch scale for example some of the low cost bio adsorbents which are successfully used are hardwood char 9 corn straw char 10 empty fruit branch magnetic biochar 11 dairy manure char 12 rice husk cellulosic materials fly ash sawdust pine bark tea industry waste bagasse cone biomass and many more for removal of zn2 cu2 and ni2 13 from the aqueous solution therefore it is a challenging task to develop the adsorption based separation process in a continuous system which is applicable in a real industrial situation in this research direction there are few reported results on established liquid solid contacting equipment like fixed bed reactor and fluidized bed reactors 14 16 in a very small lab scale despite having many advantages fluidized bed adsorption column was used for removal of pb2 cd2 cu2 and zn2 by biochar and other low cost adsorbents 17 20 those reported results were experimental as well as model based analysis studies on packed bed adsorption column are comparatively higher packed bed adsorption column has been studied for removal of various heavy metals like pb2 cr 4 cd2 21 25 and readers are encouraged to go through review articles by afroze and sen 1 where up to date compilation was made on packed bed adsorption column and its applications in the removal of aqueous phase inorganics organics removal by adsorption from the extensive literature review it is evident that in recent years studies on the packed or fixed bed column is more than the fluidized bed on the other hand packed bed and fluidized bed both have some specific drawbacks like a high pressure drop less utilization of adsorbent material back mixing adsorbent washout and low conversion 26 29 therefore there is some research gap still to be addressed to accomplish some extensive work to overcome such drawbacks and increase the separation efficiency hence this present study has been undertaken to develop a novel semifluidized bed reactor sfbr which is a fixed bed followed by a fluidized bed in the same reacting column and tested its effectiveness in the removal of heavy metal ions from wastewater in continuous mode of operation though the concept of semifluidization is not new still its application in industrial as well as lab based system is very minimal this type of novel reactor is reported by some researchers describing its advantages and can overcome some drawbacks of individual reactors partially moreover the adsorbent used as bed material and fluidizing materials in this investigation is immobilized biochar in ca alginate biopolymer this novel adsorbent prevents the particle washout from the system during continuous operation and hence reduces the extra cost for liquid solid separation and makes the process easier to implement therefore the overall aims to analyse the performance of a novel semifluidized bed column for heavy metals removal from wastewater as per our knowledge no such studies have been reported to date along with the experimental analysis the optimum conditions for maximizing the percentage removal was also investigated a real time dynamic mathematical mass transfer model has been developed based on solid liquid mass balance and accordingly validated with the experimental data for the scale up of such novel process for future applications in wastewater treatment 2 materials and method the synthetic wastewater solution of zn2 cu2 ni2 were prepared by dissolving a calculated amount of zn no3 2 6h2o cu no3 6h2o ni no3 2 6h2o respectively in double distilled water the stock solutions were prepared with a concentration of 1000 mg l the working solutions of various concentration were prepared by s dilution method the ph of the working solution was adjusted by 0 1 m hno3 and 0 1 m naoh using a pre calibrated digital ph meter all the chemicals used here are of laboratory reagent grade and procured from sigma aldrich pvt ltd 2 1 adsorbent preparation a novel adsorbent as well as the solid phase of the semifluidized bed were synthesized from biochar and sodium alginate biopolymer detailed synthesis method was discussed in our earlier publications 7 27 briefly sugarcane bagasse which is agricultural waste biomass was collected from the local market it was rinsed with clean water and dried in open sunlight followed by overnight oven drying the proximate and ultimate analysis of the dried sugarcane bagasse found that the precursor has fixed carbon 17 68 45 volatile matter 1 1 moisture and 1 32 ash and total carbon 84 dried biomass was crushed into small pieces and pyrolysis was undergone in a muffle furnace at 500 c for 2 h in the n2 flow rate of 1 ml min an alginate biochar solution was prepared by dissolving 4 1 wt and drop casting was done in chilled 3 cacl2 solution to get the beads the beads were kept overnight to be hardened washed with distilled water thoroughly to remove excess ca2 ions na alginate used for the beads sysnthesis is commercial grade and procured from loba cheme pvt ltd and cacl2 2h2o purchased from sigma aldrich pvt ltd 2 2 semifluidized bed adsorption column operation a novel semifluidized bed adsorption column has been used here to evaluate its performance for the removal of zn2 cu2 ni2 individually from its aqueous solution in a closed circuit mode the experimental setup is a perspex tube having an inner diameter of 5 cm and a height of 25 cm a gas liquid distributor has been placed at the bottom of the column and a top restraint is there to restrict the solid phase at a certain fluid velocity to create a packed zone across the top restraint a weighted amount of hybrid adsorbent beads was loaded in the column to obtain a certain bed height in this investigation bed heights were taken 5 10 and 15 cm respectively the feed flow rate was controlled by a single phase mono block centrifugal pump at a variable flow rate 2 6 lpm by a pre calibrated rotameter a constant airflow rate was maintained at 0 5 lpm from an air pump feed concentration for both the metal ions was varied from 10 30 mg l a sampling point is there in the setup to collect the effluent sample after a specific time interval residual concentration for all the metal ions was measured by aas all the experiments were conducted at room temperature with an error between 5 6 the actual view of experimental setup under operation has been given in fig 1 the range of experiments are given in table 1 three different heavy metals zinc zn2 copper cu2 and nickel ni2 were chosen simultaneously for every set of experiment a predetermined solution concentration was prepared and ph was adjusted the column was filled with fresh adsorbent and checked whether any kind of leakage with distilled water is present or not after each set for the run the column was washed thoroughly with deionized water for 2 3 h to ensure the removal of any trace of metal from the previous experiments the system was operated at room temperature and ph was maintained at the optimum value obtained from the batch study there are few assumptions which have been taken care of for the experimental investigation the assumptions are 30 31 the bed materials or the adsorbents are uniform in size the wall effect on bed performance has been neglected and column to particle diameter assumed constant 25 the radial concentration gradient has been assumed to negligible adsorption rate is determined from the linear driving force model based on batch kinetics data the system equilibrium is determined by the langmuir model dispersion of adsorbate in the solid phase has not been accounted the distribution of solid adsorbent is uniform in the fluidized zone the liquid phase is described by the axial dispersion model each section will behave like individual pfdr reactors in series a packed section followed by the fluidized section 28 29 the adsorption capacity of the bed has been calculated from the following equation 23 1 q t o t a l q 1000 t 0 t t t o t a l c a d d t here q t o t a l is the total amount of dye adsorbed throughout the operation q is the feed flow rate l min c a d amount of dye adsorbed on the adsorbent surface mg 2 3 process optimization by rsm rsm is a composition of several statistical processes and analytical methods this kind of statistical or numerical technique is generally beneficial for the demographic analysis modelling and optimization of the process variables the primary objective of an optimization technique mainly illustrates the regression model on this basis and accordingly optimises the resultant variable also referred to as response the responses are ruled or governed by several input variables that are independent by nature several experimental runs were performed by varying the input data the rsm technique supports cost reduction or minimization of the cost of high rated analysis cfd analysis finite element process and noise analysis include some of the prime examples of such category of expensive studies one of the most standard methods of rsm technology or technique is central composite design ccd which caters the proper estimation or calculation of second degree polynomial 32 this kind of second degree polynomial helps in relating the independent as well as the dependent variables accordingly it also provides the information of interaction between the variables based on dependent parameters 33 in general the ccd methodology is mainly composed of 2n factorial run or set of experiments conducted which is generally associated with 2n axial set of runs and accordingly several centres run nc are used to measure the experimental errors the design of experiments mainly comprises of 2n factorial designs containing 1 notation codes further consisting of 2n axial points a 0 0 0 0 a 0 0 0 0 a 0 and nc centre points 0 0 0 0 34 in this case n counts to be the number of process variables that are controllable in nature a equals to nf 1 4 and nf is the total number of points utilized in factorial position 2n some of the selected variables that are independent by nature which are used in the experiments the experimental coding for the group of selected independent variables were calculated according to the following eq 2 2 x i x i x i δ x i where xi is the ith dimensionless independent variable xi is the uncoded value of an ith independent variable xi is the centre point uncoded value of the ith independent variable δxi states the step change value 4 it is being observed that the variables of independence in any experiment are generally monitored by the number of experiments performed in an error free manner the continuous nature of the independent variables involved in experimental design helps in optimizing the response variables z it is always better to develop a correlation approximation between response surfaces and several variables of independence factor 5 several experimental runs or repetitions were performed to minimize the error and impact of uncontrollable parameters accordingly an empirical model was developed with the assistance of the responses which forms a correlation with the experimental variables bearing a second degree polynomial eq 3 3 y β 0 i 1 n β i x i i 1 n β i i x i i 2 i 1 n j i 1 n β i j x i x j ε where y is denoted as the predicted response β0 is coefficient of constant βi is the coefficient of linearity βii is noted as the quadratic coefficient βij is the coefficient of interaction n counts to be the total number of optimized and observed factors xi xj are coded variable values for heavy metal removal process from wastewater ε denotes the error function in the present study there is the existence of three independent variables which gives a statistical analysis and design of experiments accordingly it depends on the following independent variable parameters like bed height x1 cm heavy metal concentration x2 mg l and liquid flow rate x3 lpm based on experimental design percentage removal is considered to be the dependent parameter where all the independent varies with some minimum to maximum ranges and level factorials 4 z f x1 x2 x3 xn where z is the response of the system or the dependent variable here z resembles with removal of heavy metal ions whereas x denotes several independent variable parameters or factors 5 n 2n 2n nc 23 2 3 6 20 eq 4 shows eight factorial points six axial points and six number of replicates which are needed to design a ccd when there are three independent variables a conceptual view is given in fig 2 in this entire experimental study and analysis model fitting and statistical analysis were done by anova analysis of variance the anova technique helps in observation and study of graphical analysis of several experimental data showing a clear correlation between the dependent and independent variables regression analysis was done with the help and assistance of several statistical software kits like design expert stay ease etc here to draw contour plot or plotting of response surfaces at best optimized condition above mentioned software packages were used the desired accuracy of the polynomial model was found out with the coefficient of r2 values the statistical process significance was determined and f test having a particular probability value or p value giving its confidence interval of approximately 95 in table 2 the relationship between the coded variables and actual variables are tabulated detail range of experimental scope has been given in tables 3 and 4 experimental runs for central composite design with factor values in coded form and respective responses are given 2 4 real time dynamic mass transfer model development based on solid liquid mass balance the dynamic model of any system depicts the behaviour of the process mathematically to develop any novel system for large scale application its dynamic behaviour must be studied therefore in this study a real time dynamic model has been developed based on the solid liquid mass balance of the system the performance curve from the model and the experiments were compared to justify the model accuracy performance curves are the illustrations of saturation of a given amount of adsorbent or catalyst loaded in the reactor column with a certain amount of adsorbate passes through the bed at a fixed flow rate at a constant temperature though the performance curves are empirical and depend upon all the process parameters that have some persistence a whether the adsorbent is efficient for the successful separation of target solute b to find out the saturation point based on some criteria the dynamic model for the system can be developed based on mass balance for the adsorbate over a fixed volume of adsorbent which is continuously percolated by the adsorbate containing liquid in this investigation the system is the recycling type to ensure maximum utilization of the adsorbent the prime hypothesis followed during the model development are the system is assumed to be isothermal throughout the operation the heat of adsorption is also neglected the feed flow rate or the liquid velocity for a particular set of the experiment will remain constant the velocity profile of the liquid as a dispersed plug flow for the fluidized bed regime dispersion is more compared to the packed zone hence the reactor is termed as pfdr plug flow dispersion reactor having different dispersion coefficient for the different section there is no chemical reaction occurs between the adsorbate and the adsorbent eddy mixing is neglected bed porosity is uniform and constant for both the section respectively under the above conditions the solute or the adsorbate mass conservation of the process can be written as per the following convective diffusion equation 6 d z 2 c z 2 u c z c t 1 ε ε c a t where d z is the axial dispersion coefficient this value has been found different for a different section fluidized has a higher dispersion and the packed bed has very low dispersion value t is operation time ε is the bed porosity and c a is the adsorbate concentration on adsorbate u is superficial liquid velocity eq 5 can be rewritten as 7 d z ε 2 c z 2 u ε c z ε c t ρ a 1 ε q t where ρ a is the density of the adsorbent material and q defined previously is the actual concentration of adsorbate in the adsorbent as a matter of fact ρ a 1 ε is the density of the adsorbent bed symbolized simply by ρ thus eq 7 becomes 8 d z ε 2 c z 2 u ε c z ε c t ρ a q t since diffusion is generally a slow process compared to the bulk flow present in fixed bed adsorption systems the first term in eq 7 can be neglected giving 9 u ε c z ε c t ρ a q t 0 the initial and boundary conditions associated with eq 8 are 10 t 0 c c 0 0 z hsf 11 t 0 c c f z 0 and c z 0 z hsf where hsf is the height of the semifluidized bed and c f is the concentration of adsorbate in the liquid in the bed feed stream the total bed height can be expressed as 12 h s f h p h f where h p and h f are the height of the packed and fluidized section respectively this height can be obtained from experimental data at different operating conditions the adsorption rate of the adsorbate in eq 8 has been simplified the adsorption rate has been expressed in the form of overall liquid phase mass transfer coefficient k l as follows 13 ρ a q t ε k l a c c by substituting eq 13 in eq 8 we obtain 14 d z ε 2 c z 2 u ε c z ε c t ε k l a c c eq 13 is a second order partial differential equation which can be solved numerically with the given initial and boundary condition to obtain the concentration profile eq 14 will be solved individually for both the packed and fluidized sections the final boundary condition for the fluidized section will be the same as the initial boundary condition for the packed section eq 10 2 5 solution for the developed model the partial differential equation eq 14 was solved numerically using matlab 2019 simulation tool with pdpe function the unknown parameters like axial dispersion coefficient d z for both packed and fluidized section and mass transfer coefficient k l were obtained from the optimization route initially the values were assumed and it was changed until the calculated value of concentration is much closer to the experimental values and the error was minimum between the experimental and model predicted values 3 results and discussion the synthesized adsorbent exhibited excellent removal efficiency for various heavy metals for which batch adsorption results were reported in our earlier publications 7 8 therefore the same adsorbent was used as bed materials during the sfbr system operation to analyse column performance under various operating conditions the material characterization are discussed here in brief the composite adsorbent has fixed carbon of 29 78 and total carbon 77 27 the bet analysis exhibit that the material has a specific surface area of 200 14 m2 g bulk density 0 39 g cm3 average pore volume is 0 24 cm g3 and average pore diameter is 1 41 nm the ft ir analysis shows that it has some distinct weak peak at 3446 cm 1 indicates the presence of the nh stretching group the medium peak from 2854 2925 cm 1 for ch and nh group and some week peaks from 996 1631 cm 1 are for cc and c h groups in the case of sb biochar and its composite many small peaks are observed from 500 to 759 cm 1 represent the presence of cc bending the ft ir signal data of raw and spent adsorbent has been represented in fig 3 a the surface morphology of the adsorbent has been determined by fesem and eds the raw adsorbent is found highly porous in nature fig 3b the spent adsorbent after the interaction of metalions the surface morphology change is very significant the surface structure has changed from porous to nonporous and some lump has been observed after metal ion adsorption fig 3c e the eds is a quantitive analysis which confirms the presence of metal ions on the adsorbent surface 3 1 effect of operating parameters on bed efficiency 3 1 1 effect of adsorbent bed depth adsorbent bed depth or initial adsorbent bed height is one of the major parameters for the design and application of adsorption based separation process therefore the performance of such a novel reactor highly depends on the bed depth of adsorbent or amount of adsorbent used height of initial bed height has several significances at high adsorbent bed height the solute molecules got more active available adsorbent sites level of competition reduces between molecules and the system reaches equilibrium faster moreover high adsorbent increases the peclet no pe of the system 35 peclet no pe is defined as the ratio of axial convection rate to the axial dispersion rate at higher adsorbent bed depth the packed bed formation is higher and the for packed bed dispersion coefficient is less and the convection rate is high hence the peclet no of system increases and the percentage removal also increases however the experimental data when plotted shows that the characteristic of all the adsorbent adsorbate system is the same the only difference in the value of outlet concentration at a different time due to difference in adsorbate adsorbent interaction and mass transfer coefficient the outlet concentration profile and percentage removal of various heavy metal at bed depth of 5 10 15 cm have been given in fig 4 a c at the initial bed height of 5 cm and initial metal ion concentration of 20 mg l zn2 has removal efficiency of 64 36 cu2 has 74 45 ni2 has 77 9 when bed height increased from 5 to 15 cm percentage removal increased to 77 5 82 75 and 81 75 for zn2 cu2 and ni2 respectively from the performance analysis it is anticipated that cu2 has a maximum mass transfer coefficient and which got later confirmation from the model validations similar behavious of the system was also found for mb dye removal in sfbr 30 and treatment of groundwater in aclosed lood fixed bed system 36 3 1 2 effect of initial solute concentration initial solute concentration has a very strong effect on the determination of the performance of a novel adsorption based separation technique initial solute concentration decides the adsorption capacity of the system this is very much significant for scaling up the system therefore in this study the initial concentration range was chosen based on the reported data of various industries releasing such heavy metals moreover in a lab scale reactor the metal concentration should be chosen carefully to avoid any difficulties in contaminated water disposal however in this investigation the initial metal concentration was 10 20 and 30 mg l for all the metal ions the total solution used was 15 l in a closed circuit mode to keep the bed depth at 10 cm and feed flow rate at 2 lpm throughout the operation low concentration of zn2 having 10 20 mg l reached equilibrium around 120 min but for high concentration having 30 mg l took 240 300 min to reach equilibrium for 10 mg l initial concentration maximum percentage removal was 82 and for 20 and 30 mg l percentage removal reduced to 72 36 and 69 83 for cu2 metal the equilibrium time is comparatively faster for all the concentration the initial concentration of 10 mg l having equilibrium time of 60 min and for 20 and 30 mg l 360 min were required to reach equilibrium it has been observed that ni2 needs more time to reach equilibrium even at the lowest concentration around 180 min was required when initial concentration was 10 mg l and more than 360 min was required for the concentration of 20 and 30 mg l in these experiments it was also found that percentage removal was reduced from 72 to 70 43 over the specified concentration range the concentration profile has been presented in fig 5 a c at different initial solute concentration for different heavy metals the similar trend also found for a semifluidized bed system for mb dye removal and heavy metalcontaing wastewater 30 37 at low concentration the competition between the solute molecules are less for the adsorption site and therefore the concentration depletion is higher when the initial concentration is higher the competition is higher as the active sites are fixed or limited however the amount of adsorbed solute is higher due to the higher driving force and lesser resistance offered by the boundary layer still the percentage of removal is less in this case 3 1 3 effect of feed flow rate the feed flow rate of a system is another important parameter for obtaining the optimum condition the feed flow rate decides the hydraulic retention time of solute inside the reactor and decides the mass transfer coefficient indirectly at low feed flow the solute molecules get more time to interact with the adsorbent surface and overcome the mass transfer resistance the phenomenon can be explained from biot no of the system biot no bi of the system is defined as film diffusion to intraparticle diffusion 35 at high feed flow rate film diffusion will increase but intraparticle will be less as a result intraparticle diffusion will be rate controlling and overall mass transfer will reduce significantly 30 therefore a low flow rate results in faster equilibrium therefore a low flow rate is recommended for such a reactor but for semifluidized bed system a certain velocity must be maintained to form the top packed section though the high flow rate increases the formation of packed bed due to the fast movement of the solute molecule through the bed prohibit the whole system attains a higher removal efficiency the performance curves for the individual system at different feed flow rates are represented in fig 6 a c the experimental data were plotted as outlet concentration against operation time and percentage removal against time at flow rate of 2 lpm percentage removals were 75 78 4 and 72 6 for zn2 cu2 and ni2 respectively at high flow rate of 6 lpm percentage removal drop down to 62 5 52 62 3 respectively 3 2 optimization of the system 3 2 1 anova results and analysis central composite design ccd analysis was performed over three independent process parameters and percentage removal response of various heavy metals from synthetic wastewater in a novel semifluidized bed reactor system the anova results are presented in table 5 the model equations obtained based on the analysis of variance are presented in eqs 15 17 for zn2 cu2 and ni2 respectively the percentage removal of zn2 in terms of coded variables 15 y 71 65 5 65 x 1 4 21 x 2 2 70 x 3 3 0 x 1 x 2 0 25 x 1 x 3 0 5 x 2 x 3 0 72 x 1 2 0 87 x 2 2 0 54 x 3 2 the percentage removal of cu2 in terms of coded variables 16 y 66 41 5 66 x 1 6 67 x 2 4 66 x 3 0 38 x 1 x 2 1 13 x 1 x 3 0 37 x 2 x 3 1 77 x 1 2 4 42 x 2 2 1 24 x 3 2 the percentage removal of ni2 in terms of coded variables 17 y 71 29 4 88 x 1 2 95 x 2 1 24 x 3 1 56 x 1 x 2 0 063 x 1 x 3 1 06 x 2 x 3 1 56 x 1 2 0 86 x 2 2 1 03 x 3 2 the fit summary results indicate that the quadratic model is the best fitting for all the heavy metals that got removed in the sfbr the experimental data analysed in ccd presented in table 5 explain the statistical significance of individual term as well as the interacting effect from the analysis it has been found that each term has significant fisher s f value and low probability values 0 005 hence it is clear that the model for all the three heavy metals is significant p value of the model found 0 001 and ci confidence interval of 99 the p values for lack of fit are 0 288 0 242 and 0 363 for zn2 cu2 and ni2 respectively which are insignificant moreover the anova results predict that the linear coefficient x 1 x 2 and x 3 are significant for all three heavy metals the interaction effect x 1 x 2 x 2 x 3 x 1 x 3 and quadratic effects x 1 2 x 2 2 x 3 2 are not significant for all the cases for example x 1 x 2 and x 2 2 are significant for zn2 x 1 x 3 and x 2 2 are significant for cu2 removal and x 1 x 2 and x 1 2 are significant for ni2 removal however all the quadratic models were found to yield high values of r 2 0 91 0 093 and adjusted r 2 0 88 0 91 which indicated a high correlation between the experimental and model predicted values of metal removal in sfbr thus good agreements demonstrate that all the developed model equations can predict the experimental results 3 2 2 model accuracy study the normal probability plot of residuals and experimental vs predicted plots for zn2 cu2 and ni2 are presented in figs 6a b 7 a b and 8 a b the graphical representation postulate that the residuals follow a satisfactory straight line and have a normal distribution these results confirm the adequacy and validity of the predicted models the deviation between the actual response percentage removal of heavy metals and model prediction will be less the effect of noise is also very small in the developed model 3 2 3 studies on operating parameters interaction and process optimization the interacting effect of the operating parameters has been investigated that contributes to the removal efficiency of the semifluidized bed reactor for this investigation two parameters were varied keeping another constant at centre point or zero levels the contour plot and 3d plot at optimum condition have been presented here in figs 7c d 8 c d and 9 c d for zn2 cu2 and ni2 respectively the green zone in the plot indicates the adverse effect of the parameter where efficiency of the process is minimum and the red zone signifies the condition of the parameter where maximum removal of the process is achieved from the 3d surface analysis and the experimental data it is evident that among all the parameters the initial bed height or the adsorbent bed depth x 1 is the most effective parameter for the performance of the system the percentage removal of metal ions increases significantly with the increase in adsorbent bed depth from 5 to 15 cm at a constant feed flow rate and a particular initial solute concentration it is reasonable to obtain an increased removal efficiency by increasing adsorbent as the metal binding sites and active functional groups are increased however the increment of adsorbent bed depth is very high and may impact negatively 38 at an optimum adsorbent dose the intercellular distance is greater and facilitates the adsorption process 39 by optimizing the electrostatic force between the solute and sorbet cells at a bed depth of 15 cm the bed efficiency reaches to 77 5 82 75 and 81 75 for zn2 cu2 and ni2 respectively at 20 mg l initial solute concentration and bed efficiency of 64 36 74 45 and 77 9 at bed depth of 5 cm respectively the metal ion dose or solute concentration plays a negative role in the performance evaluation of the semifluidized bed system for removal of zn2 cu2 and ni2 as the solute concentration increases the competition between them increases and the total available binding site reduces as a result the overall performance or percentage removal reduces however at high solute concentration the driving force between the liquid solid increases due to high competition and accordingly many solute molecules remain unabsorbed from table 5 it is also evident that the effect of solute concentration is very effective with the other two parameters individually but the combined effect is not much significant except zn2 and ni2 however in this investigation the initial metal concentration was 10 20 and 30 mg l for all the metal ions the total solution used was 15 l in a closed circuit mode keeping the bed depth at 10 cm and feed flow rate at 2 lpm percentage removal reduced from 86 to 70 for zn2 88 to 76 for cu2 and 78 to 72 for ni2 the results indicate that solute concentration has a strong effect on zn2 and cu2 adsorption than ni2 apart from these two variables another parameter that very significantly determines the sfbr performance is the feed flow rate the feed flow rate in another word can be described as the retention time of the solute in the system or bed at low feed flow rate the solute retention time will be more and the interaction between the solid liquid will be more and more mass transfer will occur from bulk phase to surface of the adsorbent therefore at the high flow rate bed efficiency reduces percentage removal reduced from 71 to 64 for zn2 77 to 51 for cu2 and 72 to 62 35 for ni2 this data depicts that the significant effect of flow rate over concentration cu2 has most significantly affected this variable to predict the optimum condition the variables were set in the range and the percentage removal which is the response in this study has been set to maximize different conditions were suggested by the software based on the data analysis and predicted output the condition at which the desirability reaches near unity was chosen as the optimum operating condition to optimize the process the rsm followes few steps such as i selection of independent variables ii choice of the experimental design based on selected experimentl matrix iii mathematic statistical treatment of the experimental data through a polynomial function fitting iv evaluation of the polynomial model v performaing a displacement in direction to the optimal region and vi obtain the optimum values for each studied parameter later the surface generate a model liner or quadratic which used to indicate the direction at which the original design must be displaced to obtain the optimal condition 40 the optimum conditions and the predicted and experimental values of response have been tabulated in table 6 3 3 comparision of sfbr results with individual fixed and fluidized bed system some literature based investigation has been done in this study to find out the superior performance of a semifluidized bed adsorption column over normal packed bed fixed bed and fluidized bed adsorption column at very similar experimental conditions the performance has been analysed based on operation time the total volume of effluent treated initial concentration and percentage removal it has been found that most of the packed bed reactors required very long operational time and less amount of water treated further it was found that at 50 of the total operation time the bed efficiency reaches below 50 for packed bed as shown in table 7 therefore 500 ml 1 l of solution have over 80 removal efficiency which is very low in comparison with actalscenario on the other hand very few reported studied were found for the fluidized bed adsorption column with very high operation time and low bed efficiency some examples are provided in table 7 however the studies reported that in fluidized bed percent removal is less though the operation time is also high in contrast to the individual system the present system which is a combination of both fixed and fluidized bed achieved around 80 removal for 15 l of effluent within 240 360 min few reported results have been represented in table 7 3 4 dynamic model validation over the last few years several numbers of mathematical techniques have been developed to simulate the system in many studies the authors have fitted the experimental data in some well established model like thomas model 44 adams bohart y n model 45 and calculate the model parameters but these models have some limitations and assumptions beyond that the models cannot be applied therefore it is better to develop a model based on the basic principle or first principle method in this study the soluble metal removal process is modelled based on advection and axial dispersion followed by mass transfer from liquid to the surface of the adsorbent the degree of axial mixing or the axial dispersion coefficient for both the section individually evaluated as d a x f and d a x p the mass transfer coefficient k f is considered the same for both the sections as it is the property of the solute ions and the surface of the adsorbent in the model these two parameters are evaluated rest are known therefore some initial values from some reported studies have been assumed and the eq 13 got solved if the calculated concentration over the time range is not close with the experimental data new values for the axial dispersion and mass transfer coefficient were changed by trial and error basis once the concentration values of calculated and experimental techniques were very close the mass transfer coefficient and dispersion coefficient were noted an error function test also adopted in term of χ 2 test from eq 18 to estimate the error between the calculated values from the model and the experimental values the enuation inserted in the code and directly give the value of errors 18 χ 2 q e e x p q e c a l 2 q e c a l the model fitted well in line with the experimental for most of the cases with an error 5 it has been observed that the mass transfer coefficient value k f was changed with the operating parameters like initial metal ion concentration adsorbent bed depth and feed flow rate example of the model fitted vs experimental data for each metal ion at a particular parameter are represented in figs 10 12 all the model predicted data are tabulated in table 8 hence from the elaborate analysis it can be anticipated that the developed model for the novel system is very accurate with a high correlation coefficient from the developed model the scale up of the system can be possible in future research work table 8 4 conclusion from a concise and in depth study it has been found that the novel semifluidized bed adsorption column has been performed very efficiently for the removal of different divalent heavy metal ions simultaneously the low cost and lightweight hybrid adsorbent make the operation very easy in terms of low pumping cost and got fluidized at very low velocity moreover the material has a very high affinity for the metal ions due to the presence of various functional groups and porous structure the adsorbent material has specific surfacearea 200 14 m2 g average pore diameter of 1 41 nm and average pore volume 0 24 cm g3 which indicate that the adsorbent can capture ion molecules from the aqueous solution various operating variables and their effect on bed performance have been analysed in details and outlined it is being observed that how significantly they are influencing the removal efficiency both experimentally and statistically the interactive effect of the operating parameters was also investigated by response surface methodology quadratic equation for the system has been developed which predicts the experimental results very well with a high correlation coefficient maximum efficiency by the sfbr was achieved as 2 81 lpm flow rate 14 05 mg l metal concentration and 12 97 cm of adsorbent bed depth maximum percent removal for zn2 was 87 86 cu2 was 88 89 and ni2 was 84 31 a real time dynamic model for the novel system was developed by assuming the system as a pfdr based on solute phase mass balance various mass transfer parameters for the system was also obtained from the developed model and accordingly validated with the experimental data the model data which was well in line with the experimental data along with an error in 5 6 in most of the cases for a few points the error is more due to some instability in the three phase experiment nevertheless the novel system exhibited satisfactorily for heavy metals removal from industrial wastewater based on this present investigation further studies can be done for the scaling up of such novel system and can be implemented as large scale operation in future declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper 
13909,water scarcity and the precariousness of municipal wastewater treatment associated with high social vulnerability and resource shortages in brazil s semi arid regions aggravate social disparities and make it impossible to improve the quality of life for the population living there it is possible to reverse this scenario through the reuse of treated municipal wastewater in productive activities this paper sets up a scenario with hydroponic cultivation crop irrigation and fish farming using treated municipal wastewater as a mean of recovering water and nutrients for food and income generation for the local families multicriteria decision analysis was applied to select a treatment system that would allow municipal wastewater reuse a conventional preliminary treatment was used and for the biological treatment a upflow anaerobic sludge blanket digestion uasb reactor was selected which transforms the organic fraction of wastewater into biogas and sludge when converted into electricity biogas allows the meeting of the wastewater treatment plant demand and sludge could be applied to the soil as biofertiliser two post treatments are presented high rate pond and constructed wetland both post treatments are adequate and provide treated municipal wastewater in a satisfactory condition for reuse in addition they produce biomass which can be used as fish food water and nutrients are kept in a cycle bringing socioeconomic benefits to the population and environmental benefits to the semi arid regions keywords sustainability aspects municipal wastewater treatment wastewater reuse semi arid conditions multicriteria decision analysis 1 introduction brazil has the highest availability of fresh water on the planet however twenty seven million people in the country live in a region with semi arid conditions 1 2 arid and semi arid regions are characterised by scarce rainfall high temperatures strong insolation and high evapotranspiration rates which contribute to an unfavourable water balance 3 4 locations with these characteristics particularly semi aridity have unstable hydrography in relation to water flow in addition the disproportionate spatial distribution of water in the territory is a contributing factor to drought in this region 5 in semi arid areas water supply is not enough to meet the demand and this limits farming practices leaving the population vulnerable 4 in brazil s semi arid regions the water supply for human consumption in the municipality depends on surface sources which mostly present intermittent flow in addition to heterogeneity in water availability water quality is compromised in general the region s watersheds present a critical situation due to the low water availability and lack of municipal wastewater treatment mwwt 3 6 in brazil s semi arid regions according to the national water agency of brazil the percentage of wastewater collection is only 22 7 in these regions municipal wastewater disposal practices comprise pits open trenches and increasingly direct discharge into water bodies 6 the environmental consequences of these practices impact water bodies and soil pollution in terms of public health diseases such as diarrhoea dysentery cholera hepatitis a and typhoid fever are widespread with children being the most affected population 8 inadequate sanitation lack of water and untreated wastewater as seen in brazil s semi arid regions is a major cause of mortality and morbidity in developing countries 9 associated with the sanitation problem socioeconomic aspects contribute to aggravating the population s vulnerability brazil poses the most populated semi arid region in the world and is the one with the most socioeconomically fragile population 5 the average monthly income per capita of the inhabitants of brazil s semi arid regions is us 98 which is much lower than the national average of us 233 10 more than 1000 municipalities in brazil s semi arid regions have a municipal human development index mhdi of 0 592 11 which is lower than the country s average of 0 727 12 therefore reconciling sanitation and the socioeconomic development of the population by maximizing natural resources and recovering nutrients are important challenges to overcome in brazil incorporated into that it is possible to reuse treated municipal wastewater tmww to promote productive activities that for regions with water scarcity would not be possible otherwise activities such as crop hydroponics fish farming and irrigation of agricultural crops 13 16 are parts of the social and environmental policies that improve the population s quality of life 17 so this paper proposes the implementation of productive activities in brazil s semi arid regions through the reuse of tmww this paper applies multicriteria decision analysis for the selection of a mwwt and proposes hydroponic cultivation crop irrigation and fish farming using treated municipal wastewater as a means of recovering water and nutrients for food and income generation for local families 2 methodology the applied methodology follows the steps presented in fig 1 and described in sequence after defining the study area information was collected on the options for the preliminary treatment biological treatment and post treatment of municipal wastewater as the preliminary treatment units in brazil are consolidated 18 by screening grit removal and parshall flume this same configuration was adopted as for the biological treatment and after treatment systems used in brazil those that have the potential to meet the requirements for the reuse of treated wastewater were selected 18 20 to support this decision multicriteria decision analysis was applied the main criteria that should be considered when choosing a mwwt were selected these criteria were organised in order of importance by the authors using references from brasil 18 the comparison between pairs of these criteria in the matrix of the analytical hierarchy process ahp by saaty 21 made each of them receive a weight according to their assigned importance after defining the criteria the score obtained by each mwwt system selected for evaluation were collected this score was also obtained according to data from von sperling 18 from brazil as this is where the study area is located it is important to adapt these references so that local data can be used when reproducing this methodology finally the weights assigned to the selection criteria by the ahp matrix and the score of each system in those criteria were combined thus the biological treatment and the post treatment with the highest score were selected to compose the mwwt after that the tmww reuse scenario is configured and discussed 2 1 study area the semi arid regions in brazil are located in the northeastern region and parts of the southeast region including the northern portion of the state of minas gerais fig 2 the area of 1 03 million km² covers 1262 municipalities where about 27 million people live representing 12 of the country s population 1 12 22 the average population of the semi arid municipalities is 13 000 inhabitants per capita water consumption self reported by the municipalities in this semi arid region is 90 l habitant 1 day 1 on average 23 the collected and untreated wastewater together with the non collected wastewater represent 80 of the wastewater generated in brazil s semi arid regions the biochemical oxygen demand bod dumped without collection or treatment is 340 kg bod day on average 7 2 2 selection of alternatives for mwwt with the aim of proposing a mwwt for application in brazil s semi arid regions preliminary treatment with screening grit removal and flow measurement was considered 18 for the selection of biological treatment chernicharo et al 20 found that 77 of the installed mwwt in the brazil s regions with the highest treatment index have stabilisation ponds sps or upflow anaerobic sludge blanket reactors uasb these two systems are widely used in cities with populations between 2000 and 100 000 habitants and therefore are more likely to be implanted in the study area the efficiency of organic matter removal by these systems is between 75 and 85 in sps and between 60 and 75 in uasb nutrient removal such as phosphorus and nitrogen is between 35 and 60 in both systems the pathogens removed are between 90 and 99 18 the systems have an impressive performance in the removal of organic matter however it is noted that nutrient and pathogen removal have lower efficiencies thus seeking better quality treated wastewater the post treatment alternatives of maturation pond mp or constructed wetland cw for sp and high rate pond hrp or constructed wetland cw for uasb reactor were proposed these alternatives were selected because they are presented in the literature as an applicable form of post treatment for sps and uasb 24 31 another aspect in favour of these post treatment systems is that in ponds mp and hrp factors such as temperature insolation ph and oxygen availability act as disinfectants in cw plants and soil remove nutrients and suspended solids and pathogens become inactivated 18 32 2 3 multicriteria decision analysis to define the biological treatment and the post treatment to compose the mwwt multicriteria decision analysis was applied using the analytic hierarchy process ahp method developed by saaty in 1977 21 ahp is one of the methods used to evaluate multiple objectives and criteria the ahp method makes it possible to compare decision elements in pairs be they quantitative or qualitative the assignment of weights to the selection criteria was done by building a matrix of the relative importance of each criterion table 1 shows the values of relative importance used in the ahp matrix to define the criteria weights in the ahp matrix the criteria are compared in pairs in relation to the impact it causes on the element above it in the hierarchy 21 data consistency was assessed using the ahp consistency index ci and consistency ratio rc ci was calculated according to the highest eigenvalue of the criteria matrix and the total number of criteria the cr was calculated according to the ci such consistency analyses were proposed by saaty 21 in order to verify that the hierarchy does not violate data integrity restrictions 2 4 decision criteria for the choice of mwwt in order to perform the multicriteria decision analysis the mwwt selection criteria were initially obtained and organised these criteria were used for the paired comparisons between the wastewater treatment systems according to recommendations suggested by von sperling 18 and applied to brazil s characteristics these criteria are organic matter nutrient and pathogen removal efficiency area and energy demand implementation operation and maintenance costs by product generation resistance to variations reliability simplicity of operation and maintenance independence from climate and soil and the possibility of environmental problems in developing countries like brazil the critical criteria to consider when selecting mwwt 18 are implementation operation and maintenance costs energy demand and simplicity in this order in addition the main products generated biogas tmww and sludge are presented as a way of resource recovery 19 therefore only the critical criteria and those related to the generated by products were considered in the multicriteria decision analysis 2 5 mwwt suitability each biological treatment system sp and uasb and post treatment hrp and cw had scores assigned on a scale of 5 five to 0 zero score 5 was attributed to the systems whose physical operational environmental or financial characteristics were favourable for meeting the chosen criteria a score of 1 was ascribed to the least favourable 0 represented those with no effect and 4 3 and 2 were intermediate effects in descending order the assigned scores were recommended by von sperling 18 because they applied brazil s characteristics to obtain the total suitability of the mwwt a weighted average was calculated using the system score of the systems in each criterion scored from 0 to 5 and its respective weight obtained from the ahp in this way the maximum suitability could be achieved for a set of biological treatment and post treatment by the union of the most appropriate systems found for each treatment stage 2 6 reuse routes for tmww the extreme social fragility of the one million people living in brazil s semi arid regions and the climatic conditions to which they are exposed compromises economic development due to these factors the objective of this work was to propose productive activities in addition to alleviating the problem of basic sanitation through the reuse of tmww as a source of subsistence and income generation the reuse alternatives addressed are in line with the proposals of the brazil s association of sanitary and environmental engineering abes 13 and basic sanitation research program prosab 14 i e irrigation hydroponics and fish farming the hydroponic cultivation of crops in tmww in addition to producing food provide pollutants and nutrients removal from wastewater due to filtering by plant roots 34 36 tilapia oreochromis niloticus farming in excavated or built tanks integrated with other activities such as irrigation brings the benefit of tmww this practice requires smaller areas less raw materials and electricity in addition tilapia demand has grown since it is a food of high nutritional value and easy adaptation 16 37 crop irrigation using tmww is a recognised form of plant nutrient and water recovery 38 41 using data from the literature estimates of pathogen removal by biological treatment and wastewater post treatment validated the reuse in each of these proposed activities limited values of e coli should be respected table 2 considering food safety it is noteworthy that for the reuse of treated wastewater the sanitary surveillance norms and compliance with other recommendations and commercialisation standards must be obeyed 35 42 45 3 results and discussion the cr obtained in this ahp matrix was less than 0 1 and considered acceptable 21 fig 3 shows the ahp matrix with the values of relative importance for each criterion used to define the criteria weights and the weights resulting from the multicriteria decision analysis the score of each treatment system investigated is presented in table 3 next to the weights of the criteria the multiplication of these resulted in the suitability of the systems also shown in this table implementation maintenance and operation costs energy demand and simplicity are critical criteria these technical and economic criteria received the greatest weight 0 18 in ahp this is because as presented by massoud tarhini and nasr 46 in developing countries investment in mwwt represents a very high expenditure in places where budgets are restricted in addition to the costs of operation and maintenance this fact can become an impediment to the construction of a station therefore it is so important to consider the units that will compose the mwwt as for technical criteria massoud tarhini and nasr 46 expressed concern about the lack of local knowledge which could lead to the inadequate operation of mwwt causing problems for the environment and in this case where reuse is foreseen problems would also arise for the population thus the allocation of weights in this article is in line with existing concerns about the installation of mwwt in developing countries the criteria related to the generated products obtained different weights the biogas generation received a weight of 0 09 as it was considered to be more important than the other two products treated wastewater and sludge this fact can be related to the importance of biogas as an alternative electricity source co generation of heat and electricity using biogas may supply mwwt s energy demand eliminating or at least reducing its operational expenses in addition the environmental impacts associated with wastewater treatment are reduced 47 48 the criteria related to water quality for reuse pathogens organic matter and nutrients removal received the same weight 0 05 water quality is related to technical legal and social aspects that are a concern with regard to reuse but do not prevent the implementation of mwwt 49 sludge generation was the least important criterion 0 03 although this by product can be used as a biofertiliser when degraded 18 19 50 it benefits economic activities in the semi arid region once again it is an important and interesting aspect but not decisive for the selection of mwwt for the study area 3 1 biological treatment and post treatment suitability the biological treatment system that presented the best suitability for brazil s semi arid regions considering the weighted average of all criteria of the multicriteria decision analysis was the uasb for the post treatment pr and cw obtained very close suitability despite their particularities the graph shown in fig 4 was constructed using the suitability of each treatment technology in each of the groups of criteria the costs group includes the criteria for savings in implementation operation and maintenance energy demand is the energy saving criterion simplicity represents the operational simplicity criterion and generation of bioproducts covers the remaining criteria this graphical representation of the data in table 3 helps to distinguish the performance of the different technologies sps performed well in the first four criteria fig 4 a but do not generate biogas and sludge removal is required only after 20 years or more 51 sp and uasb have similar demand for electricity however the main advantage of the uasb is the biogas generated during the degradation of organic matter present in the wastewater it is mostly composed of methane and carbon dioxide and can be converted into energy 52 54 another factor is sludge which is removed stabilised and densified from the reactor and can be used as a biofertiliser as an alternative to commercial fertilisers 55 for post treatment fig 4 b in terms of operational simplicity hrp requires co2 supplementation and ph must be monitored and controlled 56 58 cw may clog when high wastewater loads are applied requiring washing or unit replacement on the other hand very small loads lead to the unexplored potential of this unit thus constant monitoring and control of the loads are required 59 hrp showed better product generation performance compared to cw although both provide biomass planting vegetables such as alfalfa medicago sativa in cw may provide protein to be used in the tilapia diet 60 microalgae grown in hrp have 51 58 protein composition and can meet the needs of this nutrient in the various stages of tilapia development 25 61 62 this is one of the possibilities of using these products in the case of cw a different biomass can be obtained and offered to other animals 30 hrp s microalgae biomass however has more options for use this biomass can be applied to the soil as biofertiliser and has value as bioenergy 52 54 63 64 3 2 mwwt configuration mwwt configuration with uasb and hrp or cw reactor was obtained through the hierarchy of treatment systems criteria by pairwise comparison as proposed in the literature however for the implementation of such a mwwt the flow measurement and the pollutant loads quantification of raw municipal wastewater must be made thus it is possible to know if the proposed treatment and post treatment can really be applied in addition for mwwt to operate as planned there must be constant monitoring and maintenance of the units that comprise it assis et al 29 and assemany et al 52 evaluated the performance of lat downstream of the uasb for the treatment of brazil s municipal wastewater e coli concentrations between 103 and 104 colony forming units cfu were found per 100 ml approximately 11 mg l 1 of nitrogen concentration and approximately 4 mg l 1 of phosphorus concentration 29 52 these results are similar to those found in a system using an anaerobic digester uasb reactor like organic matter degradation process and hrp undertaken by craggs et al 58 results of 103 and 104 cfu in 100 ml were obtained for e coli concentration whilst nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations close to 8 and 2 mg l 1 were obtained respectively el khateeb et al 30 and sousa et al 31 evaluated the performance of cw applied to the post treatment of wastewater treated in a uasb and found adequate results e coli was observed at a magnitude of 101 cfu in 100 ml approximately 14 mg l 1 of nitrogen concentration and approximately 1 mg l 1 of phosphorus concentration according to the world health organisation who the main parameter for the evaluation of the quality of the tmww is the quantification of e coli per 100 ml the e coli concentration found in tmww by assis et al 29 assemany et al 52 craggs et al 58 el khateeb et al 30 and sousa et al 31 were compared with the values shown in table 2 this was done to estimate the possible quality of the wastewater treated by the proposed mwwt configuration and to compare this quality with that required for the planned reuses when cw is used there are no restrictions on hydroponic cultivation and irrigation however it is observed that when using hrp for post treatment edible crops reuse in hydroponics and low growth crop rate irrigation should be avoided in addition consumption of raw food irrigated with tmww containing e coli concentrations of 104 cfu in 100 ml or above poses a significant risk of bacterial or viral infection 15 however practices such as washing disinfecting peeling or cooking food promote pathogen removal in up to 2 log units 99 15 in terms of removing organic matter the load of wastewater dumped without treatment or collection in brazil s semi arid region was found to be 340 kg bod per day 7 el khateeb 30 found bod removal to be from 84 to 99 through a combination of uasb and cw when hrp was used after uasb lopes et al 65 found 94 bod removal thus a similar reduction is expected if this alternative is applied in addition 80 of the wastewater in the generated in brazil s semi arid regions is not treated 7 a situation that can be mitigated with the application of this proposal with this there is the production of downstream users and the aquatic ecosystem 3 3 tmww reuse considering the quality of tmww and the restrictions imposed described above tmww can be designed for fish farming hydroponics and irrigation of agricultural crops as illustrated in fig 5 in this proposal there is maximum use of water in productive activities the association of sanitation and agriculture forms a closed cycle where the treated wastewater nutrients essential for plant growth are recovered and water is reused 36 hydroponic cultivation requires less water than irrigation and allows year round cultivation without the need for arable land 34 36 magwaza et al 36 pointed out that the hydroponic system can be a suitable use of tmww as long as it minimises the health risks associated with farmers harvested crops and consumers which can arise through contact with wastewater this can be done through the constant monitoring and optimisation of mwwt technologies the reuse of tmww provides sustainable management of waste disposal protects the environment and benefits society allowing the recovery and reuse of nutrients for food production another important aspect is the valorisation of the product which can reach higher commercial values than the same food if irrigated 66 for this cultivation it is important to know the macro and micronutrients which may limit plant growth due to their excess or deficiency 67 thus nutrient supplementation and salt addition should be anticipated according to crop needs and tmww availability 68 fish farming can be carried out in parallel with hydroponic cultivation and its effluent will contribute to irrigation fish production in tmww for human consumption is usual in countries such as china india egypt south africa germany and peru among others 16 tilapia is a species with high development potential in this type of aquaculture 16 61 62 dampin et al 61 found that sps water quality is appropriate for fish growth ammonia and nitrate values were above release standards however nile tilapia could tolerate and assimilate high levels of ammonia and nitrate considering that the treatment efficiency of the proposed configuration uasb and hrp or cw is greater than sp an appropriate environment for fish breeding is expected feeding tilapia with biomass enables the reduction or even the elimination of feed expenses 16 tmww is fertilised as it passes through the fish tank and may be used to irrigate pastures orchards and vegetables 15 37 the most suitable irrigation method for better water resource use is dripping the proximity of the water source and the plant root prevents evaporative waste and can be used in low and high growth rate crops 69 in brazil s semi arid regions studies have been carried out on sorbet and good results for the irrigation of peppers with tmww were obtained by carvalho et al and tavares et al 70 71 zaibel et al 72 pointed out that the reuse of tmww for agricultural irrigation as a well established practice can solve the problem of water scarcity in semi arid and arid regions in addition to increasing water flow and restoring aquatic ecosystems it is estimated that in a city located in a semi arid region with 1 million people it is possible to irrigate between 1500 and 3 500 ha with tmww 15 in addition to the expected harvest the use of tmww meets the water demand and decreases the use of artificial fertilisers it is estimated that by irrigating semi arid land at a typical rate of 1 5 m³ m 2 y 1 the tmww can provide 225 kg of nitrogen and 54 kg of phosphorus per hectare per year 15 kehrein et al 73 reported that recovering and reusing wastewater may be a more sustainable solution compared to desalination or long distance freshwater transfers despite this it is emphasised that the use of microalgae biomass or tmww for food production depends on its acceptance by the population this can be supplied by complying with health surveillance standards and by meeting other recommendations and marketing standards 35 42 45 still mizyed 49 points out that legal aspects of normalising reuse are challenging and that for the proposal to work there must be participation by the population in brazil several factors mean that in many cases mwwt projects are implemented without the participation of the population which affects the performance of mwwt in this way participatory processes of the population combined with the products they can obtain through mwwt are essential for the success of the proposal 3 4 energy generation the need for a diversified energy mix with more affordable costs have made the conversion of biogas into electric energy inevitable 74 uasb is estimated to produce 15 l of biogas per inhabitant per day under ideal conditions in brazil 19 thus in a city with a population of 13 000 representing the average population of brazil s semi arid regions a biogas production of 195 m³ is expected which can generate about 300 kw h day 1 of energy these values were estimated from the per capita biogas production considering the operation of the system within the project values with no load or temperature variation studies indicate that a 5 ha hrp needs a 3 kw three phase motor operating 24 h a day 58 an hrp for wastewater post treatment in a city in brazil s semi arid region with 13 000 inhabitants and water consumption of 90 l inhabitant 1 day 1 requires an area of approximately 2 6 ha to be 0 30 m deep and operate with a hydraulic detention time hdt of 8 days considering the energy consumption as being proportional to the size of the hrp the biogas generated in the uasb could supply the energy demanded by it there would be remaining electricity to be used in productive activities fish farming hydroponics and irrigation which require pumping thus mwwt becomes independent of the cost fluctuations in electricity provided by the brazil s energy matrix and is presented as being sustainable 3 5 feasibility and benefits of the proposed mwwt in this context the mwwt combined with productive arrangements and the biorefinery meets the 17 sustainable development goals sdgs in the 2030 agenda 2 in addition to the treatment of wastewater it can provide a stable and reliable supply throughout the year especially in arid and semi arid regions 75 the biomass can be used contributing to the socioeconomic development of the population in the brazil s semi arid region in brazil s semi arid regions the income from irrigated cultivation is about ten times higher than rain dependent cultivation in normal years 76 this is due to rainfall irregularity in the region which can compromise production when the intermittent period between rains is prolonged 77 driving water available for irrigation is critical the main crops that are grown in the irrigated parts of the brazil s semi arid regions are cowpea manioc squash fodder for livestock and onions 76 it is important to highlight that productive activities can be developed in a modular way according to the financial resources availability in the same way raw wastewater should be evaluated to validate the application of the selected treatment system also tmww must be analysed before its application in productive activities according to hao et al 78 the recovery of water nutrients and energy manages to transform conventional wastewater treatment plants which emit pollutants and dissipate energy into stations that benefit the environment and approach the level of zero net impact although wastewater treatment is an impacting activity it cannot be avoided considering the percentage of wastewater collection in brazil s semi arid regions 22 7 and that municipal wastewater disposal practices comprise pits open trenches and in greater numbers direct discharge into bodies of water 6 the need to invest in sanitation is reaffirmed for the federal government the economic benefits of investing in sanitation include an estimated 1 5 gain in gross domestic product gdp and a return of us 4 3 for every dollar invested in sanitation services due to reduced health costs 79 according to hao et al 78 research should then focus on reducing impacts reusing water producing energy and using nutrients similar to the purpose of this study this is because they propose to reduce costs with electricity fish food nutrients for crops and water reuse all of these aspects work to reduce the environmental impacts associated with the treatment of wastewater 41 lopes et al 65 assessed the life cycle of wastewater treatment composed of uasb and cw they pointed out that the mwwt using uasb followed by cw is attractive for developing countries due to its operational simplicity in addition the generation of electricity through biogas contributed to the reduction of environmental impacts associated with the operation of mwwt when hrp is used schneider et al 80 pointed out that through life cycle assessment the cultivation of microalgae biomass can be carried out with low environmental impact obtaining a promising renewable raw material for various recovery routes 4 conclusion multicriteria decision analysis proved to be efficient in choosing an adequate treatment system for implementing in brazil s semi arid regions the productive activities of hydroponics fish farming and irrigation aim to improve the living conditions of the population in semi arid areas besides generating food employment and income they are modular and can be installed in isolation however wastewater characteristics should be evaluated prior to the implementation of any mwwt the proposal has benefits considering sanitation agriculture and sustainability in terms of electricity water and nutrients in addition with municipal wastewater treatment it is possible to promote

13909,water scarcity and the precariousness of municipal wastewater treatment associated with high social vulnerability and resource shortages in brazil s semi arid regions aggravate social disparities and make it impossible to improve the quality of life for the population living there it is possible to reverse this scenario through the reuse of treated municipal wastewater in productive activities this paper sets up a scenario with hydroponic cultivation crop irrigation and fish farming using treated municipal wastewater as a mean of recovering water and nutrients for food and income generation for the local families multicriteria decision analysis was applied to select a treatment system that would allow municipal wastewater reuse a conventional preliminary treatment was used and for the biological treatment a upflow anaerobic sludge blanket digestion uasb reactor was selected which transforms the organic fraction of wastewater into biogas and sludge when converted into electricity biogas allows the meeting of the wastewater treatment plant demand and sludge could be applied to the soil as biofertiliser two post treatments are presented high rate pond and constructed wetland both post treatments are adequate and provide treated municipal wastewater in a satisfactory condition for reuse in addition they produce biomass which can be used as fish food water and nutrients are kept in a cycle bringing socioeconomic benefits to the population and environmental benefits to the semi arid regions keywords sustainability aspects municipal wastewater treatment wastewater reuse semi arid conditions multicriteria decision analysis 1 introduction brazil has the highest availability of fresh water on the planet however twenty seven million people in the country live in a region with semi arid conditions 1 2 arid and semi arid regions are characterised by scarce rainfall high temperatures strong insolation and high evapotranspiration rates which contribute to an unfavourable water balance 3 4 locations with these characteristics particularly semi aridity have unstable hydrography in relation to water flow in addition the disproportionate spatial distribution of water in the territory is a contributing factor to drought in this region 5 in semi arid areas water supply is not enough to meet the demand and this limits farming practices leaving the population vulnerable 4 in brazil s semi arid regions the water supply for human consumption in the municipality depends on surface sources which mostly present intermittent flow in addition to heterogeneity in water availability water quality is compromised in general the region s watersheds present a critical situation due to the low water availability and lack of municipal wastewater treatment mwwt 3 6 in brazil s semi arid regions according to the national water agency of brazil the percentage of wastewater collection is only 22 7 in these regions municipal wastewater disposal practices comprise pits open trenches and increasingly direct discharge into water bodies 6 the environmental consequences of these practices impact water bodies and soil pollution in terms of public health diseases such as diarrhoea dysentery cholera hepatitis a and typhoid fever are widespread with children being the most affected population 8 inadequate sanitation lack of water and untreated wastewater as seen in brazil s semi arid regions is a major cause of mortality and morbidity in developing countries 9 associated with the sanitation problem socioeconomic aspects contribute to aggravating the population s vulnerability brazil poses the most populated semi arid region in the world and is the one with the most socioeconomically fragile population 5 the average monthly income per capita of the inhabitants of brazil s semi arid regions is us 98 which is much lower than the national average of us 233 10 more than 1000 municipalities in brazil s semi arid regions have a municipal human development index mhdi of 0 592 11 which is lower than the country s average of 0 727 12 therefore reconciling sanitation and the socioeconomic development of the population by maximizing natural resources and recovering nutrients are important challenges to overcome in brazil incorporated into that it is possible to reuse treated municipal wastewater tmww to promote productive activities that for regions with water scarcity would not be possible otherwise activities such as crop hydroponics fish farming and irrigation of agricultural crops 13 16 are parts of the social and environmental policies that improve the population s quality of life 17 so this paper proposes the implementation of productive activities in brazil s semi arid regions through the reuse of tmww this paper applies multicriteria decision analysis for the selection of a mwwt and proposes hydroponic cultivation crop irrigation and fish farming using treated municipal wastewater as a means of recovering water and nutrients for food and income generation for local families 2 methodology the applied methodology follows the steps presented in fig 1 and described in sequence after defining the study area information was collected on the options for the preliminary treatment biological treatment and post treatment of municipal wastewater as the preliminary treatment units in brazil are consolidated 18 by screening grit removal and parshall flume this same configuration was adopted as for the biological treatment and after treatment systems used in brazil those that have the potential to meet the requirements for the reuse of treated wastewater were selected 18 20 to support this decision multicriteria decision analysis was applied the main criteria that should be considered when choosing a mwwt were selected these criteria were organised in order of importance by the authors using references from brasil 18 the comparison between pairs of these criteria in the matrix of the analytical hierarchy process ahp by saaty 21 made each of them receive a weight according to their assigned importance after defining the criteria the score obtained by each mwwt system selected for evaluation were collected this score was also obtained according to data from von sperling 18 from brazil as this is where the study area is located it is important to adapt these references so that local data can be used when reproducing this methodology finally the weights assigned to the selection criteria by the ahp matrix and the score of each system in those criteria were combined thus the biological treatment and the post treatment with the highest score were selected to compose the mwwt after that the tmww reuse scenario is configured and discussed 2 1 study area the semi arid regions in brazil are located in the northeastern region and parts of the southeast region including the northern portion of the state of minas gerais fig 2 the area of 1 03 million km² covers 1262 municipalities where about 27 million people live representing 12 of the country s population 1 12 22 the average population of the semi arid municipalities is 13 000 inhabitants per capita water consumption self reported by the municipalities in this semi arid region is 90 l habitant 1 day 1 on average 23 the collected and untreated wastewater together with the non collected wastewater represent 80 of the wastewater generated in brazil s semi arid regions the biochemical oxygen demand bod dumped without collection or treatment is 340 kg bod day on average 7 2 2 selection of alternatives for mwwt with the aim of proposing a mwwt for application in brazil s semi arid regions preliminary treatment with screening grit removal and flow measurement was considered 18 for the selection of biological treatment chernicharo et al 20 found that 77 of the installed mwwt in the brazil s regions with the highest treatment index have stabilisation ponds sps or upflow anaerobic sludge blanket reactors uasb these two systems are widely used in cities with populations between 2000 and 100 000 habitants and therefore are more likely to be implanted in the study area the efficiency of organic matter removal by these systems is between 75 and 85 in sps and between 60 and 75 in uasb nutrient removal such as phosphorus and nitrogen is between 35 and 60 in both systems the pathogens removed are between 90 and 99 18 the systems have an impressive performance in the removal of organic matter however it is noted that nutrient and pathogen removal have lower efficiencies thus seeking better quality treated wastewater the post treatment alternatives of maturation pond mp or constructed wetland cw for sp and high rate pond hrp or constructed wetland cw for uasb reactor were proposed these alternatives were selected because they are presented in the literature as an applicable form of post treatment for sps and uasb 24 31 another aspect in favour of these post treatment systems is that in ponds mp and hrp factors such as temperature insolation ph and oxygen availability act as disinfectants in cw plants and soil remove nutrients and suspended solids and pathogens become inactivated 18 32 2 3 multicriteria decision analysis to define the biological treatment and the post treatment to compose the mwwt multicriteria decision analysis was applied using the analytic hierarchy process ahp method developed by saaty in 1977 21 ahp is one of the methods used to evaluate multiple objectives and criteria the ahp method makes it possible to compare decision elements in pairs be they quantitative or qualitative the assignment of weights to the selection criteria was done by building a matrix of the relative importance of each criterion table 1 shows the values of relative importance used in the ahp matrix to define the criteria weights in the ahp matrix the criteria are compared in pairs in relation to the impact it causes on the element above it in the hierarchy 21 data consistency was assessed using the ahp consistency index ci and consistency ratio rc ci was calculated according to the highest eigenvalue of the criteria matrix and the total number of criteria the cr was calculated according to the ci such consistency analyses were proposed by saaty 21 in order to verify that the hierarchy does not violate data integrity restrictions 2 4 decision criteria for the choice of mwwt in order to perform the multicriteria decision analysis the mwwt selection criteria were initially obtained and organised these criteria were used for the paired comparisons between the wastewater treatment systems according to recommendations suggested by von sperling 18 and applied to brazil s characteristics these criteria are organic matter nutrient and pathogen removal efficiency area and energy demand implementation operation and maintenance costs by product generation resistance to variations reliability simplicity of operation and maintenance independence from climate and soil and the possibility of environmental problems in developing countries like brazil the critical criteria to consider when selecting mwwt 18 are implementation operation and maintenance costs energy demand and simplicity in this order in addition the main products generated biogas tmww and sludge are presented as a way of resource recovery 19 therefore only the critical criteria and those related to the generated by products were considered in the multicriteria decision analysis 2 5 mwwt suitability each biological treatment system sp and uasb and post treatment hrp and cw had scores assigned on a scale of 5 five to 0 zero score 5 was attributed to the systems whose physical operational environmental or financial characteristics were favourable for meeting the chosen criteria a score of 1 was ascribed to the least favourable 0 represented those with no effect and 4 3 and 2 were intermediate effects in descending order the assigned scores were recommended by von sperling 18 because they applied brazil s characteristics to obtain the total suitability of the mwwt a weighted average was calculated using the system score of the systems in each criterion scored from 0 to 5 and its respective weight obtained from the ahp in this way the maximum suitability could be achieved for a set of biological treatment and post treatment by the union of the most appropriate systems found for each treatment stage 2 6 reuse routes for tmww the extreme social fragility of the one million people living in brazil s semi arid regions and the climatic conditions to which they are exposed compromises economic development due to these factors the objective of this work was to propose productive activities in addition to alleviating the problem of basic sanitation through the reuse of tmww as a source of subsistence and income generation the reuse alternatives addressed are in line with the proposals of the brazil s association of sanitary and environmental engineering abes 13 and basic sanitation research program prosab 14 i e irrigation hydroponics and fish farming the hydroponic cultivation of crops in tmww in addition to producing food provide pollutants and nutrients removal from wastewater due to filtering by plant roots 34 36 tilapia oreochromis niloticus farming in excavated or built tanks integrated with other activities such as irrigation brings the benefit of tmww this practice requires smaller areas less raw materials and electricity in addition tilapia demand has grown since it is a food of high nutritional value and easy adaptation 16 37 crop irrigation using tmww is a recognised form of plant nutrient and water recovery 38 41 using data from the literature estimates of pathogen removal by biological treatment and wastewater post treatment validated the reuse in each of these proposed activities limited values of e coli should be respected table 2 considering food safety it is noteworthy that for the reuse of treated wastewater the sanitary surveillance norms and compliance with other recommendations and commercialisation standards must be obeyed 35 42 45 3 results and discussion the cr obtained in this ahp matrix was less than 0 1 and considered acceptable 21 fig 3 shows the ahp matrix with the values of relative importance for each criterion used to define the criteria weights and the weights resulting from the multicriteria decision analysis the score of each treatment system investigated is presented in table 3 next to the weights of the criteria the multiplication of these resulted in the suitability of the systems also shown in this table implementation maintenance and operation costs energy demand and simplicity are critical criteria these technical and economic criteria received the greatest weight 0 18 in ahp this is because as presented by massoud tarhini and nasr 46 in developing countries investment in mwwt represents a very high expenditure in places where budgets are restricted in addition to the costs of operation and maintenance this fact can become an impediment to the construction of a station therefore it is so important to consider the units that will compose the mwwt as for technical criteria massoud tarhini and nasr 46 expressed concern about the lack of local knowledge which could lead to the inadequate operation of mwwt causing problems for the environment and in this case where reuse is foreseen problems would also arise for the population thus the allocation of weights in this article is in line with existing concerns about the installation of mwwt in developing countries the criteria related to the generated products obtained different weights the biogas generation received a weight of 0 09 as it was considered to be more important than the other two products treated wastewater and sludge this fact can be related to the importance of biogas as an alternative electricity source co generation of heat and electricity using biogas may supply mwwt s energy demand eliminating or at least reducing its operational expenses in addition the environmental impacts associated with wastewater treatment are reduced 47 48 the criteria related to water quality for reuse pathogens organic matter and nutrients removal received the same weight 0 05 water quality is related to technical legal and social aspects that are a concern with regard to reuse but do not prevent the implementation of mwwt 49 sludge generation was the least important criterion 0 03 although this by product can be used as a biofertiliser when degraded 18 19 50 it benefits economic activities in the semi arid region once again it is an important and interesting aspect but not decisive for the selection of mwwt for the study area 3 1 biological treatment and post treatment suitability the biological treatment system that presented the best suitability for brazil s semi arid regions considering the weighted average of all criteria of the multicriteria decision analysis was the uasb for the post treatment pr and cw obtained very close suitability despite their particularities the graph shown in fig 4 was constructed using the suitability of each treatment technology in each of the groups of criteria the costs group includes the criteria for savings in implementation operation and maintenance energy demand is the energy saving criterion simplicity represents the operational simplicity criterion and generation of bioproducts covers the remaining criteria this graphical representation of the data in table 3 helps to distinguish the performance of the different technologies sps performed well in the first four criteria fig 4 a but do not generate biogas and sludge removal is required only after 20 years or more 51 sp and uasb have similar demand for electricity however the main advantage of the uasb is the biogas generated during the degradation of organic matter present in the wastewater it is mostly composed of methane and carbon dioxide and can be converted into energy 52 54 another factor is sludge which is removed stabilised and densified from the reactor and can be used as a biofertiliser as an alternative to commercial fertilisers 55 for post treatment fig 4 b in terms of operational simplicity hrp requires co2 supplementation and ph must be monitored and controlled 56 58 cw may clog when high wastewater loads are applied requiring washing or unit replacement on the other hand very small loads lead to the unexplored potential of this unit thus constant monitoring and control of the loads are required 59 hrp showed better product generation performance compared to cw although both provide biomass planting vegetables such as alfalfa medicago sativa in cw may provide protein to be used in the tilapia diet 60 microalgae grown in hrp have 51 58 protein composition and can meet the needs of this nutrient in the various stages of tilapia development 25 61 62 this is one of the possibilities of using these products in the case of cw a different biomass can be obtained and offered to other animals 30 hrp s microalgae biomass however has more options for use this biomass can be applied to the soil as biofertiliser and has value as bioenergy 52 54 63 64 3 2 mwwt configuration mwwt configuration with uasb and hrp or cw reactor was obtained through the hierarchy of treatment systems criteria by pairwise comparison as proposed in the literature however for the implementation of such a mwwt the flow measurement and the pollutant loads quantification of raw municipal wastewater must be made thus it is possible to know if the proposed treatment and post treatment can really be applied in addition for mwwt to operate as planned there must be constant monitoring and maintenance of the units that comprise it assis et al 29 and assemany et al 52 evaluated the performance of lat downstream of the uasb for the treatment of brazil s municipal wastewater e coli concentrations between 103 and 104 colony forming units cfu were found per 100 ml approximately 11 mg l 1 of nitrogen concentration and approximately 4 mg l 1 of phosphorus concentration 29 52 these results are similar to those found in a system using an anaerobic digester uasb reactor like organic matter degradation process and hrp undertaken by craggs et al 58 results of 103 and 104 cfu in 100 ml were obtained for e coli concentration whilst nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations close to 8 and 2 mg l 1 were obtained respectively el khateeb et al 30 and sousa et al 31 evaluated the performance of cw applied to the post treatment of wastewater treated in a uasb and found adequate results e coli was observed at a magnitude of 101 cfu in 100 ml approximately 14 mg l 1 of nitrogen concentration and approximately 1 mg l 1 of phosphorus concentration according to the world health organisation who the main parameter for the evaluation of the quality of the tmww is the quantification of e coli per 100 ml the e coli concentration found in tmww by assis et al 29 assemany et al 52 craggs et al 58 el khateeb et al 30 and sousa et al 31 were compared with the values shown in table 2 this was done to estimate the possible quality of the wastewater treated by the proposed mwwt configuration and to compare this quality with that required for the planned reuses when cw is used there are no restrictions on hydroponic cultivation and irrigation however it is observed that when using hrp for post treatment edible crops reuse in hydroponics and low growth crop rate irrigation should be avoided in addition consumption of raw food irrigated with tmww containing e coli concentrations of 104 cfu in 100 ml or above poses a significant risk of bacterial or viral infection 15 however practices such as washing disinfecting peeling or cooking food promote pathogen removal in up to 2 log units 99 15 in terms of removing organic matter the load of wastewater dumped without treatment or collection in brazil s semi arid region was found to be 340 kg bod per day 7 el khateeb 30 found bod removal to be from 84 to 99 through a combination of uasb and cw when hrp was used after uasb lopes et al 65 found 94 bod removal thus a similar reduction is expected if this alternative is applied in addition 80 of the wastewater in the generated in brazil s semi arid regions is not treated 7 a situation that can be mitigated with the application of this proposal with this there is the production of downstream users and the aquatic ecosystem 3 3 tmww reuse considering the quality of tmww and the restrictions imposed described above tmww can be designed for fish farming hydroponics and irrigation of agricultural crops as illustrated in fig 5 in this proposal there is maximum use of water in productive activities the association of sanitation and agriculture forms a closed cycle where the treated wastewater nutrients essential for plant growth are recovered and water is reused 36 hydroponic cultivation requires less water than irrigation and allows year round cultivation without the need for arable land 34 36 magwaza et al 36 pointed out that the hydroponic system can be a suitable use of tmww as long as it minimises the health risks associated with farmers harvested crops and consumers which can arise through contact with wastewater this can be done through the constant monitoring and optimisation of mwwt technologies the reuse of tmww provides sustainable management of waste disposal protects the environment and benefits society allowing the recovery and reuse of nutrients for food production another important aspect is the valorisation of the product which can reach higher commercial values than the same food if irrigated 66 for this cultivation it is important to know the macro and micronutrients which may limit plant growth due to their excess or deficiency 67 thus nutrient supplementation and salt addition should be anticipated according to crop needs and tmww availability 68 fish farming can be carried out in parallel with hydroponic cultivation and its effluent will contribute to irrigation fish production in tmww for human consumption is usual in countries such as china india egypt south africa germany and peru among others 16 tilapia is a species with high development potential in this type of aquaculture 16 61 62 dampin et al 61 found that sps water quality is appropriate for fish growth ammonia and nitrate values were above release standards however nile tilapia could tolerate and assimilate high levels of ammonia and nitrate considering that the treatment efficiency of the proposed configuration uasb and hrp or cw is greater than sp an appropriate environment for fish breeding is expected feeding tilapia with biomass enables the reduction or even the elimination of feed expenses 16 tmww is fertilised as it passes through the fish tank and may be used to irrigate pastures orchards and vegetables 15 37 the most suitable irrigation method for better water resource use is dripping the proximity of the water source and the plant root prevents evaporative waste and can be used in low and high growth rate crops 69 in brazil s semi arid regions studies have been carried out on sorbet and good results for the irrigation of peppers with tmww were obtained by carvalho et al and tavares et al 70 71 zaibel et al 72 pointed out that the reuse of tmww for agricultural irrigation as a well established practice can solve the

73 reported that recovering and reusing wastewater may be a more sustainable solution compared to desalination or long distance freshwater transfers despite this it is emphasised that the use of microalgae biomass or tmww for food production depends on its acceptance by the population this can be supplied by complying with health surveillance standards and by meeting other recommendations and marketing standards 35 42 45 still mizyed 49 points out that legal aspects of normalising reuse are challenging and that for the proposal to work there must be participation by the population in brazil several factors mean that in many cases mwwt projects are implemented without the participation of the population which affects the performance of mwwt in this way participatory processes of the population combined with the products they can obtain through mwwt are essential for the success of the proposal 3 4 energy generation the need for a diversified energy mix with more affordable costs have made the conversion of biogas into electric energy inevitable 74 uasb is estimated to produce 15 l of biogas per inhabitant per day under ideal conditions in brazil 19 thus in a city with a population of 13 000 representing the average population of brazil s semi arid regions a biogas production of 195 m³ is expected which can generate about 300 kw h day 1 of energy these values were estimated from the per capita biogas production considering the operation of the system within the project values with no load or temperature variation studies indicate that a 5 ha hrp needs a 3 kw three phase motor operating 24 h a day 58 an hrp for wastewater post treatment in a city in brazil s semi arid region with 13 000 inhabitants and water consumption of 90 l inhabitant 1 day 1 requires an area of approximately 2 6 ha to be 0 30 m deep and operate with a hydraulic detention time hdt of 8 days considering the energy consumption as being proportional to the size of the hrp the biogas generated in the uasb could supply the energy demanded by it there would be remaining electricity to be used in productive activities fish farming hydroponics and irrigation which require pumping thus mwwt becomes independent of the cost fluctuations in electricity provided by the brazil s energy matrix and is presented as being sustainable 3 5 feasibility and benefits of the proposed mwwt in this context the mwwt combined with productive arrangements and the biorefinery meets the 17 sustainable development goals sdgs in the 2030 agenda 2 in addition to the treatment of wastewater it can provide a stable and reliable supply throughout the year especially in arid and semi arid regions 75 the biomass can be used contributing to the socioeconomic development of the population in the brazil s semi arid region in brazil s semi arid regions the income from irrigated cultivation is about ten times higher than rain dependent cultivation in normal years 76 this is due to rainfall irregularity in the region which can compromise production when the intermittent period between rains is prolonged 77 driving water available for irrigation is critical the main crops that are grown in the irrigated parts of the brazil s semi arid regions are cowpea manioc squash fodder for livestock and onions 76 it is important to highlight that productive activities can be developed in a modular way according to the financial resources availability in the same way raw wastewater should be evaluated to validate the application of the selected treatment system also tmww must be analysed before its application in productive activities according to hao et al 78 the recovery of water nutrients and energy manages to transform conventional wastewater treatment plants which emit pollutants and dissipate energy into stations that benefit the environment and approach the level of zero net impact although wastewater treatment is an impacting activity it cannot be avoided considering the percentage of wastewater collection in brazil s semi arid regions 22 7 and that municipal wastewater disposal practices comprise pits open trenches and in greater numbers direct discharge into bodies of water 6 the need to invest in sanitation is reaffirmed for the federal government the economic benefits of investing in sanitation include an estimated 1 5 gain in gross domestic product gdp and a return of us 4 3 for every dollar invested in sanitation services due to reduced health costs 79 according to hao et al 78 research should then focus on reducing impacts reusing water producing energy and using nutrients similar to the purpose of this study this is because they propose to reduce costs with electricity fish food nutrients for crops and water reuse all of these aspects work to reduce the environmental impacts associated with the treatment of wastewater 41 lopes et al 65 assessed the life cycle of wastewater treatment composed of uasb and cw they pointed out that the mwwt using uasb followed by cw is attractive for developing countries due to its operational simplicity in addition the generation of electricity through biogas contributed to the reduction of environmental impacts associated with the operation of mwwt when hrp is used schneider et al 80 pointed out that through life cycle assessment the cultivation of microalgae biomass can be carried out with low environmental impact obtaining a promising renewable raw material for various recovery routes 4 conclusion multicriteria decision analysis proved to be efficient in choosing an adequate treatment system for implementing in brazil s semi arid regions the productive activities of hydroponics fish farming and irrigation aim to improve the living conditions of the population in semi arid areas besides generating food employment and income they are modular and can be installed in isolation however wastewater characteristics should be evaluated prior to the implementation of any mwwt the proposal has benefits considering sanitation agriculture and sustainability in terms of electricity water and nutrients in addition with municipal wastewater treatment it is possible to promote
