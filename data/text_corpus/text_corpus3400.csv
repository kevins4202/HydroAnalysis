17000,although methane ch4 has been proven to be able to serve as an electron donor for bio reducing various oxidized contaminants e g selenate seo4 2 little is known regarding the roles of oxygen in methane based reduction processes here a methane based membrane biofilm reactor mbfr was established for evaluating the effects of oxygen supply rates on selenate reduction performance and microbial communities the oxygen supply rate played a dual role stimulatory or suppressive effect in selenate reduction rates depending on the presence or absence of dissolved oxygen do specifically selenate reduction rate was substantially enhanced when an appropriate oxygen rate e g 12 to 184 mg l d in this study was supplied but with negligible do the highest selenate reduction rate up to 34 mg se l d was obtained under an oxygen supply rate of 184 mg l d in contrast excessive oxygen supply rate 626 mg l d would significantly suppress selenate reduction rate under do level of 3 mg l accordingly though the high oxygen supply rate 626 mg l d would promote the expression of pmoa 5 9 109 copies g 1 the expression level of narg a recognized gene to mediate selenate reduction would be significantly downregulated 6 1 109 copies g 1 thus suppressing selenate reduction in contrast the expression of narg gene significantly increased to 2 8 1010 copies g 1 and the expression of pmoa gene could still maintain at 1 1 109 copies g 1 under an oxygen supply rate of 184 mg l d high throughput sequencing targeting 16s rrna gene pmoa and narg collectively suggested methylocystis acts as the major aerobic methanotroph in synergy with arthrobacter and variovorax which likely jointly reduce selenate to selenite seo3 2 and further to elemental selenium se0 methylocystis was predominant in the biofilm regardless of variations of oxygen supply rates while arthrobacter and variovorax were sensitive to oxygen fluctuation these findings provide insights into the effects of oxygen on methane dependent selenate reduction and suggest that it is feasible to achieve a higher selenate removal by regulating oxygen supply rates graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords

groundwater resulting from these anthropogenic factors is of particular concern coomar and mukherjee 2021 for instance mining wastewater typically contains selenate with a total concentration ranging from 3 μ g l to above 12 mg l santos et al 2015 due to its high toxicity selenate could cause human neurological and gastrointestinal disorders and deformities in waterfowls posing serious threats to both human health and aquatic ecosystem safety goldhaber 2003 presser 1994 biological reduction is an effective approach to eliminate selenate from water systems by converting it to elemental selenium se0 precipitates which can be readily separated from water systems when extra electron donors are supplied a number of microorganisms are able to reduce selenate to selenite seo3 2 by the action of

drawn increasing attention due to several advantages liu et al 2019 luo et al 2018a luo et al 2018b wu et al 2019 methane is a nontoxic and cost effective carbon source modin et al 2007 moreover the application of methane as an electron donor can avoid contamination risk for downstream as methane has a very poor solubility in water approximately 1 mm at 30 c and 1 atm haynes and gonzalez 2014 thus leaving no residues after usage methane dependent selenate reduction can proceed under both anaerobic and microaerobic conditions anaerobic oxidation of methane coupled to selenate reduction aom ser could be potentially carried out by archaea candidatus methanoperedens luo et al 2018a the identified aom pathways and high abundance of c type cytochromes imply candidatus methanoperedens might be able to carry out simultaneous aom and selenate reduction leu et al 2020 by contrast microaerobic oxidation of methane coupled to selenate reduction mom ser is mediated by a synergistic consortium consisting of aerobic methanotrophs and selenate reducing bacteria in which aerobic methanotrophs utilize oxygen to activate methane to generate intermediates e g methanol or acetate then which are utilized by coexisting selenate reducing bacteria for executing selenate reduction shi et al 2019 although several studies investigated methane dependent selenate reduction process the roles of oxygen have been overlooked on one hand oxygen is a crucial factor in triggering methane oxidation and regulating growth and metabolic activity of methanotrophs chistoserdova 2011 modin et al 2010 despite that methane driven selenate reduction could take place in the absence of oxygen the selenate removal rate is quite low 0 2 1 0 mg se l d luo et al 2018a compared to anaerobic conditions limited oxygen supply from the influent has been found to dramatically enhance selenate removal rate 12 mg se l d in the methane based membrane biofilm reactor mbfr systems lai et al 2016 on the other hand the presence of oxygen might negatively affect selenate reduction metabolisms associated with the tca cycle and glycolysis in the biofilms were likely suppressed so far the roles of oxygen in methane dependent selenate reduction process remain not clear and the optimal oxygen supply rates that are favourable for highly efficient methane driven selenate reduction are still unknown in this study we comprehensively assessed the effects of oxygen supply rates on methane driven selenate bio reduction process in a lab scale mbfr system both long term operation and batch tests were conducted to evaluate selenate reduction performance with various oxygen supply rates quantitative polymerase chain reaction qpcr and reverse transcription rt qpcr were utilized to monitor changes of gene abundance and expression levels of pmoa encoding β subunit of the particulate methane monooxygenase and narg encoding the catalytic subunit of respiratory nitrate reductase potentially involved in selenate reduction sabaty et al 2001 in the biofilms high throughput sequencing targeting 16s rrna gene pmoa and narg were jointly employed to identify functional microorganisms performing methane oxidation or selenate reduction the findings might provide insights into the roles of oxygen in methane supported selenate reduction process the results could be facilitated to the development of guiding strategies for methane based technologies to remove selenate more efficiently from contaminated water 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental setup a lab scale mbfr fig 1 with a working

mbfr to get an initial concentration of 12 mg se l while the oxygen supply rate was kept to be the same rate as the level adopted at each stage during the long term operation each batch test lasted for 6 hours and was conducted in triplicate eight gas and liquid samples were taken over the whole period of each batch test to monitor methane and selenate consumptions respectively triplicate

under various oxygen supply rates during long term operation the mbfr was operated in three successive stages over a period of 195 days during stage i day 0 54 i e the ho stage selenate was partially converted to selenite immediately after inoculation with selenate removal efficiency less than 20 fig 2 a and selenate removal rate srr at 0 48 mg se l d fig 2b when o2 supply rate was lower 184 mg l d in stage ii day 55 153 i e the mo stage selenate removal percentage gradually increased and finally achieved 100 on day 88 along with a higher srr 4 02 mg se l d when oxygen supply rate was further reduced to 12 mg l d in stage iii day 154 195 i e the lo stage selenate was still completely removed throughout the whole stage fig 2c meanwhile a progressive increase of calculated se0 concentrations was observed in both stages ii and iii the eds spectrum fig 3 a confirms se was the dominant element in the precipitates deposited within the biofilm the xps spectra fig 3b reflecting distinct se0 peaks in the selenate shaped biofilm sample compared to inoculum further supports the eds results moreover sem analysis fig 3c d reveals the presence of 100 to 300 nm diameter needle like and spherical se0 nanoparticles 3 2 effects of oxygen on microbial activities associated with methane oxidation and selenate reduction 3 2 1 effects of oxygen on methane oxidation and selenate reduction rates in order to further elucidate the roles of oxygen supply rates in methane oxidation coupled to selenate reduction batch tests were conducted in triplicate at the end of each stage during batch test a the average do concentration of 3 8 mg l was detected whereas it was consistently under detectable level in both batch b and c as shown in fig 4 a b c decrease of methane and selenate concentrations were observed but with different rates in three tests for methane oxidation the highest oxidation rate fig 4d was 0 24 mmol h i e 370 mg l d in batch a ho condition while it declined significantly p 0 001 to 0 10 mmol h i e 150 mg l d in batch b mo condition when oxygen supply rate was the lowest in batch c lo condition the methane oxidation rate further decreased to 0 02 mmol h i e 37 mg l d which was 12 times lower than that in batch a p 0 001 and 5 times lower than that in batch b p 0 001 differently the highest selenate removal rate of 0 0045 mmol se h i e 34 mg se l d was achieved in batch b fig 4e and it dramatically dropped to 0 0013 mmol se h i e 10 mg se l d in batch a p 0 001 and to 0 0018 mmol se h i e 14 mg l d in batch c p 0 001 there was no significant difference in selenate removal rates between batch a and c p 0 17 collectively it can be found that an appropriate oxygen supply rate e g 184 mg l d in this study would be favourable to driving the highest selenate reduction rate but too high 626 mg l d and too low 12 mg l d oxygen supply rate might have restricted selenate reduction rate 3 2 2 effects of oxygen on abundances and expressions of functional genes in order to investigate the responses of crucial functional genes pmoa and narg both qpcr and rt qpcr were employed to track the changes of abundances and expression levels of these two functional genes within three batch tests the abundance of pmoa was 8 2 1014 and 7 4 1014 copies g 1 under ho and mo conditions respectively fig 5 a but it reached the highest level of 2 5 1015 copies g 1 under lo condition p 0 001 a significant difference of pmoa abundance was also observed between ho and lo conditions p 0 001 different with qpcr data the highest transcription abundance of pmoa 5 9 109 copies g 1 was observed under ho condition fig 5b while it was significantly lower p 0 001 under mo and lo conditions 1 1 109 and 1 8 109 copies g 1 respectively similar to the gene pmoa the abundance of narg was 3 6 1015 copies g 1 under lo condition fig 5c which was significantly higher p 0 001 than that under ho 7 6 1013 copies g 1 and mo conditions 7 2 1013 copies g 1 in contrast the expression levels of narg fig 5d under lo and mo conditions was 2 2 1010 and 2 8 1010 copies g 1 which was significantly higher p 0 001 than that under ho condition 6 1 109 copies g 1 the expression ratio of pmoa and narg was further calculated by normalizing the transcription of gene to the abundance of gene i e mrna dna to assess the active functional communities it was obvious that the expression ratio of pmoa fig 5e dropped when oxygen supply rate was reduced the significant difference of pmoa transcriptional activity was observed between ho and mo conditions p 0 001 and ho and lo conditions p 0 001 respectively with regard to narg fig 5f its expression ratio under mo condition was significantly higher p 0 001 than that under ho and lo conditions which might have explained why the highest selenate removal was achieved in stage ii no significant difference of narg expression was found between ho and lo conditions p 0 08 3 3 changes of microbial community structure in response to various oxygen supply rates microbial communities of the inoculum and biofilms of all stages were characterized by high throughput 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing fig 6 a shows that candidatus methanoperedens i e n damo archaea dominated in the inoculum accounting for 36 3 of total microbial sequences while it disappeared in all biofilm samples indicating the adverse effect of oxygen on this anaerobic microorganism although it was absent in the inoculum methylocystis as a known aerobic methanotroph became the predominant genus in the biofilm samples accounting for 17 4 22 6 and 24 2 in stage i ii and iii respectively it was worth noting that variovorax was retained in the biofilms with an abundance of 0 2 6 3 during stages i iii additionally hyphomicrobium increased its relative abundance from 3 4 in stage i to 7 7 in stage iii functional gene based sequencing targeting pmoa and narg genes were further employed to identify the key aerobic methanotrophs and potential selenate reducing bacteria respectively similar to 16s rrna gene sequencing results methylocystis was again predominant in the pmoa gene containing community fig 6b with an abundance of 67 4 60 5 and 80 8 in stages i ii and iii respectively additionally methyloparacoccus was detected within the pmoa harbouring groups while its abundance decreased from 2 7 in stage i to 0 1 in stage ii and then disappeared in stage iii with regard to the narg containing community fig 6c the abundance of arthrobacter variovorax acidovorax and methyloceanibacter increased from 1 9 2 3 2 8 and 0 3 in stage i to 5 5 11 4 9 4 and 13 3 in stage ii respectively variovorax was further enriched in stage iii 13 6 but the abundances of acidovorax arthrobacter and methyloceanibacter decreased to 7 1 0 6 and undetected level respectively micromonospora and mycobacterium dominated the microbial community in stage i 24 8 and 8 0 respectively but they became much less abundant in stage ii 9 5 and 5 0 respectively these two genera eventually disappeared in stage iii 4 discussion 4 1 effects of oxygen supply rates on methane based selenate reduction although previous studies have documented that methane could be used as a sole electron donor for driving selenate reduction in mbfrs lai et al 2016 luo et al 2018a it is still not well understood how the oxygen supply rate affects methane based selenate reduction process herein this present study reports that the oxygen supply rate has either stimulatory or suppressive effects on selenate reduction in the methane based mbfr depending on the range of oxygen supply rate 4 1 1 stimulatory effect of oxygen on selenate reduction activity the significantly higher selenate reduction rate under mo condition than lo condition in batch tests fig 4 implied that an appropriate oxygen supply rate could stimulate selenate reduction in methane based mbfrs although very few studies have suggested candidatus methanoperedens is potentially able to couple anaerobic methane oxidation with selenate reduction leu et al 2020 luo et al 2018a many previous studies mainly achieved selenate removal through microaerobic oxidation of methane coupled to selenate reduction mom ser two steps are involved in mom ser process in which methane will be partially oxidized by aerobic methanotrophs into intermediates e g methanol or acetate then which will be used by selenate reducers to mediate selenate reduction typically the supply of oxygen is required for aerobic methanotrophs to activate methane oxidation for mom ser process with the limited supply of oxygen methane monooxygenase carried by aerobic methanotrophs incorporates one atom from oxygen into methane to break its carbon hydrogen bond thus likely releasing intermediates via a pyrophosphate mediated glycolytic pathway kalyuzhnaya et al 2013 compared to lo condition the higher expression ratio of pmoa gene under mo condition supports that the activity of methane monooxygenase was positively related to the oxygen supply rate therefore it is assumed that the adequate oxygen supply rate in stage ii i e mo condition enhanced ch4 oxidation thereby generating more intermediates to support selenate reduction this study tried to track whether any accumulation of possible intermediates including methanol and acetate was observed in the system however none of these intermediates mentioned above was detected during the entire experiment likely because all the generated intermediates could have been consumed completely the higher expression level and mrna dna ratio of narg gene under mo condition than that in lo condition fig 5 further validated the activity of nitrate reductase which might enable to mediate selenate reduction sabaty et al 2001 was enhanced with increased oxygen supply rate for stimulating selenate reduction it should be noted that do was undetected under both mo and lo conditions the results are consistent with the study of werner and kayser 1991 in which increased oxygen supply rate could improve nitrate removal rate as long as do was 1 mg l in a methane supplied continuous flow activated sludge reactor 4 1 2 suppressive effect of do on selenate reduction it should be pointed out that the methane based mbfr had the lowest seo4 2 reduction rate under ho condition regardless of long term operation fig 2a or batch tests fig 4e under this condition the highest ch4 oxidation rate fig 4d and the highest expression level of pmoa gene fig 5e were observed suggesting that methane might have been completely oxidized into co2 rather than organic intermediates the lowest mrna level of narg gene under ho condition further confirmed selenate reduction rate would be reduced due to the inhibited activity of nitrate reductase under ho condition therefore it can be inferred that in the methane based mbfr an excessive oxygen supply rate would suppress selenate reduction if there is considerable do e g 3 mg l in this study during long term operation in the microenvironment where methane dependent selenate reduction occurs in contrast the suppressive effect will be alleviated as long as do in the microenvironment is low enough e g 0 01 mg l a similar observation has also been reported by sun et al 2013 in which the raise of do from 0 to 3 mg l dramatically decreased denitrification rate differently shi et al 2019 reported the presence of oxygen did not inhibit selenate reduction in a similar methane based mbfr system even though the influent do was elevated from 0 2 mg l to 7 mg l given do in their system was 0 1 mg l during the whole operation time it seems that the range of oxygen supply rate tested in their study was relatively narrow which might have restricted to observe the inhibitory effect of oxygen on selenate reduction herein we inferred that the unsatisfied selenate reduction in the ho condition with the presence of do could be attributed to two reasons first compared to selenate oxygen is generally the preferred electron acceptor for methanotrophs and heterotrophs considering the redox potential of o2 h2o 820 mv is higher than that of seo4 2 seo3 2 480 mv nancharaiah and lens 2015 more gibbs energy is obtained for supporting microbial growth with oxygen as the electron acceptor second excessive do could induce oxidative pressure to selenate reducing bacteria which require anoxic conditions to mediate selenate reduction the microbial reduction of oxygen via respiratory chain would generate reactive oxygen species ros e g superoxide and hydroxyl radicals which have deleterious effects on microbial dna proteins and cytomembranes imlay 2002 particularly for anaerobes collectively we demonstrated that the variable oxygen supply rates could dramatically affect selenate removal rate in a methane based mbfr appropriate oxygen supply rate in a certain range is favourable for enhancing rates of both methane oxidation and selenate reduction however excessive oxygen supply could result in the presence of do thus damaging anoxic microenvironment and inhibiting selenate reduction therefore in order to maximize selenate reduction rate sufficient but appropriate oxygen should be delivered into the system to boost methane oxidation while at the same time the do concentration must be controlled to be undetected or at a lower level than the inhibitory concentration which requires further exploration 4 2 response of microbial communities to various oxygen supply rates although n damo microorganisms were inoculated initially they were not detected when stable selenate removal performance was achieved in stages ii and iii the disappearance of n damo microorganisms might be associated with the high oxygen supply rate in stage i which might have caused adverse effects on the growths and activities of these anaerobic microbes in contrast methylocystis became the predominant microorganism in the biofilms based on both 16s rrna gene and pmoa gene sequencing as known aerobic methanotrophs methylocystis contains many type ii methanotrophs kalyuzhnaya et al 2019 suggesting this genus might have contributed to methane oxidation in the mbfr it is noteworthy that the abundance of methylocystis kept high level 17 4 24 2 and 67 4 80 8 according to 16s rrna gene and pmoa gene sequencing respectively regardless of the variations of oxygen supply rate indeed methylocystis can survive in a wide variety of habitats with different ch4 o2 ratios cébron et al 2007 dedysh et al 2003 eller and frenzel 2001 knief et al 2006 nauer et al 2012 interestingly a previous study found methylocystis sp strain sc2 harbours two distinct methane monooxygenases pmmo1 and pmmo2 exhibiting different methane oxidation kinetics baani and liesack 2008 the enzyme pmmo1 only oxidizes methane at the concentration 600 ppmv while the pmmo2 is able to oxidize methane even at atmospheric concentration 2 ppmv such a unique physiological feature of methylocystis enables its survival advantages in the methane fed biofilms with fluctuating oxygen supply in contrast methyloparacoccus can be detected in stage i but it disappeared from the system in stage iii which should be associated with its lower oxygen affinity ability crossman et al 2004 notably arthrobacter and variovorax were detected in the biofilms according to narg gene based sequencing the relative abundance of these genera in the narg containing group obviously increased from stage i to stage ii in accordance with the improved seo4 2 reducing capability of the biofilms as a se resistant genus arthrobacter has been reported to possess the ability to reduce both selenate and selenite to se0 siddique et al 2005 sura de jong et al 2015 implying this genus might play a role in selenate and selenite reduction in the methane fed biofilms in particular in stages i and ii however species belonging to arthrobacter are generally aerobic bacteria santacruz calvo et al 2013 thus it is reasonable to observe the relative abundance of arthrobacter decreased in stage iii in contrast the relative abundance of variovorax a reported selenite reducing genus sura de jong et al 2015 increased continuously from stage i to stage iii in the narg containing group many variovorax species are facultative anaerobes and possess catalase for protecting their cells from being damaged by ros satola et al 2013 making them highly resistant to oxygen fluctuation additionally other dominant genera in narg containing group e g micromonospora luedemann 1971 hyphomicrobium urakami et al 1995 and methyloceanibacter vekeman et al 2016 are reported nitrate reducing bacteria considering that nitrate reductase carried by many nitrate reducing bacteria could also carry out selenate reduction sabaty et al 2001 these genera likely also play a role in selenate reduction based on these results we put forward that a cross feeding interaction was involved in the methane driven selenate reduction process it is hypothesized that methylocystis oxidizes methane and releases unknown intermediates likely methanol acetate modin et al 2007 wu et al 2019 to arthrobacter who implemented selenate reduction to selenite and further to se0 at the same time variovorax utilized intermediates to reduce selenite to se0 the specific response of these important genera to oxygen fluctuation shows different trends methylocystis retained a high abundance under various oxygen supply conditions while the abundance of arthrobacter first rose and then dropped when oxygen supply rates decreased gradually from ho condition to lo condition differently the abundance of facultatively variovorax kept increasing with decreasing oxygen supply rate it is worth noting that this study only employed dna based sequencing to track microbial communities rather than rna based sequencing for identifying active microbial communities thus the key players for methane oxidation and selenate reduction and their detailed metabolic pathways including to identify intermediates from methane oxidation in methane dependent selenate reduction need to be further revealed by combining more advanced analytical and molecular methods such as isotope and meta omics metagenomics meta transcriptomics and metaproteomics in the future 4 3 practical implications the findings of this study could be helpful to advance the development of ex situ methane based biological process for efficiently removing selenate from contaminated groundwater here we demonstrated that the oxygen supply rate plays a dual role stimulatory or suppressive effect in methane based selenate reduction depending on the presence or absence of do in order to achieve highly efficient selenate removal oxygen supply rate should be as high as possible to activate methane while do is required to be controlled to an extremely low level e g 0 01 mg l in this study to avoid its inhibitory effect further studies are required to explore the critical point of do that affects selenate reduction when treating real contaminated water it is assumed that selenate removal rate could be further improved with a higher oxygen supply rate provided that do is maintained at the undetectable level however a higher oxygen supply rate would result in a higher aeration energy consumption from the practical application perspective a lower specific requirement of oxygen for methane oxidation while maintaining favourable selenate removal efficiency would be more advantageous in the current system methane delivery rate was maintained at a constant level which can be further optimized to enhance operational performance moreover it will be interesting to investigate whether the impact of oxygen on methane driven bio reduction process is in a similar manner when treating a range of other electron acceptors e g perchlorate chromate and bromate which are typical oxidized contaminants in groundwater as well in addition considering oxygen generally exists in groundwater this study also contributes to developing guiding strategies for in situ selenate remediation process using methane abundant natural gas or biogas 5 conclusions in this study we demonstrated that the oxygen supply rate could significantly affect selenate removal rate in the methane based mbfr the main conclusions include the supply of oxygen is a prerequisite for microaerobic oxidation of methane coupled to selenate reduction the oxygen supply rate played either stimulatory or suppressive role in selenate reduction rates depending on the presence or absence of do an appropriate oxygen supply rate 184 mg l d could increase selenate reduction rate when do was kept at an undetected or low level e g 0 01 mg l the highest selenate reduction rate of 34 mg se l d was obtained under a medium oxygen supply rate 184 mg l d with undetectable do concentration nevertheless excessive oxygen supply e g oxygen supply rate of 626 mg l d resulted in suppressing selenate reduction due to the presence of do 3 mg l the expression levels of pmoa and narg genes were consistent with the microbial activities of methane oxidation and selenate reduction methylocystis kept dominant in the methane fed biofilm for oxidizing methane oxidation with different oxygen supply rates likely establishing a cross feeding interaction with oxygen

17000,although methane ch4 has been proven to be able to serve as an electron donor for bio reducing various oxidized contaminants e g selenate seo4 2 little is known regarding the roles of oxygen in methane based reduction processes here a methane based membrane biofilm reactor mbfr was established for evaluating the effects of oxygen supply rates on selenate reduction performance and microbial communities the oxygen supply rate played a dual role stimulatory or suppressive effect in selenate reduction rates depending on the presence or absence of dissolved oxygen do specifically selenate reduction rate was substantially enhanced when an appropriate oxygen rate e g 12 to 184 mg l d in this study was supplied but with negligible do the highest selenate reduction rate up to 34 mg se l d was obtained under an oxygen supply rate of 184 mg l d in contrast excessive oxygen supply rate 626 mg l d would significantly suppress selenate reduction rate under do level of 3 mg l accordingly though the high oxygen supply rate 626 mg l d would promote the expression of pmoa 5 9 109 copies g 1 the expression level of narg a recognized gene to mediate selenate reduction would be significantly downregulated 6 1 109 copies g 1 thus suppressing selenate reduction in contrast the expression of narg gene significantly increased to 2 8 1010 copies g 1 and the expression of pmoa gene could still maintain at 1 1 109 copies g 1 under an oxygen supply rate of 184 mg l d high throughput sequencing targeting 16s rrna gene pmoa and narg collectively suggested methylocystis acts as the major aerobic methanotroph in synergy with arthrobacter and variovorax which likely jointly reduce selenate to selenite seo3 2 and further to elemental selenium se0 methylocystis was predominant in the biofilm regardless of variations of oxygen supply rates while arthrobacter and variovorax were sensitive to oxygen fluctuation these findings provide insights into the effects of oxygen on

reduced to 12 mg l d in stage iii day 154 195 i e the lo stage selenate was still completely removed throughout the whole stage fig 2c meanwhile a progressive increase of calculated se0 concentrations was observed in both stages ii and iii the eds spectrum fig 3 a confirms se was the dominant element in the precipitates deposited within the biofilm the xps spectra fig 3b reflecting distinct se0 peaks in the selenate shaped biofilm sample compared to inoculum further supports the eds results moreover sem analysis fig 3c d reveals the presence of 100 to 300 nm diameter needle like and spherical se0 nanoparticles 3 2 effects of oxygen on microbial activities associated with methane oxidation and selenate reduction 3 2 1 effects of oxygen on methane oxidation and selenate reduction rates in order to further elucidate the roles of oxygen supply rates in methane oxidation coupled to selenate reduction batch tests were conducted in triplicate at the end of each stage during batch test a the average do concentration of 3 8 mg l was detected whereas it was consistently under detectable level in both batch b and c as shown in fig 4 a b c decrease of methane and selenate concentrations were observed but with different rates in three tests for methane oxidation the highest oxidation rate fig 4d was 0 24 mmol h i e 370 mg l d in batch a ho condition while it declined significantly p 0 001 to 0 10 mmol h i e 150 mg l d in batch b mo condition when oxygen supply rate was the lowest in batch c lo condition the methane oxidation rate further decreased to 0 02 mmol h i e 37 mg l d which was 12 times lower than that in batch a p 0 001 and 5 times lower than that in batch b p 0 001 differently the highest selenate removal rate of 0 0045 mmol se h i e 34 mg se l d was achieved in batch b fig 4e and it dramatically dropped to 0 0013 mmol se h i e 10 mg se l d in batch a p 0 001 and to 0 0018 mmol se h i e 14 mg l d in batch c p 0 001 there was no significant difference in selenate removal rates between batch a and c p 0 17 collectively it can be found that an appropriate oxygen supply rate e g 184 mg l d in this study would be favourable to driving the highest selenate reduction rate but too high 626 mg l d and too low 12 mg l d oxygen supply rate might have restricted selenate reduction rate 3 2 2 effects of oxygen on abundances and expressions of functional genes in order to investigate the responses of crucial functional genes pmoa and narg both qpcr and rt qpcr were employed to track the changes of abundances and expression levels of these two functional genes within three batch tests the abundance of pmoa was 8 2 1014 and 7 4 1014 copies g 1 under ho and mo conditions respectively fig 5 a but it reached the highest level of 2 5 1015 copies g 1 under lo condition p 0 001 a significant difference of pmoa abundance was also observed between ho and lo conditions p 0 001 different with qpcr data the highest transcription abundance of pmoa 5 9 109 copies g 1 was observed under ho condition fig 5b while it was significantly lower p 0 001 under mo and lo conditions 1 1 109 and 1 8 109 copies g 1 respectively similar to the gene pmoa the abundance of narg was 3 6 1015 copies g 1 under lo condition fig 5c which was significantly higher p 0 001 than that under ho 7 6 1013 copies g 1 and mo conditions 7 2 1013 copies g 1 in contrast the expression levels of narg fig 5d under lo and mo conditions was 2 2 1010 and 2 8 1010 copies g 1 which was significantly higher p 0 001 than that under ho condition 6 1 109 copies g 1 the expression ratio of pmoa and narg was further calculated by normalizing the transcription of gene to the abundance of gene i e mrna dna to assess the active functional communities it was obvious that the expression ratio of pmoa fig 5e dropped when oxygen supply rate was reduced the significant difference of pmoa transcriptional activity was observed between ho and mo conditions p 0 001 and ho and lo conditions p 0 001 respectively with regard to narg fig 5f its expression ratio under mo condition was significantly higher p 0 001 than that under ho and lo conditions which might have explained why the highest selenate removal was achieved in stage ii no significant difference of narg expression was found between ho and lo conditions p 0 08 3 3 changes of microbial community structure in response to various oxygen supply rates microbial communities of the inoculum and biofilms of all stages were characterized by high throughput 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing fig 6 a shows that candidatus methanoperedens i e n damo archaea dominated in the inoculum accounting for 36 3 of total microbial sequences while it disappeared in all biofilm samples indicating the adverse effect of oxygen on this anaerobic microorganism although it was absent in the inoculum methylocystis as a known aerobic methanotroph became the predominant genus in the biofilm samples accounting for 17 4 22 6 and 24 2 in stage i ii and iii respectively it was worth noting that variovorax was retained in the biofilms with an abundance of 0 2 6 3 during stages i iii additionally hyphomicrobium increased its relative abundance from 3 4 in stage i to 7 7 in stage iii functional gene based sequencing targeting pmoa and narg genes were further employed to identify the key aerobic methanotrophs and potential selenate reducing bacteria respectively similar to 16s rrna gene sequencing results methylocystis was again predominant in the pmoa gene containing community fig 6b with an abundance of 67 4 60 5 and 80 8 in stages i ii and iii respectively additionally methyloparacoccus was detected within the pmoa harbouring groups while its abundance decreased from 2 7 in stage i to 0 1 in stage ii and then disappeared in stage iii with regard to the narg containing community fig 6c the abundance of arthrobacter variovorax acidovorax and methyloceanibacter increased from 1 9 2 3 2 8 and 0 3 in stage i to 5 5 11 4 9 4 and 13 3 in stage ii respectively variovorax was further enriched in stage iii 13 6 but the abundances of acidovorax arthrobacter and methyloceanibacter decreased to 7 1 0 6 and undetected level respectively micromonospora and mycobacterium dominated the microbial community in stage i 24 8 and 8 0 respectively but they became much less abundant in stage ii 9 5 and 5 0 respectively these two genera eventually disappeared in stage iii 4 discussion 4 1 effects of oxygen supply rates on methane based selenate reduction although previous studies have documented that methane could be used as a sole electron donor for driving selenate reduction in mbfrs lai et al 2016 luo et al 2018a it is still not well understood how the oxygen supply rate affects methane based selenate reduction process herein this present study reports that the oxygen supply rate has either stimulatory or suppressive effects on selenate reduction in the methane based mbfr depending on the range of oxygen supply rate 4 1 1 stimulatory effect of oxygen on selenate reduction activity the significantly higher selenate reduction rate under mo condition than lo condition in batch tests fig 4 implied that an appropriate oxygen supply rate could stimulate selenate reduction in methane based mbfrs although very few studies have suggested candidatus methanoperedens is potentially able to couple anaerobic methane oxidation with selenate reduction leu et al 2020 luo et al 2018a many previous studies mainly achieved selenate removal through microaerobic oxidation of methane coupled to selenate reduction mom ser two steps are involved in mom ser process in which methane will be partially oxidized by aerobic methanotrophs into intermediates e g methanol or acetate then which will be used by selenate reducers to mediate selenate reduction typically the supply of oxygen is required for aerobic methanotrophs to activate methane oxidation for mom ser process with the limited supply of oxygen methane monooxygenase carried by aerobic methanotrophs incorporates one atom from oxygen into methane to break its carbon hydrogen bond thus likely releasing intermediates via a pyrophosphate mediated glycolytic pathway kalyuzhnaya et al 2013 compared to lo condition the higher expression ratio of pmoa gene under mo condition supports that the activity of methane monooxygenase was positively related to the oxygen supply rate therefore it is assumed that the adequate oxygen supply rate in stage ii i e mo condition enhanced ch4 oxidation thereby generating more intermediates to support selenate reduction this study tried to track whether any accumulation of possible intermediates including methanol and acetate was observed in the system however none of these intermediates mentioned above was detected during the entire experiment likely because all the generated intermediates could have been consumed completely the higher expression level and mrna dna ratio of narg gene under mo condition than that in lo condition fig 5 further validated the activity of nitrate reductase which might enable to mediate selenate reduction sabaty et al 2001 was enhanced with increased oxygen supply rate for stimulating selenate reduction it should be noted that do was undetected under both mo and lo conditions the results are consistent with the study of werner and kayser 1991 in which increased oxygen supply rate could improve nitrate removal rate as long as do was 1 mg l in a methane supplied continuous flow activated sludge reactor 4 1 2 suppressive effect of do on selenate reduction it should be pointed out that the methane based mbfr had the lowest seo4 2 reduction rate under ho condition regardless of long term operation fig 2a or batch tests fig 4e under this condition the highest ch4 oxidation rate fig 4d and the highest expression level of pmoa gene fig 5e were observed suggesting that methane might have been completely oxidized into co2 rather than organic intermediates the lowest mrna level of narg gene under ho condition further confirmed selenate reduction rate would be reduced due to the inhibited activity of nitrate reductase under ho condition therefore it can be inferred that in the methane based mbfr an excessive oxygen supply rate would suppress selenate reduction if there is considerable do e g 3 mg l in this study during long term operation in the microenvironment where methane dependent selenate reduction occurs in contrast the suppressive effect will be alleviated as long as do in the microenvironment is low enough e g 0 01 mg l a similar observation has also been reported by sun et al 2013 in which the raise of do from 0 to 3 mg l dramatically decreased denitrification rate differently shi et al 2019 reported the presence of oxygen did not inhibit selenate reduction in a similar methane based mbfr system even though the influent do was elevated from 0 2 mg l to 7 mg l given do in their system was 0 1 mg l during the whole operation time it seems that the range of oxygen supply rate tested in their study was relatively narrow which might have restricted to observe the inhibitory effect of oxygen on selenate reduction herein we inferred that the unsatisfied selenate reduction in the ho condition with the presence of do could be attributed to two reasons first compared to selenate oxygen is generally the preferred electron acceptor for methanotrophs and heterotrophs considering the redox potential of o2 h2o 820 mv is higher than that of seo4 2 seo3 2 480 mv nancharaiah and lens 2015 more gibbs energy is obtained for supporting microbial growth with oxygen as the electron acceptor second excessive do could induce oxidative pressure to selenate reducing bacteria which require anoxic conditions to mediate selenate reduction the microbial reduction of oxygen via respiratory chain would generate reactive oxygen species ros e g superoxide and hydroxyl radicals which have deleterious effects on microbial dna proteins and cytomembranes imlay 2002 particularly for anaerobes collectively we demonstrated that the variable oxygen supply rates could dramatically affect selenate removal rate in a methane based mbfr appropriate oxygen supply rate in a certain range is favourable for enhancing rates of both methane oxidation and selenate reduction however excessive oxygen supply could result in the presence of do thus damaging anoxic microenvironment and inhibiting selenate reduction therefore in order to maximize selenate reduction rate sufficient but appropriate oxygen should be delivered into the system to boost methane oxidation while at the same time the do concentration must be controlled to be undetected or at a lower level than the inhibitory concentration which requires further exploration 4 2 response of microbial communities to various oxygen supply rates although n damo microorganisms were inoculated initially they were not detected when stable selenate removal performance was achieved in stages ii and iii the disappearance of n damo microorganisms might be associated with the high oxygen supply rate in stage i which might have caused adverse effects on the growths and activities of these anaerobic microbes in contrast methylocystis became the predominant microorganism in the biofilms based on both 16s rrna gene and pmoa gene sequencing as known aerobic methanotrophs methylocystis contains many type ii methanotrophs kalyuzhnaya et al 2019 suggesting this genus might have contributed to methane oxidation in the mbfr it is noteworthy that the abundance of methylocystis kept high level 17 4 24 2 and 67 4 80 8 according to 16s rrna gene and pmoa gene sequencing respectively regardless of the variations of oxygen supply rate indeed methylocystis can survive in a wide variety of habitats with different ch4 o2 ratios cébron et al 2007 dedysh et al 2003 eller and frenzel 2001 knief et al 2006 nauer et al 2012 interestingly a previous study found methylocystis sp strain sc2 harbours two distinct methane monooxygenases pmmo1 and pmmo2 exhibiting different methane oxidation kinetics baani and liesack 2008 the enzyme pmmo1 only oxidizes methane at the concentration 600 ppmv while the pmmo2 is able to oxidize methane even at atmospheric concentration 2 ppmv such a unique physiological feature of methylocystis enables its survival advantages in the methane fed biofilms with fluctuating oxygen supply in contrast methyloparacoccus can be detected in stage i but it disappeared from the system in stage iii which should be associated with its lower oxygen affinity ability crossman et al 2004 notably arthrobacter and variovorax were detected in the biofilms according to narg gene based sequencing the relative abundance of these genera in the narg containing group obviously increased from stage i to stage ii in accordance with the improved seo4 2 reducing capability of the biofilms as a se resistant genus arthrobacter has been reported to possess the ability to reduce both selenate and selenite to se0 siddique et al 2005 sura de jong et al 2015 implying this genus might play a role in selenate and selenite reduction in the methane fed biofilms in particular in stages i and ii however species belonging to arthrobacter are generally aerobic bacteria santacruz calvo et al 2013 thus it is reasonable to observe the relative abundance of arthrobacter decreased in stage iii in contrast the relative abundance of variovorax a reported selenite reducing genus sura de jong et al 2015 increased continuously from stage i to stage iii in the narg containing group many variovorax species are facultative anaerobes and possess catalase for protecting their cells from being damaged by ros satola et al 2013 making them highly resistant to oxygen fluctuation additionally other dominant genera in narg containing group e g micromonospora luedemann 1971 hyphomicrobium urakami et al 1995 and methyloceanibacter vekeman et al 2016 are reported nitrate reducing bacteria considering that nitrate reductase carried by many nitrate reducing bacteria could also carry out selenate reduction sabaty et al 2001 these genera likely also play a role in selenate reduction based on these results we put forward that a cross feeding interaction was involved in the methane driven selenate reduction process it is hypothesized that methylocystis oxidizes methane and releases unknown intermediates likely methanol acetate modin et al 2007 wu et al 2019 to arthrobacter who implemented selenate reduction to selenite and further to se0 at the same time variovorax utilized intermediates to reduce selenite to se0 the specific response of these important genera to oxygen fluctuation shows different trends methylocystis retained a high abundance under various oxygen supply conditions while the abundance of arthrobacter first rose and then dropped when oxygen supply rates decreased gradually from ho condition to lo condition differently the abundance of facultatively variovorax kept increasing with decreasing oxygen supply rate it is worth noting that this study only employed dna based sequencing to track microbial communities rather than rna based sequencing for identifying active microbial communities thus the key players for methane oxidation and selenate reduction and their detailed metabolic pathways including to identify intermediates from methane oxidation in methane dependent selenate reduction need to be further revealed by combining more advanced analytical and molecular methods such as isotope and meta omics metagenomics meta transcriptomics and metaproteomics in the future 4 3 practical implications the findings of this study could be helpful to advance the development of ex situ methane based biological process for efficiently removing selenate from contaminated groundwater here we demonstrated that the oxygen supply rate plays a dual role stimulatory or suppressive effect in methane based selenate reduction depending on the presence or absence of do in order to achieve highly efficient selenate removal oxygen supply rate should be as high as possible to activate methane while do is required to be controlled to an extremely low level e g 0 01 mg l in this study to avoid its inhibitory effect further studies are required to explore the critical point of do that affects selenate reduction when treating real contaminated water it is assumed that selenate removal rate could be further improved with a higher oxygen supply rate provided that do is maintained at the undetectable level however a higher oxygen supply rate would result in a higher aeration energy consumption from the practical application perspective a lower specific requirement of oxygen for methane oxidation while maintaining favourable selenate removal efficiency would be more advantageous in the current system methane delivery rate was maintained at a constant level which can be further optimized to enhance operational performance moreover it will be interesting to investigate whether the impact of oxygen on methane driven bio reduction process is in a similar manner when treating a range of other electron acceptors e g perchlorate chromate and bromate which are typical oxidized contaminants in groundwater as well in addition considering oxygen generally exists in groundwater this study also contributes to developing guiding strategies for in situ selenate remediation process using methane abundant natural gas or biogas 5 conclusions in this study we demonstrated that the oxygen supply rate could significantly affect selenate removal rate in the methane based mbfr the main conclusions include the supply of oxygen is a prerequisite for microaerobic oxidation of methane coupled to selenate reduction the oxygen supply rate played either stimulatory or suppressive role in selenate reduction rates depending on the presence or absence of do an appropriate oxygen supply rate 184 mg l d could increase selenate reduction rate when do was kept at an undetected or low level e g 0 01 mg l the highest selenate reduction rate of 34 mg se l d was obtained under a medium oxygen supply rate 184 mg l d with undetectable do concentration nevertheless excessive oxygen supply e g oxygen supply rate of 626 mg l d resulted in suppressing selenate reduction due to the presence of do 3 mg l the expression levels of pmoa and narg genes were consistent with the microbial activities of methane oxidation and selenate reduction methylocystis kept dominant in the methane fed biofilm for oxidizing methane oxidation with different oxygen supply rates likely establishing a cross feeding interaction with oxygen

17001,phytoremediation has been proven to be an alternative in situ treatment technique for sulfonamide polluted wastewater however the fate of sulfonamides in the phytoremediation process of multiple sulfonamides coexistence is unclear therefore the possibility and mechanism of phytoremediation of ten sulfonamides by different wetland plants through hydroponics were investigated in this study the phytoremediation rates of σsulfonamides by different wetland plants were from 44 5 to 56 9 mass balance analysis showed that rhizosphere biodegradation 90 2 92 2 dominated the phytoremediation of σsulfonamides while hydrolysis 7 63 8 95 and plant uptake 0 05 0 17 accounted for a small proportion it is worth mentioning that the dissipation of the target sulfonamides in the hydroponic system followed the first order reaction kinetic model with half lives of 13 3 d to 53 3 d which are close to or even lower than that of aerobic biodegradation in river water sediment and piggery wastewater six of the ten spiked sulfonamides were detected in plant samples demonstrated that the selective uptake of plants under the coexistence of multiple sulfonamides the distribution of sulfonamides concentrations and uptake amounts in plant tissues followed the sequence of root stem leaf in this study but the distribution in stems and leaves needs further study the uptake and rhizosphere biodegradation of cyperus papyrus to sulfonamides are optimally resulting that its phytoremediation rate is significantly higher than other plants p 0 05 which indicates that plant species is one of the key factors affecting the phytoremediation efficiency of sulfonamides these findings verify the feasibility of phytoremediation of sulfonamides and provide new insights into the fate of sulfonamides in the process of phytoremediation keywords phytoremediation multiple sulfonamides fate rhizosphere biodegradation selective uptake1 introduction antibiotics and the by products have been found in soil and water ecosystems ubiquitous in recent years because of the incomplete metabolism by humans and animals 30 to up 90 and unsatisfactory removal by conventional wastewater treatment e g 48 77 by engineered biological wastewater treatment systems carvalho and santos 2016 oberoi et al 2019 antibiotic residuals especially in natural water systems has become a serious environmental problem in the 21st century because of the potential threat to the ecological safety and human health posed by bioaccumulation and biomagnification as well as the development of antibiotics resistance genes args and antibiotics resistance bacteria arb grenni et al 2018 tang et al 2020 wang et al 2019 among antibiotics sulfonamides are found to be the most common in water since the large consumption of human and veterinary medicine and their persistence in the aqueous environment carvalho and santos 2016 grenni et al 2018 according to the summary of a review some existing modern technologies cannot effectively remove sulfonamides and nearly 80 of used sulfonamides reach the biosphere baran et al 2011 for example the removal of sulfonamides by wastewater treatment plants wwtps with activated sludge process ranged from 280 to 100 with an average of about 24 baran et al 2011 concerns are growing about the deterioration of water quality caused by the discharge of sulfonamides and the long term impact caused by the accelerated evolution of sulfa resistant bacteria and the spread of sulfa resistant genes on the ecological environment and humans bai et al 2019 tian et al 2020 therefore it is urgent for an effective treatment technology to solve the problem of sulfonamide residues in surface water phytoremediation is a non destructive and cost effective in situ remediation technology that cleanses the environment through the plants themselves and their associated rhizosphere microbes to remove transform or contain toxic pollutants in environmental media such as contaminated soil sediment groundwater surface water and even the atmosphere pilon smits 2005 salt et al 1998 susarla et al 2002 plants and the rhizosphere microbes can remediate environmental contaminants via physical chemical and biological processes including stabilization accumulation degradation transformation and volatilization which can be classified into phytoextraction phytodegradation rhizo filtration phytostabilization and phytovolatilization kanwar et al 2020 liu et al 2013b pilon smits 2005 compared with the traditional physical and chemical techniques of soil remediation and wastewater treatment phytoremediation is a green technology with the advantages of low treatment cost controllable secondary pollution easy to follow up treatment and no damage to soil and aquatic ecological environment hu et al 2019 pilon smits 2005 hence this in situ remediation technology has been widely accepted and has become frontier research in environmental pollution control it is reported that phytoremediation can be used for the non noxious treatment of various pollutants including inorganic pollutants such as heavy metals metalloids and radionuclides ali et al 2013 mcgrath et al 2002 sharma et al 2015 and organic pollutants such as petroleum hydrocarbons ndimele 2010 polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons cristaldi et al 2017 pesticides singh and singh 2017 polychlorinated biphenyls aken et al 2010 as well as antibiotics hu et al 2019 therefore phytoremediation has gradually become the alternative technology for sulfonamides remediation studies have shown that phytoremediation with wetland plants is an alternative in situ treatment technology for sulfonamides polluted wastewater liu et al 2013a tai et al 2019 considering that the selection of candidate macrophytes is a key factor in a successful phytoremediation process rezania et al 2015 the selection of appropriate wetland plants for sulfonamides contaminated wastewater treatment is crucial it should be noted that the previous successful cases of phytoremediation antibiotics were always obtained from a single antibiotic exposure experiment hydroponic or soil culture guo et al 2020 hu et al 2019 panja et al 2020 singh et al 2019 yan et al 2019 under the premise of the co existence of multi sulfa antibiotics the phytoremediation efficiency by plants and the distribution characteristics of sulfonamides in different plant tissues are still unclear a recent study investigated the feasibility of removing five sulfonamides by canna indica and iris pseudacorus through hydroponic experiments but the trial period was only 7 days tai et al 2019 compared with other costly alternatives such as advanced oxidative processes activated carbon adsorption and membrane filtration phytoremediation is a relatively time consuming technique khalifa and alkhalf 2018 and the fate of sulfonamides in this long term process is also a scientific issue worthy of attention therefore this study aims to explore the possibility and mechanism of different wetland plants to repair multi sulfa antibiotics through hydroponics for one month and provide a basis for further understanding of the fate of sulfonamides in the phytoremediation process the main objectives of this study were to investigate 1 the phytoremediation efficiencies of different wetland plants in the treatment of sulfonamides contaminated wastewater 2 the fates of target sulfonamides in the hydroponic system 3 the bioaccumulation and translocation of sulfonamides in wetland plants 4 the performance of wetland plants in sulfonamides phytoremediation these findings will provide a more intuitive understanding and potential alternative for phytoremediation of antibiotic contaminated

laboratory technologies inc shanghai china 2 2 hydroponic experiment five common wetland plants including lythrum salicaria l s ruellia simplex r s acorus calamus a c cyperus papyrus c p and thalia dealbata t d were chosen for the hydroponic experiment in a greenhouse all the plants about half a month old and basically the same growth were purchased from the nursery after washing off the soil with running water these plants were transferred to 1 2 hoagland nutrient solution to adapt to growth over the next two weeks the detailed chemical composition of the hoagland nutrient solution is shown in si table s1 in addition the 1 2 hoagland nutrient solution spiked with 10 target sulfonamides 50 μg l for each antibiotic was prepared in advance for plant exposure experiments after adaptive growth nine healthy individuals of each species were selected for the hydroponic experiment in a greenhouse with a constant temperature 28 c and a photoperiod of 12 h per day all plants were planted in 5 l black pp buckets each filled with 3 l nutrient solution supplemented with antibiotics all plants were supported and fixed with black sponges to ensure that only the roots were in direct contact with the nutrient solution and were completely submerged three experimental groups per species were performed in triplicate including the treatment group plants cultivated with spiked solution blank group plants cultivated with nonspiked solution and control group spiked solution no plant during the one month cultivation the loss of nutrient solution of each experimental group was measured and recorded every day and the non spiked nutrient solution was added to keep it at a constant level meanwhile the concentrations of target sulfonamides in the culture solution were monitored at different time intervals and ph was monitored simultaneously moreover the weight and length of all plants were measured at the beginning and end of the hydroponic experiment at the end of the cultivation experiment all the plants were harvested and the nutrient solution on the surface of the roots was naturally dried in the greenhouse then each plant was divided into leaves stems and roots and further freeze dried crushed homogenized and stored at 20 c in the dark until extraction 2 3 sulfonamides extraction the extraction methods and instrumental analysis of target sulfonamides in water and plant samples are based on our previous studies chen et al 2020a zhou et al 2012 the quick easy cheap effective rugged and safe quechers pretreatment was applied for target sulfonamides extraction from different plant tissues roots stems and leaves specifically 0 2 g of pre treated plant tissue sample was weighed into a 50 ml centrifuge tube and then 50 μl of the internal standards work solutions 2 mg l each and 100 μl of the antibiotic standards work solutions 1 mg l each were added the samples were vortexed for 30 s and placed in the dark within a refrigerator at 4 c overnight to enable the spiked standards to fully contact the matrix then 5 ml of citric acid buffer ph 3 was added into the centrifuge tube and the suspension was mixed by a vortex mixer for 1 min afterwards 10 ml of acetonitrile with 1 0 acetic acid and the quechers extraction salt packet containing 4 g of anhydrous mgso4 1 g of sodium chloride 1 g of citrate acid and 1 g of sodium hydrogen citrate were added into each centrifuge tube the tubes were immediately sealed vortex shaken with a multi position vortexer talboys usa for 1 min and centrifuged at 3500 rpm for 5 min and then 7 ml of supernatant from each tube was transferred into a 10 ml centrifuge tube containing dispersive solid phase extraction sorbents 900 mg mgso4 and 150 mg psa the tubes with sorbents were vortex shaken for 30 s and centrifuged at 3500 rpm for 5 min and then 5 ml of the supernatant was piped into glass tubes evaporated to almost dryness under a gentle stream of nitrogen and then dissolved in 1 ml of methanol merck and filtered through 0 22 μm nylon filter before instrumental analysis in addition 60 μl of water sample containing hoagland nutrient solution was filtered by 0 22 μm polytetrafluoroethylene filter stored in brown vial and then 10 μl pre prepared buffer 2 formic acid and 20 mm ammonium acetate in ultrapure water and 30 μl internal standard in merck methanol were added the samples should be analyzed as soon as possible 2 4 instrumental analysis the target sulfonamides were analyzed by waters acquity ultra performance liquid chromatography uplc system coupled with the waters xevo tq s triple quadrupole mass spectrometer waters co milford ma usa in multiple reaction monitoring mrm mode all target compounds were separated by acquity uplc beh c18 column 50 mm 2 1 mm particle size 1 7 μm optimum separation was achieved by gradient elution the mobile phases were milli q water with 0 05 formic acid a and methanol b the mobile phase gradient started from 20 b at a flow rate of 0 3 ml min then ramped from 20 to 100 b in 4 5 min maintained at 100 b in 1 min decreased from 100 to 20 b in 0 5 min and finally maintained at 20 b in 2 5 min the column temperature was set at 40 c and the injection volume for each sample was 5 µl the ion source was electrospray ionization esi and positive ionization mode with a capillary voltage of 2 99 kv drying gas temperature of 300 c and drying gas flow rate of 800 l h the other operating conditions including source temperature desolvation temperature nebulizer gas flow and collision gas flow were set to 150 c 300 c 7 bar and 0 17 ml min respectively finally data acquisition and processing were conducted with masslynx v4 1 software 2 5 data analysis 2 5 1 mass balance analysis the mass balance analysis at the end of the hydroponic experiment can reflect the distribution characteristics of sulfonamides in the hydroponic system in this light proof hydroponic system the possible removal pathways of target sulfonamides mainly include rhizospheric microorganism degradation plant uptake and hydrolysis hence the mass balance calculation is based on the following formulas m r e m o v a l m m i c r o b i o l o g i c a l d e g r a d a t i o n m p l a n t u p t a k e m hydrolysis m r e m o v a l m 0 w a t e r m 30 w a t e r where m r e m o v a l represents the mass of target sulfonamides removal by phytoremediation m m i c r o b i o l o g i c a l d e g r a d a t i o n m p l a n t u p t a k e and m hydrolysis mean the mass of sulfonamides removal by rhizospheric microorganism degradation plant uptake and hydrolysis respectively m 0 w a t e r and m 30 w a t e r are the mass loads of the target sulfonamides in the aqueous phase at 0th and 30th day respectively 2 5 2 accumulation and translocation coefficient root concentration factor rcf was used to describe the accumulation potential of plant root for chemicals and translocation factor tf was used to describe the translocation potential of chemicals from root to shoot the calculation of rcf and tf was as follows r c f c r o o t c w a t e r t f c s h o o t c r o o t where c r o o t and c s h o o t mean the concentration of chemicals in root and shoot ng g dw c w a t e r means the concentration of chemicals in external solution ng ml 2 5 3 reaction kinetic model first order reaction kinetic model was applied to fit the reduced concentration of target sulfonamides in the phytoremediation experiment 30 d which can be expressed according to the following formula d c d t k c c t c 0 e k t where c 0 is the initial concentration of the target sulfonamide c t is the concentration of the target sulfonamide at time t and k is the first order rate constant combined with this equation the half life t 1 2 of the target sulfonamide can be calculated as follows t 1 2 ln 2 k where k is the first order rate constant of the target sulfonamide 3 results and discussion the basic parameters of culture solution and plants during the experiment were shown in si table s2 indicating that the ph 6 45 6 61 and the temperature of hoagland nutrient solution 26 3 26 8 c remained stable compared with the blank group plants cultivated with nonspiked solution the addition of antibiotics had no significant effect on plant growth height and weight 3 1 the fates of sulfonamides in the hydroponic system the average phytoremediation efficiencies of target sulfonamides by different wetland plants at the end of phytoremediation hydroponic 30 days were summarized in fig 1 a and si table s3 in general the phytoremediation rates of σsulfonamides in the treatment groups with wetland plants form 44 5 of l s to 56 9 of c p were significantly improved p 0 05 compared with the control groups without plants 4 51 fig 1 a this conclusion is also applicable to the comparison of single sulfanilamide between the treatment group and the control group si table s3 these results demonstrated that phytoremediation could reduce the potential risk of sulfonamides in wastewater to a certain extent previous studies have shown more satisfactory effects such as the phytoremediation rates of eichhornia crassipes on sulfadiazine 63 8 74 6 and the phytoremediation rates of vallisneria natans on sulfonamide 99 7 under the premise of single sulfanilamide exposure yan et al 2019 zhu et al 2020 however the phytoremediation efficiencies for single or multiple antibiotics exposures are often different and multiple antibiotics always coexist in the actual environment regrettably previous studies of multiple antibiotics exposure have shown unstable phytoremediation rates 15 2 98 4 of canna indica and iris pseudacorus to five sulfonamides and even lower phytoremediation rates 10 33 of chlorella vulgaris and chrysosporum ovalisporum to two sulfonamides and two fluoroquinolones chen et al 2020b tai et al 2019 hence more research is needed to understand whether phytoremediation is suitable for the treatment of actual antibiotic contaminated wastewater where multiple antibiotics coexist in addition the phytoremediation rates of σsulfonamides of c p treatment were significantly higher than that of other wetland plants p 0 05 fig 1 a indicating that plant species is one of the key factors affecting the phytoremediation efficiency of sulfonamides this is consistent with the view of other scholars that the removal ability of pollutants varies from species to species and the selection of plant species is a crucial part of effective phytoremediation for pollutants removal de stefani et al 2011 rezania et al 2015 singh et al 2003 although c p performed the best on sulfonamides phytoremediation in the present study this is only a relatively low phytoremediation efficiency 56 9 which indicates that finding more suitable wetland plants is necessary for the success of the phytoremediation of sulfonamides mass balance analysis can intuitively reflect the fates of target compounds in the hydroponic system the amounts and percentages of sulfonamides remaining in the hydroponic system and removed by various pathways including biodegradation plant uptake and hydrolysis are summarized fig 1 b c and si table s4 s5 results showed that the residual amounts of σsulfonamides ranged from 233 μg l s to 300 μg c p accounting for 43 1 c p to 55 5 l s of the total spiked the removal amount of σsulfonamides by biodegradation plant uptake and hydrolysis were 217 μg l s accounting for 40 2 283 μg c p accounting for 52 5 0 11 μg l s accounting for 0 02 0 52 μg l s accounting for 0 10 and 23 4 μg accounting for 4 30 of r s to 4 37 of t d respectively on this basis the overall analysis of the light tolerant hydroponic system is carried out from the three removal pathways of biodegradation plant uptake and hydrolysis revealing the phytoremediation mechanism as shown in fig 1 d biodegradation from 90 2 of l s to 92 2 of c p dominates the removal of sulfonamides hydrolysis from7 63 of c p to 8 95 of r s only accounts for a very small proportion and plant uptake from 0 05 of l s to 0 17 of c p seems almost negligible this is obviously different from the phytoremediation process of inorganic pollutants such as metals which mainly depends on the physiology and biochemistry processes such as the uptake transport and sequestration of hyperaccumulators mcgrath et al 2002 previous studies have proved that although the elimination of organochlorine pesticides by phytoremediation is based on plant uptake and transformation it mainly depends on microbial degradation in the root zone singh and singh 2017 the data obtained in this study now proves that the conclusion of phytoremediation of organic contaminants dominated by rhizosphere biodegradation is also applicable to the phytoremediation process of sulfanilamide antibiotics in fact biodegradation has been proven to be the main way for the dissipation of sulfonamides in natural and engineered ecosystems under aerobic or anaerobic conditions chen and xie 2018 in addition although plant and rhizosphere microorganisms have different contributions to pollutant removal they are indeed complementary and inseparable plant root zone provides a good living environment for microorganisms and plant exudates increase microbial activity and promote the microbial degradation or metabolism of pollutants glick 2014 correspondingly certain microorganisms would increase the vigor of the plant thereby facilitating the host plant to overcome the stress of pollutants singh and singh 2017 this may be one of the reasons why the growth of wetland plants in the treatment group was not inhibited under the pressure of sulfonamides contamination at the level of hundreds of μg l the dissipation behaviors of target sulfonamides in the hydroponic system during the one month incubation were shown in fig 2 the analysis results showed that the concentrations of target sulfonamides in the culture solution displayed a downward trend with the minimum dissipation rate of 20 2 sdm r s and the maximum dissipation rate of 79 1 spd c p the dissipation trends of all sulfonamides followed the first order reaction kinetic model with the r2 of the kinetic equation ranged from 0 6813 sdm a c to 0 9678 sm t d fig 2 and si table s3 the result is consistent with the conclusion of a review that is the biodegradation of sulfonamides always follows first order or zero order degradation kinetics both in the natural environment and in lab scale experiments chen and xie 2018 what s more different sulfonamides showed similar biodegradation patterns indicating that other researchers inferences might be correct that a certain sulfonamide degrader might be able to degrade other sulfonamides ingerslev and halling sørensen 2000 pérez et al 2005 in addition according to the results of the first order kinetic simulation in the phytoremediation process there were seven sulfonamides with half lives within 30 days 15 8 d 25 7 d for spd 17 8 d 25 7 d for smx 20 4 d 27 7 d for smr 14 4 d 25 7 d for sm 18 7 d 26 6 d for sx 18 7 d 26 6 d for smm and 13 3 d 27 7 d for sdo one with half lives between 20 days and 30 days 21 7 d 36 5 d for smz and the other two with half lives more than 30 days 34 7 d 49 5 d for scp and 36 5 d 53 3 d for sdm previous studies have shown that the half lives of sulfonamides are always more than two months and cannot be classified as easily biodegradable chemicals adamek et al 2016 ingerslev and halling sørensen 2000 khaleel et al 2013 even in activated sludge the removal of sulfonamides from wastewater requires a lag time of about 6 12 days chen and xie 2018 however it is worth mentioning that the simulated half lives of target sulfonamides in phytoremediation in the present study are similar or even lower than those of aerobic biodegradation in polluted river water 22 4 55 7 days sediment 22 8 71 2 days and piggery wastewater 30 1 69 3 days adamek et al 2016 chen et al 2017 the results showed that the presence of plants is even more important than aeration which fully illustrated the effectiveness of phytoremediation in treating sulfonamides contaminated wastewater 3 2 the fates of sulfonamides in wetland plants for the analysis of sulfonamides in plant tissues a c and c p were divided into root and shoot in consideration of the inseparability of stem and leaf while the other three plants were divided into root stem and leaf analysis results showed that six of the ten spiked sulfonamides were detected in plant samples including spd smx smr smz sm and scp si table s7 a study of phytoremediation exposed to 13 pharmaceutical chemicals showed that only 10 of the 13 compounds were detected in the leaves and stems of plants tanoue et al 2012 our previous monitoring results of plants in constructed wetland also found that plants can only absorb a few types of antibiotics in multi antibiotic contaminated domestic wastewater chen et al 2019 chen et al 2016 all these findings and the results of the present study demonstrated that plants can selectively absorb sulfonamides and other organic pollutants in the presence of multiple sulfonamides and organic pollutants of course it cannot be concluded that the antibiotics not detected in plants in this study cannot be absorbed by plants sdm was detected in salix fragilis l in a phytoremediation study with single antibiotic exposure michelini et al 2012 which was not detected in the present study such different results may be either the selective uptake of plants under multi sulfonamides exposure or the different uptake capacity of different plant species of the six sulfonamides all were detected in root and stem samples with the concentrations ranging from 0 63 0 03 ng g smx in t d to 15 8 0 38 ng g spd in c p and from 0 26 0 03 ng g smx in c p to 5 37 0 28 ng g spd in c p respectively si table s7 and only two were detected in leaf samples with the concentration ranging from 0 30 0 01 ng g smx in t d to 1 06 0 04 ng g smz in t d si table s7 as shown in fig 3 aand si table s7 the concentrations of σsulfonamides in different plant tissues followed the sequence of root from 11 9 0 41 ng g in t d to 50 5 0 16 ng g in l s stem from 3 01 0 17 ng g in t d to 13 7 0 27 ng g in c p leaf from 1 37 0 04 ng g in t d to 1 53 0 03 ng g in t d combining the dry weight of different tissues and the corresponding concentrations it is found that the storage amounts of detected sulfonamides in different tissues also followed the same order root from 110 43 1 ng in l s to 302 62 1 ng in c p stem from nd in l s and r s to 221 20 7 ng in c p leaf 14 5 4 63 ng g in t d fig 3 b and si table s8 hence regardless of the concentration and storage amount the distribution of sulfonamides in different tissues of wetland plants followed the sequence of root stem leaf many studies have confirmed that antibiotics mainly accumulated in the roots of plants rather than in the aboveground tissues datta et al 2013 hoang et al 2013 liu et al 2013a but the distribution characteristics of the aboveground tissues stem and leaf have not yet reached a uniform conclusion a study has found that the distribution of detected antibiotics in phragmites australis followed the sequence of leaf stem indicating that plant stems may only be the channel for conducting antibiotics liu et al 2013a however the results of this study are consistent with some other reports madikizela et al 2018 topal 2015 inferring that the concentration of antibiotics will decrease with the increase of transmission distance therefore it is believed that only by revealing the transportation mode of antibiotics in plant tissues can it be possible to clarify the distribution of antibiotics in stems and leaves bioconcentration factors such as rcf and tf can reflect the accumulation potential and translocation potential of organic compounds in organisms yan et al 2019 as shown in fig 4 c d and si table s9 the rcf of sulfonamides detected in different wetland plants ranged from 0 018 0 006 ml g smx in t d to 0 228 0 056 ml g sm in a c and the tf ranged from 0 706 0 374 smx in a c to 16 1 5 33 smz in t d however no matter the concentrations of root and shoot or bioconcentration factors rcf and tf the differences among different sulfonamides were more insignificant p 0 05 fig 4 in addition although the absorption process of pollutants is correlated with the physiological characteristics of plants such as the transpiration rate and plant growth increased weight and height and the physicochemical characteristics of target pollutants like aqueous solubility logkow pka and concentration garbisu and alkorta 2001 jamuna and noorjahan 2009 rezania et al 2015 there was no significant correlation between these parameters and the concentrations and uptake amounts of sulfonamides in plants in the present study p 0 05 previous studies have shown similar biodegradation patterns of different sulfonamides which indicated that the biodegradation of different sulfonamides may require similar enzymes ingerslev and halling sørensen 2000 pérez et al 2005 combined with the data of this study it can be inferred that a similar conclusion might be also applicable to the uptake process of sulfonamides in the plant in other words the specific plant that can strongly uptake a certain sulfonamide may also easily uptake other sulfonamides however the relatively low uptake of target sulfonamides ranging from 5 34 0 58 ng g to 42 1 3 60 ng g fig 5 and si table s7 indicated that the five wetland plants in this study are not hyperaccumulators of sulfonamides therefore the four sulfonamides not detected in plants may be caused by the degradation and transformation of endophytes or the plants themselves resulting in the concentration lower than the detection limit in addition the concentration 42 1 3 60 ng g and uptake amount 523 76 1 ng of c p for σsulfonamides were significantly higher than those of the other four wetland plants which were 5 34 0 58 ng g r s 19 6 4 58 ng g a c and 110 43 1 ng l s 361 42 3 ng t d respectively p 0 05 fig 5 and table s11 s12 moreover the biodegradation amount of σsulfonamides by rhizosphere microorganisms of c p 283 μg fig 1 b was also significantly higher than the other four wetland plants 217 μg 245 μg fig 1 b p 0 05 indicating that the ability of plants to absorb sulfonamides might be related to the ability of rhizosphere microorganisms to degrade and transform these sulfonamides it is reasonable to believe that both the maximum uptake and rhizosphere biodegradation of sulfonamides ultimately lead to the highest phytoremediation efficiency of c p in the present study 3 3 the limitations and challenges of antibiotic phytoremediation phytoremediation has been proven to be an alternative in situ remediation technology for antibiotic contaminated wastewater hu et al 2019 tai et al 2019 related research is mainly divided into mechanism exploration and application evaluation both of which have limitations and challenges khalifa and alkhalf 2018 the main challenges of mechanism exploration are mainly concentrated in the following four aspects 1 is the uptake of antibiotics by plants through active or passive transport or is it both what about the ratio if there is an active transport process in plants for antibiotics uptake how to identify the key enzymes and key genes 2 how do plants transport antibiotics to other tissues through their roots 3 how do environmental factors such as heavy metals dom or other organic pollutants affect the uptake and transport process and 4 are antibiotics degraded and transformed in plants if the answer is yes it is necessary to identify the products and determine the pathways in addition are endophytes involved in the process of antibiotics degradation and transformation only by answering the above four questions can we truly understand the mechanism of antibiotics uptake by plants while the main limitations of application evaluation include two aspects 1 lack of long term field experiment verification long term field experiments are needed to assess the effectiveness of phytoremediation the actual cost of application and how to build models to predict the interaction between plants and antibiotics 2 there are still many problems from theory to practical application of antibiotic phytoremediation such as shortening the phytoremediation time and improving the phytoremediation capacity khalifa and alkhalf 2018 hyperaccumulator for antibiotics may be the critical hitting point 4 conclusion this study proved that phytoremediation of wetland plants could be an alternative in situ remediation technology for sulfonamides pollution in wastewater plant species is one of the key factors affecting the phytoremediation efficiency of sulfonamides and cyperus papyrus is optimal in this study mass balance analysis showed that in the light proof hydroponic system rhizosphere biodegradation dominates the removal of sulfonamides hydrolysis only accounts for a very small proportion and plant uptake seems almost negligible the dissipation of target sulfonamides in the hydroponic system displayed a decreasing trend and followed the first order reaction kinetic model and the simulative half lives of target sulfonamides in phytoremediation in the present study are close to or even lower than that of aerobic biodegradation indicating that the presence of plants might be even more important than aeration in the treatment of sulfonamides contaminated wastewater six of the 10 spiked sulfonamides were detected in plant samples demonstrating that the uptake of sulfonamides by plants is selective under the condition of multiple sulfonamides coexistence the distribution of sulfonamides concentrations and uptake amounts in different plant tissues followed the sequence of root stem leaf in the present study but the distribution in stem and leaf needs further research similar uptake and transfer patterns of different sulfonamides in plants indicated that the specific plant that can strongly uptake one certain sulfonamide may also have a strong absorption capacity for other sulfonamides lastly cyperus papyrus had the best phytoremediation efficiency mainly due to its powerful uptake of sulfonamides and rhizosphere biodegradation declaration

17001,phytoremediation has been proven to be an alternative in situ treatment technique for sulfonamide polluted wastewater however the fate of sulfonamides in the phytoremediation process of multiple sulfonamides coexistence is unclear therefore the possibility and mechanism of phytoremediation of ten sulfonamides by different wetland plants through hydroponics were investigated in this study the phytoremediation rates of σsulfonamides by different wetland plants were from 44 5 to 56 9 mass balance analysis showed that rhizosphere biodegradation 90 2 92 2 dominated the phytoremediation of σsulfonamides while hydrolysis 7 63 8 95 and plant uptake 0 05 0 17 accounted for a small proportion it is worth mentioning that the dissipation of the target sulfonamides in the hydroponic system followed the first order reaction kinetic model with half lives of 13 3 d to 53 3 d which are close to or even lower than that of aerobic biodegradation in river water sediment and piggery wastewater six of the ten spiked sulfonamides were detected in plant samples demonstrated that the selective uptake of plants under the coexistence of multiple sulfonamides the distribution of sulfonamides concentrations and uptake amounts in plant tissues followed the sequence of root stem leaf in this study but the distribution in stems and leaves needs further study the uptake and rhizosphere biodegradation of cyperus papyrus to sulfonamides are optimally resulting that its phytoremediation rate is significantly higher than other plants p 0 05 which indicates that plant species is one of the key factors affecting the phytoremediation efficiency of sulfonamides these findings verify the feasibility of phytoremediation of sulfonamides and provide new insights into the fate of sulfonamides in the process of phytoremediation keywords phytoremediation multiple sulfonamides fate rhizosphere biodegradation selective uptake1 introduction antibiotics and the by products have been found in soil and water ecosystems ubiquitous in recent years because of the incomplete metabolism by humans and animals 30 to up 90 and unsatisfactory removal by conventional wastewater treatment e g 48 77 by engineered biological wastewater treatment systems carvalho and santos 2016 oberoi et al 2019 antibiotic residuals especially in natural water systems has become a serious environmental problem in the 21st century because of the potential threat to the ecological safety and human health posed by bioaccumulation and biomagnification as well as the development of antibiotics resistance genes args and antibiotics resistance bacteria arb grenni et al 2018 tang et al 2020 wang et al 2019 among antibiotics sulfonamides are found to be the most common in water since the large consumption of human and veterinary medicine and their persistence in the aqueous environment carvalho and santos 2016 grenni et al 2018 according to the summary of a review some existing modern technologies cannot effectively remove sulfonamides and nearly 80 of used sulfonamides reach the biosphere baran et al 2011 for example the removal of sulfonamides by wastewater treatment plants wwtps with activated sludge process ranged from 280 to 100 with an average of about 24 baran et al 2011 concerns are growing about the deterioration of water quality caused by the discharge of sulfonamides and the long term impact caused by the accelerated evolution of sulfa resistant bacteria and the spread of sulfa resistant genes on the ecological environment and humans bai et al 2019 tian et al 2020 therefore it is urgent for an effective treatment technology to solve the problem of sulfonamide residues in surface water phytoremediation is a non destructive and cost effective in situ remediation technology that cleanses the environment through the plants themselves and their associated rhizosphere microbes to remove transform or contain toxic pollutants in environmental media such as contaminated soil sediment groundwater surface water and even the atmosphere pilon smits 2005 salt et al 1998 susarla et al 2002 plants and the rhizosphere microbes can remediate environmental contaminants via physical chemical and biological processes including stabilization accumulation degradation transformation and volatilization which can be classified into phytoextraction phytodegradation rhizo filtration phytostabilization and phytovolatilization kanwar et al 2020 liu et al 2013b pilon smits 2005 compared with the traditional physical and chemical techniques of soil remediation and wastewater treatment phytoremediation is a green technology with the advantages of low treatment cost controllable secondary pollution easy to follow up treatment and no damage to soil and aquatic ecological environment hu et al 2019 pilon smits 2005 hence this in situ remediation technology has been widely accepted and has become frontier research in environmental pollution control it is reported that phytoremediation can be used for the non noxious treatment of various pollutants including inorganic pollutants such as heavy metals metalloids and radionuclides ali et al 2013 mcgrath et al 2002 sharma et al 2015 and organic pollutants such as petroleum hydrocarbons ndimele 2010 polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons cristaldi et al 2017 pesticides singh and singh 2017 polychlorinated biphenyls aken et al 2010 as well as antibiotics hu et al 2019 therefore phytoremediation has gradually become the alternative technology for sulfonamides remediation studies have shown that phytoremediation with wetland plants is an alternative in situ treatment technology for sulfonamides polluted wastewater liu et al 2013a tai et al 2019 considering that the selection of candidate macrophytes is a key factor in a successful phytoremediation process rezania et al 2015 the selection of appropriate wetland plants for sulfonamides contaminated wastewater treatment is crucial it should be noted that the previous successful cases of phytoremediation antibiotics were always obtained from a single antibiotic exposure experiment hydroponic or soil culture guo et al 2020 hu et al 2019 panja et al 2020 singh et al 2019 yan et al 2019 under the premise of the co existence of multi sulfa antibiotics the phytoremediation efficiency by plants and the distribution characteristics of sulfonamides in different plant tissues are still unclear a recent study investigated the feasibility of removing five sulfonamides by canna indica and iris pseudacorus through hydroponic experiments but the trial period was only 7 days tai et al 2019 compared with other costly alternatives such as advanced oxidative processes activated carbon adsorption and membrane filtration phytoremediation is a relatively time consuming technique khalifa and alkhalf 2018 and the fate of sulfonamides in this long term process is also a scientific issue worthy of attention therefore this study aims to explore the possibility and mechanism of different wetland plants to repair multi sulfa antibiotics through hydroponics for one month and provide a basis for further understanding of the fate of sulfonamides in the phytoremediation process the main objectives of this study were to investigate 1 the phytoremediation efficiencies of different wetland plants in the treatment of sulfonamides contaminated wastewater 2 the fates of target sulfonamides in the hydroponic system 3 the bioaccumulation and translocation of sulfonamides in wetland plants 4 the performance of wetland plants in sulfonamides phytoremediation these findings will provide a more intuitive understanding and potential alternative for phytoremediation of antibiotic contaminated

laboratory technologies inc shanghai china 2 2 hydroponic experiment five common wetland plants including lythrum salicaria l s ruellia simplex r s acorus calamus a c cyperus papyrus c p and thalia dealbata t d were chosen for the hydroponic experiment in a greenhouse all the plants about half a month old and basically the same growth were purchased from the nursery after washing off the soil with running water these plants were transferred to 1 2 hoagland nutrient solution to adapt to growth over the next two weeks the detailed chemical composition of the hoagland nutrient solution is shown in si table s1 in addition the 1 2 hoagland nutrient solution spiked with 10 target sulfonamides 50 μg l for each antibiotic was prepared in advance for plant exposure experiments after adaptive growth nine healthy individuals of each species were selected for the hydroponic experiment in a greenhouse with a constant temperature 28 c and a photoperiod of 12 h per day all plants were planted in 5 l black pp buckets each filled with 3 l nutrient solution supplemented with antibiotics all plants were supported and fixed with black sponges to ensure that only the roots were in direct contact with the nutrient solution and were completely submerged three experimental groups per species were performed in triplicate including the treatment group plants cultivated with spiked solution blank group plants cultivated with nonspiked solution and control group spiked solution no plant during the one month cultivation the loss of nutrient solution of each experimental group was measured and recorded every day and the non spiked nutrient solution was added to keep it at a constant level meanwhile the concentrations of target sulfonamides in the culture solution were monitored at different time intervals and ph was monitored simultaneously moreover the weight and length of all plants were measured at the beginning and end of the hydroponic experiment at the end of the cultivation experiment all the plants were harvested and the nutrient solution on the surface of the roots was naturally dried in the greenhouse then each plant was divided into leaves stems and roots and further freeze dried crushed homogenized and stored at 20 c in the dark until extraction 2 3 sulfonamides extraction the extraction methods and instrumental analysis of target sulfonamides in water and plant samples are based on our previous studies chen et al 2020a zhou et al 2012 the quick easy cheap effective rugged and safe quechers pretreatment was applied for target sulfonamides extraction from different plant tissues roots stems and leaves specifically 0 2 g of pre treated plant tissue sample was weighed into a 50 ml centrifuge tube and then 50 μl of the internal standards work solutions 2 mg l each and 100 μl of the antibiotic standards work solutions 1 mg l each were added the samples were vortexed for 30 s and placed in the dark within a refrigerator at 4 c overnight to enable the spiked standards to fully contact the matrix then 5 ml of citric acid buffer ph 3 was added into the centrifuge tube and the suspension was mixed by a vortex mixer for 1 min afterwards 10 ml of acetonitrile with 1 0 acetic acid and the quechers extraction salt packet containing 4 g of anhydrous mgso4 1 g of sodium chloride 1 g of citrate acid and 1 g of sodium hydrogen citrate were added into each centrifuge tube the tubes were immediately sealed vortex shaken with a multi position vortexer talboys usa for 1 min and centrifuged at 3500 rpm for 5 min and then 7 ml of supernatant from each tube was transferred into a 10 ml centrifuge tube containing dispersive solid phase extraction sorbents 900 mg mgso4 and 150 mg psa the tubes with sorbents were vortex shaken for 30 s and centrifuged at 3500 rpm for 5 min and then 5 ml of the supernatant was piped into glass tubes evaporated to almost dryness under a gentle stream of nitrogen and then dissolved in 1 ml of methanol merck and filtered through 0 22 μm nylon filter before instrumental analysis in addition 60 μl of water sample containing hoagland nutrient solution was filtered by 0 22 μm polytetrafluoroethylene filter stored in brown vial and then 10 μl pre prepared buffer 2 formic acid and 20 mm ammonium acetate in ultrapure water and 30 μl internal standard in merck methanol were added the samples should be analyzed as soon as possible 2 4 instrumental analysis the target sulfonamides were analyzed by waters acquity ultra performance liquid chromatography uplc system coupled with the waters xevo tq s triple quadrupole mass spectrometer waters co milford ma usa in multiple reaction monitoring mrm mode all target compounds were separated by acquity uplc beh c18 column 50 mm 2 1 mm particle size 1 7 μm optimum separation was achieved by gradient elution the mobile phases were milli q water with 0 05 formic acid a and methanol b the mobile phase gradient started from 20 b at a flow rate of 0 3 ml min then ramped from 20 to 100 b in 4 5 min maintained at 100 b in 1 min decreased from 100 to 20 b in 0 5 min and finally maintained at 20 b in 2 5 min the column temperature was set at 40 c and the injection volume for each sample was 5 µl the ion source was electrospray ionization esi and positive ionization mode with a capillary voltage of 2 99 kv drying gas temperature of 300 c and drying gas flow rate of 800 l h the other operating conditions including source temperature desolvation temperature nebulizer gas flow and collision gas flow were set to 150 c 300 c 7 bar and 0 17 ml min respectively finally data acquisition and processing were conducted with masslynx v4 1 software 2 5 data analysis 2 5 1 mass balance analysis the mass balance analysis at the end of the hydroponic experiment can reflect the distribution characteristics of sulfonamides in the hydroponic system in this light proof hydroponic system the possible removal pathways of target sulfonamides mainly include rhizospheric microorganism degradation plant uptake and hydrolysis hence the mass balance calculation is based on the following formulas m r e m o v a l m m i c r o b i o l o g i c a l d e g r a d a t i o n m p l a n t u p t a k e m hydrolysis m r e m o v a l m 0 w a t e r m 30 w a t e r where m r e m o v a l represents the mass of target sulfonamides removal by phytoremediation m m i c r o b i o l o g i c a l d e g r a d a t i o n m p l a n t u p t a k e and m hydrolysis mean the mass of sulfonamides removal by rhizospheric microorganism degradation plant uptake and hydrolysis respectively m 0 w a t e r and m 30 w a t e r are the mass loads of the target sulfonamides in the aqueous phase at 0th and 30th day respectively 2 5 2 accumulation and translocation coefficient root concentration factor rcf was used to describe the accumulation potential of plant root for chemicals and translocation factor tf was used to describe the translocation potential of chemicals from root to shoot the calculation of rcf and tf was as follows r c f c r o o t c w a t e r t f c s h o o t c r o o t where c r o o t and c s h o o t mean the concentration of chemicals in root and shoot ng g dw c w a t e r means the concentration of chemicals in external solution ng ml 2 5 3 reaction kinetic model first order reaction kinetic model was applied to fit the reduced concentration of target sulfonamides in the phytoremediation experiment 30 d which can be expressed according to the following formula d c d t k c c t c 0 e k t where c 0 is the initial concentration of the target sulfonamide c t is the concentration of the target sulfonamide at time t and k is the first order rate constant combined with this equation the half life t 1 2 of the target sulfonamide can be calculated as follows t 1 2 ln 2 k where k is the first order rate constant of the target sulfonamide 3 results and discussion the basic parameters of culture solution and plants during the experiment were shown in si table s2 indicating that the ph 6 45 6 61 and the temperature of hoagland nutrient solution 26 3 26 8 c remained stable compared with the blank group plants cultivated with nonspiked solution the addition of antibiotics had no significant effect on plant growth height and weight 3 1 the fates of sulfonamides in the hydroponic system the average phytoremediation efficiencies of target sulfonamides by different wetland plants at the end of phytoremediation hydroponic 30 days were summarized in fig 1 a and si table s3 in general the phytoremediation rates of σsulfonamides in the treatment groups with wetland plants form 44 5 of l s to 56 9 of c p were significantly improved p 0 05 compared with the control groups without plants 4 51 fig 1 a this conclusion is also applicable to the comparison of single sulfanilamide between the treatment group and the control group si table s3 these results demonstrated that phytoremediation could reduce the potential risk of sulfonamides in wastewater to a certain extent previous studies have shown more satisfactory effects such as the phytoremediation rates of eichhornia crassipes on sulfadiazine 63 8 74 6 and the phytoremediation rates of vallisneria natans on sulfonamide 99 7 under the premise of single sulfanilamide exposure yan et al 2019 zhu et al 2020 however the phytoremediation efficiencies for single or multiple antibiotics exposures are often different and multiple antibiotics always coexist in the actual environment regrettably previous studies of multiple antibiotics exposure have shown unstable phytoremediation rates 15 2 98 4 of canna indica and iris pseudacorus to five sulfonamides and even lower phytoremediation rates 10 33 of chlorella vulgaris and chrysosporum ovalisporum to two sulfonamides and two fluoroquinolones chen et al 2020b tai et al 2019 hence more research is needed to understand whether phytoremediation is suitable for the treatment of actual antibiotic contaminated wastewater where multiple antibiotics coexist in addition the phytoremediation rates of σsulfonamides of c p treatment were significantly higher than that of other wetland plants p 0 05 fig 1 a indicating that plant species is one of the key factors affecting the phytoremediation efficiency of sulfonamides this is consistent with the view of other scholars that the removal ability of pollutants varies from species to species and the selection of plant species is a crucial part of effective phytoremediation for pollutants removal de stefani et al 2011 rezania et al 2015 singh et al 2003 although c p performed the best on sulfonamides phytoremediation in the present study this is only a relatively low phytoremediation efficiency 56 9 which indicates that finding more suitable wetland plants is necessary for the success of the phytoremediation of sulfonamides mass balance analysis can intuitively reflect the fates of target compounds in the hydroponic system the amounts and percentages of sulfonamides remaining in the hydroponic system and removed by various pathways including biodegradation plant uptake and hydrolysis are summarized fig 1 b c and si table s4 s5 results showed that the residual amounts of σsulfonamides ranged from 233 μg l s to 300 μg c p accounting for 43 1 c p to 55 5 l s of the total spiked the removal amount of σsulfonamides by biodegradation plant uptake and hydrolysis were 217 μg l s accounting for 40 2 283 μg c p accounting for 52 5 0 11 μg l s accounting for 0 02 0 52 μg l s accounting for 0 10 and 23 4 μg accounting for 4 30 of r s to 4 37 of t d respectively on this basis the overall analysis of the light tolerant hydroponic system is carried out from the three removal pathways of biodegradation plant uptake and hydrolysis revealing the phytoremediation mechanism as shown in fig 1 d biodegradation from 90 2 of l s to 92 2 of c p dominates the removal of sulfonamides hydrolysis from7 63 of c p to 8 95 of r s only accounts for a very small proportion and plant uptake from 0 05 of l s to 0 17 of c p seems almost negligible this is obviously different from the phytoremediation process of inorganic pollutants such as metals which mainly depends on the physiology and biochemistry processes such as the uptake transport and sequestration of hyperaccumulators mcgrath et al 2002 previous studies have proved that although the elimination of organochlorine pesticides by phytoremediation is based on plant uptake and transformation it mainly depends on microbial degradation in the root zone singh and singh 2017 the data obtained in this study now proves that the conclusion of phytoremediation of organic contaminants dominated by rhizosphere biodegradation is also applicable to the phytoremediation process of sulfanilamide antibiotics in fact biodegradation has been proven to be the main way for the dissipation of sulfonamides in natural and engineered ecosystems under aerobic or anaerobic conditions chen and xie 2018 in addition although plant and rhizosphere microorganisms have different contributions to pollutant removal they are indeed complementary and inseparable plant root zone provides a good living environment for microorganisms and plant exudates increase microbial activity and promote the microbial degradation or metabolism of pollutants glick 2014 correspondingly certain microorganisms would increase the vigor of the plant thereby facilitating the host plant to overcome the stress of pollutants singh and singh 2017 this may be one of the reasons why the growth of wetland plants in the treatment group was not inhibited under the pressure of sulfonamides contamination at the level of hundreds of μg l the dissipation behaviors of target sulfonamides in the hydroponic system during the one month incubation were shown in fig 2 the analysis results showed that the concentrations of target sulfonamides in the culture solution displayed a downward trend with the minimum dissipation rate of 20 2 sdm r s and the maximum dissipation rate of 79 1 spd c p the dissipation trends of all sulfonamides followed the first order reaction kinetic model with the r2 of the kinetic equation ranged from 0 6813 sdm a c to 0 9678 sm t d fig 2 and si table s3 the result is consistent with the conclusion of a review that is the biodegradation of sulfonamides always follows first order or zero order degradation kinetics both in the natural environment and in lab scale experiments chen and xie 2018 what s more different sulfonamides showed similar biodegradation patterns indicating that other researchers inferences might be correct that a certain sulfonamide degrader might be able to degrade other sulfonamides ingerslev and halling sørensen 2000 pérez et al 2005 in addition according to the results of the first order kinetic simulation in the phytoremediation process there were seven sulfonamides with half lives within 30 days 15 8 d 25 7 d for spd 17 8 d 25 7 d for smx 20 4 d 27 7 d for smr 14 4 d 25 7 d for sm 18 7 d 26 6 d for sx 18 7 d 26 6 d for smm and 13 3 d 27 7 d for sdo one with half lives between 20 days and 30 days 21 7 d 36 5 d for smz and the other two with half lives more than 30 days 34 7 d 49 5 d for scp and 36 5 d 53 3 d for sdm previous studies have shown that the half lives of sulfonamides are always more than two months and cannot be classified as easily biodegradable chemicals adamek et al 2016 ingerslev and halling sørensen 2000 khaleel et al 2013 even in activated sludge the removal of sulfonamides from wastewater requires a lag time of about 6 12 days chen and xie 2018 however it is worth mentioning that the simulated half lives of target sulfonamides in phytoremediation in the present study are similar or even lower than those of aerobic biodegradation in polluted river water 22 4 55 7 days sediment 22 8 71 2 days and piggery wastewater 30 1 69 3 days adamek et al 2016 chen et al 2017 the results showed that the presence of plants is even more important than aeration which fully illustrated the effectiveness of phytoremediation in treating sulfonamides contaminated wastewater 3 2 the fates of sulfonamides in wetland plants for the analysis of sulfonamides in plant tissues a c and c p were divided into root and shoot in consideration of the inseparability of stem and leaf while the other three plants were divided into root stem and leaf analysis results showed that six of the ten spiked sulfonamides were detected in plant samples including spd smx smr smz sm and scp si table s7 a study of phytoremediation exposed to 13 pharmaceutical chemicals showed that only 10 of the 13 compounds were detected in the leaves and stems of plants tanoue et al 2012 our previous monitoring results of plants in constructed wetland also found that plants can only absorb a few types of antibiotics in multi antibiotic contaminated domestic wastewater chen et al 2019 chen et al 2016 all these findings and the results of the present study demonstrated that plants can selectively absorb sulfonamides and other organic pollutants in the presence of multiple sulfonamides and organic pollutants of course it cannot be concluded that the antibiotics not detected in plants in this study cannot be absorbed by plants sdm was detected in salix fragilis l in a phytoremediation study with single antibiotic exposure michelini et al 2012 which was not detected in the present study such different results may be either the selective uptake of plants under multi sulfonamides exposure or the different uptake capacity of different plant species of the six sulfonamides all were detected in root and stem samples with the concentrations ranging from 0 63 0 03 ng g smx in t d to 15 8 0 38 ng g spd in c p and from 0 26 0 03 ng g smx in c p to 5 37 0 28 ng g spd in c p respectively si table s7 and only two were detected in leaf samples with the concentration ranging from 0 30 0 01 ng g smx in t d to 1 06 0 04 ng g smz in t d si table s7 as shown in fig 3 aand si table s7 the concentrations of σsulfonamides in different plant tissues followed the sequence of root from 11 9 0 41 ng g in t d to 50 5 0 16 ng g in l s stem from 3 01 0 17 ng g in t d to 13 7 0 27 ng g in c p leaf from 1 37 0 04 ng g in t d to 1 53 0 03 ng g in t d combining the dry weight of different tissues and the corresponding concentrations it is found that the storage amounts of detected sulfonamides in different tissues also followed the same order root from 110 43 1 ng in l s to 302 62 1 ng in c p stem from nd in l s and r s to 221 20 7 ng in c p leaf 14 5 4 63 ng g in t d fig 3 b and si table s8 hence regardless of the concentration and storage amount the distribution of sulfonamides in different tissues of wetland plants followed the sequence of root stem leaf many studies have confirmed that antibiotics mainly accumulated in the roots of plants rather than in the aboveground tissues datta et al 2013 hoang et al 2013 liu et al 2013a but the distribution characteristics of the aboveground tissues stem and leaf have not yet reached a uniform conclusion a study has found that the distribution of detected antibiotics in phragmites australis followed the sequence of leaf stem indicating that plant stems may only be the channel for conducting antibiotics liu et al 2013a however the results of this study are consistent with some other reports madikizela et al 2018 topal 2015 inferring that the concentration of antibiotics will decrease with the increase of transmission distance therefore it is believed that only by revealing the transportation mode of antibiotics in plant tissues can it be possible to clarify the distribution of antibiotics in stems and leaves bioconcentration factors such as rcf and tf can reflect the accumulation potential and translocation potential of organic compounds in organisms yan et al 2019 as shown in fig 4 c d and si table s9 the rcf of sulfonamides detected in different wetland plants ranged from 0 018 0 006 ml g smx in t d to 0 228 0 056 ml g sm in a c and the tf ranged from 0 706 0 374 smx in a c to 16 1 5 33 smz in t d however no matter the concentrations of root and shoot or bioconcentration factors rcf and tf the differences among different sulfonamides were more insignificant p 0 05 fig 4 in addition although the absorption process of pollutants is correlated with the physiological characteristics of plants such as the transpiration rate and plant growth increased weight and height and the physicochemical characteristics of target pollutants like aqueous solubility logkow pka and concentration garbisu and alkorta 2001 jamuna and noorjahan 2009 rezania et al 2015 there was no significant correlation between these parameters and the concentrations and uptake amounts of sulfonamides in plants in the present study p 0 05 previous studies have shown similar biodegradation patterns of different sulfonamides which indicated that the biodegradation of different sulfonamides may require similar enzymes ingerslev and halling sørensen 2000 pérez et al 2005 combined with the data of this study it can be inferred that a similar conclusion might be also applicable to the uptake process of sulfonamides in the plant in other words the specific plant that can strongly uptake a certain sulfonamide may also easily uptake other sulfonamides however the relatively low uptake of target sulfonamides ranging from 5 34 0 58 ng g to 42 1 3 60 ng g fig 5 and si table s7 indicated that the five wetland plants in this study are not hyperaccumulators of sulfonamides therefore the four sulfonamides not detected in plants may be caused by the degradation and transformation of endophytes or the plants themselves resulting in the concentration lower than the detection limit in addition the concentration 42 1 3 60 ng g and uptake amount 523 76 1 ng of c p for σsulfonamides were significantly higher than those of the other four wetland plants which were 5 34 0 58 ng g r s 19 6 4 58 ng g a c and 110 43 1 ng l s 361 42 3 ng t d respectively p 0 05 fig 5 and table s11 s12 moreover the biodegradation amount of σsulfonamides by rhizosphere microorganisms of c p 283 μg fig 1 b was also significantly higher than the other four wetland plants 217 μg 245 μg fig 1 b p 0 05 indicating that the ability of plants to absorb sulfonamides might be related to the ability of rhizosphere microorganisms to degrade and transform these sulfonamides it is reasonable to believe that both the maximum uptake and rhizosphere biodegradation of sulfonamides ultimately lead to the highest phytoremediation efficiency of c p in the present study 3 3 the limitations and challenges of antibiotic phytoremediation phytoremediation has been proven to be an alternative in situ remediation technology for antibiotic contaminated wastewater hu et al 2019 tai et al 2019 related research is mainly divided into mechanism exploration and application evaluation both of which have limitations and challenges khalifa and alkhalf 2018 the main challenges of mechanism exploration are mainly concentrated in the following four aspects 1 is the uptake of antibiotics by plants through active or passive transport or is it both what about the ratio if there is an active transport process in plants for antibiotics uptake how to identify the key enzymes and key genes 2 how do plants transport antibiotics to other tissues through their roots 3 how do environmental factors such as heavy metals dom or other organic pollutants affect the uptake and transport process and 4 are antibiotics degraded and transformed in plants if the answer is yes it is necessary to identify the products and determine the pathways in addition are endophytes involved in the process of antibiotics degradation and transformation only by answering the above four questions can we truly understand the mechanism of antibiotics uptake by plants while the main limitations of application evaluation include two aspects 1 lack of long term field experiment verification long term field experiments are needed to assess the effectiveness of phytoremediation the actual cost of application and how to build models to predict the interaction between plants and antibiotics 2 there are still many problems from theory to practical application of antibiotic phytoremediation such as shortening the phytoremediation time and improving the phytoremediation capacity khalifa and alkhalf 2018 hyperaccumulator for antibiotics may be the critical hitting point 4 conclusion this study proved that phytoremediation of wetland plants could be an alternative in situ remediation technology for sulfonamides pollution in wastewater plant species is one of the key factors affecting the phytoremediation efficiency of sulfonamides and cyperus papyrus is optimal in this study mass balance analysis showed that in the light proof hydroponic system rhizosphere biodegradation dominates the removal of sulfonamides hydrolysis only accounts for a very small proportion and plant uptake seems almost negligible the dissipation of target sulfonamides in the hydroponic system displayed a decreasing trend and followed the first order reaction kinetic model and the simulative half lives of target sulfonamides in phytoremediation in the present study are close to or even lower than that of aerobic biodegradation indicating that the presence of plants might be even more important than aeration in the treatment of sulfonamides contaminated wastewater six of the 10 spiked sulfonamides were detected in plant samples demonstrating that the uptake of sulfonamides by plants is selective under the condition of multiple sulfonamides coexistence the distribution of sulfonamides concentrations and uptake amounts in different plant tissues followed the sequence of root stem leaf in the present study but the distribution in stem and leaf needs further research similar uptake and transfer patterns of different sulfonamides in plants indicated that the specific plant that can strongly uptake one certain sulfonamide may also have a strong absorption capacity for other sulfonamides lastly cyperus papyrus had the best phytoremediation efficiency mainly due to its powerful uptake of sulfonamides and rhizosphere biodegradation declaration

17002,this study investigated the regeneration of pfas saturated granular activated carbons gacs by microwave mw irradiation two commercially available gacs bituminous coal based gac bcgac and lignite coal based gac lcgac were saturated with perfluorooctanoic acid pfoa and perfluorooctane sulfonic acid pfos and then irradiated at different mw conditions applied power 125 500 w irradiation time 3 12 min the performance of mw regeneration for pfos or pfoa saturated gacs was assessed by evaluating the variation of gac adsorption capacity regeneration efficiency re and weight loss percentage wl moreover the effect of mw irradiation on gac textural properties e g surface area and pore volume was examined through n2 adsorption isotherms additionally five successive adsorption regeneration cycles were carried out at the mw operational condition that allowed to reach the target temperature t 600 c while minimizing the wl both gacs exhibited a strong ability to convert mw irradiation into a rapid temperature increase 150 c min 1 at 500 w the highest values of re 90 for both pfoa and pfos saturated gacs were obtained at mw irradiation conditions that employed short regeneration time 3 min and optimal temperature indeed the highest re did not occur at the highest temperatures 750 c due to the damage of gac porous structure particularly for lcgac after five cycles the observed values of re 65 and a moderate weight loss 7 demonstrated the good performance of mw irradiation for regenerating pfoa and pfos saturated bcgac the obtained findings pointed out that mw irradiation is a promising alternative regeneration technique for pfas saturated gac graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords gac adsorption contaminants of emerging concern cec microwave mw irradiation poly and perfluoroalkyl substances pfas regeneration 1 introduction poly and perfluoroalkyl substances pfas are a class of anthropogenic compounds that attracted attention worldwide as contaminants of high concern ateia et al 2019 itrc 2020 over several decades they have been used in an array of formulations for the manufacture of several commercial products such as fire fighting foams food packing stain repellents and non stick cookware buck et al 2011 rahman et al 2014 the widespread use of pfas is certainly ascribable to their unique properties such as chemical thermal stability and hydrophilic lipophilic nature imparted by chemical composition gagliano et al 2020 itrc 2017 pfas structure is made up of a c f chain of varying length and it also includes a charged functional group attached at one end e g carboxylic or sulfonic acid buck et al 2011 du et al 2014 consequently pfas are categorized into long chain and short chain according to c f chain length and into perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acids pfcas and perfluoroalkyl sulfonic acids pfsas according to the type of functional group buck et al 2011 itrc 2017 recently pfas have been called forever chemicals due to their persistence and mobility in environment as well as their toxicity for human and wildlife crawford et al 2017 hölzer et al 2009 sorlini et al 2019 their occurrence in water bodies is the result of consumer product degradation firefighting activities and discharges of fluorochemical manufacturing facilities ateia et al 2019 hu et al 2016 consequently pfas have been detected worldwide from ng l 1 to μg l 1 or even mg l 1 levels at some contaminated sites gagliano et al 2020 rahman et al 2014 amongst long chain pfas perfluorooctanoic acid pfoa and perfluorooctane sulfonic acid pfos has been the most widely used and although their production has been banned they have been detected in groundwater surface water wastewater and tap water around the world gagliano et al 2020 takagi et al 2008 the need for efficient pfas removal from water is a growing need as a result of increasing regulatory attention and general concern regarding the exposure effects kucharzyk et al 2017 park et al 2020 sorlini et al 2019 in recent years a significant progress has been made to investigate the application of innovative advanced technologies such as plasma treatment electrochemical and photocatalysis ji et al 2020 ross et al 2018 nevertheless at pilot and full scale operations adsorption using granular activated carbon gac has been the most widely used approach for treatment of pfas contaminated water du et al 2014 gagliano et al 2020 shivakoti et al 2010 however periodic gac replacement is required from an environmental and sustainability standpoint the regeneration of exhausted ac is a more attractive alternative then landfill disposal which could lead to a secondary contamination pathway the regeneration should allow an increase in gac lifetime restoring its adsorption capacity by removing the adsorbed pfas gagliano et al 2020 yuen and hameed 2009 however the regeneration of pfas exhausted gac is a challenging task for both water utilities and activated carbon manufactures among different regeneration techniques chemical regeneration using a solution of sodium salts and organic alcohol allows the desorption of pfas molecules out of carbon pores wang et al 2014 woodard et al 2017 however the use of organic alcohol has negative impacts for full scale applications and consequently on site regeneration is not feasible gagliano et al 2020 furthermore the management of eluate having high pfas concentration is another limiting factor of chemical regeneration over the years the thermal regeneration of exhausted gac has been extensively performed at 800 1000 c under mildly oxidizing atmospheric conditions usually carbon dioxide and steam guo and du 2012 zanella et al 2014 however these conditions lead to a considerable amount of carbon lost 5 15 by attrition burn off and washout and subsequent decline in the adsorption capacity zanella et al 2014 furthermore thermal regeneration under oxidative gases negatively affects carbon porous structure e g a decrease in micropore volume and a shift to pores of narrower sizes and it may lead to changes in carbon functional groups the carbonization of adsorbates may also result in pore blockage due to coke formation ania et al 2005 therefore the development of alternative regeneration techniques for pfas exhausted gac is highly desirable in order to i avoid the harmful secondary pollution after landfill disposal ii save costs related to gac replacement iii restore gac adsorption capacity while ensuring the preservation of its porous structure gagliano et al 2020 yuen and hameed 2009 developed for radar and communication purposes microwave mw irradiation is a well established technology alternative to conventional heating it has also been recently proposed as a potentially viable approach for regenerating gac saturated with both organic and inorganic compounds ania et al 2007 ao et al 2018 falciglia et al 2020b foo and hameed 2012 compared to conventional thermal heating mw irradiation offers several advantages interior heating higher heating rates selective heating greater control of the heating process no direct contact between the heating source and heated materials and reduced equipment size and waste falciglia et al 2018 kim et al 2014 previous studies have pointed out the outperformance of the mw over conventional thermal regeneration for saturated activated carbons ania et al 2005 durán jiménez et al 2019 the major driving force of the treatment is the dielectric nature of the irradiated material e g activated carbon which allows the conversion of low power irradiation energy into a rapid temperature increase ania et al 2007 falciglia et al 2020a its dielectric heating capacity leads to a large reduction in treatment time and energy consumption making the application cost effective ao et al 2018 falciglia et al 2018 jointly with high gac dielectric features high mechanical strength and a good resistance towards heat and radiation are other essential features for promoting gac regeneration by mw irradiation ania et al 2007 biniak et al 1997 durán jiménez et al 2019 gagliano et al 2019 to the best of our knowledge the applicability of mw irradiation for regenerating pfas saturated gacs has not been reported in the literature therefore the aim of the present study was to systematically examine the regeneration of two commercially available gacs saturated with selected long chain pfas i e pfoa and pfos by mw irradiation for multiple adsorption regeneration cycles mw regeneration was performed at different operational conditions mw power levels and irradiation times in order to examine the variation in gac adsorption capacity in terms of regeneration efficiency and gac weight loss percentage afterwards the optimum temperature for mw regeneration with the lowest gac weight loss was selected to carry out five successive pfas adsorption regeneration cycles the changes in gac textural properties e g surface area and pore volume after mw irradiation were assessed through n2 adsorption isotherms in order to evaluate the mw effect on gac porous structure 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials the two commercial gacs selected for the experiments are obtained from steam activation of bituminous coal bcgac and lignite coal lcgac and they were purchased from calgon carbon corporation and norit respectively table 1 both gacs have been extensively tested in pfas removal studies and they are currently employed at water treatment facilities kothawala et al 2017 liu et al 2019 ochoa herrera and sierra alvarez 2008 park et al 2020 as received gacs were washed in distilled and deionized water ddw several times dried at 100 c overnight and then stored in a desiccator until use the dried gacs were sieved at 10 20 mesh size in order to obtain a fraction from 0 85 to 2 mm pfos cas n 1763 23 1 96 purity and pfoa cas n 335 67 1 96 purity were obtained from sigma aldrich liquid chromatography lc grade ammonium acetate acetonitrile and water were purchased from fischer scientific table s1 supplementary materials reports the physicochemical properties of pfoa and pfos investigated in this study 2 2 adsorption and mw regeneration experiments in order to obtain gacs both bcgac and lcgac fully saturated with pfoa and pfos gac samples were saturated with high concentrated 500 mg l 1 solution of pfoa or pfos in ddw to ensure that the active sites on gac inner surface were fully occupied foo 2018 sun et al 2017 five grams of gac bcgac or lcgac were added to 200 ml of solution pfoa or pfos in ddw the mixture was kept stirred 180 rpm at room temperature 25 1 c for 24 h to ensure that the equilibrium was established as also confirmed with the preliminary tests which was in agreement with previous experimental studies ochoa herrera and sierra alvarez 2008 yao et al 2014 after saturation aqueous samples were centrifugated to separate the activated carbons before analysis through liquid chromatography mass spectrometry lc ms ms as described in analytical methods section in order to measure the remaining concentration of compounds in solution the amount of pfoa and pfos adsorbed by bcgac and lcgac was calculated as follows 1 q v c 0 c f m where q is the adsorption capacity mg g 1 c0 mg l 1 and cf mg l 1 are the initial and final concentrations of each compound in the solution respectively and v l is the volume of the solution and m g is the gac mass pfoa or pfos saturated bcgac and lcgac were separated from liquid solution through vacuum filtration and transferred into ceramic crucible for the regeneration experiments a modified domestic 2 45 ghz mw oven equipped with cyclonic inverter owing a maximum power of 1 25 kw was employed for the saturated gac regeneration purpose the temperature t c reached by gacs after mw irradiation was recorded through a k type thermocouple omega engineering inc u s a before performing mw regeneration of pfas saturated gac 5 g of bcgac or lcgac separately were subjected to mw irradiation at different power levels from 125 to 500 w and irradiation times from 3 to 12 min to develop the temperature profiles consequently based on temperature reached by gacs several mw irradiation conditions combinations of power and irradiation time were selected and applied for the regeneration of pfoa and pfos saturated gacs the dried regenerated gac was employed in the subsequent adsorption test and a small amount 20 mg was used for gac characterization as reported in section 2 3 adsorption tests were carried out as reported above the efficiency of mw regeneration was evaluated by means of the regeneration efficiency re and the single step desorption efficiency ssde specifically ssde allows the understanding of pfoa and pfos desorption among different cycles whereas re enables to study the evolution of the overall yield of mw regeneration the re was calculated as followed 2 re q i q 0 100 where qi is the adsorption capacity of the mw regenerated gac and q0 is the adsorption capacity of the virgin gac whereas the ssde was determined by 3 ssde q n q n 1 100 where qn and qn 1 are the adsorption capacities of the mw regenerated gac in a given cycle n and in the previous regeneration cycle n 1 respectively besides the re and ssde gac weight loss percentage wl represents another important parameter could affect the applicability of mw for the regeneration of pfoa and pfos saturated gac it was calculated as 4 wl w 0 w t w 0 100 where w0 and wt are the mass of gac g before and after mw irradiation respectively the operating conditions i e irradiation power and irradiation time which allow the achievement of the highest re and the lowest wl values were selected for the successive five adsorption regeneration cycles in order to verify the potential leaching of pfos or pfoa and their related shorter chain compounds as degradation products from mw regenerated gacs 5 g of pfoa or pfos saturated bcgac after mw regeneration irradiated at t 600 c were added to 200 ml of ddw pfas free solution or to 200 ml of meoh with naoh 100 mmol l 1 meoh naoh solution the two mixtures were kept stirred 180 rpm at room temperature 25 1 c for 48 h then liquid samples from the two mixtures were withdrawn and analysed through lc ms ms as described below in order to determine the residual concentrations of pfas both long and short chain compounds potentially released from mw regenerated bcgac in ddw or meoh naoh solution specifically meoh naoh solution was selected due to its high pfas recovery from gac 90 100 in agreement with xiao et al 2020 2 3 gac characterization the surface areas pore volumes and pore size distributions of gac samples before and after mw irradiation were measured by nitrogen physisorption data at 77 k after degassing the samples at 298 k for 10 h with asap 2020 analyzer micromeritics instrument corp u s brunauer emmett teller bet equation was used to calculate the specific surface area whereas the pore size distribution of gac samples were determined from the nitrogen isotherms using the density functional theory dft dastgheib et al 2004 lowell et al 1985 the reproducibility of measurements was assessed from triplicate data of randomly selected samples and the relative standard deviation rsd of bet surface area micropore volume and total pore volume resulted less than 4 2 4 analytical method the determination of pfoa and pfos was conducted using the method described by park et al 2020 with few modifications specifically the high volume direct injection was performed using a liquid chromatography coupled to esi triple quadrupole mass spectrometer agilent 6470 lc tq operated in the negative ionization mode the mobile phase in lc grade solvents was a 100 mm ammonium acetate in water ph 10 b acetonitrile a combination of 50 of a and 50 of b was delivered at a flow rate of 0 4 ml min 1 by the binary pump an agilent zorbax rrhd eclipse plus c18 column 2 1 100 mm 1 8 µm particle size was installed at the binary pump moreover polytetrafluoroethylene free vials caps and septa were used to reduce pfas background data acquisition was performed in multiple reaction monitoring mrm mode for each compound two mrm transitions pfos 499 80 499 99 pfoa 413 169 413 369 were used for quantification and confirmation respectively due to the high concentrations used in the present study samples were diluted with lc grade water to obtain concentrations ranging between 5 500 μg l 1 afterwards calibration curves were constructed and the correlation coefficients r2 of the calibration curves for pfos and pfoa were 0 98 based on the lowest acceptable calibration standard the detection limit of both pfoa and pfos measurements was 1 μg l 1 for selected experiments carried out to monitor the potential release of pfas from mw regenerated gac the analytical determination of other pfas listed in table s2 was conducted using the method described above with few modifications in these measurements the detection limit was 0 4 μg l 1 3 results and discussion 3 1 gac temperature profiles and weight loss during mw irradiation the variation of gacs temperature with irradiation times at different power levels is shown in fig 1 the comparison of the temperature profiles reveals that both bcgac and lcgac have the same trend where temperature increases with increasing the irradiation time and power however lcgac reached higher temperature than bcgac when the mw power was 375 w for irradiation time longer than 3 min moreover at the highest power investigated 500 w the increase in temperature c with irradiation time min was faster for lcgac than bcgac 156 and 146 c min 1 respectively overall among the operational conditions investigated the irradiation at 500 w for 5 min resulted in the highest gac temperatures which were 730 and 780 c for bcgac and on lcgac respectively however temperatures 600 c were also attained at a lower mw power 250 w applied for 6 min and above demonstrating the ability of gacs to convert a low adsorbed mw power into a rapid temperature increase regardless of power applied both gacs reached the minimal value of 250 c after 1 min of irradiation which correspond to a t increase ratio of 250 c min 1 this sharp rise of gac temperature within short irradiation times is the key factor in the mw regeneration process the difference in temperature profiles observed for the bcgac and lcgac samples may be ascribed to difference in their chemical composition the oxygen content in lcgac is higher than that of bcgac 8 7 and 5 9 respectively cheng et al 2005 dastgheib et al 2004 indeed most of oxygen functionalities are polar functional groups which are more prone to absorb mw energy than nonpolar ones pi et al 2017 providing a plausible explanation for the highest temperature reached in lcgac during the mw irradiation the variation of weight loss with temperature increase on bcgac and lcgac samples irradiated at several power levels and irradiation times is shown in fig 2 the gac weight loss wl increased linearly with the increase in temperature r2 0 98 and the highest wls were 6 1 and 6 9 for bcgac and lcgac respectively weight loss is one of the main factors affecting the scaling up of the mw technology especially to calculate the cost of gac replacement as previously demonstrated by falciglia et al 2020a wl t relationship may also be useful in the selection of commercially available gacs at a comparable value of adsorption capacity for a target compound gac characterized by lower wl and sharp t rise should be preferred since it is more prone to mw irradiation or thermal regeneration among the different experimental conditions investigated in the present study to develop temperature profiles six combinations of power w and irradiation time t min were selected for the regeneration of pfas saturated gac table 2 these combinations of power and irradiation time correspond to a total consumed energy e in the 0 025 0 038 kwh range remya and lin 2011 specifically the highest e is achievable applying a power of 375 w for an irradiation time of 6 min whereas the lowest one is attained when gac samples were irradiated at 125 w for 12 min 250 w for 6 min or 500 w for 3 min the mw irradiation conditions employed in the present study were selected based on the criterion of maintaining the gac both bcgac and lcgac temperature over 600 c which would allow the pfoa and pfos thermal desorption from gacs this value can be referred to the thermogravimetric tga analysis of pfoa and pfos chemical compounds as reported elsewhere wang et al 2011 xiao et al 2020 the tga analysis conducted under n2 atmosphere revealed a single step degradation of pfos at 425 500 c while pfoa degradation started at lower temperature 300 c moreover it was demonstrated that the total thermal decomposition of a wide group of pfas including pfoa and pfos occurred at 600 c or above wang et al 2011 watanabe et al 2018 2016 xiao et al 2020 indeed pfas molecules thermally destabilized are transferred from gac to gas phase with the potential generation of organofluorine compounds xiao et al 2020 whereas pfas thermal destruction requires temperatures higher than 900 c which are commonly employed at carbon manufacture plants for gac reactivation process itrc 2018 xiao et al 2020 consequently for the regeneration purpose the mw irradiation conditions power and irradiation time applied in the present study were set to ensure the achievement of temperature needed for pfoa and pfos thermal decomposition avoiding the damage of gac it should be highlighted that when bcgac and lcgac were irradiated at 125 w for 12 min the gac temperatures were much lower than 600 c 300 c however this combination of power and time 125 w for 12 min was selected as control experiment to further understand the pfas desorption process 3 2 mw regeneration of pfoa saturated gacs the results from batch adsorption experiments showed that the adsorption capacity of pfoa was 20 0 mg g 1 and 21 9 mg g 1 on virgin bcgac and lcgac respectively pfoa saturated bcgac and lcgac samples were irradiated at several mw operational conditions table 2 temperature weight loss and regeneration efficiency of pfoa saturated gacs observed are depicted in fig 3 as expected pfoa saturated gac samples irradiated at 125 w for 12 min reached temperature of 268 and 340 c respectively far from the target temperature of 600 c fig 3a which also corresponded to the lowest wls 2 for the bcgac sample and 6 5 for the lcgac overall pfoa saturated lcgac samples exhibited higher wl than pfoa saturated bcgac samples although in some cases the temperatures reached by gac samples were almost the same e g mw irradiation at 250 w for 6 and 8 min moreover the highest temperatures were reached for both pfoa saturated lcgac and bcgac samples 753 and 685 c respectively at the power of 375 w applied for 6 min the temperatures recorded at the end of the mw regeneration process for both bcgac and lcgac were almost similar to that reached by the virgin gacs when irradiated at the same conditions fig 1 this suggests that gac acts as the major mw absorbing phase durán jiménez et al 2019 mao et al 2015 and the presence of adsorbed pfoa had small influence on the conversion of electromagnetic energy into heat during mw irradiation the regeneration efficiency re calculated according to eq 2 for pfoa saturated bcgac and lcgac as a function of different mw powers and irradiation times is shown in fig 3b barring two conditions obtained for 125 w 12 min and 375 w 6 min separately discussed the re values were in the range of 75 94 for both the pfoa saturated bcgac and lcgac the lowest values of re 30 were obtained when pfoa saturated gac samples bcgac and h3000 were irradiated at 125 w for 12 min this combination of mw power and irradiation time which corresponds to a total consumed energy of 0 025 kwh seems to be insufficient for regenerating pfoa saturated gac due to the low temperatures reached fig 3a the unsatisfactory regeneration at 125 w for 12 min was also supported by gac textural characterization after mw irradiation as detailed below based on re values obtained it can be argued that the highest mw regeneration efficiency did not occur at the highest total power consumed 0 038 kwh which was obtained for a mw irradiation of 375 w for 6 min at this irradiation condition the highest temperatures have been reached by pfoa bcgac and pfoa lcgac 685 and 753 c respectively nevertheless re for pfoa bcgac was 74 3 and re for pfoa lcgac was 60 3 fig 3b the re values of mw irradiation for regenerating pfoa saturated gac are similar to that obtained in previous experimental studies after one adsorption regeneration cycle in which mw irradiation was investigated for the regeneration of ac samples saturated with organic e g methylene blue phenol chloramphenicol ania et al 2005 foo 2018 sun et al 2017 and inorganic compounds e g cesium falciglia et al 2020b these findings demonstrate that mw irradiation could effectively regenerate pfoa saturated gac it could be assumed that adsorbed pfoa was thermally destabilized by mw heating desorbed from gac and transferred to the gas phase indeed it was demonstrated that spent gac filtrasorb 200 calgon corporation saturated with pfoa heated in a quartz tube furnace for 30 min at temperature higher than 300 c lead to pfoa thermal degradation to gaseous productions xiao et al 2020 while the highest mineralization of pfoa 92 4 mol occurred at 700 c comparing to conventional thermal heating mw irradiation allowed the lowering of treatment time since temperatures higher than 600 c were obtained in less than 8 min moreover the potential release of pfoa and its degradation compounds shorter chain compounds from mw regenerated bcgac mw irradiated at t 600 c was evaluated both in ddw and meoh naoh solution the results revealed that pfoa concentrations were 3 5 μg l 1 and 316 μg l 1 in ddw and meoh naoh solution respectively the concentrations of other shorter pfcas i e pfhpa pfhxa pfpea pfba were under the detection limit 0 4 μg l 1 in ddw whereas in meoh naoh solution the concentration of each compound was lower than 60 μg l 1 these results pointed out that i pfoa is removed 99 from pfoa exhausted gac by the mw regeneration ii negligible amounts of shorter pfcas were released from mw regenerated bcgac in both ddw and meoh naoh solution temperatures higher than 600 c might have a detrimental effect on the porous structure of gac ania et al 2005 therefore the effect of mw regeneration performed at different irradiation conditions on gac physical characteristics pfoa bcgac and pfoa lcgac was evaluated by means of nitrogen adsorption isotherms the change in bet areas and pore volumes of both bcgac and lcgac as a result of mw irradiation are shown in fig 4 the positive values represent the increase over the virgin condition while a decrease in bet area and pore volume is depicted with negative values the results reveal that the variations in both bet area and total pore volume of pfoa saturated bcgac were within 15 even though the micropore volume increased more than 20 after mw regeneration performed at 250 w 6 min and 250 w 8 min fig 4 such changes seem do not affect significantly the mw regeneration efficiency for pfoa saturated bcgac fig 3b in contrast a decrease in bet area and pore volumes were observed for lcgac after mw irradiation fig 4 the negative impact of mw irradiation on lcgac was attributed to the higher presence of functional oxygen groups cheng et al 2005 as reported elsewhere ania et al 2007 pi et al 2017 zhang et al 2012 upon heating a large amount of gases coming from desorption of volatiles and the decomposition of oxygen containing groups are evolved as a result the lcgac porous structure was more negatively affected than bcgac depending on the extent of mw irradiation the highest decrease of bet area in pfoa saturated lcgac occurred when mw irradiation was performed at 375 w for 6 min a 18 decrease compared to virgin lcgac fig 4a the decrease in bet area observed for lcgac regenerated samples was also found for total pore volume fig 4b this suggests that the mw irradiation created a residual deposit in lcgac pores which blocked the porosity and reduced both bet area and total pore volume wang et al 2010 the harsh regeneration condition applied at which the temperature of 753 c was reached also contributed to the damage of lcgac porous structure this deterioration of lcgac sample irradiated at 375 w for 6 min negatively affected the adsorption capacity of regenerated lcgac as demonstrated by a low value of re obtained 60 fig 3b overall it seems that the reduction in total pore volumes affects negatively the adsorption capacity of mw regenerated lcgac as observed for data obtained at 375 w 4 min and 375 w 6 min mw fig 3b and fig 4b 3 3 mw regeneration of pfos saturated gacs from batch adsorption experiments similar pfos adsorption capacities were obtained on virgin bcgac and lcgac 19 8 and 20 0 mg g 1 respectively temperature weight loss percentage and regeneration efficiency for pfos saturated gacs are reported in fig 5 similar to pfoa saturated gac samples lcgac saturated with pfos reached higher temperature than bcgac when both gacs were irradiated at the same mw power and irradiation time fig 5a while the power of 125 w and irradiation time of 12 min yielded temperatures much lower than 600 c t 240 c in pfos saturated bcgac t 370 c in pfos saturated lcgac the lowest res were obtained for both bcgac and lcgac fig 5b despite the higher temperatures reached the re values for pfos saturated lcgac were slightly lower than those obtained for bcgac specifically the re values for pfos saturated bcgac were equal or greater than 80 expect for mw irradiation at 125 w for 12 min due to the low temperature reached at the highest power 500 w applied for the shortest irradiation time 3 min the re values were higher than 90 for both pfos saturated gac samples fig 5b however the lowest wl of bcgac samples 4 vs 10 5 in lcgac encouraged its application for the investigation of the five successive adsorption regeneration cycles section 3 4 as previously pointed out for pfoa the potential release of pfos and its related degradation products shorter chain compounds from mw regenerated gac mw irradiated at t 600 c was also assessed in both ddw and meoh naoh solution the results revealed that pfos concentrations were 58 μg l 1 and 2 4 mg l 1 in ddw and meoh naoh solution respectively shorter pfsas i e pfhps pfhxs pfpes pfbs were under the detection limit 0 4 μg l 1 in ddw whereas higher concentrations were observed in meoh naoh solution pfbs 8 μg l 1 pfhxs 215 μg l 1 pfhps 62 μg l 1 pfpes 27 μg l 1 these results corroborate that pfos is removed from the gac by the mw regeneration and negligible pfsas desorption occurs during the following adsorption cycle the re values after one adsorption regeneration cycle for pfos saturated gacs were in good agreement with those of previous studies carried out on ac saturated with both organic and inorganic compounds ania et al 2005 falciglia et al 2020b foo 2018 sun et al 2017 the variation of re across mw regeneration performed at different power and irradiation time reflects the change in bet area and total pore volume of irradiated gac samples compared to virgin ones gac porous structure after mw regeneration depends on pfos removal rate and the deposition of regeneration residues which might block carbon pores durán jiménez et al 2019 wang et al 2010 this is shown in fig 6 with the bet area and pore volume percentage variations in pfos saturated bcgac and lcgac similar to pfoa saturated bcgac the bet area variations in pfos saturated bcgac were lower than 15 fig 6a the changes in pore volume were also limited to a maximum of 20 this data demonstrates that mw irradiation has a slight effect on bcgac porous structure fig 6b on the other hand a more noticeable decrease up to 30 in bet area for pfos saturated lcgac was obtained after mw irradiation demonstrating the negative impact of mw on lcgac as previously pointed out for pfoa saturated lcgac for instance the mw regeneration performed at 375 w for 6 min resulted in damages to the pore structure of carbon as demonstrated by the decrease in bet area 20 and in pore volume 30 and 44 of total pore volume and microporous volume respectively those variations in lcgac porous structure led to a reduction in the adsorption capacity re 60 the efficiency of mw regeneration obtained in the present study was compared with the findings reported by xiao et al 2020 the authors reported that the thermal treatment of spent gac filtrasorb 200 calgon corporation at 500 c for 30 min allowed the decomposition of pfas i e 99 for pfos although the recovery of gac adsorption capacity was not evaluated and a significant mineralization of pfos 86 8 mol was reached at 800 c treatment time 30 min to further highlight the potential of mw regeneration a comparison was also made with the chemical regeneration results for pfos saturated ac deng et al 2015 du et al 2016 2015 punyapalakul et al 2013 the regeneration percentages higher than 80 were achieved when pfos saturated ac samples e g bamboo derived ac and coconut shell based gac using a solution of ethanol or methanol 50 indeed a solution of organic alcohol was required to desorb the hydrophobic c f chain however chemical regeneration using an organic solvent is not suitable for the full scale drinking water applications gagliano et al 2020 3 4 investigation of adsorption regeneration cycles for pfoa and pfos saturated bcgac to further assess the performance of mw irradiation for the regeneration of gac saturated with pfoa and pfos five successive adsorption regeneration cycles were carried out bcgac was selected for these experiments owing to its lower wl than lcgac which encourages its applicability for mw regeneration among irradiation conditions investigated in the present study table 2 a mw power of 500 w and irradiation time of 3 min were selected since this combination yielded a temperature higher than 600 c moreover it allowed a better preservation of bcgac porous structure ensuring a good thermal desorption of pfos and pfoa re 90 with the lowest carbon weight loss wl 4 3 the trends observed in re ssde and wl values for both pfoa and pfos saturated bcgac throughout five successive adsorption regeneration cycles are depicted in fig 7 the re values of pfoa and pfos saturated bcgac followed different trends specifically the re values of pfoa saturated bcgac increased until the 3rd cycle 95 further adsorption regeneration cycles led to a gradual decrease in re which was 65 after the 5th cycle in comparison pfos saturated bcgac irradiated at 500 w for 3 min reached the highest re after the 1st cycle then re gradually decreased to 63 5 after the 5th adsorption regeneration cycle the single step desorption efficiency ssde provides the percentage of pfoa and pfos desorption in each cycle allowing to evaluate the desorption yield in the different cycles ania et al 2007 çalişkan et al 2012 fig 7 for the pfos saturated bcgac the ssde was 90 and it remained almost constant throughout successive cycles demonstrating a high rate of pfos desorption conversely a gradual increase followed by a sharp decrease can be observed in ssde for pfoa saturated bcgac samples fig 7 this suggests that pfoa desorption from regenerated bcgac was easier until the 3rd cycle at which the highest re was also obtained wl increased almost linearly with mw regeneration cycles in both pfos and pfoa saturated bcgac samples fig 7 although the greater loss of mass carbon occurred after the 1st cycle wl 4 total wl remained was 7 after 5 successive cycles of pfos and pfoa saturated bcgac this percentage is lower than that attributed to conventional thermal regeneration of gac which is in the range of 5 15 at each regeneration cycle zanella et al 2014 moreover the obtained values of wl corroborate the advantage of mw regeneration over the conventional thermal regeneration and they are in good agreement with previous findings reported in literature falciglia et al 2020b liu et al 2004 sun et al 2017 wei et al 2012 textural properties of pfoa and pfos saturated bcgac after several adsorption regeneration cycles are reported in table 3 the physical features of the regenerated carbons i e bet area and pore volume did not differ noticeably from the virgin samples as demonstrated by the percentage variation remaining lower than 20 table 3 this demonstrates that the application of short mw irradiation times i e 3 min could preserve the porous structure of the regenerated carbons throughout several adsorption regeneration cycles after the 3rd cycle the lack in mesoporosity vmeso 0 05 cm3 g 1 may delay the migration of the pfos molecules desorbed from bcgac this is also true for the pfoa saturated bcgac after the 5th adsorption regeneration cycle indeed a fall in mesopore volume vmeso 0 08 cm3 g 1 and a decrease in average pore size 3 8 nm occurred table 3 a gradual blockage of the porous structure seemed to occur due to the fraction of adsorbed pfoa or pfos molecules which did not evolve from the carbon surface during the regeneration after successive cycles these molecules may remain inside the pore network of bcgac and give rise to carbonaceous residues ania et al 2005 foo and hameed 2012 consequently the formation of coke deposits and damage to porosity may cause the decrease in the adsorption capacity of regenerated bcgac as demonstrated by the decrease in re throughout several cycles ania et al 2005 falciglia et al 2020b it is noteworthy that when water saturated gacs are irradiated with mw gac grains could act as hotspots and their internal temperature is higher than the recorded temperature on the external surface due to a cooling down effect δt 400 c falciglia et al 2020b yang et al 2017 the thermal gradient from the interior of the grain to its surface allows the mw induced reaction to proceed more quickly and effectively at a lower bulk temperature thus saving energy and shortening the processing time in addition the hotspots favour heterogenous reactions between gac and the gases taking part in the reaction which might contribute to pfas desorption through stripping mechanism of interstitial water falciglia et al 2018 sun et al 2016 4 conclusion and future perspectives the applicability of mw irradiation for the regeneration of pfoa and pfos saturated gac was investigated in terms of regeneration efficiency carbon weight loss and variation of gac textural properties the key findings were summarized as follow during mw irradiation fast temperature increases were obtained on both gacs 150 c min 1 at power of 500 w furthermore temperatures higher than 600 c were attained by applying a minimum mw power of 250 w for 6 min the high temperatures reached pointed out the strong ability of gac to transform the adsorbed mw power into a rapid temperature rise representing the key factor in the regeneration process the correlation between gac temperatures and their weight loss percentage provides valuable information to distinguish among several gacs commercially available the highest weight loss percentages obtained in lcgac lignite coal gac negatively affects its applicability on several successive adsorption regeneration cycles a very short mw irradiation time of 3 min allowed the achievement of temperature needed for pfos and pfoa thermal desorption resulting in the lowest wl and in the highest re values 90 the enhancement in the re may not be exclusively attributed to the complete desorption of pfoa or pfos but an increase in the overall uptake was attributed to the changes in gac porous structure e g the development of mesoporosity as demonstrated by the variation in pore volume after five successive adsorption regeneration cycles the observed values of re 65 jointly with a moderate weight loss 7 demonstrated the potential applicability of mw irradiation for regenerating pfoa and pfos saturated bcgac comparing to conventional thermal regeneration mw irradiation allowed the lowering of treatment time since the temperatures required for pfas desorption 600 c were obtained within 3 min negligible amounts of pfoa and pfos were released from mw regenerated gac moreover considering gac temperatures reached during mw regeneration it could be assumed that both pfoa and pfos are thermally degraded without any significant formation of related shorter chain compounds this study showed for the first time that the regeneration of pfas saturated gacs through mw irradiation is a promising technology moreover the obtained findings contributed to increase the knowledge concerning the fate of pfoa and pfos during gac thermal regeneration which are partially understood however there are still a number of knowledge gaps that need further investigation to explore its application such as understanding of the efficiency of mw regeneration in the presence of co existing compounds both organic matter and inorganic compounds the fate of pfas molecules during mw regeneration regeneration mechanisms and the experiences with gac samples obtained from full

17002,this study investigated the regeneration of pfas saturated granular activated carbons gacs by microwave mw irradiation two commercially available gacs bituminous coal based gac bcgac and lignite coal based gac lcgac were saturated with perfluorooctanoic acid pfoa and perfluorooctane sulfonic acid pfos and then irradiated at different mw conditions applied power 125 500 w irradiation time 3 12 min the performance of mw regeneration for pfos or pfoa saturated gacs was assessed by evaluating the variation of gac adsorption capacity regeneration efficiency re and weight loss percentage wl moreover the effect of mw irradiation on gac textural properties e g surface area and pore volume was examined through n2 adsorption isotherms additionally five successive adsorption regeneration cycles were carried out at the mw operational condition that allowed to reach the target temperature t 600 c while minimizing the wl both gacs exhibited a strong ability to convert mw irradiation into a rapid temperature increase 150 c min 1 at 500 w the highest values of re 90 for both pfoa and pfos saturated gacs were obtained at mw irradiation conditions that employed short regeneration time 3 min and optimal temperature indeed the highest re did not occur at the highest temperatures 750 c due to the damage of gac porous structure particularly for lcgac after five cycles the observed values of re 65 and a moderate weight loss 7 demonstrated the good performance of mw irradiation for regenerating pfoa and pfos saturated bcgac the obtained findings pointed out that mw irradiation is a promising alternative regeneration technique for pfas saturated gac graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords gac adsorption contaminants of emerging concern cec microwave mw irradiation poly and perfluoroalkyl substances pfas regeneration 1 introduction poly and perfluoroalkyl substances pfas are a class of anthropogenic compounds that attracted attention worldwide as contaminants of high concern ateia et al 2019 itrc 2020 over several decades they have been used in an array of formulations for the manufacture of several commercial products such as fire fighting foams food packing stain repellents and non stick cookware buck et al 2011 rahman et al 2014 the widespread use of pfas is certainly ascribable to their unique properties such as chemical thermal stability and hydrophilic lipophilic nature imparted by chemical composition gagliano et al 2020 itrc 2017 pfas structure is made up of a c f chain of varying length and it also includes a charged functional group attached at one end e g carboxylic or sulfonic acid buck et al 2011 du et al 2014 consequently pfas are categorized into long chain and short chain according to c f chain length and into perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acids pfcas and perfluoroalkyl sulfonic acids pfsas according to the type of functional group buck et al 2011 itrc 2017 recently pfas have been called forever chemicals due to their persistence and mobility in environment as well as their toxicity for human and wildlife crawford et al 2017 hölzer et al 2009 sorlini et al 2019 their occurrence in water bodies is the result of consumer product degradation firefighting activities and discharges of fluorochemical manufacturing facilities ateia et al 2019 hu et al 2016 consequently pfas have been detected worldwide from ng l 1 to μg l 1 or even mg l 1 levels at some contaminated sites gagliano et al 2020 rahman et al 2014 amongst long chain pfas perfluorooctanoic acid pfoa and perfluorooctane sulfonic acid pfos has been the most widely used and although their production has been banned they have been detected in groundwater surface water wastewater and tap water around the world gagliano et al 2020 takagi et al 2008 the need for efficient pfas removal from water is a growing need as a result of increasing regulatory attention and general concern regarding the exposure effects kucharzyk et al 2017 park et al 2020 sorlini et al 2019 in recent years a significant progress has been made to investigate the application of innovative advanced technologies such as plasma treatment electrochemical and photocatalysis ji et al 2020 ross et al 2018 nevertheless at pilot and full scale operations adsorption using granular activated carbon gac has been the most widely used approach for treatment of pfas contaminated water du et al 2014 gagliano et al 2020 shivakoti et al 2010 however periodic gac replacement is required from an environmental and sustainability standpoint the regeneration of exhausted ac is a more attractive alternative then landfill disposal which could lead to a secondary contamination pathway the regeneration should allow an increase in gac lifetime restoring its adsorption capacity by removing the adsorbed pfas gagliano et al 2020 yuen and hameed 2009 however the regeneration of pfas exhausted gac is a challenging task for both water utilities and activated carbon manufactures among different regeneration techniques chemical regeneration using a solution of sodium salts and organic alcohol allows the desorption of pfas molecules out of carbon pores wang et al 2014 woodard et al 2017 however the use of organic alcohol has negative impacts for full scale applications and consequently on site regeneration is not feasible gagliano et al 2020 furthermore the management of eluate having high pfas concentration is another limiting factor of chemical regeneration over the years the thermal regeneration of exhausted gac has been extensively performed at 800 1000 c under mildly oxidizing atmospheric conditions usually carbon dioxide and steam guo and du 2012 zanella et al 2014 however these conditions lead to a considerable amount of carbon lost 5 15 by attrition burn off and washout and subsequent decline in the adsorption capacity zanella et al 2014 furthermore thermal regeneration under oxidative gases negatively affects carbon porous structure e g a decrease in micropore volume and a shift to pores of narrower sizes and it may lead to changes in carbon functional groups the carbonization of adsorbates may also result in pore blockage due to coke formation ania et al 2005 therefore the development of alternative regeneration techniques for pfas exhausted gac is highly desirable in order to i avoid the harmful secondary pollution after landfill disposal ii save costs related to gac replacement iii restore gac adsorption capacity while ensuring the preservation of its porous structure gagliano et al 2020 yuen and hameed 2009 developed for radar and communication purposes microwave mw irradiation is a well established technology alternative to conventional heating it has also been recently proposed as a potentially viable approach for regenerating gac saturated with both organic and inorganic compounds ania et al 2007 ao et al 2018 falciglia et al 2020b foo and hameed 2012 compared to conventional thermal heating mw irradiation offers several advantages interior heating higher heating rates selective heating greater control of the heating process no direct contact between the heating source and heated materials and reduced equipment size and waste falciglia et al 2018 kim et al 2014 previous studies have pointed out the outperformance of the mw over conventional thermal regeneration for saturated activated carbons ania et al 2005 durán jiménez et al 2019 the major driving force of the treatment is the dielectric nature of the irradiated material e g activated carbon which allows the conversion of low power irradiation energy into a rapid temperature increase ania et al 2007 falciglia et al 2020a its dielectric heating capacity leads to a large reduction in treatment time and energy consumption making the application cost effective ao et al 2018 falciglia et al 2018 jointly with high gac dielectric features high mechanical strength and a good resistance towards heat and radiation are other essential features for promoting gac regeneration by mw irradiation ania et al 2007 biniak et al 1997 durán jiménez et al 2019 gagliano et al 2019 to the best of our knowledge the applicability of mw irradiation for regenerating pfas saturated gacs has not been reported in the literature therefore the aim of the present study was to systematically examine the regeneration of two commercially available gacs saturated with selected long chain pfas i e pfoa and pfos by mw irradiation for multiple adsorption regeneration cycles mw regeneration was performed at different operational conditions mw power levels and irradiation times in order to examine the variation in gac adsorption capacity in terms of regeneration efficiency and gac weight loss percentage afterwards the optimum temperature for mw regeneration with the lowest gac weight loss was selected to carry out five successive pfas adsorption regeneration cycles the changes in gac textural properties e g surface area and pore volume after mw irradiation were assessed through n2 adsorption isotherms in order to evaluate the mw effect on gac porous structure 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials the two commercial gacs selected for the experiments are obtained from steam activation of bituminous coal bcgac and lignite coal lcgac and they were purchased from calgon carbon corporation and norit respectively table 1 both gacs have been extensively tested in pfas removal studies and they are currently employed at water treatment facilities kothawala et al 2017 liu et al 2019 ochoa herrera and sierra alvarez 2008 park et al 2020 as received gacs were washed in distilled and deionized water ddw several times dried at 100 c overnight and then stored in a desiccator until use the dried gacs were sieved at 10 20 mesh size in order to obtain a fraction from 0 85 to 2 mm pfos cas n 1763 23 1 96 purity and pfoa cas n 335 67 1 96 purity were obtained from sigma aldrich liquid chromatography lc grade ammonium acetate acetonitrile and water were purchased from fischer scientific table s1 supplementary materials reports the physicochemical properties of pfoa and pfos investigated in this study 2 2 adsorption and mw regeneration experiments in order to obtain gacs both bcgac and lcgac fully saturated with pfoa and pfos gac samples were saturated with high concentrated 500 mg l 1 solution of pfoa or pfos in ddw to ensure that the active sites on gac inner surface were fully occupied foo 2018 sun et al 2017 five grams of gac bcgac or lcgac were added to 200 ml of solution pfoa or pfos in ddw the mixture was kept stirred 180 rpm at room temperature 25 1 c for 24 h to ensure that the equilibrium was established as also confirmed with the preliminary tests which was in agreement with previous experimental studies ochoa herrera and sierra alvarez 2008 yao et al 2014 after saturation aqueous samples were centrifugated to separate the activated carbons before analysis through liquid chromatography mass spectrometry lc ms ms as described in analytical methods section in order to measure the remaining concentration of compounds in solution the amount of pfoa and pfos adsorbed by bcgac and lcgac was calculated as follows 1 q v c 0 c f m where q is the adsorption capacity mg g 1 c0 mg l 1 and cf mg l 1 are the initial and final concentrations of each compound in the solution respectively and v l is the volume of the solution and m g is the gac mass pfoa or pfos saturated bcgac and lcgac were separated from liquid solution through vacuum filtration and transferred into ceramic crucible for the regeneration experiments a modified domestic 2 45 ghz mw oven equipped with cyclonic inverter owing a maximum power of 1 25 kw was employed for the saturated gac regeneration purpose the temperature t c reached by gacs after mw irradiation was recorded through a k type thermocouple omega engineering inc u s a before performing mw regeneration of pfas saturated gac 5 g of bcgac or lcgac separately were subjected to mw irradiation at different power levels from 125 to 500 w and irradiation times from 3 to 12 min to develop the temperature profiles consequently based on temperature reached by gacs several mw irradiation conditions combinations of power and irradiation time were selected and applied for the regeneration of pfoa and pfos saturated gacs the dried regenerated gac was employed in the subsequent adsorption test and a small amount 20 mg was used for gac characterization as reported in section 2 3 adsorption tests were carried out as reported above the efficiency of mw regeneration was evaluated by means of the regeneration efficiency re and the single step desorption efficiency ssde specifically ssde allows the understanding of pfoa and pfos desorption among different cycles whereas re enables to study the evolution of the overall yield of mw regeneration the re was calculated as followed 2 re q i q 0 100 where qi is the adsorption capacity of the mw regenerated gac and q0 is the adsorption capacity of the virgin gac whereas the ssde was determined by 3 ssde q n q n 1 100 where qn and qn 1 are the adsorption capacities of the mw regenerated gac in a given cycle n and in the previous regeneration cycle n 1 respectively besides the re and ssde gac weight loss percentage wl represents another important parameter could affect the applicability of mw for the regeneration of pfoa and pfos saturated gac it was calculated as 4 wl w 0 w t w 0 100 where w0 and wt are the mass of gac g before and after mw irradiation respectively the operating conditions i e irradiation power and irradiation time which allow the achievement of the highest re and the lowest wl values were selected for the successive five adsorption regeneration cycles in order to verify the potential leaching of pfos or pfoa and their related shorter chain compounds as degradation products from mw regenerated gacs 5 g of pfoa or pfos saturated bcgac after mw regeneration irradiated at t 600 c were added to 200 ml of ddw pfas free solution or to 200 ml of meoh with naoh 100 mmol l 1 meoh naoh solution the two mixtures were kept stirred 180 rpm at room temperature 25 1 c for 48 h then liquid samples from the two mixtures were withdrawn and analysed through lc ms ms as described below in order to determine the residual concentrations of pfas both long and short chain compounds potentially released from mw regenerated bcgac in ddw or meoh naoh solution specifically meoh naoh solution was selected due to its high pfas recovery from gac 90 100 in agreement with xiao et al 2020 2 3 gac characterization the surface areas pore volumes and pore size distributions of gac samples before and after mw irradiation were measured by nitrogen physisorption data at 77 k after degassing the samples at 298 k for 10 h with asap 2020 analyzer micromeritics instrument corp u s brunauer emmett teller bet equation was used to calculate the specific surface area whereas the pore size distribution of gac samples were determined from the nitrogen isotherms using the density functional theory dft dastgheib et al 2004 lowell et al 1985 the reproducibility of measurements was assessed from triplicate data of randomly selected samples and the relative standard deviation rsd of bet surface area micropore volume and total pore volume resulted less than 4 2 4 analytical method the determination of pfoa and pfos was conducted using the method described by park et al 2020 with few modifications specifically the high volume direct injection was performed using a liquid chromatography coupled to esi triple quadrupole mass spectrometer agilent 6470 lc tq operated in the negative ionization mode the mobile phase in lc grade solvents was a 100 mm ammonium acetate in water ph 10 b acetonitrile a combination of 50 of a and 50 of b was delivered at a flow rate of 0 4 ml min 1 by the binary pump an agilent zorbax rrhd eclipse plus c18 column 2 1 100 mm 1 8 µm particle size was installed at the binary pump moreover polytetrafluoroethylene free vials caps and septa were used to reduce pfas background data acquisition was performed in multiple reaction monitoring mrm mode for each compound two mrm transitions pfos 499 80 499 99 pfoa 413 169 413 369 were used for quantification and confirmation respectively due to the high concentrations used in the present study samples were diluted with lc grade water to obtain concentrations ranging between 5 500 μg l 1 afterwards calibration curves were constructed and the correlation coefficients r2 of the calibration curves for pfos and pfoa were 0 98 based on the lowest acceptable calibration standard the detection limit of both pfoa and pfos measurements was 1 μg l 1 for selected experiments carried out to monitor the potential release of pfas from mw regenerated gac the analytical determination of other pfas listed in table s2 was conducted using the method described above with few modifications in these measurements the detection limit was 0 4 μg l 1 3 results and discussion 3 1 gac temperature profiles and weight loss during mw irradiation the variation of gacs temperature with irradiation times at different power levels is shown in fig 1 the comparison of the temperature profiles reveals that both bcgac and lcgac have the same trend where temperature increases with increasing the irradiation time and power however lcgac reached higher temperature than bcgac when the mw power was 375 w for irradiation time longer than 3 min moreover at the highest power investigated 500 w the increase in temperature c with irradiation time min was faster for lcgac than bcgac 156 and 146 c min 1 respectively overall among the operational conditions investigated the irradiation at 500 w for 5 min resulted in the highest gac temperatures which were 730 and 780 c for bcgac and on lcgac respectively however temperatures 600 c were also attained at a lower mw power 250 w applied for 6 min and above demonstrating the ability of gacs to convert a low adsorbed mw power into a rapid temperature increase regardless of power applied both gacs reached the minimal value of 250 c after 1 min of irradiation which correspond to a t increase ratio of 250 c min 1 this sharp rise of gac temperature within short irradiation times is the key factor in the mw regeneration process the difference in temperature profiles observed for the bcgac and lcgac samples may be ascribed to difference in their chemical composition the oxygen content in lcgac is higher than that of bcgac 8 7 and 5 9 respectively cheng et al 2005 dastgheib et al 2004 indeed most of oxygen functionalities are polar functional groups which are more prone to absorb mw energy than nonpolar ones pi et al 2017 providing a plausible explanation for the highest temperature reached in lcgac during the mw irradiation the variation of weight loss with temperature increase on bcgac and lcgac samples irradiated at several power levels and irradiation times is shown in fig 2 the gac weight loss wl increased linearly with the increase in temperature r2 0 98 and the highest wls were 6 1 and 6 9 for bcgac and lcgac respectively weight loss is one of the main factors affecting the scaling up of the mw technology especially to calculate the cost of gac replacement as previously demonstrated by falciglia et al 2020a wl t relationship may also be useful in the selection of commercially available gacs at a comparable value of adsorption capacity for a target compound gac characterized by lower wl and sharp t rise should be preferred since it is more prone to mw irradiation or thermal regeneration among the different experimental conditions investigated in the present study to develop temperature profiles six combinations of power w and irradiation time t min were selected for the regeneration of pfas saturated gac table 2 these combinations of power and irradiation time correspond to a total consumed energy e in the 0 025 0 038 kwh range remya and lin 2011 specifically the highest e is achievable applying a power of 375 w for an irradiation time of 6 min whereas the lowest one is attained when gac samples were irradiated at 125 w for 12 min 250 w for 6 min or 500 w for 3 min the mw irradiation conditions employed in the present study were selected based on the criterion of maintaining the gac both bcgac and lcgac temperature over 600 c which would allow the pfoa and pfos thermal desorption from gacs this value can be referred to the thermogravimetric tga analysis of pfoa and pfos chemical compounds as reported elsewhere wang et al 2011 xiao et al 2020 the tga analysis conducted under n2 atmosphere revealed a single step degradation of pfos at 425 500 c while pfoa degradation started at lower temperature 300 c moreover it was demonstrated that the total thermal decomposition of a wide group of pfas including pfoa and pfos occurred at 600 c or above wang et al 2011 watanabe et al 2018 2016 xiao et al 2020 indeed pfas molecules thermally destabilized are transferred from gac to gas phase with the potential generation of organofluorine compounds xiao et al 2020 whereas pfas thermal destruction requires temperatures higher than 900 c which are commonly employed at carbon manufacture plants for gac reactivation process itrc 2018 xiao et al 2020 consequently for the regeneration purpose the mw irradiation conditions power and irradiation time applied in the present study were set to ensure the achievement of temperature needed for pfoa and pfos thermal decomposition avoiding the damage of gac it should be highlighted that when bcgac and lcgac were irradiated at 125 w for 12 min the gac temperatures were much lower than 600 c 300 c however this combination of power and time 125 w for 12 min was selected as control experiment to further understand the pfas desorption process 3 2 mw regeneration of pfoa saturated gacs the results from batch adsorption experiments showed that the adsorption capacity of pfoa was 20 0 mg g 1 and 21 9 mg g 1 on virgin bcgac and lcgac respectively pfoa saturated bcgac and lcgac samples were irradiated at several mw operational conditions table 2 temperature weight loss and regeneration efficiency of pfoa saturated gacs observed are depicted in fig 3 as expected pfoa saturated gac samples irradiated at 125 w for 12 min reached temperature of 268 and 340 c respectively far from the target temperature of 600 c fig 3a which also corresponded to the lowest wls 2 for the bcgac sample and 6 5 for the lcgac overall pfoa saturated lcgac samples exhibited higher wl than pfoa saturated bcgac samples although in some cases the temperatures reached by gac samples were almost the same e g mw irradiation at 250 w for 6 and 8 min moreover the highest temperatures were reached for both pfoa saturated lcgac and bcgac samples 753 and 685 c respectively at the power of 375 w applied for 6 min the temperatures recorded at the end of the mw regeneration process for both bcgac and lcgac were almost similar to that reached by the virgin gacs when irradiated at the same conditions fig 1 this suggests that gac acts as the major mw absorbing phase durán jiménez et al 2019 mao et al 2015 and the presence of adsorbed pfoa had small influence on the conversion of electromagnetic energy into heat during mw irradiation the regeneration efficiency re calculated according to eq 2 for pfoa saturated bcgac and lcgac as a function of different mw powers and irradiation times is shown in fig 3b barring two conditions obtained for 125 w 12 min and 375 w 6 min separately discussed the re values were in the range of 75 94 for both the pfoa saturated bcgac and lcgac the lowest values of re 30 were obtained when pfoa saturated gac samples bcgac and h3000 were irradiated at 125 w for 12 min this combination of mw power and irradiation time which corresponds to a total consumed energy of 0 025 kwh seems to be insufficient for regenerating pfoa saturated gac due to the low temperatures reached fig 3a the unsatisfactory regeneration at 125 w for 12 min was also supported by gac textural characterization after mw irradiation as detailed below based on re values obtained it can be argued that the highest mw regeneration efficiency did not occur at the highest total power consumed 0 038 kwh which was obtained for a mw irradiation of 375 w for 6 min at this irradiation condition the highest temperatures have been reached by pfoa bcgac and pfoa lcgac 685 and 753 c respectively nevertheless re for pfoa bcgac was 74 3 and re for pfoa lcgac was 60 3 fig 3b the re values of mw irradiation for regenerating pfoa saturated gac are similar to that obtained in previous experimental studies after one adsorption regeneration cycle in which mw irradiation was investigated for the regeneration of ac samples saturated with organic e g methylene blue phenol chloramphenicol ania et al 2005 foo 2018 sun et al 2017 and inorganic compounds e g cesium falciglia et al 2020b these findings demonstrate that mw irradiation could effectively regenerate pfoa saturated gac it could be assumed that adsorbed pfoa was thermally destabilized by mw heating desorbed from gac and transferred to the gas phase indeed it was demonstrated that spent gac filtrasorb 200 calgon corporation saturated with pfoa heated in a quartz tube furnace for 30 min at temperature higher than 300 c lead to pfoa thermal degradation to gaseous productions xiao et al 2020 while the highest mineralization of pfoa 92 4 mol occurred at 700 c comparing to conventional thermal heating mw irradiation allowed the lowering of treatment time since temperatures higher than 600 c were obtained in less than 8 min moreover the potential release of pfoa and its degradation compounds shorter chain compounds from mw regenerated bcgac mw irradiated at t 600 c was evaluated both in ddw and meoh naoh solution the results revealed that pfoa concentrations were 3 5 μg l 1 and 316 μg l 1 in ddw and meoh naoh solution respectively the concentrations of other shorter pfcas i e pfhpa pfhxa pfpea pfba were under the detection limit 0 4 μg l 1 in ddw whereas in meoh naoh solution the concentration of each compound was lower than 60 μg l 1 these results pointed out that i pfoa is removed 99 from pfoa exhausted gac by the mw regeneration ii negligible amounts of shorter pfcas were released from mw regenerated bcgac in both ddw and meoh naoh solution temperatures higher than 600 c might have a detrimental effect on the porous structure of gac ania et al 2005 therefore the effect of mw regeneration performed at different irradiation conditions on gac physical characteristics pfoa bcgac and pfoa lcgac was evaluated by means of nitrogen adsorption isotherms the change in bet areas and pore volumes of both bcgac and lcgac as a result of mw irradiation are shown in fig 4 the positive values represent the increase over the virgin condition while a decrease in bet area and pore volume is depicted with negative values the results reveal that the variations in both bet area and total pore volume of pfoa saturated bcgac were within 15 even though the micropore volume increased more than 20 after mw regeneration performed at 250 w 6 min and 250 w 8 min fig 4 such changes seem do not affect significantly the mw regeneration efficiency for pfoa saturated bcgac fig 3b in contrast a decrease in bet area and pore volumes were observed for lcgac after mw irradiation fig 4 the negative impact of mw irradiation on lcgac was attributed to the higher presence of functional oxygen groups cheng et al 2005 as reported elsewhere ania et al 2007 pi et al 2017 zhang et al 2012 upon heating a large amount of gases coming from desorption of volatiles and the decomposition of oxygen containing groups are evolved as a result the lcgac porous structure was more negatively affected than bcgac depending on the extent of mw irradiation the highest decrease of bet area in pfoa saturated lcgac occurred when mw irradiation was performed at 375 w for 6 min a 18 decrease compared to virgin lcgac fig 4a the decrease in bet area observed for lcgac regenerated samples was also found for total pore volume fig 4b this suggests that the mw irradiation created a residual deposit in lcgac pores which blocked the porosity and reduced both bet area and total pore volume wang et al 2010 the harsh regeneration condition applied at which the temperature of 753 c was reached also contributed to the damage of lcgac porous structure this deterioration of lcgac sample irradiated at 375 w for 6 min negatively affected the adsorption capacity of regenerated lcgac as demonstrated by a low value of re obtained 60 fig 3b overall it seems that the reduction in total pore volumes affects negatively the adsorption capacity of mw regenerated lcgac as observed for data obtained at 375 w 4 min and 375 w 6 min mw fig 3b and fig 4b 3 3 mw regeneration of pfos saturated gacs from batch adsorption experiments similar pfos adsorption capacities were obtained on virgin bcgac and lcgac 19 8 and 20 0 mg g 1 respectively temperature weight loss percentage and regeneration efficiency for pfos saturated gacs are reported in fig 5 similar to pfoa saturated gac samples lcgac saturated with pfos reached higher temperature than bcgac when both gacs were irradiated at the same mw power and irradiation time fig 5a while the power of 125 w and irradiation time of 12 min yielded temperatures much lower than 600 c t 240 c in pfos saturated bcgac t 370 c in pfos saturated lcgac the lowest res were obtained for both bcgac and lcgac fig 5b despite the higher temperatures reached the re values for pfos saturated lcgac were slightly lower than those obtained for bcgac specifically the re values for pfos saturated bcgac were equal or greater than 80 expect for mw irradiation at 125 w for 12 min due to the low temperature reached at the highest power 500 w applied for the shortest irradiation time 3 min the re values were higher than 90 for both pfos saturated gac samples fig 5b however the lowest wl of bcgac samples 4 vs 10 5 in lcgac encouraged its application for the investigation of the five successive adsorption regeneration cycles section 3 4 as previously pointed out for pfoa the potential release of pfos and its related degradation products shorter chain compounds from mw regenerated gac mw irradiated at t 600 c was also assessed in both ddw and meoh naoh solution the results revealed that pfos concentrations were 58 μg l 1 and 2 4 mg l 1 in ddw and meoh naoh solution respectively shorter pfsas i e pfhps pfhxs pfpes pfbs were under the detection limit 0 4 μg l 1 in ddw whereas higher concentrations were observed in meoh naoh solution pfbs 8 μg l 1 pfhxs 215 μg l 1 pfhps 62 μg l 1 pfpes 27 μg l 1 these results corroborate that pfos is removed from the gac by the mw regeneration and negligible pfsas desorption occurs during the following adsorption cycle the re values after one adsorption regeneration cycle for pfos saturated gacs were in good agreement with those of previous studies carried out on ac saturated with both organic and inorganic compounds ania et al 2005 falciglia et al 2020b foo 2018 sun et al 2017 the variation of re across mw regeneration performed at different power and irradiation time reflects the change in bet area and total pore volume of irradiated gac samples compared to virgin ones gac porous structure after mw regeneration depends on pfos removal rate and the deposition of regeneration residues which might block carbon pores durán jiménez et al 2019 wang et al 2010 this is shown in fig 6 with the bet area and pore volume percentage variations in pfos saturated bcgac and lcgac similar to pfoa saturated bcgac the bet area variations in pfos saturated bcgac were lower than 15 fig 6a the changes in pore volume were also limited to a maximum of 20 this data demonstrates that mw irradiation has a slight effect on bcgac porous structure fig 6b on the other hand a more noticeable decrease up to 30 in bet area for pfos saturated lcgac was obtained after mw irradiation demonstrating the negative impact of mw on lcgac as previously pointed out for pfoa saturated lcgac for instance the mw regeneration performed at 375 w for 6 min resulted in damages to the pore structure of carbon as demonstrated by the decrease in bet area 20 and in pore volume 30 and 44 of total pore volume and microporous volume respectively those variations in lcgac porous structure led to a reduction in the adsorption capacity re 60 the efficiency of mw regeneration obtained in the present study was compared with the findings reported by xiao et al 2020 the authors reported that the thermal treatment of spent gac filtrasorb 200 calgon corporation at 500 c for 30 min allowed the decomposition of pfas i e 99 for pfos although the recovery of gac adsorption capacity was not evaluated and a significant mineralization of pfos 86 8 mol was reached at 800 c treatment time 30 min to further highlight the potential of mw regeneration a comparison was also made with the chemical regeneration results for pfos saturated ac deng et al 2015 du et al 2016 2015 punyapalakul et al 2013 the regeneration percentages higher than 80 were achieved when pfos saturated ac samples e g bamboo derived ac and coconut shell based gac using a solution of ethanol or methanol 50 indeed a solution of organic alcohol was required to desorb the hydrophobic c f chain however chemical regeneration using an organic solvent is not suitable for the full scale drinking water applications gagliano et al 2020 3 4 investigation of adsorption regeneration cycles for pfoa and pfos saturated bcgac to further assess the performance of mw irradiation for the regeneration of gac saturated with pfoa and pfos five successive adsorption regeneration cycles were carried out bcgac was selected for these experiments owing to its lower wl than lcgac which encourages its applicability for mw regeneration among irradiation conditions investigated in the present study table 2 a mw power of 500 w and irradiation time of 3 min were selected since this combination yielded a temperature higher than 600 c moreover it allowed a better preservation of bcgac porous structure ensuring a good thermal desorption of pfos and pfoa re 90 with the lowest carbon weight loss wl 4 3 the trends observed in re ssde and wl values for both pfoa and pfos saturated bcgac throughout five successive adsorption regeneration cycles are depicted in fig 7 the re values of pfoa and pfos saturated bcgac followed different trends specifically the re values of pfoa saturated bcgac increased until the 3rd cycle 95 further adsorption regeneration cycles led to a gradual decrease in re which was 65 after the 5th cycle in comparison pfos saturated bcgac irradiated at 500 w for 3 min reached the highest re after the 1st cycle then re gradually decreased to 63 5 after the 5th adsorption regeneration cycle the single step desorption efficiency ssde provides the percentage of pfoa and pfos desorption in each cycle allowing to evaluate the desorption yield in the different cycles ania et al 2007 çalişkan et al 2012 fig 7 for the pfos saturated bcgac the ssde was 90 and it remained almost constant throughout successive cycles demonstrating a high rate of pfos desorption conversely a gradual increase followed by a sharp decrease can be observed in ssde for pfoa saturated bcgac samples fig 7 this suggests that pfoa desorption from regenerated bcgac was easier until the 3rd cycle at which the highest re was also obtained wl increased almost linearly with mw regeneration cycles in both pfos and pfoa saturated bcgac samples fig 7 although the greater loss of mass carbon occurred after the 1st cycle wl 4 total wl remained was 7 after 5 successive cycles of pfos and pfoa saturated bcgac this percentage is lower than that attributed to conventional thermal regeneration of gac which is in the range of 5 15 at each regeneration cycle zanella et al 2014 moreover the obtained values of wl corroborate the advantage of mw regeneration over the conventional thermal regeneration and they are in good agreement with previous findings reported in literature falciglia et al 2020b liu et al 2004 sun et al 2017 wei et al 2012 textural properties of pfoa and pfos saturated bcgac after several adsorption regeneration cycles are reported in table 3 the physical features of the regenerated carbons i e bet area and pore volume did not differ noticeably from the virgin samples as demonstrated by the percentage variation remaining lower than 20 table 3 this demonstrates that the application of short mw irradiation times i e 3 min could preserve the porous structure of the regenerated carbons throughout several adsorption regeneration cycles after the 3rd cycle the lack in mesoporosity vmeso 0 05 cm3 g 1 may delay the migration of the pfos molecules desorbed from bcgac this is also true for the pfoa saturated bcgac after the 5th adsorption regeneration cycle indeed a fall in mesopore volume vmeso 0 08 cm3 g 1 and a decrease in average pore size 3 8 nm occurred table 3 a gradual blockage of the porous structure seemed to occur due to the fraction of adsorbed pfoa or pfos molecules which did not evolve from the carbon surface during the regeneration after successive cycles these molecules may remain inside the pore network of bcgac and give rise to carbonaceous residues ania et al 2005 foo and hameed 2012 consequently the formation of coke deposits and damage to porosity may cause the decrease in the adsorption capacity of regenerated bcgac as demonstrated by the decrease in re throughout several cycles ania et al 2005 falciglia et al 2020b it is noteworthy that when water saturated gacs are irradiated with mw gac grains could act as hotspots and their internal temperature is higher than the recorded temperature on the external surface due to a cooling down effect δt 400 c falciglia et al 2020b yang et al 2017 the thermal gradient from the interior of the grain to its surface allows the mw induced reaction to proceed more quickly and effectively at a lower bulk temperature thus saving energy and shortening the processing time in addition the hotspots favour heterogenous reactions between gac and the gases taking part in the reaction which might contribute to pfas desorption through stripping mechanism of interstitial water falciglia et al 2018 sun et al 2016 4 conclusion and future perspectives the applicability of mw irradiation for the regeneration of pfoa and pfos saturated gac was investigated in terms of regeneration efficiency carbon weight loss and variation of gac textural properties the key findings were summarized as follow during mw irradiation fast temperature increases were obtained on both gacs 150 c min 1 at power of 500 w furthermore temperatures higher than 600 c were attained by applying a minimum mw power of 250 w for 6 min the high temperatures reached pointed out the strong ability of gac to transform the adsorbed mw power into a rapid temperature rise representing the key factor in the regeneration process the correlation between gac temperatures and their weight loss percentage provides valuable information to distinguish among several gacs commercially available the highest weight loss percentages obtained in lcgac lignite coal gac negatively affects its applicability on several successive adsorption regeneration cycles a very short mw irradiation time of 3 min allowed the achievement of temperature needed for pfos and pfoa thermal desorption resulting in the lowest wl and in the highest re values 90 the enhancement in the re may not be exclusively attributed to the complete desorption of pfoa or pfos but an increase in the overall uptake was attributed to the changes in gac porous structure e g the development of mesoporosity as demonstrated by the variation in pore volume after five successive adsorption regeneration cycles the observed values of re 65 jointly with a moderate weight loss 7 demonstrated the potential applicability of mw irradiation for regenerating pfoa and pfos saturated bcgac comparing to conventional thermal regeneration mw irradiation allowed the lowering of treatment time since the temperatures required for pfas desorption 600 c were obtained within 3 min negligible amounts of pfoa and pfos were released from mw regenerated gac moreover considering gac temperatures reached during mw regeneration it could be assumed that both pfoa and pfos are thermally degraded without any significant formation of related shorter chain compounds this study showed for the first time that the regeneration of pfas saturated gacs through mw irradiation is a promising technology moreover the obtained findings contributed to increase the knowledge concerning the fate of pfoa and pfos during gac thermal regeneration which are partially understood however there are still a number of knowledge gaps that need further investigation to explore its application such as understanding of the efficiency of mw regeneration in the presence of co existing compounds both organic matter and inorganic compounds the fate of pfas molecules during mw regeneration regeneration mechanisms and the experiences with gac samples obtained from full

17003,a major challenge for devising an electrochemically active biofilm eab based biosensor for real time water quality early warning is the formation of eab that requires several days to weeks besides the onerous and time consuming preparation process the naturally formed eabs are intensively concerned as they can hardly deliver repeatable electrical signals even at identical experimental conditions to address these concerns this study employed sodium alginate as immobilization agent to encapsulate shewanella oneidensis mr 1 and prepared eab for devising a biosensor in a short period of less than 1 h the artificial eab were found capable of delivering highly consistent electrical signals with each other when fed with the same samples morphology and bioelectrochemical properties of the artificial eab were investigated to provide interpretations for these findings different concentrations of bacteria and alginate in forming the eab were investigated for their effects on the biosensor s sensitivity results suggested that lower concentration of bacteria would be beneficial until it increased to 0 06 od660 concentration of sodium alginate affected the sensitivity as well and 1 was found an optimum amount to serve in the formation of eab a long term operation of the biosensor with artificial eab for 110 h was performed clear warning signals for incoming toxicants were observed over random signal fluctuations all results suggested that the artificial eab electrode would support a rapid devised and highly sensitivity biosensor graphical abstract image graphical

quality monitoring technologies emerge as a promising tool to detect pollutants presented in water and thus prevent further contamination horowitz 2013 biosensors that can directly reflect bioeffect of toxicity have been demonstrated advantageous over traditional chemical analytical technology in recent years antonacci and scognamiglio 2020 most biosensors work through recognizing the concentration or effect of the toxicants those biosensors detecting the concentrations rely on some specific biomacromolecules including nucleic acids antibodies enzymes or proteins which can recognize specific target analytes dai et al 2019 however the preparation of this kind of biosensors is complicated time consuming and costly on the contrary cell based biosensors which monitor composite pollutants through their effect on selected microorganisms e g bacteria microalgae and fungi serving as sensitive elements are able to alert early warning for a variety of monitored water environments including urban rivers lakes and even sewage plants antonacci and scognamiglio 2020 gupta et al 2019 among all sensitive elements employed in early warning biosensors electrochemically active biofilm eab formed by electroactive bacteria has been intensively studied as it can generate detectable bioelectricity as warning signals without any additional chemical mediators chu et al 2021 jiang et al 2018 a variety of organic matters including biochemical oxygen demand bod and volatile fatty acids especially toxicities like heavy metals and organic toxicants can be detected by the changes of electrical signals generated by eab do et al 2019 the sensitivity that reflects the responding ability of biosensor towards the toxicities is a major matric for early warning biosensor in previous studies improved sensitivity could be achieved when the transfer of organic matters and toxicity to biofilm was facilitated through optimizing flow rate flow direction and reactor scale shen et al 2013 xiao et al 2020 regulations of the electrode were also reported to increase the sensitivity including employing constant external resistance constant anode potential constant anode current and transient state operation jiang et al 2017 stein et al 2012 yi et al 2019 modified eab for more responsive performance was prepared through adding electroconductive or redox medium quorum sensing effect and extracellular polymeric substance eps and regulating microbial community structure pan et al 2020 xiao et al 2020 yi et al 2019 with a much improved sensitivity there are still unaddressed concerns when applying in practical real time early warning one major concern is time consuming formation process of eab previous studies reported that it would require several days to weeks to form an eab in laboratorial culture which greatly restrained timely early warning process li et al 2020 liu et al 2011 qi et al 2020a in addition to culture an eab is too complicated for a non professional to perform despite of these difficulties in forming an eab the process is easily affected by many culture conditions leading to different biofilm status e g thickness density and microbial community structure this is why even feeding with identical culture in the same lab the obtained eabs could hardly output repeatable electrical signals which implies that the sensing process cannot be verifiable or convincing eab mainly consist of electroactive bacteria and eps including polysaccharides proteins and humic acid li et al 2020 stöckl et al 2019 an effective method to quickly form an eab is to employ suspended electroactive bacteria and immobilized agents particularly hydrogels that have been used in cell based biosensor ishihara et al 2020 tucci et al 2019 researchers have found that hydrogels are capable of providing an extracellular matrix link and three dimension 3d environments that are biocompatible with cells and have applied them in electroactive bacteria

bioelectricity generation some studies used hydrogels e g redox phospholipid polymer hydrogels alginate redox mediator composites to encapsulated electroactive bacteria lin et al 2012 szollosi et al 2017 these previous studies suggest that the hydrogels may facilitate and regulate the formation of eab this study employed hydrogels as immobilization agents to encapsulate electroactive bacteria and quickly formed an eab that produced repeatable electrical signals with this artificial eab electrode a biosensor was devised for early warning and delivered timely responsive signals for toxicants introduced both in short term and long term experiments further investigations on morphology features and bioelectrochemical properties of the obtained eab provided possible interpretations for the greatly reduced startup time and highly consistent repeatability different concentrations of immobilization agents and bacteria were tested for their effects on the sensitivity with both experimental and modeling studies 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials this study employed a model strain shewanella oneidensis mr 1 as electroactive bacteria which was friendly supplied by tianjin key laboratory of environmental remediation and pollution control college of environmental science and engineering nankai university the luria bertani lb medium cm0996 applied in experimental studies was composed of 10 g l pancreatic digest of casein 5 g l yeast extract and 10 g l sodium chloride sodium alginate cacl2 and formaldehyde wt 40 were provided by macklin co ltd shanghai china 2 2 preparation of artificial eab electrode the shewanella oneidensis mr 1 was inoculated in lb medium and was moved into shake cultivation for 24 h at a temperature of 30 c the suspended bacteria were collected through centrifugation at 7000 rmp min when shewanella oneidensis mr 1 was growing at log phase were then diluted to 200 400 800 1200 and 1600 times by applying phosphate buffer correspondingly the od660 was

according to a previous study szollosi et al 2017 the electrode with biofilm was prepared as follows fig 1 a first the collected bacteria and sodium alginate with identical volume were well mixed together then 0 4 ml of this mixture was added dropwise onto a piece of indium tin oxide ito conductive glass 5 cm 5 cm with a silicone pipette center diameter 4 cm to make an ito electrode which was then spun at 350 rmp min for 9 seconds on a spin coater kw 4a beijing china to ensure the biofilm distributed uniformly on the electrode a vacuum pump was employed in this process protect the biofilm next the prepared ito electrode with biofilm was sunk in 0 5 cacl2 solution for 10 seconds to allow cross linking reaction finally a light passing plastic mesh was pressed over the prepared biofilm to keep a close attachment of the electrode and biofilm in which shewanella oneidensis mr 1 served to generate electrons and to transport them with surface redox proteins and nanowire appendages while calcium alginate behaved as conjunctive agents of electroactive bacteria fig 1b for comparison abiotic ito electrodes without any substances and with only sodium alginates 1 1 5 2 2 5 were also prepared and studied as control groups 2 3 device and operation of eab sensor a three electrode reactor was employed as eab sensor to alert an incoming toxicity from water environment in this study

are normalized as qi et al 2019 2 n e s i n i where nes is the normalized electrical signal and i n is the recorded current every 4 seconds 3 results and discussion 3 1 artificial biofilm for devising eab based biosensor and its electrical signal output mixing shewanella oneidensis mr 1 od660 0 12 with 2 sodium alginate at volume ratio of 1 1 made a 3 d hydrogel to encapsulate the electroactive bacteria after spin coating and cross linking reaction the biofilm came in a round shape fig 2 a which was more inerratic than a naturally formed biofilm sui et al 2020 further examination of the biofilm s morphology from front and top views of the biofilm by clsm showed that it was homogeneous among the center middle and side area fig 2b this biofilm had a similar cell density with one of our previous studies qi et al 2020a and the biofilm thickness was about 100 µm sem images with side view revealed that electroactive bacteria and sodium alginate were evenly mixed together fig 2c both clsm and sem images showed that cells were in contact with each other providing easy pathways for extracellular electron transfer eet that was found mediated through surface redox proteins e g cytochrome c flavin that secreted by bacteria even nanowires in eab biofilm shi et al 2016 from the above mentioned contents the artificial eab theoretically can transfer electrons to electrode to investigate the performance of artificial biofilm for generating electrons to electrode eis and cv were performed as a comparison a control group did not attach any microorganism as illustrated in eis plots the artificial eab delivered much reduced diffusion resistance than the control at low frequency stage suggesting that the eab was in good attachment with ito electrode fig 2d the results of cv also indicated that the constructed eab was electrochemically active fig 2e with this rapidly formed eab the electrode served as working electrode in a three electrode system for bioelectricity generation in the following experiments when the nutrient solution was pumped into the reactor an electrical signal was generated instantly which achieved stable at around 5 µa after 2000 seconds fig 2f compared to several similar previous studies that normally required several days or even weeks to form a mature biofilm for signal generation flexer et al 2013 liu et al 2011 xie et al 2015 the eab was all ready for toxicity alert in just 0 6 hour in this study 3 2 outstanding repeatability of biosensor with artificial eab it is well acknowledged that naturally formed biofilms are easily affected by culture conditions this is why good repeatability when changing the eab electrode in a biosensor is a critical concern and challenge for biosensors that mostly rely on the biofilm to generate electrical signals for toxicity to study the repeatability of biosensor with different eabs besides artificial eab prepared as described previously fig 3 a traditional naturally formed eab on the side of electrode with eps secreted by themselves was also prepared according to a recent report fig 3d stöckl et al 2019 another tested eab was obtained by gravity settling when the electrode was rotated 90 degrees which was reported as a fast accessed method to form an eab electrode fig 3h li et al 2017 all these eabs were prepared in duplicates to investigate their electricity generations under the same experimental conditions the biosensors with these three eab electrodes delivered distinct repeatabilities fig 3 at beginning when feeding continuously for 0 8 h the current signals output by the two biosensors with artificial eab were quite similar fig 3b after that water sample containing 0 06 of formaldehyde was fed in the reactor two current signals produced by two biosensors with artificial eab declined almost at the same time and with the same rate fig 3c however the generated current signals from two biosensors with naturally formed eab were not repeatable in startup process with batch mode fig 3e moreover it required a long startup period up to 45 hours which far exceeded the startup time of biosensor with artificial eab when these two biosensors were operated with continuous feed two current signals immediately drop sharply suggesting the repeatability of this type of biosensor was not promising fig 3f further examination by clsm revealed that no mature biofilm could be found on the electrode indicating that high current signal in the batch startup process was mainly produced by suspended bacteria rather than a biofilm figure s1a as for the biosensor with electrode rotated 90 degrees its current signals took about 15 hours to arrive at stable under gravity settling still much longer than that of biosensor with artificial eab 0 6 h fig 3h like biosensor with naturally formed eab two biosensors with rotated electrode failed to deliver repeatable current signals during the startup process when switching to continuous feed those currents dropped as well fig 3h the biofilm on rotated electrode appeared thick in the middle and thin at the edge in clsm images figure s1b in addition the two biosensors with rotated electrode delivered much different inhibition rates of one reaching to 80 and the other less than 20 fig 3i in conclusion ito electrode with artificial eab could be employed as a modulized electrode to devise the biosensor for fast startup and repeatable signal output 3 3 effects of electroactive bacteria concentration on sensitivity aiming to determine how the concentration of electroactive bacteria affects the biosensor s sensitivity different concentrations of bacteria encapsulated in 3d hydrogel were investigated while the concentration of immobilization agents was fixed at 2 results showed that the current signals gradually increased with the bacteria concentration od660 from 0 3 to 2 5 fig 4 a nevertheless the abiotic control with only sodium alginates of 2 did not generate any current signals for early warning of formaldehyde since high concentration of electron donors organic matters could diffuse to the whole eab and ensure that electroactive bacteria would obtain enough electron donors for bioelectricity generation the electron donors would be considered sufficient to support the early warning process all current signals generated by artificial eabs with any bacteria concentration tested declined once water sample containing 0 06 of formaldehyde was fed in the reactors and the toxicity processes had good reproducibility under each concentration figure s2 these current signals were normalized by eq 2 results showed that there was no significant difference among the toxicity processes when the bacterial concentration exceeded 0 06 fig 4b nevertheless the toxicity process was more obvious when the bacterial concentration was very small 0 04 and 0 03 the inhibition ratio slightly decreased with larger bacteria concentration fig 4c a normal understanding is that a reduced concentration of bacteria would benefit mass transfer unless the bacteria is scarce to restrain electrons conduction and thus to affect the output of current signals to further analyze the spatial distribution of biofilms with different bacterial concentrations 3d clsm images scanning was employed to observe these biofilms and fluorescence intensity analysis was performed on the interfaces at the same z axis position images from clsm figure s3 illustrated that average fluorescence intensity calculated by imagej software gradually increased with larger bacteria concentration employed figure s4 but this influence became weak when the bacterial concentrations exceeded 0 06 which was consistent with the change of nes sensitivity with bacteria concentration these findings suggested that the biosensor s sensitivity would not be much affected by mass transfer when the concentration of bacteria exceeded 0 06 to further verify the effect of bio current generation and mass transfer on sensitivity a kinetic model integrated nernst monod model of bio electrons and 1d mass transfer model of toxicants supplementary materials 1 2 was proposed to simulate the toxicity process of formaldehyde in the artificial biofilm with different electroactive bacteria concentrations nernst monod model of bioelectricity generation provided a relationship between current and electroactive bacteria concentrations while 1d mass transfer model connected together the concentration of toxicants diffusion coefficients biofilm thickness and the time our previous study revealed an intimate connection between the current signals and mass transfer of toxicants in eab qi et al 2020a herein the diffusion coefficients of formaldehyde were approximately calculated by fitting the current signals of toxicity process and the fitted results output by matlab software were shown in figure s5 obviously the fitted curve was more in line with experimental data when low concentration of electroactive bacteria was employed in readily cultured eab fig 4d illustrated that the diffusion coefficients significantly increased with larger bacteria concentration from 0 04 and 0 03 but presented no obvious difference when the concentration exceeded 0 06 which was consistent with the change of inhibition rate with bacteria concentration 3 4 effects of immobilization agent concentration on sensitivity this study employed sodium alginate as immobilization agent to encapsulate electroactive bacteria because several studies succeeded in extracting alginate polysaccharide from eps a substance secreted by electroactive bacteria and critical to form the biofilm jiang et al 2019 pronk et al 2017 the concentration of eps was found to affect the biosensor s sensitivity yi et al 2019 this implied that the concentration of sodium alginate as immobilization agent might have potential effect on early warning process with different concentration of sodium alginate hydrogel applied 1 1 5 2 and 2 5 current signals changed with the time when the working electrode potential was fixed at 0 v against a sce reference electrode fig 5 a current signals with different concentration of immobilization agents appeared similar before toxicity because high concentration of organic matters provided enough electron donors for the whole biofilm then the toxicants were introduced into the biosensors with increased concentration of sodium alginate the biosensor delivered slower response to toxic substances with a lower inhibition ratio fig 5a the abiotic ito electrodes with only sodium alginates did not produce any current signals or respond to any toxicants figure s6 however this effect was not obvious when the concentration of sodium alginate was lower than 1 5 fig 5b which could be interpreted as low concentration of sodium alginate had little impact on the transfer of formaldehyde in biofilm herein the biofilm could not form with the immobilization technology when the sodium alginate concentration is lower than 1 in this study thus 1 of sodium alginate was optimum for artificial eab formation a previous study reported that biofilm thickness would impact the transportation of toxicants in biofilm and further affect the sensitivity qi et al 2020a however 3d clsm images of the biofilms with different concentration of immobilization agents showed no obvious difference in the thickness and similar morphology structures figure s7 and s8 by excluding the biofilm thickness high concentration of sodium alginate would be considered a major contributor for the limited mass transfer of toxicants in biofilm this interpretation was evidenced by the calculations of diffusion coefficients of formaldehyde in biofilms with different concentration of sodium alginate which concluded that higher sodium alginate concentration would lead to lower diffusion coefficient figure s9 in addition the dose effect curves with different concentration of formaldehyde were illustrated in figure s10 revealing again that low concentration of sodium alginate would come with improved sensitivity the artificial eab with 1 of sodium alginate had an inhibition ratio of up to 45 when it exposed to 0 02 formaldehyde an earlier study suggested that electroactive bacteria would generate more eps to protect itself from further toxic impacts when it suffered toxicants shock patil et al 2010 on the contrary the artificial eab may keep sensitive toward toxic impacts rather than act against them as natural biofilms do 3 5 comprehensiveness and real time online operation in practical application eab based biosensor is expected to deliver early warning signals for incoming toxicants in monitored water environment qi et al 2020b to investigate the availability of the biosensor with artificial eab for composite toxicants the phenol which was also presented in water as a pollutant was employed to study the sensitivity of the biosensor results showed that phenol with a concentration of 0 06 could be alerted by the biosensor with a 35 inhibition ratio figure s11 this finding suggested that the biosensor with artificial biofilm was able to alert various pollutants biosensors employed during long term operation may encounter environmental interferences and thus deliver unstable signals in this process to investigate long term performance of the biosensor with artificial eab it was operated for 110 hours despite of random fluctuations its electrical signal output showed clear changes soon after feeding water sample containing 0 06 and 0 1 of formaldehyde during 90 100 h figure s12a the corresponding inhibition ratios were 55 and 76 respectively figure s12b suggesting a weakly reduced sensitivity than in short term monitoring moreover the biosensor could recover 87 after toxicity shock figure s12b at the end of 110 h operation the biofilm had developed into a mature eab figure s13 the above studies were conducted under laboratory simulation conditions it s noted that a pre treatment process will be provided against contamination issue during the practical application in addition if ph is not considered an early warning target the effect of ph on calcium alginate can be eliminated by adding buffer solution in real water samples 4 conclusions by employing sodium alginate as immobilization agent this study proposed a simple and fast way to form an artificial eab electrode enriched with shewanella oneidensis mr 1 for highly sensitive biosensor to monitor incoming toxicants in water environment the artificial eabs were found to deliver repeatable and effective electrical signals under identical early warning experimental conditions different ratios of bacteria and alginate concentrations in forming the eab were investigated for their effects on the biosensor s sensitivity results indicated that low concentration of electroactive bacteria would lead to higher sensitivity but extreme concentration upper 0 06 od660 would not affect the sensitivity anymore in addition 1 sodium alginate was found an optimum amount to serve in eab besides short term early warning experiments long time operation for 110 h was also performed with the biosensor with artificial eab despite of random fluctuations caused by the surrounding the tested biosensor delivered clear signals for incoming toxicants all results suggested that the artificial eab electrode could serve as modularized electrode to devise and regulate an early warning biosensor significantly this

17003,a major challenge for devising an electrochemically active biofilm eab based biosensor for real time water quality early warning is the formation of eab that requires several days to weeks besides the onerous and time consuming preparation process the naturally formed eabs are intensively concerned as they can hardly deliver repeatable electrical signals even at identical experimental conditions to address these concerns this study employed sodium alginate as immobilization agent to encapsulate shewanella oneidensis mr 1 and prepared eab for devising a biosensor in a short period of less than 1 h the artificial eab were found capable of delivering highly consistent electrical signals with each other when fed with the same samples morphology and bioelectrochemical properties of the artificial eab were investigated to provide interpretations for these findings different concentrations of bacteria and alginate in forming the eab were investigated for their effects on the biosensor s sensitivity results suggested that lower concentration of bacteria would be beneficial until it increased to 0 06 od660 concentration of sodium alginate affected the sensitivity as well and 1 was found an optimum amount to serve in the formation of eab a long term operation of the biosensor with artificial eab for 110 h was performed clear warning signals for incoming toxicants were observed over random signal fluctuations all results suggested that the artificial eab electrode would support a rapid devised and highly sensitivity biosensor graphical abstract image graphical

quality monitoring technologies emerge as a promising tool to detect pollutants presented in water and thus prevent further contamination horowitz 2013 biosensors that can directly reflect bioeffect of toxicity have been demonstrated advantageous over traditional chemical analytical technology in recent years antonacci and scognamiglio 2020 most biosensors work through recognizing the concentration or effect of the toxicants those biosensors detecting the concentrations rely on some specific biomacromolecules including nucleic acids antibodies enzymes or proteins which can recognize specific target analytes dai et al 2019 however the preparation of this kind of biosensors is complicated time consuming and costly on the contrary cell based biosensors which monitor composite pollutants through their effect on selected microorganisms e g bacteria microalgae and fungi serving as sensitive elements are able to alert early warning for a variety of monitored water environments including urban rivers lakes and even sewage plants antonacci and scognamiglio 2020 gupta et al 2019 among all sensitive elements employed in early warning biosensors electrochemically active biofilm eab formed by electroactive bacteria has been intensively studied as it can generate detectable bioelectricity as warning signals without any additional chemical mediators chu et al 2021 jiang et al 2018 a variety of organic matters including biochemical oxygen demand bod and volatile fatty acids especially toxicities like heavy metals and organic toxicants can be detected by the changes of electrical signals generated by eab do et al 2019 the sensitivity that reflects the responding ability of biosensor towards the toxicities is a major matric for early warning biosensor in previous studies improved sensitivity could be achieved when the transfer of organic matters and toxicity to biofilm was facilitated through optimizing flow rate flow direction and reactor scale shen et al 2013 xiao et al 2020 regulations of the electrode were also reported to increase the sensitivity including employing constant external resistance constant anode potential constant anode current and transient state operation jiang et al 2017 stein et al 2012 yi et al 2019 modified eab for more responsive performance was prepared through adding electroconductive or redox medium quorum sensing effect and extracellular polymeric substance eps and regulating microbial community structure pan et al 2020 xiao et al 2020 yi et al 2019 with a much improved sensitivity there are still unaddressed concerns when applying in practical real time early warning one major concern is time consuming formation process of eab previous studies reported that it would require several days to weeks to form an eab in laboratorial culture which greatly restrained timely early warning process li et al 2020 liu et al 2011 qi et al 2020a in addition to culture an eab is too complicated for a non professional to perform despite of these difficulties in forming an eab the process is easily affected by many culture conditions leading to different biofilm status e g thickness density and microbial community structure this is why even feeding with identical culture in the same lab the obtained eabs could hardly output repeatable electrical signals which implies that the sensing process cannot be verifiable or convincing eab mainly consist of electroactive bacteria and eps including polysaccharides proteins and humic acid li et al 2020 stöckl et al 2019 an effective method to quickly form an eab is to employ suspended electroactive bacteria and immobilized agents particularly hydrogels that have been used in cell based biosensor ishihara et al 2020 tucci et al 2019 researchers have found that hydrogels are capable of providing an extracellular matrix link and three dimension 3d environments that are biocompatible with cells and have applied them in electroactive bacteria

2017 these previous studies suggest that the hydrogels may facilitate and regulate the formation of eab this study employed hydrogels as immobilization agents to encapsulate electroactive bacteria and quickly formed an eab that produced repeatable electrical signals with this artificial eab electrode a biosensor was devised for early warning and delivered timely responsive signals for toxicants introduced both in short term and long term experiments further investigations on morphology features and bioelectrochemical properties of the obtained eab provided possible interpretations for the greatly reduced startup time and highly consistent repeatability different concentrations of immobilization agents and bacteria were tested for their effects on the sensitivity with both experimental

according to a previous study szollosi et al 2017 the electrode with biofilm was prepared as follows fig 1 a first the collected bacteria and sodium alginate with identical volume were well mixed together then 0 4 ml of this mixture was added dropwise onto a piece of indium tin oxide ito conductive glass 5 cm 5 cm with a silicone pipette center diameter 4 cm to make an ito electrode which was then spun at 350 rmp min for 9 seconds on a spin coater kw 4a beijing china to ensure the biofilm distributed uniformly on the electrode a vacuum pump was employed in this process protect the biofilm next the prepared ito electrode with biofilm was sunk in 0 5 cacl2 solution for 10 seconds to allow cross linking reaction finally a light passing plastic mesh was pressed over the prepared biofilm to keep a close attachment of the electrode and biofilm in which shewanella oneidensis mr 1 served to generate electrons and to transport them with surface redox proteins and nanowire appendages while calcium alginate behaved as conjunctive agents of electroactive bacteria fig 1b for comparison abiotic ito electrodes without any substances and with only sodium alginates 1 1 5 2 2 5 were also prepared and studied as control groups 2 3 device and operation of eab sensor a three electrode reactor was employed as eab sensor to alert an incoming toxicity from water environment in this study

concentration of immobilization agents appeared similar before toxicity because high concentration of organic matters provided enough electron donors for the whole biofilm then the toxicants were introduced into the biosensors with increased concentration of sodium alginate the biosensor delivered slower response to toxic substances with a lower inhibition ratio fig 5a the abiotic ito electrodes with only sodium alginates did not produce any current signals or respond to any toxicants figure s6 however this effect was not obvious when the concentration of sodium alginate was lower than 1 5 fig 5b which could be interpreted as low concentration of sodium alginate had little impact on the transfer of formaldehyde in biofilm herein the biofilm could not form with the immobilization technology when the sodium alginate concentration is lower than 1 in this study thus 1 of sodium alginate was optimum for artificial eab formation a previous study reported that biofilm thickness would impact the transportation of toxicants in biofilm and further affect the sensitivity qi et al 2020a however 3d clsm images of the biofilms with different concentration of immobilization agents showed no obvious difference in the thickness and similar morphology structures figure s7 and s8 by excluding the biofilm thickness high concentration of sodium alginate would be considered a major contributor for the limited mass transfer of toxicants in biofilm this interpretation was evidenced by the calculations of diffusion coefficients of formaldehyde in biofilms with different concentration of sodium alginate which concluded that higher sodium alginate concentration would lead to lower diffusion coefficient figure s9 in addition the dose effect curves with different concentration of formaldehyde were illustrated in figure s10 revealing again that low concentration of sodium alginate would come with improved sensitivity the artificial eab with 1 of sodium alginate had an inhibition ratio of up to 45 when it exposed to 0 02 formaldehyde an earlier study suggested that electroactive bacteria would generate more eps to protect itself from further toxic impacts when it suffered toxicants shock patil et al 2010 on the contrary the artificial eab may keep sensitive toward toxic impacts rather than act against them as natural biofilms do 3 5 comprehensiveness and real time online operation in practical application eab based biosensor is expected to deliver early warning signals for incoming toxicants in monitored water environment qi et al 2020b to investigate the availability of the biosensor with artificial eab for composite toxicants the phenol which was also presented in water as a pollutant was employed to study the sensitivity of the biosensor results showed that phenol with a concentration of 0 06 could be alerted by the biosensor with a 35 inhibition ratio figure s11 this finding suggested that the biosensor with artificial biofilm was able to alert various pollutants biosensors employed during long term operation may encounter environmental interferences and thus deliver unstable signals in this process to investigate long term performance of the biosensor with artificial eab it was operated for 110 hours despite of random fluctuations its electrical signal output showed clear changes soon after feeding water sample containing 0 06 and 0 1 of formaldehyde during 90 100 h figure s12a the corresponding inhibition ratios were 55 and 76 respectively figure s12b suggesting a weakly reduced sensitivity than in short term monitoring moreover the biosensor could recover 87 after toxicity shock figure s12b at the end of 110 h operation the biofilm had developed into a mature eab figure s13 the above studies were conducted under laboratory simulation conditions it s noted that a pre treatment process will be provided against contamination issue during the practical application in addition if ph is not considered an early warning target the effect of ph on calcium alginate can be eliminated by adding buffer solution in real water samples 4 conclusions by employing sodium alginate as immobilization agent this study proposed a simple and fast way to form an artificial eab electrode enriched with shewanella oneidensis mr 1 for highly sensitive biosensor to monitor incoming toxicants in water environment the artificial eabs were found to deliver repeatable and effective electrical signals under identical early warning experimental conditions different ratios of bacteria and alginate concentrations in forming the eab were investigated for their effects on the biosensor s sensitivity results indicated that low concentration of electroactive bacteria would lead to higher sensitivity but extreme concentration upper 0 06 od660 would not affect the sensitivity anymore in addition 1 sodium alginate was found an optimum amount to serve in eab besides short term early warning experiments long time operation for 110 h was also performed with the biosensor with artificial eab despite of random fluctuations caused by the surrounding the tested biosensor delivered clear signals for incoming toxicants all results suggested that the artificial eab electrode could serve as modularized electrode to devise and regulate an early warning biosensor significantly this work is expected to push eab based biosensor into a national or international standard of water quality early warning in the future declaration of competing interest the authors declare no competing

17004,currently existing fenton like catalysts were limited in wastewater treatment owing to their potential transition metal poisoning narrow applicable ph range and high dependence on external energy excitation in this work the mgncn mgo nanocomposites were firstly synthesized by a facile one pot calcination of melamine and basic magnesium carbonate and used as novel h2o2 activator for antibiotic removal it was found that the mgncn mgo composite calcined at 550 c with the mass ratio of melamine to basic magnesium carbonate at 2 1 exhibited an excellent catalytic ability to tetracycline tc degradation in a wide ph range of 4 10 without any external energy input more than 90 of tc 100 ml 50 mg l could be degraded within 30 min by 10 mg of the nanocomposite in the presence of 0 2 ml of 30 wt h2o2 based on the experimental results it was concluded that the mg n coordination between mgncn and mgo in mgncn mgo nanocomposites activated h2o2 to produce primary singlet oxygen 1o2 and minor hydroxyl radicals oh responding for tc degradation in addition the degradation pathways of tc were deduced by determining the generated intermediates during the degradation process this work provided a novel idea for designing transition metal free catalysts for nonradical activation of h2o2 in the absence of external energy excitation graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords mgncn mgo nanocomposite one step synthesis h2o2 activation singlet oxygen tetracycline degradation 1 introduction in recent decades antibiotics have been widely used in humans and veterinary medicine to treat diseases due to their excellent ability to cope with bacterial infections li et al 2020a xiao et al 2018 however the worldwide production and abuse of antibiotics have resulted in a large amount of antibiotic wastewater discharged into the environment barhoumi et al 2017 these residual antibiotics have caused a great harm to humans and environment because of their toxicity to organisms and resulted collection of antibiotic resistance genes in microorganisms karaolia et al 2018 kong et al 2020 a variety of methods including adsorption yue et al 2019 membrane filtration cheng et al 2016 biodegradation xie et al 2018 photodegradation yue et al 2020 and fenton fenton like oxidation han et al 2020 jin et al 2017 li et al 2021 have been developed and improved to eliminate antibiotics from sewage among them fenton fenton like reactions can effectively degrade persistent antibiotics by generating abundant oxidizing reactive oxygen species ros such as hydroxyl radicals oh superoxide radicals o2 singlet oxygen 1o2 however the conventional fenton processes require pre acidification post neutralization and removal of generated iron sludge to avoid secondary pollution yang et al 2013 making the processes complicated and costly to overcome these shortcomings various fenton like catalysts such as ag he et al 2014a feooh qian et al 2017 mn3o4 weng et al 2017 cufeo2 dai et al 2018 biocl li et al 2017 and mnsio3 hao et al 2016 have been developed to extend the applicable ph range even to near neutral nevertheless the reported fenton like catalysts either contain toxic transition metal components or require external energy light electricity or ultrasound excitation özcan et al 2017 perini et al 2018 zhu et al 2019 these defects greatly limit the practical application of fenton like reactions therefore it is necessary to develop toxic metal free fenton like catalysts which can work in a wide ph range without external energy input metal cyanamides have long been known as metal pseudo chalcogenides because ncn 2 in metal cyanamide is equivalent to o2 in metal oxide zhao et al 2013 compared to metal oxide the lower electronegativity and larger charge delocalization of ncn 2 cause its bond with metals to possess a large degree of covalent character eguía barrio et al 2016 thus the structural characteristics of ncn 2 endow metal cyanamides specific properties facilitating the development of new functional materials such as photocatalyst materials jia et al 2018 ferromagnetic materials tang et al 2010 battery materials eguía barrio et al 2016 however to the best of our knowledge the related metal cyanamide composites have never been reported as fenton like catalysts in environmental remediation applications herein the mgncn mgo nanocomposites were prepared for the first time by a simple one step calcination of melamine and basic magnesium carbonate the obtained mgncn mgo composites exhibited excellent h2o2 activation ability to degrade tc in a wide ph range without external energy input indicating a considerable energy saving advantage and suitable for more application fields compared to previous fenton like catalysts mgncn mgo composites were more environmentally friendly because they did not contain any toxic metal component the excellent fenton like catalytic performance was attributed to the mg n coordination between mgo and mgncn in the mgncn mgo composites furthermore the mechanism of catalytic degradation was explored by identifying the crucial reactive oxygen species and detecting the

grinding in a mortar afterwards the homogeneous mixture was transferred into a 30 ml crucible covered with a lid and aluminum foil then the crucible was heated from room temperature to 550 c with a heating rate of 10 c min and kept at 550 c for 2 h in a muffle furnace after cooling to room temperature the mgncn mgo nanocomposites with different ratio of melamine to basic magnesium carbonate were obtained and denoted as pre 1 1 pre 2 1 pre 3 1 and pre 4 1 respectively as control groups pure g c3n4 and pure mgo were obtained by calcining melamine and basic magnesium carbonate individually at 550 c for 2 h to study the effect of calcination temperature the mixture of 1 0 g of melamine and 0 5g of basic magnesium carbonate was also calcined at 450 500 600 and 650 c respectively 2 3

of 30 wt h2o2 was added into the above solution under constant stirring at specified time intervals about 3 ml of mixture was taken out and evenly mixed with 20 μl of 3 mol l na2s2o3 solution by

diffraction xrd patterns of the as prepared samples obtained by calcining melamine and basic magnesium carbonate with different mass ratios at 550 c as expected the product from basic magnesium carbonate alone showed the diffraction peaks at 2θ 36 9 42 8 62 2 74 5 and 78 4 which was well ascribed to mgo phase with a periclase structure jcpds 00 004 0829 as for the products from the co calcination of melamine and basic magnesium carbonate besides the peaks from mgo there existed the diffraction peaks at 2θ 18 8 34 0 45 2 56 1 59 7 and 67 3 derived from the 003 012 015 110 113 and 202 plane of mgncn with a rhombohedral structure jcpds 00 051 0540 respectively this indicated the nanocomposites were mainly composed of mgo and mgncn phases as the mass ratio of melamine to basic magnesium carbonate increased the related peaks from mgncn phase became stronger compared to mgo suggesting an increase of mgncn content in the composites when the mass ratio rose to 4 1 the two peaks at 13 0 and 27 4 appeared in the xrd pattern of pre 4 1 arisen from the 100 and 002 planes of graphitic carbon nitride g c3n4 ge et al 2018 meantime calcining individual melamine only yielded pure g c3n4 phase the interaction between mgncn and mgo in mgncn mgo nanocomposites was studied by fourier transform infrared ftir spectrometer fig 1b typical peaks of mgo ge et al 2018 xiong et al 2015 and g c3n4 liang et al 2015 yu et al 2016 appeared in ftir spectra of the samples from calcining basic magnesium carbonate and melamine alone which indirectly proved the products were mgo and g c3n4 respectively compared to the curves of pure mgo and g c3n4 a strong peak at 2138 cm 1 and a sharp peak at 683 cm 1 emerged in ftir spectra of the pre 1 1 pre 2 1 pre 3 1 and pre 4 1 samples which resulted from the stretching vibration and deformation vibration of ncn 2 meng et al 2015 it was well known that ncn 2 existed in two electronic structures symmetric carbodiimide n c n 2 form eguía barrio et al 2016 and asymmetric cyanamide nc n 2 form ressnig and antonietti 2014 according to the previous reports barhoumi et al 2017 ressnig et al 2015 it was determined that mgncn phase existed in the form of mg n c n carbodiimide in mgncn mgo nanocomposites notably in comparison with the peaks at 2074 and 675 cm 1 in the ftir spectrum of pure mgncn fig s1 the peaks of n c n 2 in mgncn mgo shifted to high wavenumber which might be due to the bonding effect between mgncn and mgo to investigate the effect of calcining temperature on the products another set of samples were obtained by calcining melamine and basic magnesium carbonate with mass ratio of 2 1 at different temperatures as shown in the xrd patterns fig 1c when calcination temperature was lower than 550 c the obtained samples had residual mgco3 phase indicating that basic magnesium carbonate was not completely decomposed the composite calcined at 550 c possessed relatively strong diffraction peaks from mgncn phase suggesting a high mgncn content in the composite thereafter the mgncn content in the samples gradually decreased as calcination temperature increased even no characteristic peaks from mgncn phase were detected for the sample calcined at 650 c as shown in fig 1d the ftir peaks of mgncn phase gradually became stronger with the calcination temperature rose from 450 to 550 c and reached the strongest when the temperature up to 550 c further increased the temperature the peaks of mgncn phase conversely became weak this demonstrated that the mgncn in the samples increased firstly and then decomposed progressively as calcination temperature rose which was in coincidence with the above xrd results the microstructure of the pre 2 1 nanocomposites was investigated by field emission scanning electron microscopy fsem and field emission transmission electron microscopy ftem in the fsem image fig 2 a the mgncn mgo nanocomposites were composed of numerous irregularly shaped nanoparticles with the size around 40 nm evidently these nanoparticles exhibited a certain degree of agglomeration caused by high surface energy of small sized particle edx mapping fig s2a e showed that c n o and mg elements were evenly distributed in the pre 2 1 sample moreover the contents of these elements in pre 2 1 fig s2f were almost consistent with the theoretical values the ftem image of pre 2 1 fig 2b also verified that mgncn mgo nanocomposites consisted of small flake like particles with diameter ranging from 20 to 60 nm n2 adsorption desorption isotherms fig s3a revealed that the mgncn mgo nanocomposites had a bet surface area of 38 94 m² g and pore volume of 0 23 cm³ g by calculation of bjh model the pore size concentrated in the range of 2 50 nm fig s3b these small sized particles with high surface area would provide a great amount of active sites and thus favorable for the improvement of catalytic performance x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps analysis of pre 2 1 was carried out to study the chemical structures and states of the typical elements in the mgncn mgo nanocomposites clearly the c 1s xps spectrum of the nanocomposites fig 2c could be deconvoluted into three characteristic peaks the main peak at 285 0 ev corresponded to the n c n bond which was similar to graphitic carbon c c c c the peak appeared at 286 5 ev could be assigned to the formed c o bond hu et al 2015 yeh et al 2014 between mgncn and mgo in addition the peak at 289 1 ev could be originated from residual carbonate li et al 2016 which also appeared in the c 1s spectrum of individual mgo fig s4 in the high resolution n 1s xps spectrum fig 2d the main peak located at 397 8 ev could be derived from mg n c bond in mgncn phase similar to the reported b n c bond wang et al 2020b further confirming that ncn 2 had only one chemical state and existed in a symmetric n c n 2 form the small peak at 397 2 ev was related to the mg n coordination bond ge et al 2018 between mgncn and mgo it was worth noting that the bonding energy of the mg n coordination 397 2 ev was lower than that of pristine mg n bond 397 8 ev in mgncn phase suggesting a high electron cloud density around the coordinated n atom which was caused by the coordination of mgo the o 1s xps spectrum fig 2e could be divided into three peaks the peaks at 531 9 and 533 3 ev could be indexed to lattice oxygen of mgo and adsorbed oxygen respectively cai et al 2017 rao et al 2014 the peak appeared at 530 2 ev was attributed to c o bond jayaramulu et al 2016 which was consistent with the analyses of c 1s spectrum the mg 1s peak of the mgncn mgo nanocomposites fig 2f could be fitted into three adjacent peaks located at 1302 9 1303 6 and 1304 3 ev according to the fact that the electronegativity of o atom was stronger than that of n atom these peaks were ascribed to n mg n n mg o and o mg o bond respectively 3 2 catalytic performance of mgncn mgo nanocomposites tetracycline tc was selected as a model antibiotic to test the catalytic performance of obtained nanocomposites as shown in fig 3 a both g c3n4 and mgo were unable to catalyze the degradation of tc indicating that single g c3n4 or mgo had no catalytic activity under the experimental conditions however tc could be more or less degraded by pre 1 1 pre 2 1 pre 3 1 and pre 4 1 among these samples the pre 2 1 sample exhibited the best catalytic performance on the basis of relative intensities of xrd peaks in fig 1a the pre 3 1 sample contained more mgncn phase than the pre 2 1 sample however the catalytic activity of pre 3 1 became weaker than that of pre 2 1 indirectly demonstrating that the catalytic performance was dependent on mgncn mgo composites rather than mgncn alone to further prove this viewpoint the single phased mgncn sample was prepared and used for the catalytic degradation of tc details in supplementary data evidently individual mgncn could hardly catalyze the degradation of tc fig s5 these results powerfully manifested that the bonding effect between mgncn and mgo in the nanocomposites played a major role in the catalytic degradation of tc the catalytic performances of the samples calcined at different temperature were shown in fig 3b when the calcination temperature was no more than 550 c the performance of the obtained samples improved as the calcination temperature increased however the tendency was reversed once the temperature was higher than 550 c the sample obtained at 650 c had nearly no catalytic ability due to the fact that the sample was pure mgo phase fig 1c the data of tc degradation were fitted by pseudo first order eq 1 in supplementary data and pseudo second order eq 2 in supplementary data kinetic models bao et al 2017 wu et al 2019 as shown in fig 3 and s6 the experimental data was in better agreement with pseudo first order model due to its higher correlation coefficients table s1 and s2 compared to pseudo second order model the kinetic rate constant of the pre 2 1 nanocomposites was calculated to be about 0 1245 min 1 which was higher than that of other samples moreover the removal rates of chemical oxygen demands cod by pre 2 1 were estimated to be about 42 6 and 71 1 at 30 min and 24 h respectively fig s7 therefore the pre 2 1 nanocomposites were used in the subsequent experiments owing to its distinguished catalytic activity towards tc degradation effects of other experimental parameters including h2o2 dosage catalyst dosage and initial solution ph on tc degradation were also studied in details as shown in fig 4 a the concentration of tc was almost kept constant without adding h2o2 indaciting none of tc was adsorbed or degraded by individual mgncn mgo nanocomposites once h2o2 was introduced into the system even a very small dosage tc could be significantly degraded as the amount of h2o2 increased the degradation efficiency of tc constantly improved fig s8a and table s3 when the addition dosage of h2o2 exceeded 0 2 ml the improvement of degradation efficiency was not remarkable as expected only h2o2 could not degrade tc in the absence of mgncn mgo nanocomposites fig 4b demonstrating that mgncn mgo nanocomposites as catalyst was indispensable for tc degradation moreover the degradation efficiency of tc was gradually enhanced with increasing the amount of mgncn mgo nanocomposites fig s8b and table s4 when the dosage of mgncn mgo nanocomposites were more than 10 mg the degradation efficiency slowly increased therefore taking into account of cost and efficiency 0 2 ml of h2o2 and 10 mg of mgncn mgo nanocomposites were suitable for tc degradation surprisingly tc could be efficiently degraded in a wide ph range of 4 10 fig 4c by mgncn mgo h2o2 system fig s8c and table s5 this overcame the drawback of common fenton fenton like systems that were effective only under acidic condition when the initial solution ph was adjusted to 2 there exsited plentiful hydrogen ions h in solution which caused mgncn mgo nanocomposites to be decomposed completely thus tc could not be catalytically degraded by mgncn mgo nanocomposites under strong acid condition when the initial solution ph was highly alkaline ph 12 the degradation efficiency of tc was reduced to some extent only 66 3 after 30 min it might be due to the fact that h2o2 tended to decompose into h2o and o2 in strong alkaline condition thereby reducing the generation of ros chen et al 2017 voitko et al 2015 to rule out the chelation of mg2 the effect of mg2 with different concentration on tc degradation were examined and shown in fig 4d no matter how many mg ions were introduced tc was not degraded at all indicating that mg2 had no contribution to tc removal compared with most reported photocatalysts and fenton like catalysts table s6 the fenton like catalysis of pre 2 1 without external energy excitation exhibited a higher kinetic constant and wider ph application range for tc degradation further the degradation performance of mgncn mgo h2o2 system was evaluated using low concentrations of tc in distilled water and natural river water inferior class v as can be seen in fig s9 the lower concentration of tc the faster the degradation rate the degradation rate of tc in river water was slower than that in distilled water due to the existence of large amounts of organics inorganics and microorganisms in natural river water which would consume the generated ros when the volume of tc solution was enlarged to 5 l scale the degradation performance of mgncn mgo h2o2 system almost no decreased compared to 100 ml of tc solution moreover after the degradation reaction the collected precipitates could be easily regenerated to mgncn mgo composites for reuse fig s10 hence the mgncn mgo nanocomposites pre 2 1 had great application prospects in sewage treatment 3 3 catalytic mechanism of mgncn mgo nanocomposites it was a general consensus that fenton fenton like reactions were capable of degrading organic contaminants due to the generation of strongly oxidizing oh 1o2 or o2 here isopropanol furfuryl alcohol and tempol as scavenger agents for oh 1o2 and o2 ahmed et al 2020 hu et al 2020 zhang et al 2019 were added into the mgncn mgo h2o2 tc systems respectively it was found that a very high concentration of isopropanol 2000 mm could inhibit tc degradation to a certain extent indicating that oh maight play a weak role in tc degradation while the inhibitory effect was not obvious at low concentrations of isopropanol fig 5 a which might be due to the fact that mgo in mgncn mgo nanocomposites has strong adsorption towards isopropanol fuente et al 2015 fig 5b showed that furfuryl alcohol could significantly suppress tc degradation implying that 1o2 was the main ros responding for tc degradation meanwhile the addition of tempol has almost no inhibitory effect on tc degradation fig 5c suggesting that there was little o2 generated in the mgncn mgo h2o2 system in order to verify the above points electron paramagnetic resonance epr analyses were employed to find out which kind of ros produced in the mgncn mgo h2o2 system by using 5 5 dimethyl 1 pyrroline n oxide dmpo and 2 2 6 6 tetramethyl 4 piperidinol temp as spin trapping agents respectively as shown in fig 5d a weak characteristic signal of dmpo oh adduct the quartet peak with intensity ratios of 1 2 2 1 liu et al 2020 was appeared while the signal from the dmpo o2 adduct was hardly detected in contrast a strong 1 1 1 triplet signal from the characteristic peaks of temp 1o2 adduct dai et al 2020 huang et al 2020 was observed all these results indicated that 1o2 was the predominant ros generated in the mgncn mgo h2o2 system the catalytic ability of mgncn mgo nanocomposites might be attributed to the formation of electron rich n centers resulting from the mg n coordination between mgo and mgncn which could efficiently activate oxidants to yield ros cao et al 2019 chen et al 2018 to further explore the catalytic process the concentrations of generated nh4 no2 and no3 in the mgncn mgo h2o2 and mgncn mgo h2o2 tc systems were tested by a water quality analyzer and ion chromatograph fig 6 a and 6b in the mgncn mgo h2o2 system fig 6c as the time went on the no2 concentration declined while the amounts of no3 and nh4 increased here nh4 was from the continuous decomposition of mgncn mgo nanocomposites which was oxidized by generated 1o2 and oh to no2 and no2 was subsequently oxidized to no3 by 1o2 and oh kim and choi 2002 xingdong zhu et al 2005 as for the mgncn mgo h2o2 tc system fig 6d the nh4 concentration was higher than that in the mgncn mgo h2o2 system at the same time because the extra nh4 in the solution was derived from the degradation of tc molecule he et al 2014b besides the decomposition of mgncn mgo nanocomposites it was worth noting that the concentrations of no2 and no3 were not high especially no3 was maintained at a low concentration this result indicated that the generated 1o2 and oh in the mgncn mgo h2o2 tc system preferentially degraded tc molecule instead of oxidizing nh4 and no2 which was consistent with the literature reported kim et al 2002 to study the transformation product of mgncn mgo nanocomposites after reaction a relatively high amount of the nanocomposites were used as catalyst to facilitate collection of solid residue xrd patterns of the two residual precipitates fig s11a revealed that the all diffraction peaks were indexed to mg oh 2 jcpds 00 044 1482 originating from the hydrolysis of mgncn mgo nanocomposites in the mgncn mgo h2o2 tc and mgncn mgo h2o2 systems however the peak intensities of the residue in the mgncn mgo h2o2 tc system were weaker than those in the mgncn mgo h2o2 system this might be because tc and its degradation intermediates in solution inhibited the crystallization of mg oh 2 in the ftir spectra of the residues fig s11b the sharp peak at 3700 cm 1 was derived from the stretching vibration of oh in mg oh 2 structure llamas et al 2007 the weak absorption located at 2210 cm 1 might be related to the adsorbed nox species raskó and kiss 2006 resulting from the decomposition of mgncn and tc and the weak peak at 2150 cm 1 was from residual mgncn obviously the peak of adsorbed nox species in the mgncn mgo h2o2 system was stronger than that in the mgncn mgo h2o2 tc system due to more nox generation in the mgncn mgo h2o2 system fig 6 thus the catalytic process and mechanism of mgncn mgo nanocomposite for tc degradation was schematically depicted in fig 7 based on the above discussion and analysis the generated intermediates during the degradation process were identified by lc ms to deduce the degradation pathways of tc fig s12 showed the chromatograms of the mixture solutions with different reaction time clearly the peaks of tc drastically reduced and almost disappeared within 30 min along with the appearance and decay of several new weak peaks at different retention time demonstrating that tc was degraded step by step the mass spectra at different retention time were summarized in fig s13 and the corresponding intermediates were listed in table s7 according to these intermediates the possible degradation pathways of tc were proposed and shown in fig 8 at the initial step of degradation the electron rich functional groups in tc molecule such as double bond c7 c8 c11a c12 amide group c2 and dimethylamino group c4 were more vulnerable to the attack of electrophilic 1o2 and oh liu et al 2019 wang et al 2020a under attack of 1o2 the p1 intermediate m z 492 8 was produced through ring opening at c7 c8 in tc molecule khan et al 2010 li et al 2020b then it was dehydroxylated at c6 to form p4 m z 476 9 the dimethylamino at c4 position in p4 was further reacted with 1o2 and oh to yield the p5 intermediate m z 446 9 meanwhile tc molecule was directly demethylated at c4 position to yield the p2 intermediate m z 416 9 due to the co attacks of 1o2 and oh jiang et al 2017 xie et al 2018 after then p2 was converted into the p5 p6 m z 400 9 and p7 m z 432 9 intermediates were given from by the ring opening at c7 c8 deamination at c4 dehydroxylation at c6 position and cycloaddition towards c11a c12 double bond respectively in addition the p3 intermediate m z 460 9 was generated by the 1 3 dipolar cyclo addition towards c11a c12 double bond he et al 2014b in tc molecule after the demethylation of n methyl group c4 position p7 was also produced from p3 subsequently the intermediates including compounds p8 p14 were formed through further oxidation of the p5 p6 and p7 intermediates finally these intermediates were oxidized into co2 h2o and nh4 by 1o2 and oh wang et al 2020a 4 conclusion in summary mgncn mgo nanocomposites were successfully synthesized by one

17004,currently existing fenton like catalysts were limited in wastewater treatment owing to their potential transition metal poisoning narrow applicable ph range and high dependence on external energy excitation in this work the mgncn mgo nanocomposites were firstly synthesized by a facile one pot calcination of melamine and basic magnesium carbonate and used as novel h2o2 activator for antibiotic removal it was found that the mgncn mgo composite calcined at 550 c with the mass ratio of melamine to basic magnesium carbonate at 2 1 exhibited an excellent catalytic ability to tetracycline tc degradation in a wide ph range of 4 10 without any external energy input more than 90 of tc 100 ml 50 mg l could be degraded within 30 min by 10 mg of the nanocomposite in the presence of 0 2 ml of 30 wt h2o2 based on the experimental results it was concluded that the mg n coordination between mgncn and mgo in mgncn mgo nanocomposites activated h2o2 to produce primary singlet oxygen 1o2 and minor hydroxyl radicals oh responding for tc degradation in addition the degradation pathways of tc were deduced by determining the generated intermediates during the degradation process this work provided a novel idea for designing transition metal free catalysts for nonradical activation of h2o2 in the absence of external energy excitation graphical abstract image graphical abstract

medicine to treat diseases due to their excellent ability to cope with bacterial infections li et al 2020a xiao et al 2018 however the worldwide production and abuse of antibiotics have resulted in a large amount of antibiotic wastewater discharged into the environment barhoumi et al 2017 these residual antibiotics have caused a great harm to humans and environment because of their toxicity to organisms and resulted collection of antibiotic resistance genes in microorganisms karaolia et al 2018 kong et al 2020 a variety of methods including adsorption yue et al 2019 membrane filtration cheng et al 2016 biodegradation xie et al 2018 photodegradation yue et al 2020 and fenton fenton like oxidation han et al 2020 jin et al 2017 li et al 2021 have been developed and improved to eliminate antibiotics from sewage among them fenton fenton like reactions can effectively degrade persistent antibiotics by generating abundant oxidizing reactive oxygen species ros such as hydroxyl radicals oh superoxide radicals o2 singlet oxygen 1o2 however the conventional fenton processes require pre acidification post neutralization and removal of generated iron sludge to avoid secondary pollution yang et al 2013 making the processes complicated and costly to overcome these shortcomings various fenton like catalysts such as ag he et al 2014a feooh qian et al 2017 mn3o4 weng et al 2017 cufeo2 dai et al 2018 biocl li et al 2017 and mnsio3 hao et al 2016 have been developed to extend the applicable ph range even to near neutral nevertheless the reported fenton like catalysts either contain toxic transition metal components or require external energy light electricity or ultrasound excitation özcan et al 2017 perini et al 2018 zhu et al 2019 these defects greatly limit the practical application of fenton like reactions therefore it is necessary to develop toxic metal free fenton like catalysts which can work in a wide ph range without external energy input metal cyanamides have long been known as metal pseudo chalcogenides because ncn 2 in metal cyanamide is equivalent to o2 in metal oxide zhao et al 2013 compared to metal oxide the lower electronegativity and larger charge delocalization of ncn 2 cause its bond with metals to possess a large degree of covalent character eguía barrio et al 2016 thus the structural characteristics of ncn 2 endow metal cyanamides specific properties facilitating the development of new functional materials such as photocatalyst materials jia et al 2018 ferromagnetic materials tang et al 2010 battery materials eguía barrio et al 2016 however to the best of our knowledge the related metal cyanamide composites have never been reported as fenton like catalysts in environmental remediation applications herein the mgncn mgo nanocomposites were prepared for the first time by a simple one step calcination of melamine and basic magnesium carbonate the obtained mgncn mgo composites exhibited excellent h2o2 activation ability to degrade tc in a wide ph range without external energy input indicating a considerable energy saving advantage and suitable for more application fields compared to previous fenton like catalysts mgncn mgo composites were more environmentally friendly because they did not contain any toxic metal component the excellent fenton like catalytic performance was attributed to the mg n coordination between mgo and mgncn in the mgncn mgo composites furthermore the mechanism of catalytic degradation was explored by identifying the crucial reactive oxygen species and detecting the

stated and used without further purification 2 2 preparation of nanocomposites firstly 1 0 g of melamine and different amounts 1 0 5 0 33 and 0 25g of basic magnesium carbonate were mixed evenly by grinding in a mortar afterwards the homogeneous mixture was transferred into a 30 ml crucible covered with a lid and aluminum foil then the crucible was heated from room temperature to 550 c with a heating rate of 10 c min and kept at 550 c for 2 h in a muffle furnace after cooling to room temperature the mgncn mgo nanocomposites with different ratio of melamine to basic magnesium carbonate were obtained and denoted as pre 1 1 pre 2 1 pre 3 1 and pre 4 1 respectively as control groups pure g c3n4 and pure mgo were obtained by calcining melamine and basic magnesium carbonate individually at 550 c for 2 h to study the effect of calcination temperature the mixture of 1 0 g of melamine and 0 5g of basic magnesium carbonate was also calcined at 450 500 600 and 650 c respectively 2 3

mgo nanocomposites was added into a beaker containing 100 ml of 50 mg l tc solution at room temperature 25 c after magnetically stirring for 5 min to distribute the catalyst evenly in solution 0 2 ml of 30 wt h2o2 was added into the above solution under constant stirring at specified time intervals about 3 ml of mixture was taken out and evenly mixed with 20 μl of 3 mol l na2s2o3 solution by shaking vigorously to quench the degradation reaction then the mixture was filtered through a 0 22 μm pore size syringe filter and the filtrate was collected to measure the concentration of residual

diffraction xrd patterns of the as prepared samples obtained by calcining melamine and basic magnesium carbonate with different mass ratios at 550 c as expected the product from basic magnesium carbonate alone showed the diffraction peaks at 2θ 36 9 42 8 62 2 74 5 and 78 4 which was well ascribed to mgo phase with a periclase structure jcpds 00 004 0829 as for the products from the co calcination of melamine and basic magnesium carbonate besides the peaks from mgo there existed the diffraction peaks at 2θ 18 8 34 0 45 2 56 1 59 7 and 67 3 derived from the 003 012 015 110 113 and 202 plane of mgncn with a rhombohedral structure jcpds 00 051 0540 respectively this indicated the nanocomposites were mainly composed of mgo and mgncn phases as the mass ratio of melamine to basic magnesium carbonate increased the related peaks from mgncn phase became stronger compared to mgo suggesting an increase of mgncn content in the composites when the mass ratio rose to 4 1 the two peaks at 13 0 and 27 4 appeared in the xrd pattern of pre 4 1 arisen from the 100 and 002 planes of graphitic carbon nitride g c3n4 ge et al 2018 meantime calcining individual melamine only yielded pure g c3n4 phase the interaction between mgncn and mgo in mgncn mgo nanocomposites was studied by fourier transform infrared ftir spectrometer fig 1b typical peaks of mgo ge et al 2018 xiong et al 2015 and g c3n4 liang et al 2015 yu et al 2016 appeared in ftir spectra of the samples from calcining basic magnesium carbonate and melamine alone which indirectly proved the products were mgo and g c3n4 respectively compared to the curves of pure mgo and g c3n4 a strong peak at 2138 cm 1 and a sharp peak at 683 cm 1 emerged in ftir spectra of the pre 1 1 pre 2 1 pre 3 1 and pre 4 1 samples which resulted from the stretching vibration and deformation vibration of ncn 2 meng et al 2015 it was well known that ncn 2 existed in two electronic structures symmetric carbodiimide n c n 2 form eguía barrio et al 2016 and asymmetric cyanamide nc n 2 form ressnig and antonietti 2014 according to the previous reports barhoumi et al 2017 ressnig et al 2015 it was determined that mgncn phase existed in the form of mg n c n carbodiimide in mgncn mgo nanocomposites notably in comparison with the peaks at 2074 and 675 cm 1 in the ftir spectrum of pure mgncn fig s1 the peaks of n c n 2 in mgncn mgo shifted to high wavenumber which might be due to the bonding effect between mgncn and mgo to investigate the effect of calcining temperature on the products another set of samples were obtained by calcining melamine and basic magnesium carbonate with mass ratio of 2 1 at different temperatures as shown in the xrd patterns fig 1c when calcination temperature was lower than 550 c the obtained samples had residual mgco3 phase indicating that basic magnesium carbonate was not completely decomposed the composite calcined at 550 c possessed relatively strong diffraction peaks from mgncn phase suggesting a high mgncn content in the composite thereafter the mgncn content in the samples gradually decreased as calcination temperature increased even no characteristic peaks from mgncn phase were detected for the sample calcined at 650 c as shown in fig 1d the ftir peaks of mgncn phase gradually became stronger with the calcination temperature rose from 450 to 550 c and reached the strongest when the temperature up to 550 c further increased the temperature the peaks of mgncn phase conversely became weak this demonstrated that the mgncn in the samples increased firstly and then decomposed progressively as calcination temperature rose which was in coincidence with the above xrd results the microstructure of the pre 2 1 nanocomposites was investigated by field emission scanning electron microscopy fsem and field emission transmission electron microscopy ftem in the fsem image fig 2 a the mgncn mgo nanocomposites were composed of numerous irregularly shaped nanoparticles with the size around 40 nm evidently these nanoparticles exhibited a certain degree of agglomeration caused by high surface energy of small sized particle edx mapping fig s2a e showed that c n o and mg elements were evenly distributed in the pre 2 1 sample moreover the contents of these elements in pre 2 1 fig s2f were almost consistent with the theoretical values the ftem image of pre 2 1 fig 2b also verified that mgncn mgo nanocomposites consisted of small flake like particles with diameter ranging from 20 to 60 nm n2 adsorption desorption isotherms fig s3a revealed that the mgncn mgo nanocomposites had a bet surface area of 38 94 m² g and pore volume of 0 23 cm³ g by calculation of bjh model the pore size concentrated in the range of 2 50 nm fig s3b these small sized particles with high surface area would provide a great amount of active sites and thus favorable for the improvement of catalytic performance x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps analysis of pre 2 1 was carried out to study the chemical structures and states of the typical elements in the mgncn mgo nanocomposites clearly the c 1s xps spectrum of the nanocomposites fig 2c could be deconvoluted into three characteristic peaks the main peak at 285 0 ev corresponded to the n c n bond which was similar to graphitic carbon c c c c the peak appeared at 286 5 ev could be assigned to the formed c o bond hu et al 2015 yeh et al 2014 between mgncn and mgo in addition the peak at 289 1 ev could be originated from residual carbonate li et al 2016 which also appeared in the c 1s spectrum of individual mgo fig s4 in the high resolution n 1s xps spectrum fig 2d the main peak located at 397 8 ev could be derived from mg n c bond in mgncn phase similar to the reported b n c bond wang et al 2020b further confirming that ncn 2 had only one chemical state and existed in a symmetric n c n 2 form the small peak at 397 2 ev was related to the mg n coordination bond ge et al 2018 between mgncn and mgo it was worth noting that the bonding energy of the mg n coordination 397 2 ev was lower than that of pristine mg n bond 397 8 ev in mgncn phase suggesting a high electron cloud density around the coordinated n atom which was caused by the coordination of mgo the o 1s xps spectrum fig 2e could be divided into three peaks the peaks at 531 9 and 533 3 ev could be indexed to lattice oxygen of mgo and adsorbed oxygen respectively cai et al 2017 rao et al 2014 the peak appeared at 530 2 ev was attributed to c o bond jayaramulu et al 2016 which was consistent with the analyses of c 1s spectrum the mg 1s peak of the mgncn mgo nanocomposites fig 2f could be fitted into three adjacent peaks located at 1302 9 1303 6 and 1304 3 ev according to the fact that the electronegativity of o atom was stronger than that of n atom these peaks were ascribed to n mg n n mg o and o mg o bond respectively 3 2 catalytic performance of mgncn mgo nanocomposites tetracycline tc was selected as a model antibiotic to test the catalytic performance of obtained nanocomposites as shown in fig 3 a both g c3n4 and mgo were unable to catalyze the degradation of tc indicating that single g c3n4 or mgo had no catalytic activity under the experimental conditions however tc could be more or less degraded by pre 1 1 pre 2 1 pre 3 1 and pre 4 1 among these samples the pre 2 1 sample exhibited the best catalytic performance on the basis of relative intensities of xrd peaks in fig 1a the pre 3 1 sample contained more mgncn phase than the pre 2 1 sample however the catalytic activity of pre 3 1 became weaker than that of pre 2 1 indirectly demonstrating that the catalytic performance was dependent on mgncn mgo composites rather than mgncn alone to further prove this viewpoint the single phased mgncn sample was prepared and used for the catalytic degradation of tc details in supplementary data evidently individual mgncn could hardly catalyze the degradation of tc fig s5 these results powerfully manifested that the bonding effect between mgncn and mgo in the nanocomposites played a major role in the catalytic degradation of tc the catalytic performances of the samples calcined at different temperature were shown in fig 3b when the calcination temperature was no more than 550 c the performance of the obtained samples improved as the calcination temperature increased however the tendency was reversed once the temperature was higher than 550 c the sample obtained at 650 c had nearly no catalytic ability due to the fact that the sample was pure mgo phase fig 1c the data of tc degradation were fitted by pseudo first order eq 1 in supplementary data and pseudo second order eq 2 in supplementary data kinetic models bao et al 2017 wu et al 2019 as shown in fig 3 and s6 the experimental data was in better agreement with pseudo first order model due to its higher correlation coefficients table s1 and s2 compared to pseudo second order model the kinetic rate constant of the pre 2 1 nanocomposites was calculated to be about 0 1245 min 1 which was higher than that of other samples moreover the removal rates of chemical oxygen demands cod by pre 2 1 were estimated to be about 42 6 and 71 1 at 30 min and 24 h respectively fig s7 therefore the pre 2 1 nanocomposites were used in the subsequent experiments owing to its distinguished catalytic activity towards tc degradation effects of other experimental parameters including h2o2 dosage catalyst dosage and initial solution ph on tc degradation were also studied in details as shown in fig 4 a the concentration of tc was almost kept constant without adding h2o2 indaciting none of tc was adsorbed or degraded by individual mgncn mgo nanocomposites once h2o2 was introduced into the system even a very small dosage tc could be significantly degraded as the amount of h2o2 increased the degradation efficiency of tc constantly improved fig s8a and table s3 when the addition dosage of h2o2 exceeded 0 2 ml the improvement of degradation efficiency was not remarkable as expected only h2o2 could not degrade tc in the absence of mgncn mgo nanocomposites fig 4b demonstrating that mgncn mgo nanocomposites as catalyst was indispensable for tc degradation moreover the degradation efficiency of tc was gradually enhanced with increasing the amount of mgncn mgo nanocomposites fig s8b and table s4 when the dosage of mgncn mgo nanocomposites were more than 10 mg the degradation efficiency slowly increased therefore taking into account of cost and efficiency 0 2 ml of h2o2 and 10 mg of mgncn mgo nanocomposites were suitable for tc degradation surprisingly tc could be efficiently degraded in a wide ph range of 4 10 fig 4c by mgncn mgo h2o2 system fig s8c and table s5 this overcame the drawback of common fenton fenton like systems that were effective only under acidic condition when the initial solution ph was adjusted to 2 there exsited plentiful hydrogen ions h in solution which caused mgncn mgo nanocomposites to be decomposed completely thus tc could not be catalytically degraded by mgncn mgo nanocomposites under strong acid condition when the initial solution ph was highly alkaline ph 12 the degradation efficiency of tc was reduced to some extent only 66 3 after 30 min it might be due to the fact that h2o2 tended to decompose into h2o and o2 in strong alkaline condition thereby reducing the generation of ros chen et al 2017 voitko et al 2015 to rule out the chelation of mg2 the effect of mg2 with different concentration on tc degradation were examined and shown in fig 4d no matter how many mg ions were introduced tc was not degraded at all indicating that mg2 had no contribution to tc removal compared with most reported photocatalysts and fenton like catalysts table s6 the fenton like catalysis of pre 2 1 without external energy excitation exhibited a higher kinetic constant and wider ph application range for tc degradation further the degradation performance of mgncn mgo h2o2 system was evaluated using low concentrations of tc in distilled water and natural river water inferior class v as can be seen in fig s9 the lower concentration of tc the faster the degradation rate the degradation rate of tc in river water was slower than that in distilled water due to the existence of large amounts of organics inorganics and microorganisms in natural river water which would consume the generated ros when the volume of tc solution was enlarged to 5 l scale the degradation performance of mgncn mgo h2o2 system almost no decreased compared to 100 ml of tc solution moreover after the degradation reaction the collected precipitates could be easily regenerated to mgncn mgo composites for reuse fig s10 hence the mgncn mgo nanocomposites pre 2 1 had great application prospects in sewage treatment 3 3 catalytic mechanism of mgncn mgo nanocomposites it was a general consensus that fenton fenton like reactions were capable of degrading organic contaminants due to the generation of strongly oxidizing oh 1o2 or o2 here isopropanol furfuryl alcohol and tempol as scavenger agents for oh 1o2 and o2 ahmed et al 2020 hu et al 2020 zhang et al 2019 were added into the mgncn mgo h2o2 tc systems respectively it was found that a very high concentration of isopropanol 2000 mm could inhibit tc degradation to a certain extent indicating that oh maight play a weak role in tc degradation while the inhibitory effect was not obvious at low concentrations of isopropanol fig 5 a which might be due to the fact that mgo in mgncn mgo nanocomposites has strong adsorption towards isopropanol fuente et al 2015 fig 5b showed that furfuryl alcohol could significantly suppress tc degradation implying that 1o2 was the main ros responding for tc degradation meanwhile the addition of tempol has almost no inhibitory effect on tc degradation fig 5c suggesting that there was little o2 generated in the mgncn mgo h2o2 system in order to verify the above points electron paramagnetic resonance epr analyses were employed to find out which kind of ros produced in the mgncn mgo h2o2 system by using 5 5 dimethyl 1 pyrroline n oxide dmpo and 2 2 6 6 tetramethyl 4 piperidinol temp as spin trapping agents respectively as shown in fig 5d a weak characteristic signal of dmpo oh adduct the quartet peak with intensity ratios of 1 2 2 1 liu et al 2020 was appeared while the signal from the dmpo o2 adduct was hardly detected in contrast a strong 1 1 1 triplet signal from the characteristic peaks of temp 1o2 adduct dai et al 2020 huang et al 2020 was observed all these results indicated that 1o2 was the predominant ros generated in the mgncn mgo h2o2 system the catalytic ability of mgncn mgo nanocomposites might be attributed to the formation of electron rich n centers resulting from the mg n coordination between mgo and mgncn which could efficiently activate oxidants to yield ros cao et al 2019 chen et al 2018 to further explore the catalytic process the concentrations of generated nh4 no2 and no3 in the mgncn mgo h2o2 and mgncn mgo h2o2 tc systems were tested by a water quality analyzer and ion chromatograph fig 6 a and 6b in the mgncn mgo h2o2 system fig 6c as the time went on the no2 concentration declined while the amounts of no3 and nh4 increased here nh4 was from the continuous decomposition of mgncn mgo nanocomposites which was oxidized by generated 1o2 and oh to no2 and no2 was subsequently oxidized to no3 by 1o2 and oh kim and choi 2002 xingdong zhu et al 2005 as for the mgncn mgo h2o2 tc system fig 6d the nh4 concentration was higher than that in the mgncn mgo h2o2 system at the same time because the extra nh4 in the solution was derived from the degradation of tc molecule he et al 2014b besides the decomposition of mgncn mgo nanocomposites it was worth noting that the concentrations of no2 and no3 were not high especially no3 was maintained at a low concentration this result indicated that the generated 1o2 and oh in the mgncn mgo h2o2 tc system preferentially degraded tc molecule instead of oxidizing nh4 and no2 which was consistent with the literature reported kim et al 2002 to study the transformation product of mgncn mgo nanocomposites after reaction a relatively high amount of the nanocomposites were used as catalyst to facilitate collection of solid residue xrd patterns of the two residual precipitates fig s11a revealed that the all diffraction peaks were indexed to mg oh 2 jcpds 00 044 1482 originating from the hydrolysis of mgncn mgo nanocomposites in the mgncn mgo h2o2 tc and mgncn mgo h2o2 systems however the peak intensities of the residue in the mgncn mgo h2o2 tc system were weaker than those in the mgncn mgo h2o2 system this might be because tc and its degradation intermediates in solution inhibited the crystallization of mg oh 2 in the ftir spectra of the residues fig s11b the sharp peak at 3700 cm 1 was derived from the stretching vibration of oh in mg oh 2 structure llamas et al 2007 the weak absorption located at 2210 cm 1 might be related to the adsorbed nox species raskó and kiss 2006 resulting from the decomposition of mgncn and tc and the weak peak at 2150 cm 1 was from residual mgncn obviously the peak of adsorbed nox species in the mgncn mgo h2o2 system was stronger than that in the mgncn mgo h2o2 tc system due to more nox generation in the mgncn mgo h2o2 system fig 6 thus the catalytic process and mechanism of mgncn mgo nanocomposite for tc degradation was schematically depicted in fig 7 based on the above discussion and analysis the generated intermediates during the degradation process were identified by lc ms to deduce the degradation pathways of tc fig s12 showed the chromatograms of the mixture solutions with different reaction time clearly the peaks of tc drastically reduced and almost disappeared within 30 min along with the appearance and decay of several new weak peaks at different retention time demonstrating that tc was degraded step by step the mass spectra at different retention time were summarized in fig s13 and the corresponding intermediates were listed in table s7 according to these intermediates the possible degradation pathways of tc were proposed and shown in fig 8 at the initial step of degradation the electron rich functional groups in tc molecule such as double bond c7 c8 c11a c12 amide group c2 and dimethylamino group c4 were more vulnerable to the attack of electrophilic 1o2 and oh liu et al 2019 wang et al 2020a under attack of 1o2 the p1 intermediate m z 492 8 was produced through ring opening at c7 c8 in tc molecule khan et al 2010 li et al 2020b then it was dehydroxylated at c6 to form p4 m z 476 9 the dimethylamino at c4 position in p4 was further reacted with 1o2 and oh to yield the p5 intermediate m z 446 9 meanwhile tc molecule was directly demethylated at c4 position to yield the p2 intermediate m z 416 9 due to the co attacks of 1o2 and oh jiang et al 2017 xie et al 2018 after then p2 was converted into the p5 p6 m z 400 9 and p7 m z 432 9 intermediates were given from by the ring opening at c7 c8 deamination at c4 dehydroxylation at c6 position and cycloaddition towards c11a c12 double bond respectively in addition the p3 intermediate m z 460 9 was generated by the 1 3 dipolar cyclo addition towards c11a c12 double bond he et al 2014b in tc molecule after the demethylation of n methyl group c4 position p7 was also produced from p3 subsequently the intermediates including compounds p8 p14 were formed through further oxidation of the p5 p6 and p7 intermediates finally these intermediates were oxidized into co2 h2o and nh4 by 1o2 and oh wang et al 2020a 4 conclusion in summary mgncn mgo nanocomposites were successfully synthesized by one pot calcination of melamine and basic magnesium carbonate the obtained mgncn mgo nanocomposites from calcining the precursors with mass ratio of 2 1 at 550 c possessed excellent fenton like catalytic activity for tc degradation in a wide ph range ph 4 10 the enhanced degradation capability could be attributed to the formation of ros in the mgncn mgo h2o2 system the electron rich n center in formed mg n coordination bond between mgncn and mgo in mgncn mgo nanocomposites was responsible for activating h2o2 to yield 1o2 and oh which were the reactive species accounting for the degradation of organic pollutants furthermore the catalytic mechanism was deduced according to the determination and analysis of generated ions nh4 no2 and no3 in the degradation system considering the advantages of low cost raw materials simple preparation process non toxic metal component wide ph application range and excellent catalytic efficiency mgncn mgo nanocomposites as novel catalyst for h2o2 activation
