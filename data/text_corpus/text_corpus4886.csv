24430,contrasting outcomes of statistical modelling methods for the same data may represent critical pieces of information about the biological process ecological niche and species distribution modelling are notorious for their keenness on algorithm testing although differences between method outcomes are seldom used to gain biological insight here we use the differences and similarities between point process models ppms and minimum volume ellipsoids mves to help identify the configuration of species climatic niches in relation to geographic space and species interactions poisson ppms represent the abundance of points in an euclidean plane as a function of spatially defined covariates while mves are used to estimate the niche centroid and represent similarity with its centroid via mahalanobis distance the niche centroid is receiving increasing attention due to its simplicity and ability to capture complex demographic processes such as species abundance mves simplicity makes them sensitive to deviations from symmetry in the statistical distribution of environmental axes or the lack of a defined centroid in geographic space using synthetic and real species we test the ability of ppms and mves to characterise niche centroids in relation to each other and to the statistical properties of the environment we also study a scenario in which non linear responses and biological interactions define a species fundamental niche and realised distribution respectively mves were less precise but estimated useful centroids more frequently than ppms when centroids clearly existed in geographic and environmental spaces ppms estimated centroids that were closer to the truth mves ability to estimate a similarity surface unlike ppms depends on the correct estimation of the

rainfall solar radiation and humidity in which population growth rates reach their biological maximum hence niches began to be modelled with minimum volume ellipsoids mves qiao et al 2016 osorio

differences between ppms and mves as both methods represent important aspects of the data traditionally used in species distribution and ecological niche modelling ppms are the ad hoc method for occurrence based analyses while mves explicitly represent the very definition of the biological phenomenon we use the differences between methods to develop a series of recommendations for the model building process and show some of the extensions that ppms incorporate in order to account for biological interactions methods overview to have complete control and knowledge of causality our study has a section that is entirely synthetic in which we simulated environmental conditions and occurrence records in squared grids of 100 100 pixels then we analyse of two contrasting real world bird species for the synthetic analyses environmental covariates were 100 layers 40 with a normal 20 with a log normal 20 with beta and 20 with gamma distributions the objective was to create variables with statistical properties that range from symmetric left or right skewed to bimodal all of which occur among temperature and precipitation pedersen et al 2010 yaya and vo 2020 to simulate species occurrence records we created 2500 unique combinations of three environmental covariates with each of the 2500 variable combinations we simulated four species one in each of the following scenarios based on the centroid s location in relation to environmental and geographic space fig 2 1 centre species centroid located at the highest density interval mode in each environmental dimension 2 random centroid located randomly across the possible range of values of each environmental dimension 3 edge centroid located at the top or bottom 5 value of the possible range of values of each environmental dimension 4 outer centroid located below or above the possible range of values of each environmental dimension after simulating environmental conditions and point processes we tried to retrieve the centroids used for simulating occurrence data sets then we performed two similar analyses with increasing levels of realism 1 simulating occurrences for two species using a set of four bioclimatic variables from the chelsa dataset karger et al 2017 and 2 analysing occurrence datasets of two north american bird species with well known distributional ecology callipepla californica with a truncated niche and calamospiza melanocorys with an ecological niche defined in geographic space osorio olvera et al 2020 for the two simulated species with the chelsa dataset centroids along each climatic axis were generated using non monotonic functions with a tipping point and then additively combined them in one single layer to use as average point intensity to simulate occurrences each simulated layer represents a species fundamental niche and we used them to simulate occurrences over a range of competition scenarios using pre specified threshold distances within which species exclude each other this method is called hardcore multi type point interaction baddeley et al 2016 we used r 4 0 2 for all the above analyses full details below simulation of environmental covariates all the covariates were simulated with a multivariate normal distribution to create a spatial structure dependent on the distance between pixel pairs the degree of correlation between pixels was proportional to an exponential function of the distance between them cov x 1 x 2 σ e ϕ s s euclidean x 1 x 2 the means of the normal distributions to simulate variables were chosen arbitrarily with values that resemble the averages of variables routinely used for modelling species distributions minimum and maximum temperatures and rainfall levels fick and hijmans 2017 to simulate spatially structured variables with log normal distributions we simply exponentiated variables simulated with the multivariate normal distribution variables with the gamma and beta distributions were simulated using log normally distributed variables for each distribution s α and β parameters gamma p x β α γ α x α 1 e β x beta p x γ β α γ β γ α x α 1 1 x β 1 simulation of occurrence records species with simulated environmental covariates to simulate points in the spatial domain of the simulated covariates we used the 2500 unique combinations described above for each layer in the combination we selected the values for the scenarios of the centroid s location in relation to environmental and geographical space then we projected the mahalanobis distance to the selected centroids to create a layer that fully represents habitat suitability the resulting layers were exponentially transformed p d n c e r d n c r 10 max d n c min d n c in order to obtain values readable as probabilities by the randompoints function of the dismo package used to simulate the collections of points we acknowledge that the spatstat baddeley and turner 2005 functions for the same purpose are more methodologically sound than dismo s however randompoints allows specification of the sample size and produces point patterns similar to a poisson while rpoispp determines sample size assuming that the probability layer is point intensity interacting species based on historic climate for these analyses we created two surfaces that represent each species fundamental niche using four of chelsa s bioclimatic variables mean annual temperature bio1 mean diurnal range bio2 annual precipitation bio12 and precipitation of driest month for each variable we created a response surface using bell shaped temperature optimum logan 1989 double exponential or asymptotic functions negative exponential formulas and parameters are given in supplementary materials after generating two response surfaces for each variable one for each species we combined the responses linearly by drawing parameter values from a uniform distribution bounded by 0 and 2 and created a climatic suitability surface used as average point intensity to simulate occurrence datasets to simulate the datasets of interacting species we used the ragsmultihard function of spatstat using the 25 different possible combinations of radii from 0 to 0 5 degrees in 0 125 increments for each species in the hardcore model of inter point interactions radii refer to the distance in which one type of point excludes the occurrence of another hence a radius of 0 is a simple poisson point process baddeley et al 2016 analysis of the simulated point patterns analyses of both kinds of simulated species comprised 1 retrieving the centroids used for generating the probability surface to simulate species using minimum volume ellipsoids mves as implemented in the ntbox r package osorio olvera et al 2020 and with poisson point process models ppms using the spatstat package 2 retrieving the surface used for simulating species using the same methods to retrieve centroids 3 measuring the ability of both methods to retrieve the centroids via the mahalanobis distance to the true centroid 4 measuring the ability of both methods to retrieve the probability surface by measuring the spatial correlation between estimated distance to the centroid for mves and point intensity for ppms with the probability surfaces 5 measuring the influence of the statistical properties of environmental space multivariate skewness on the ability of both methods to retrieve the above quantities retrieving centroids with mves is straightforward as it is part of the process however with ppms it is only possible when the model formula can have maxima hence in order to retrieve centroids we fitted all ppms using a second degree polynomial formula log λ β 0 β 1 x 1 β 2 x 2 β 3 x 3 β 1 x 1 2 β 2 x 2 2 β 3 x 3 2 where λ is point intensity per grid cell β are the regression coefficients and xi are the environmental covariates maxima or centroids x i exist only if β i 0 which we found differentiating log λ xi and then solving for xi x i β i 2 β i for the interacting species scenarios we tried to recover centroids even though it was not defined in one environmental dimension rainfall for one of the species the interacting species data were analysed as a marked hardcore ppm with an interaction radius to be estimated as a marked poisson ppm baddeley et al 2016 and with mves analysis of retrieved centroids and generating surfaces to compare the retrieved centroids with those used to simulate data we measured the mahalanobis distance between them to compare the generated surfaces with those used for simulating data we ran pearson correlation tests in order to characterise the causes of the differences obtained between modelling methods we measured the multivariate skewness of each one of the 2500 sets of covariates using the mvn function of the mvn package with the henze zirkler method henze and zirkler 1990 analysis of real world species both analysed bird species are part of the north american breeding bird survey as it is the most comprehensive vertebrate spatially referenced abundance dataset available we chose callipepla californica and calamospiza melanocorys because these two species have contrasting distributional ecologies the former has a truncated niche poorly defined in geographical space while the latter is well defined osorio olvera et al 2020 to fit models we only used the occurrence records without abundance and then tested the abundant niche centroid hypothesis with the records with abundance data to fit models we used the chelsa biolicmatic variables and the first three components of a principal components analysis to select a set of three climatic variables for each species we plotted point intensity in relation to each variable and identified those with a smooth bell shaped response and correlation pairs between variables allowing no more than r 0 7 all layers to fit models were cropped with 5 buffers around occurrence records to exclude areas where there could be analogous climates with the subset of variables with the desired bell shaped responses we identified sets of three to four variables that could be included in the same model due to low collinearity then we generated all the possible combinations of compatible variables using the same 2nd degree polynomial formula described above and fitted the ppms once we had a full set of fitted models we excluded all those with convergence or statistical significance estimation problems and then identified the model with the lowest akaike information criterion aic we then revised if the squared terms had statistically significant negative coefficients and diagnosed the model with lurking plots of cumulative residuals along the x and y axes once we obtained a satisfactory ppm we extracted the centroid and covariance matrix using the same set of climatic variables and projected the mahalanobis distance to the centroid finally we proceeded as before comparing the surfaces generated by both methods and the estimated centroids using correlation and mahalanobis distance respectively to test the abundant niche centroid hypothesis we used the abundance data and measured its correlation with point intensity and distance to the centroid exponentially transformed fig 1 results species based on simulated conditions the scenario of the centroid s location in environmental and geographic space that allowed the best estimation was the centre followed by random edge and outer allowed the least accurate estimates fig 3 between methods we observed large differences with ppms we estimated both the most and least accurate centroids because in many cases the optimisation routine did not estimate β i 0 which explains the very large distances to the true centroids fig 4 whereas regardless of the non existence of the centroid in the data mves estimate a quantity that is more similar to the true centroid the performance of both ppms and mves was significantly affected by multivariate skewness greater departure from normality resulted in less accurate estimated centroids fig 3 regarding the qualities of the surfaces generated by both methods ppms in most cases generated surfaces that were more positively correlated with the surface used to simulate occurrence data than mves environmental skewness also affected the ability of ppms and mves to retrieve the surface that generated occurrence data the correlation with the generated surfaces were less affected by greater distance from the true centroid and vice versa among ppms than mves in fact mve results can be compared with ppms in that distance to the true centroid also changes very little with ppms correlation with the generating surface fig 4 these results indicate that disparities in estimated centroids and generated surfaces between methods can be used to assess the environmental centroid geography configuration being analysed part of the reason that ppms centroid estimations can be less accurate is due to the estimation of positive effects for the squared terms fig s1 competing species based on climate databases the radii of exclusion affected the ability of the different methods to retrieve true centroids centroids estimated with poisson ppms were further away in environmental space from true centroids compared to centroids estimated with hardcore ppms and mves the method less affected by the size of the exclusion radius were mves and hardcore ppms were relatively unaffected fig 5 the ability to retrieve the generating surfaces was also affected by the size of the exclusion radius supplementary materials interacting species the method that produced the surfaces less similar to the original were mves followed by hardcore ppms and poisson however the latter two only produced surfaces negatively correlated with the generating surface when the exclusion radii of the other species were greater than 0 4 which was close to the highest values tested fig 5 analysis of real world species we obtained four candidate model formulas for callipepla californica and 10 for calamospiza melanocorys ppms the fitted effects for the linear β and quadratic terms β for each variable included in each model and their statistical significance appear in table 1 the statistics comparing ppms and mves are shown in table 2 the selected models diagnosis show cumulative residuals larger than tolerance in some areas although generally close to zero figures s2 and s3 for callipepla californica and calamospiza melanocorys respectively the estimated surfaces fig 6 and centroids and their similarities are consistent with the analyses of simulated species for calamospiza melanocorys which has a centroid well defined in geographic space the suitability surfaces generated by both methods were more similar than for calamospiza melanocorys albeit differences in this respect were more subtle than for simulated species with similar characteristics table 2 as previously found calamospiza melanocorys abundance decreases significantly with distance from the niche centroid and callipepla californica s does not when comparing the correlation between abundance and point intensity in both cases the correlation was higher than with distance from the centroid the centroid estimated with ppms for callipepla californica suggests that it could be defined outside the geographically occupied area at least on some climatic axes bio8 for instance see response plots in fig s4 and see fig s5 for the same responses for calamospiza melanocorys discussion both ppms and mves are capable of estimating niche centroids and both are sensitive to the skewness of environmental conditions mves are less sensitive to environmental skewness than ppms in their estimates of the environmental centroid although given certain centroid geographic space configurations ppms can provide more precise centroid estimates than mves ppms are capable of estimating a suitability surface that resembles more the actual suitability surface than mves regardless of the distance between estimated and true centroids mves performance in this department however depends on correct estimation of the multivariate centroid therefore differences in environmental suitabilities produced by both methods likely indicate that the centroid does not exist in geographic space yañez arenas et al 2020 similar estimates of the centroid and suitability surfaces between methods indicate that the centroid the optimal climatic conditions does exist in the geographic space occupied by the species these insights from simulated species are confirmed with the analysis of real species with contrasting distributional ecologies the first assumption in modelling species with the methods used is that an optimum exists along each environmental dimension in addition to the above we also suggest that estimation of positive coefficients in the second degree polynomial indicate that such optima are weakly expressed among data although this could be addressed with more complex model formulas for which there are more sophisticated solutions within ppms baddeley et al 2016 specific configurations of maxent for instance are equivalent to our methods renner and warton 2013 but splines can also accommodate such complex non linear responses renner et al 2015 however as shown with the second set of analyses both mves and ppms with a polynomial formula can also estimate relatively close centroids in the presence of non linear responses thus we provide evidence that simple methods are still powerful enough to begin making ecologically sound decisions in the process of developing an ecological niche model even though we analysed a comprehensive number of scenarios covering the role of both geographic space and biotic interactions more configurations and method synergies are possible for instance supra specifc units have been proposed for increasing the environmental space when the centroid does not exist within species geographic ranges castaño quintero et al 2020 and ppms could prove useful for estimating it or assessing if it actually exists in the geography or environmental space of analysis as for areas of application ppms may prove an important tool in quantifying the controversial abundant niche centroid hypothesis dallas et al 2017 osorio olvera et al 2020 or may clarify as we have done the circumstances in which the hypothesis holds on real species via ppms direct relationship with point abundance renner and warton 2013 ultimately improvements to the methods used will improve the predictive capacity of niche and species distribution models in the majority of ecological niche modelling studies models are selected by random or spatial partitioning data into training and testing fractions raes and ter steege 2007 peterson et al 2008 currently we ignore how such model selection methodologies affect the qualities of the suitability surfaces produced by models it is likely that optimising performance with a partial roc analysis for instance peterson et al 2008 improves the accuracy of the generated surface although recent developments suggest that there are more robust ways of measuring spatial predictive performance jiménez and soberón 2020 if optimising any performance metric equates improving the estimation of suitability surface for mves this process implies improving the estimated centroids similarly the customary approach when developing ppms is optimising for the akaike information criterion without data partitioning baddeley et al 2016 which has not been tested in relation to any of the validation methods frequently used in ecological niche modelling very few analyses in ecological niche modelling attempt to quantify biological interactions e g gonzález salazar et al 2013 our multi species analyses show that even when suitable conditions co occur competition between species breaks down the positive relationship between abundance and climatic suitability such phenomena are expected in trophic webs but are seldom attributed to failures to prove the abundant niche centroid hypothesis dallas et al 2017 osorio olvera et al 2020 the biology of the phenomena that breaks down the suitability abundance relationship may be related to allee effects osorio olvera et al 2019 such ecological understanding nevertheless is still difficult to implement in spatial analyses as we still lack straightforward ways to represent those dynamic processes in a simple statistical model as a result we found that quantifying interactions did not help to better estimate the centroid or the suitability surface when the effect of one species on another was very strong very large exclusion radius in such cases discrepancies between mves and ppms were less informative of the centroid geography configuration than they were for single species cases however when species interactions were weaker or bi directional there was still some inferential power to assess the niche centroid geography configuration fig 4 to our knowledge the statistical properties of environmental dimensions have been widely neglected as a source of error in model development our results suggest that environmental skewness can complicate estimation by both methods used hence we recommend choosing environmental covariates with lower skewness or considering using methods that accommodate non linearities and allow the user to estimate maxima or minima as mentioned above ppms with splines represent one such alternative to more automated algorithms like maxent phillips et al 2006 when the number of models to be developed is small when there are important ecological questions to be answered from distributional data or when the question is one of forecasting and requires better estimation of the niche centroid soberón and peterson 2005 the imputative nature of mves represents both its strength closer estimation of the centroid when it is absent or weakly defined and its weakness poor representation of the suitability surface when centroid is absent however their performance in relation to ppms in both departments can be used to an advantage to identify the centroid geography configuration yañez arenas et al 2020 and make decisions on the steps to follow in the model building process such as including closely related species castaño quintero et al 2020 to increase the environmental domain of the analyses as we show with our analyses of real world species the simulation findings are robust and we greatly encourage the synergistic use of modelling methods to improve estimates of optimal conditions and suitability abundance relationships to test important ecological questions and to develop more robust ecologically

probability layer is point intensity interacting species based on historic climate for these analyses we created two surfaces that represent each species fundamental niche using four of chelsa s bioclimatic variables mean annual temperature bio1 mean diurnal range bio2 annual precipitation bio12 and precipitation of driest month for each variable we created a response surface using bell shaped temperature optimum logan 1989 double exponential or asymptotic functions negative exponential formulas and parameters are given in supplementary materials after generating two response surfaces for each variable one for each species we combined the responses linearly by drawing parameter values from a uniform distribution bounded by 0 and 2 and created a climatic suitability surface used as average point intensity to simulate occurrence datasets to simulate the datasets of interacting species we used the ragsmultihard function of spatstat using the 25 different possible combinations of radii from 0 to 0 5 degrees in 0 125 increments for each species in the hardcore model of inter point interactions radii refer to the distance in which one type of point excludes the occurrence of another hence a radius of 0 is a simple poisson point process baddeley et al 2016 analysis of the simulated point patterns analyses of both kinds of simulated species comprised 1 retrieving the centroids used for generating the probability surface to simulate species using minimum volume ellipsoids mves as implemented in the ntbox r package osorio olvera et al 2020 and with poisson point process models ppms using the spatstat package 2 retrieving the surface used for simulating species using the same methods to retrieve centroids 3 measuring the ability of both methods to retrieve the centroids via the mahalanobis distance to the true centroid 4 measuring the ability of both methods to retrieve the probability surface by measuring the spatial correlation between estimated distance to the centroid for mves and point intensity for ppms with the probability surfaces 5 measuring the influence of the statistical properties of environmental space multivariate skewness on the ability of both methods to retrieve the above quantities retrieving centroids with mves is straightforward as it is part of the process however with ppms it is only possible when the model formula can have maxima hence in order to retrieve centroids we fitted all ppms using a second degree polynomial formula log λ β 0 β 1 x 1 β 2 x 2 β 3 x 3 β 1 x 1 2 β 2 x 2 2 β 3 x 3 2 where λ is point intensity per grid cell β are the regression coefficients and xi are the environmental covariates maxima or centroids x i exist only if β i 0 which we found differentiating log λ xi and then solving for xi x i β i 2 β i for the interacting species scenarios we tried to recover centroids even though it was not defined in one environmental dimension rainfall for one of the species the interacting species data were analysed as a marked hardcore ppm with an interaction radius to be estimated as a marked poisson ppm baddeley et al 2016 and with mves analysis of retrieved centroids and generating surfaces to compare the retrieved centroids with those used to simulate data we measured the mahalanobis distance between them to compare the generated surfaces with those used for simulating data we ran pearson correlation tests in order to characterise the causes of the differences obtained between modelling methods we measured the multivariate skewness of each one of the 2500 sets of covariates using the mvn function of the mvn package with the henze zirkler method henze and zirkler 1990 analysis of real world species both analysed bird species are part of the north american breeding bird survey as it is the most comprehensive vertebrate spatially referenced abundance dataset available we chose callipepla californica and calamospiza melanocorys because these two species have contrasting distributional ecologies the former has a truncated niche poorly defined in geographical space while the latter is well defined osorio olvera et al 2020 to fit models we only used the occurrence records without abundance and then tested the abundant niche centroid hypothesis with the records with abundance data to fit models we used the chelsa biolicmatic variables and the first three components of a principal components analysis to select a set of three climatic variables for each species we plotted point intensity in relation to each variable and identified those with a smooth bell shaped response and correlation pairs between variables allowing no more than r 0 7 all layers to fit models were cropped with 5 buffers around occurrence records to exclude areas where there could be analogous climates with the subset of variables with the desired bell shaped responses we identified sets of three to four variables that could be included in the same model due to low collinearity then we generated all the possible combinations of compatible variables using the same 2nd degree polynomial formula described above and fitted the ppms once we had a full set of fitted models we excluded all those with convergence or statistical significance estimation problems and then identified the model with the lowest akaike information criterion aic we then revised if the squared terms had statistically significant negative coefficients and diagnosed the model with lurking plots of cumulative residuals along the x and y axes once we obtained a satisfactory ppm we extracted the centroid and covariance matrix using the same set of climatic variables and projected the mahalanobis distance to the centroid finally we proceeded as before comparing the surfaces generated by both methods and the estimated centroids using correlation and mahalanobis distance respectively to test the abundant niche centroid hypothesis we used the abundance data and measured its correlation with point intensity and distance to the centroid exponentially transformed fig 1 results species based on simulated conditions the scenario of the centroid s location in environmental and geographic space that allowed the best estimation was the centre followed by random edge and outer allowed the least accurate estimates fig 3 between methods we observed large differences with ppms we estimated both the most and least accurate centroids because in many cases the optimisation routine did not estimate β i 0 which explains the very large distances to the true centroids fig 4 whereas regardless of the non existence of the centroid in the data mves estimate a quantity that is more similar to the true centroid the performance of both ppms and mves was significantly affected by multivariate skewness greater departure from normality resulted in less accurate estimated centroids fig 3 regarding the qualities of the surfaces generated by both methods ppms in most cases generated surfaces that were more positively correlated with the surface used to simulate occurrence data than mves environmental skewness also affected the ability of ppms and mves to retrieve the surface that generated occurrence data the correlation with the generated surfaces were less affected by greater distance from the true centroid and vice versa among ppms than mves in fact mve results can be compared with ppms in that distance to the true centroid also changes very little with ppms correlation with the generating surface fig 4 these results indicate that disparities in estimated centroids and generated surfaces between methods can be used to assess the environmental centroid geography configuration being analysed part of the reason that ppms centroid estimations can be less accurate is due to the estimation of positive effects for the squared terms fig s1 competing species based on climate databases the radii of exclusion affected the ability of the different methods to retrieve true centroids centroids estimated with poisson ppms were further away in environmental space from true centroids compared to centroids estimated with hardcore ppms and mves the method less affected by the size of the exclusion radius were mves and hardcore ppms were relatively unaffected fig 5 the ability to retrieve the generating surfaces was also affected by the size of the exclusion radius supplementary materials interacting species the method that produced the surfaces less similar to the original were mves followed by hardcore ppms and poisson however the latter two only produced surfaces negatively correlated with the generating surface when the exclusion radii of the other species were greater than 0 4 which was close to the highest values tested fig 5 analysis of real world species we obtained four candidate model formulas for callipepla californica and 10 for calamospiza melanocorys ppms the fitted effects for the linear β and quadratic terms β for each variable included in each model and their statistical significance appear in table 1 the statistics comparing ppms and mves are shown in table 2 the selected models diagnosis show cumulative residuals larger than tolerance in some areas although generally close to zero figures s2 and s3 for callipepla californica and calamospiza melanocorys respectively the estimated surfaces fig 6 and centroids and their similarities are consistent with the analyses of simulated species for calamospiza melanocorys which has a centroid well defined in geographic space the suitability surfaces generated by both methods were more similar than for calamospiza melanocorys albeit differences in this respect were more subtle than for simulated species with similar characteristics table 2 as previously found calamospiza melanocorys abundance decreases significantly with distance from the niche centroid and callipepla californica s does not when comparing the correlation between abundance and point intensity in both cases the correlation was higher than with distance from the centroid the centroid estimated with ppms for callipepla californica suggests that it could be defined outside the geographically occupied area at least on some climatic axes bio8 for instance see response plots in fig s4 and see fig s5 for the same responses for calamospiza melanocorys discussion both ppms and mves are capable of estimating niche centroids and both are sensitive to the skewness of environmental conditions mves are less sensitive to environmental skewness than ppms in their estimates of the environmental centroid although given certain centroid geographic space configurations ppms can provide more precise centroid estimates than mves ppms are capable of estimating a suitability surface that resembles more the actual suitability surface than mves regardless of the distance between estimated and true centroids mves performance in this department however depends on correct estimation of the multivariate centroid therefore differences in environmental suitabilities produced by both methods likely indicate that the centroid does not exist in geographic space yañez arenas et al 2020 similar estimates of the centroid and suitability surfaces between methods indicate that the centroid the optimal climatic conditions does exist in the geographic space occupied by the species these insights from simulated species are confirmed with the analysis of real species with contrasting distributional ecologies the first assumption in modelling species with the methods used is that an optimum exists along each environmental dimension in addition to the above we also suggest that estimation of positive coefficients in the second degree polynomial indicate that such optima are weakly expressed among data although this could be addressed with more complex model formulas for which there are more sophisticated solutions within ppms baddeley et al 2016 specific configurations of maxent for instance are equivalent to our methods renner and warton 2013 but splines can also accommodate such complex non linear responses renner et al 2015 however as shown with the second set of analyses both mves and ppms with a polynomial formula can also estimate relatively close centroids in the presence of non linear responses thus we provide evidence that simple methods are still powerful enough to begin making ecologically sound decisions in the process of developing an ecological niche model even though we analysed a comprehensive number of scenarios covering the role of both geographic space and biotic interactions more configurations and method synergies are possible for instance supra specifc units have been proposed for increasing the environmental space when the centroid does not exist within species geographic ranges castaño quintero et al 2020 and ppms could prove useful for estimating it or assessing if it actually exists in the geography or environmental space of analysis as for areas of application ppms may prove an important tool in quantifying the controversial abundant niche centroid hypothesis dallas et al 2017 osorio olvera et al 2020 or may clarify as we have done the circumstances in which the hypothesis holds on real species via ppms direct relationship with point abundance renner and warton 2013 ultimately improvements to the methods used will improve the predictive capacity of niche and species distribution models in the majority of ecological niche modelling studies models are selected by random or spatial partitioning data into training and testing fractions raes and ter steege 2007 peterson et al 2008 currently we ignore how such model selection methodologies affect the qualities of the suitability surfaces produced by models it is likely that optimising performance with a partial roc analysis for instance peterson et al 2008 improves the accuracy of the generated surface although recent developments suggest that there are more robust ways of measuring spatial predictive performance jiménez and soberón 2020 if optimising any performance metric equates improving the estimation of suitability surface for mves this process implies improving the estimated centroids similarly the customary approach when developing ppms is optimising for the akaike information criterion without data partitioning baddeley et al 2016 which has not been tested in relation to any of the validation methods frequently used in ecological niche modelling very few analyses in ecological niche modelling attempt to quantify biological interactions e g gonzález salazar et al 2013 our multi species analyses show that even when suitable conditions co occur competition between species breaks down the positive relationship between abundance and climatic suitability such phenomena are expected in trophic webs but are seldom attributed to failures to prove the abundant niche centroid hypothesis dallas et al 2017 osorio olvera et al 2020 the biology of the phenomena that breaks down the suitability abundance relationship may be related to allee effects osorio olvera et al 2019 such ecological understanding nevertheless is still difficult to implement in spatial analyses as we still lack straightforward ways to represent those dynamic processes in a simple statistical model as a result we found that quantifying interactions did not help to better estimate the centroid or the suitability surface when the effect of one species on another was very strong very large exclusion radius in such cases discrepancies between mves and ppms were less informative of the centroid geography configuration than they were for single species cases however when species interactions were weaker or bi directional there was still some inferential power to assess the niche centroid geography configuration fig 4 to our knowledge the statistical properties of environmental dimensions have been widely neglected as a source of error in model development our results suggest that environmental skewness can complicate estimation by both methods used hence we recommend choosing environmental covariates with lower skewness or considering using methods that accommodate non linearities and allow the user to estimate maxima or minima as mentioned above ppms with splines represent one such alternative to more automated algorithms like maxent phillips et al 2006 when the number of models to be developed is small when there are important ecological questions to be answered from distributional data or when the question is one of forecasting and requires better estimation of the niche centroid soberón and peterson 2005 the imputative nature of mves represents both its strength closer estimation of the centroid when it is absent or weakly defined and its weakness poor representation of the suitability surface when centroid is absent however their performance in relation to ppms in both departments can be used to an advantage to identify the centroid geography configuration yañez arenas et al 2020 and make decisions on the steps to follow in the model building process such as including closely related species castaño quintero et al 2020 to increase the environmental domain of the analyses as we show with our analyses of real world species the simulation findings are robust and we greatly encourage the synergistic use of modelling methods to improve estimates of optimal conditions and suitability abundance relationships to test important ecological questions and to develop more robust ecologically

24431,increases in frequency of anthropogenic and natural disturbances exacerbated by climate change are disrupting animal movement patterns and in turn species distribution and abundance habitat models are a valuable approach for predicting how a species or population is distributed across habitats however in these models the environmental characteristics describing habitat are typically constant over time which is inaccurate for a frequently disturbed landscape the goal of this study is to assess the degree to which frequent disturbances can alter abundance and distribution to the point of which inferences from static habitat maps are no longer relevant we simulated individual animal movement in a dynamically disturbed landscape and compared the observed spatial relative abundance to the one predicted from a static habitat model fit to the simulated trajectories we found that the prediction error is higher when the landscape is disturbed than where there are no disturbances this result holds even with the addition of life history and demographic processes to the model which would facilitate the discovery of novel habitat by increasing density dependent movement thereby bringing the spatial distribution of individuals closer to a proportion of habitat quality arising from the population at equilibrium assumption underlying most habitat models in the context of species at risk recovery planning using habitat models with constant environmental covariates to forecast animal locations in areas with more frequent disturbances as a result of climate change will likely produce inaccurate predictions graphical abstract keywords climate change resource selection function simulations ungulates wildfire data and code availability data output from the

zenodo 4688764 1 introduction large and unprecedented anthropogenic changes to the terrestrial systems are altering the distribution and abundance of global biodiversity raffa et al 2008 allen et al 2010 pereira et al 2012 boucher et al 2018 cadieux et al 2020 natural and anthropogenic disturbances are increasingly putting forest ecosystem and value at risk the combined effect of multiple stressors exacerbated by climate change makes it difficult to understand and predict species responses to changes in the availability of essential resources mahon and pelech 2021 in boreal forest ecosystems for example wildfires insect outbreaks drought storms and landslides are predicted to increase in frequency intensity and or duration in the near future dale et al 2001 price et al 2013 our study focuses on these disturbances whether natural or anthropogenic and their interactions that present irregular spatio temporal patterns so that animals are not able to anticipate them as environmental conditions shift due to human activity and climate change the modification of the size and location of natural habitats creates novel habitat conditions such as new land cover types where species responses include rapid population decline or proliferation and changes in phenology or distribution barnosky et al 2011 bellard et al 2012 pereira et al 2012 effective management of species at risk requires forecasting the quality and distribution of future habitats and the resulting viability of species populations unglaub et al 2015 heinrichs et al 2017 masood et al 2017 whereas relating populations to habitats is a central goal in ecology predicting population abundance and demography in novel conditions remains challenging he and gaston 2007 weber et al 2017 model predictions of habitat quality in novel areas may be misleading due to unmeasured conditions johnson et al 2020 leading to population sinks or ecological traps fretwell 1969 however a more fundamental concern for predicting population abundance across wide ranging and potentially disconnected novel habitats is the need to estimate whether and over what time span a species population will discover and use habitat that emerges in currently unused areas indeed whereas some species have strong negative responses to disturbances others react positively to new opportunities created by some disturbance types fisher and burton 2018 for example wolverines gulo gulo luscus are attracted to foraging opportunities in areas of active logging scrafford et al 2017 in this study we focus on these positive relationships between a species and a disturbance type the probability that a species will discover and use novel habitat integrates the interacting effects of animal movement and demography and the rate and predictability at which novel conditions i e habitats of varying quality emerge thereby determining the spatial and temporal landscape heterogeneity for example the effect of a wildfire on a caribou population rangifer tarandus can be extremely complex over time going from attraction to avoidance and back to attraction as different processes such as windfallen trees arise schaefer and pruitt 1991 when foraging animal movement balances the need to leave recently depleted locations return to known high quality patches charnov 1976 van moorter et al 2009 and find new high quality habitat fahrig 2007 when disturbances are frequent and memory of high quality habitat locations is less reliable some species prioritize exploration leading to increased discovery and use of novel habitat travis and dytham 1999 mueller and fagan 2008 riotte lambert and matthiopoulos 2020 for example mongolian gazelle populations procapra gutturosa experiencing unpredictable resource variations due to stochastic rainfalls display nomadic behaviour i e low level of movement coordination mueller et al 2011 similarly for red kangaroo populations macropus rufus resource unpredictability leads to occasional and irregular excursions outside of the home range norbury et al 1994 in contrast barren ground caribou populations experiencing predictable seasonal variations of their resources display regular seasonal migration patterns mueller et al 2011 however other species display stronger site fidelity in unpredictable environments for example the gunnison sage grouse centrocercus minimus chooses to always stay at the same nesting location when site quality is unpredictable gerber et al 2019 similarly the green turtle chelonia mydas have a high foraging site fidelity when their habitat is unpredictably disturbed dalleau et al 2019 statistical models such as species distribution models and habitat association models characterize habitat from which abundance can be predicted weber et al 2017 increasing access to geographic information systems remotely sensed data computing power and radio gps telemetry providing precise animal positional data northrup et al 2013 avgar et al 2016 supported the expansion of many environmental statistical modelling approaches including logistic regressions and non parametric equivalents to become valuable approaches for predicting how a species or population is distributed across habitats boyce et al 2016 typically in these methods the environmental characteristics describing habitat are constant over time nielsen et al 2010 and habitat use reflects the quality and abundance of resources fretwell and lucas 1969 boyce and mcdonald 1999 these assumptions mean that the target population has reached an equilibrium boyce and mcdonald 1999 i e individuals distribute themselves in the landscape proportionally to the resources when resource distribution or spatial availability and population demography vary over time habitat models would fail to accurately predict population spatial distribution and abundance researchers have developed models that consider the unequal access to all locations of a domain e g forester et al 2009 avgar et al 2013 latombe et al 2014 furthermore models can be modified to include temporal changes in the habitat characteristics e g keith et al 2008 nielsen et al 2010 zeller et al 2020 but implementing temporal dynamics requires regular measures of the habitat characteristics which is considerably more data than for a static landscapes or at least an understanding of the mechanisms underlying landscape changes in order to simulate these variations without inclusion of an estimate of the relative effects and the associated uncertainty of animal movement demography and landscape heterogeneity on the probability of use of novel habitat model predictions of species population or distribution across dynamic environmental conditions will be biased in time or space e g vallecillo et al 2009 the objective of this study is to use a simulation model that includes dynamic and unpredictable habitat disturbances exploration heterogeneous resource access dispersal and demography in the study species to evaluate how these variables impact the accuracy of relative abundance predictions based on a static representation of recent habitat the results could help understand the consequences of violating a key assumption of commonly used habitat models a population at equilibrium in a static landscape or rapid arrival at equilibrium in a dynamic landscape such that landscape dynamics can be ignored 2 material and methods we used the r software r core team 2020 for all simulations and calculations we created a spatially explicit landscape in silica that was subject to dynamic and unpredictable disturbances after disturbances habitats gradually returned to their previous states prior to disturbance but disturbances provided windows of opportunities for any intraspecific aspect such as foraging nesting territory thereafter called resources in this idealized system we simulated movement of our target animals using a modular individual based simulation model that included demography dispersal exploration and movement target animals were of a theoretical species with the following characteristics individuals notice habitat changes and respond to them via movement an increase in population density decreases habitat quality for this purpose we used hall et al 1997 s definition of habitat quality i e the ability of the environment to provide conditions appropriate for individual and population persistence disturbances create resources thereby increasing habitat quality which prompts a positive response from the individuals we chose these characteristics with species of large primary consumers in a forested habitat in mind however any species following these characteristics would fit in the context of this study note that we did not include temporal changes in habitat preference therefore migration patterns or population adaptation which could either encourage or prevent new habitat discovery depending on the context are not represented in this study in order to investigate the effects of local variations in the ecosystem dynamics and life history of our target animal we simulated scenarios of individual movement on a theoretical but spatially explicit domain described in section 2 1 using the movement model developed by avgar et al 2013 described in section 2 3 then we used the individual trajectories obtained by the simulations and the habitat characteristics of our domain to estimate a resource selection function rsf and predict the spatial relative abundance of the population section 2 4 finally we compared the predicted spatial relative abundance to the one observed at the end of the simulations section 2 4 a conceptual diagram summarizes these processes fig 1 we defined five different scenarios such that each scenario addressed a source of local variation in the control scenario a single individual moved in a dynamic landscape resource depletion and regeneration without disturbances in the other four scenarios the domain was subjected to the habitat dynamics with disturbances described in section 2 2 in the disturbance only scenario a single individual moved in a dynamic landscape section 2 6 in the barriers scenario a single individual moved in a dynamic landscape featuring geographical barriers to movement section 2 7 in the scramble competition scenario several individuals shared the same dynamic landscape and depleted resources resulting in negative density dependence section 2 8 in the demography scenario several individuals shared the same dynamic landscape and were subjected to demographic processes section 2 9 we chose these scenarios to assess how habitat disturbances can break the population equilibrium assumption on their own and in combination with other common local spatio temporal variations barriers to movement population density and demographic processes we would expect that increased step length or the addition of juvenile dispersal should decrease differences between the utilization distribution proportional to resources and the simulated population abundance because individuals are able to reach better resources more easily introducing barriers to movement would have the opposite effect by preventing individuals from reaching better resources increasing population density would push individuals away due to local decreases in resource forcing them to distribute themselves proportionally to the resources 2 1 spatial domain we defined a 32 32 squared landscape composed of 1166 hexagonal cells where each cell had a resource value between 0 low and 1 high we chose a hexagonal grid as it is more appropriate than a rectangular grid to model landscape connectivity and movement paths birch et al 2007 in all scenarios but the barriers scenario the resource values were spatially distributed according to a midpoint displacement neutral landscape model i e fractal using the function mpd of the nlmpy python package with a level of autocorrelation set to 0 7 etherington et al 2015 therefore cells with high level of resources were spatially arranged in patches see fig 2a for the example of the disturbances only scenario we defined the domain as a torus which meant that individuals disappearing on one side would reappear on the opposite side in the barriers scenario the domain consisted of two layers a resource layer and a barrier to movement layer fig 2b we manually organized cells with medium to high resource level to be surrounded by cells with low resource level fig 2b right panel in order to reproduce an example of a realistic landscape furthermore the low resource cells could act as partial or complete barriers to movement value of 1 complete barrier or facilitated movement value of 0 no barrier fig 2b left panel the medium to high resource cells neither restrained nor facilitated movement value of 0 5 values were smoothed in between these features by spline interpolation using the interp function of the r package akima akima and gebhardt 2020 in this scenario the domain boundaries were reflective as a torus would defeat the purpose of the barriers in the context of an ungulate this landscape could be interpreted as valleys medium to high resources no impact on movement surrounded by mountains low resources barriers to movement and connected by roads low resources facilitate movement in the context of a small mammal or reptile this landscape could be interpreted as foraging or nesting areas surrounded by barriers such as roads and other human infrastructures and connected by blue and or green corridors 2 2 disturbance regime we disturbed the domain described in section 2 1 i e created novel habitat by changing the resource values in affected cells at each time step affected cells were located within a circle with its centre randomly selected within the entire domain except for the barrier scenario see section 2 7 and radius drawn from a power law distribution therefore at the scale of a cell the disturbance frequency depended on the power law scaling parameter k the disturbance magnitude was constant we set the average resource value of the affected cells just after disturbance to 0 95 which means that disturbances created resources thus generating new habitats this represents for example a fire creating an open area in a forest where shrubs can grow and provide resources for ungulates to investigate the changes in population spatial relative abundance due to the disturbance rate we explored the values 2 0 to 3 0 by increments of 0 1 for the power law scaling parameter k representing the disturbance rate this range of values covers landscapes subjected to few disturbances to highly disturbed landscapes supplementary information fig s 1 a value of 3 0 would lead to fewer disturbances than a value of 2 0 after the simulations we recorded the cumulative number of cells affected by a disturbance over time and space for a same combination of parameters in each scenario we kept the disturbance locations and sizes the same over the simulations to be able to combine the simulation results for the rest of the analysis therefore different scenarios or parameter combinations had different realized values of disturbance locations and sizes 2 3 movement model we used the movement model from avgar et al 2013 in which an individual chooses its next location in the domain depending on the attractiveness of each cell calculated from the habitat quality as perceived by the individual we chose this model because it captures the processes by which we hypothesize an individual animal discovers and uses new habitat namely habitat quality experience and memory which lead to the use and loss of information eq 1 2 and 3 are reproduced from avgar et al 2013 for a single habitat component see supplementary information table s 1 for parameter values the perceived habitat quality q j t in spatial cell j at time t was calculated following 1 q j t e α d j t δ t q j t 1 e α d j t δ t e β δ t q j t δ t 1 e β δ t q where d j t was the euclidean distance or cost distance in section 2 7 between the current location and cell j q j t was the actual habitat quality α was the sensory attenuation coefficient δ t was the time step β was the memory decay coefficient and q was the default expectation of habitat quality therefore the individual s perception of a cell s quality changed from perfect knowledge to default expectation as distance to the individual and time to last visit increased the attractiveness a j t of a cell j at time t was calculated following the equation 2 a j t e γ d j t δ t q j t ω where γ was the friction coefficient and ω was the attraction toward the habitat a negative value represents repulsion therefore cell attractiveness depended on perceived habitat quality and was higher for the cells that were within the animal s reach the probability p j t of the individual relocating at location j at time t was 3 p j t i d j t d max a j t j i d j t d max a j t θ where i was an indicator function with value 1 if the argument was true and 0 otherwise and d max δ t ln 0 01 γ i e the redistribution kernel was truncated where the travelling propensity was below 1 this process helped reduce the computing power required by dropping very low probabilities to zero we added to the avgar et al 2013 model the exponent θ which controls the level of determinism of the cell selection process θ 0 represented a random choice whereas θ represented a deterministic choice i e the location with the highest probability was always selected the animal s next step was then randomly selected in the domain according to the probability distribution p j t the individual started in a random location in the domain except for the barrier scenario where the individual started in the centre of the landscape section 2 7 and moved for 300 time steps to have a better understanding of how the scale of movement step length impacts spatial abundance we explored the values 4 5 0 915 0 46 0 307 0 23 0 184 0 1535 0 1151 0 0921 0 0614 and 0 04605 for the movement friction coefficient γ which corresponded to the values 1 5 10 15 20 25 30 40 50 75 and 100 for the maximum distance covered in one time step d max values between 75 and 100 allow an individual to cover the entire domain in one time step whereas values between 1 and 10 restrain individuals to the nearest locations after the simulations we recorded the average of the realized animal step length over time number of individuals and number of simulations in preliminary simulations values of d max 100 did not correspond to higher values of realized step length see supplementary information fig s 2 2 4 resource selection function and spatial relative abundance we compared the predicted relative abundance of animal locations modelled from an rsf and the observed relative abundance obtained at the end of the simulations for each parameter combination and scenario we randomly selected a subset of 30 individual trajectories from the last 50 time steps of the movement model output all simulations pooled we then randomly generated 1166 alternative locations in the entire domain i e on average one alternative location per cell finally we fitted a logistic regression modelling the response variable used step which takes the value used for the 30 individual trajectories and available for the 1166 alternative locations as a function of the simulated landscape habitat values to this newly created used available dataset see supplementary information a for details on the choice of rsf over step selection function we calculated the predicted relative abundance over space by taking the probability density u pred j for each cell j using the following equation 4 u pred j w j 1 j w j 1 where each cell had an area of 1 and the logistic discriminant w j exp β x j was obtained using the coefficient β from the logistic regression and a new dataset x j consisting of the average of the resource during the last 50 time steps for each cell j we used the average of the last 50 time steps in order to reproduce what could be predicted of a future landscape under disturbances in additional simulations using the average of the last 50 time steps lead to less prediction error than using the last two time steps supplementary information b we calculated the observed relative abundance over space by taking the probability density u obsv j for each cell j using the final location of all individuals all simulations pooled as described by the following equation 5 u obsv j number of individuals in cell j j number of individuals in cell j we compared the observed and predicted relative abundances using the earth mover s distance emd rubner et al 2000 using the function emd of the r package emdist urbanek and rubner 2012 the emd also called the wasserstein metric is a measure of the difference between two distributions by calculating the cost of transforming one distribution into the other this metric allowed us to obtain a single number representing the difference between two 2 dimensional distributions 2 5 control a single individual moved on a landscape where resources could be depleted and regenerated over time we performed 5000 simulations with a very large step length γ 0 001 corresponding to d max 4605 and no disturbances and repeated this process 100 times at each time step we 1 selected the animal s new location l t according to p j t 2 depleted the resource at location l t by an amount n depl 0 01 3 updated the habitat quality perceived value at location l t to be the real habitat quality after resource depletion 4 regenerated the habitat quality of each cell of the entire domain toward the initial values q j 1 decrease or increase by an amount n reg 0 01 which allows habitat recovery after depletion up to time t and after disturbances absent in the control scenario up to time t 1 2 6 disturbances only in the disturbances only scenario a single individual moved in a dynamic landscape where resources could be depleted regenerated or exposed to disturbances we repeated simulations 5000 times for each combination of γ and k 121 combinations so we obtained 5000 individual trajectories per combination in addition to the steps described in section 2 5 we 5 introduced one disturbance of radius p ℓ min 0 2 k randomly located in the domain where p ℓ is the power law distribution and 6 modified the resource value of the cells affected by the disturbance to an amount n dis 0 02 2 7 barriers to movement scenario this scenario implemented the habitat dynamics described in section 2 6 with disturbances only located in the top left corner of the domain see below we implemented barriers to movement described in section 2 1 by adjusting the cost of movement across the landscape using graph theory and the least cost path method specifically we created a landscape of resistance fig 2b left panel where a value of 1 characterize a location where movement was impeded whereas a value of 0 represented a location where movement was facilitated using these resistance values as weight we calculated the length of all the shortest paths from or to the locations in the domain using the function distances of the r package igraph csardi and nepusz 2006 we then used the resulting matrix of cost distance as opposed to euclidean distance in eqs 1 2 and 3 for the parameter d j t the main barriers to movement isolated the top left corner of the domain which was only accessible by a small opening fig 2b another barrier in the bottom right corner helped define other resource areas but did not isolate part of the landscape the individual started in the middle of the domain on this side there were resource patches of medium quality in the top left corner area however disturbances created several new patches of high quality over time see second row of supplementary information fig s 1 this scenario can be interpreted as a disturbance creating a high amount of resources in an area previously unused by a population however the access was limited which means that individuals did not have free and equal access to the entire domain 2 8 scramble competition scenario this scenario implemented the habitat dynamics described in section 2 6 with one exception multiple animals interacted with the same landscape at the same time as resources were locally depleted by individuals they became unavailable for others such that individuals moved away to more abundant locations and thereby this process introduced negative density dependence in their movements we simulated animal densities ranging from 1 to 700 individuals the number of simulations for each combination of γ k and density 1452 combinations was 5000 divided by the density and rounded up this calculation allowed us to get approximately 5000 individual trajectories per combination matching the other scenarios at each time step we selected the new locations l t of all animals according to the corresponding perceived habitat quality p j t of each individual then we simulated the habitat dynamics described in section 2 6 with the following modification resource depletion happened at all locations l t and if several animals shared the same location depletion was accumulated 2 9 demography scenario this scenario implemented the habitat dynamics described in section 2 6 and the scramble competition described in section 2 8 with an initial density of 50 individuals over the entire landscape additionally we implemented four demographic processes adult survival fecundity juvenile dispersal and recruitment we tested three subscenarios increasing stable and decreasing population size over time we specified this change in population size using the values of the demographic processes described below supplementary information table s 1 we performed 50 simulations for each combination of γ k and population size change 363 combinations which allowed us to obtain on average 3341 individual trajectories per combination in this case the computing power available i e 20 cpu cores intel xeon e5 2689 v4 3 1 ghz with 512 gb ram limited the number of simulations 2 9 1 adult survival to account for survival over time as a function of the habitat recently encountered by individuals we calculated the probability of survival of an individual at each time step according to 6 s t ind a 1 m a 1 q past λ 0 q past 1 where λ was the hazard constant over the landscape and time period 0 λ 1 m a was the added mortality if the individual s two previous locations were of quality 0 0 m a 1 λ and q past was the actual past habitat quality of the habitat the two previous time steps at the location of the individual the past quality of a location at the last two time steps was calculated according to 7 q past 1 2 i 2 q j t i if ω 0 1 2 i 2 1 q j t i otherwise this allowed us to take into account how the individual relied on the habitat type repulsion or attraction represented by ω therefore the survival probability of an individual up to time declined over time and survival was more likely when the individual was located in locations of good quality the previous two time steps we drew the survival event at t from a bernoulli distribution with probability of survival s t ind a 2 9 2 fecundity to account for fecundity as a function of the habitat recently encountered by individuals we calculated the probability for each individual to produce a youngling at each time step according to 8 f t ind f q past if population size k 0 otherwise where f was the birth rate of new individuals in an habitat of past quality 1 0 f 1 and k was the carrying capacity of the domain therefore individuals who had access to high quality resources were more likely to reproduce we drew the birth event at t from a bernoulli distribution with probability f t ind 2 9 3 juvenile dispersal and recruitment juveniles did not have the adult s memory of the environment so their perceived habitat quality was set to the default expected quality q juveniles immediately dispersed from the parent location randomly in any direction by a distance n d y 5 where d y was the average juvenile dispersal distance we set this value to half of the domain size i e 16 we assumed that juveniles dispersed on a straight line we assumed juveniles recruited to adults and joined the population if they survived dispersal which was a function of habitat encountered during its dispersal journey described by 9 s t ind y 1 m y 1 q journey y where q journey y was the average quality of the locations on the juvenile s dispersal journey and m y was the probability of the juvenile dying if the locations on its dispersal journey were of average quality 0 0 m y 1 the average quality of the locations on the juvenile s dispersal journey was calculated according to 10 q journey y 1 path length j path q j t if ω 0 1 path length j path 1 q j t otherwise therefore juvenile recruitment after dispersal increased with the average habitat quality along the dispersal path we drew the juvenile survival event at t from a bernoulli distribution with probability of survival s t ind y if the juvenile survived it became adult and followed the regular movement rules on the following time step 2 10 statistical analysis the response variable emd represented the error between the rsf predictions and the observations of relative abundance measured at the end of each scenario we performed pairwise mann whitney rank sum tests with bonferroni correction on the emd values among scenarios pairwise wilcox test function of the r package stats we used a non parametric test since the emd does not follow a normal distribution furthermore to reveal non linear patterns in the relationships between the covariates step length or disturbance rate and the response variable emd we used a generalized additive model gam approach using the gam function of the r package mgcv wood et al 2016 additionally we added to the model the covariate animal density for the scramble competition scenario and the factor change in population size for the demography scenario each covariate was passed into a smoothing function with parameters selected by a restricted maximum likelihood approach reml wood 2011 wood et al 2016 before being passed into a linear model 3 results the error of relative abundance predictions i e emd calculated using the rsf in scenarios with disturbances barriers to movement density dependence demography and dispersal were four to ten times larger than when they were no disturbances pairwise mann whitney rank sum tests with bonferroni correction p values 0 001 n 2 157 fig 3a moreover the prediction error from the disturbances only scenario was slightly lower in average than the prediction error from the scramble competition and demography scenarios pairwise mann whitney rank sum tests with bonferroni correction respectively p value 0 001 and p value 0 038 n 2 157 fig 3a the population relative abundance predicted using the rsf function was always more spatially uniform than the one observed at the end of the simulations in all scenarios examples in fig 3b overall the emd showed highly non linear relationships with the average step length and the cumulative number of cells affected by disturbances table 1 fig 4 fig 5 however the gams were a poor fit to data see deviance explained in table 1 fig 4 except for the barriers scenario in this scenario the emd decreased 5 fold for a small step length increase and then plateaued additionally the emd was 5 times higher when the domain was highly disturbed than when it was little disturbed fig 4 second row 4 discussion in this study we show that population disequilibrium arising from realistic landscape dynamics resources access demography and survival highly impact the spatial abundance of individuals through their movement therefore our results confirm that predictive models that assume populations at equilibrium and a static landscape produce biased spatial relative abundance furthermore the prediction error is higher on a landscape with disturbances than without whether life history and demographic processes are present or not this result suggests that population spatial abundance can be more sensitive to local variations in landscape dynamics such as unpredictable disturbances rather than variations arising from life history and demographic processes at a small spatio temporal scale when a population is not at equilibrium boyce et al 2016 suggests to include population density to model abundance we show that under frequent disturbances this is not enough even when there are no other factors influencing fitness increases in the disturbance rate generally increases the prediction error and the animal step length has a varied impact on the prediction error depending on the scenario however the low deviance explained by the models with the exception of the barrier scenario highlights the high variability in prediction error which prevents us from drawing strong conclusions from these patterns this high uncertainty in the result suggests that disturbances have a highly varying effect on population spatial relative abundance increases in exploratory behaviour often result from low environmental predictability mueller and fagan 2008 riotte lambert and matthiopoulos 2020 when this movement pattern follows stochastic occurrences of novel habitat the resulting population spatial distribution would indeed randomly deviate from the habitat model predictions we would expect that increased movement should decrease differences between the proportional distribution of individuals to the resources and the simulated population abundance because individuals are able to reach better resources more easily moorcroft and barnett 2008 we would also expect that adding juvenile dispersal over distances larger than the average step length would enable individuals to reach good habitat quickly this should make simulated results proportional to resources and the deviations of the habitat model predictions from simulations should decrease however increasing step length i e increasing accessibility in our model does not decrease the prediction error except for the barrier scenario and neither does the inclusion of juvenile dispersal demography scenario a possible explanation is that in our simulations the resource availability used by the model i e the entire domain is likely representative of what is actually available to the simulated individuals in the case where there are no movement impediments thus habitat selection in our simulations is done at the scale of the home range or within the home range second and third order selection johnson 1980 in a larger simulated domain i e in a domain with areas that are unaccessible to individuals with small step length such decrease of the prediction error should become apparent similarly to what we observe in the barriers scenario moreover these results differ from barnett and moorcroft 2008 where step length dictates the population spatial abundance in a habitat constant in time without disturbances at very large step length the population spatial abundance steady state is proportional to the rsf whereas it is proportional to its square at very small step lengths therefore including disturbances changes this relationship due to their transient and stochastic nature similarly transient population dynamics allowed in the demography scenario can affect local survival and therefore the final population spatial abundance e g courtois et al 2007 shriver et al 2019 these local changes in population and habitat dynamics are expected yet they are not taken into account when predicting population spatial abundance using habitat models while climate change is driving more variability in natural disturbances regime in boreal forests it is essential to account for uncertainties arising from unpredictable ecosystem dynamics vallecillo et al 2009 schindler and hilborn 2015 management plans built from deterministic projections of central tendencies of ecosystem dynamic drivers lose efficiency by failing to take into account uncertainty daniel et al 2017 in our simulations we show that the error amplitude that results from ignoring animal movement and demography in response to landscape dynamics when projecting relative abundance is significant dynamic habitat models where the resource quality is derived for each time step are a possible methodological solution to unpredictable ecosystems nielsen et al 2010 however forecasting the resource variations under climate change needed for this method can be challenging or highly uncertain in itself e g braunisch et al 2013 our results suggest that models that account for local variations in ecosystem dynamics animal distribution behaviour and demography will provide improved estimates of uncertainty when enough simulations are run whereas the model we created in this study could be used for that purpose it requires extensive parametrization and prior information concerning animal vital rates movement and cognition when such information is missing we recommend the inclusion of as much information of this kind as possible even if only the species current distribution generation time or movement speed nonetheless researchers must account for landscape dynamics and the associated animal life history response in areas affected by disturbances in order to address the uncertainty around spatial abundance projections our model does not account for the fact that disturbances can be a novel phenomenon for individuals they might be reticent in using the resource created depending on their risk taking level our analysis also omits the potential immediate negative effects of disturbances and focuses only on resource creation indeed we used a positive magnitude for disturbances creating novel habitat on the landscape whereas disturbances can have a variable impact on resource levels e g lafontaine et al 2019 johnson et al 2020 stewart et al 2020 a more complex behaviour of recently disturbed areas could be implemented following for example the observations of caribou reactions to recent burns from silva et al 2020 or the temporal changes in bird species abundance in response to wildfires in mediterranean ecosystems from jacquet and prodon 2009 purely negative responses to disturbances could also change the conclusions given that this situation would push individuals out of their current habitat instead of providing other resource options 5 conclusion given increasing anthropogenic pressures and natural disturbances exacerbated by climate change managing populations of invasive and or species at risk requires flexible decision making tools to adapt to the uncertainty and complexity of rapidly changing landscapes in this study we show that local variations in ecosystem dynamics such as unpredictable disturbances as well as animal location and movement impact emergent properties at a population level such as spatial abundance we provide a quantitative assessment of the error associated with the assumption that population are at equilibrium in a static landscape in habitat models the implications for species at risk recovery planning are twofold first given foraging and density dependence assumptions animal movement responds dramatically to the presence of disturbances second in an area that is subject to more severe or frequent climate derived disturbances using habitat models to forecast animal location or abundance will likely produce inaccurate projections however researchers should not discard static habitat components when they are the best information available instead they should determine the potential for bias given the specifics of their study area population management and conservation plans require habitat and population abundance forecasts without knowledge or understanding of the effect of landscape dynamics on animal space use a population may be projected to do well or poorly in a domain with insufficient or mismatched resources heinrichs et al 2017 therefore it is essential that land managers and researchers collaborate to produce models that improve decision making bodner et al 2021 i e models providing accurate predictions

24431,increases in frequency of anthropogenic and natural disturbances exacerbated by climate change are disrupting animal movement patterns and in turn species distribution and abundance habitat models are a valuable approach for predicting how a species or population is distributed across habitats however in these models the environmental characteristics describing habitat are typically constant over time which is inaccurate for a frequently disturbed landscape the goal of this study is to assess the degree to which frequent disturbances can alter abundance and distribution to the point of which inferences from static habitat maps are no longer relevant we simulated individual animal movement in a dynamically disturbed landscape and compared the observed spatial relative abundance to the one predicted from a static habitat model fit to the simulated trajectories we found that the prediction error is higher when the landscape is disturbed than where there are no disturbances this result holds even with the addition of life history and demographic processes to the model which would facilitate the discovery of novel habitat by increasing density dependent movement thereby bringing the spatial distribution of individuals closer to a proportion of habitat quality arising from the population at equilibrium assumption underlying most habitat models in the context of species at risk recovery planning using habitat models with constant environmental covariates to forecast animal locations in areas with more frequent disturbances as a result of climate change will likely produce inaccurate predictions graphical abstract keywords climate change resource selection function simulations ungulates wildfire data and code availability data output from the

2010 pereira et al 2012 boucher et al 2018 cadieux et al 2020 natural and anthropogenic disturbances are increasingly putting forest ecosystem and value at risk the combined effect of multiple stressors exacerbated by climate change makes it difficult to understand and predict species responses to changes in the availability of essential resources mahon and pelech 2021 in boreal forest ecosystems for example wildfires insect outbreaks drought storms and landslides are predicted to increase in frequency intensity and or duration in the near future dale et al 2001 price et al 2013 our study focuses on these disturbances whether natural or anthropogenic and their interactions that present irregular spatio temporal patterns so that animals are not able to anticipate them as environmental conditions shift due to human activity and climate change the modification of the size and location of natural habitats creates novel habitat conditions such as new land cover types where species responses include rapid population decline or proliferation and changes in phenology or distribution barnosky et al 2011 bellard et al 2012 pereira et al 2012 effective management of species at risk requires forecasting the quality and distribution of future habitats and the resulting viability of species populations unglaub et al 2015 heinrichs et al 2017 masood et al 2017 whereas relating populations to habitats is a central goal in ecology predicting population abundance and demography in novel conditions remains challenging he and gaston 2007 weber et al 2017 model predictions of habitat quality in novel areas may be misleading due to unmeasured conditions johnson et al 2020 leading to population sinks or ecological traps fretwell 1969 however a more fundamental concern for predicting population abundance across wide ranging and potentially disconnected novel habitats is the need to estimate whether and over what time span a species population will discover and use habitat that emerges in currently unused areas indeed whereas some species have strong negative responses to disturbances others react positively to new opportunities created by some disturbance types fisher and burton 2018 for example wolverines gulo gulo luscus are attracted to foraging opportunities in areas of active logging scrafford et al 2017 in this study we focus on these positive relationships between a species and a disturbance type the probability that a species will discover and use novel habitat integrates the interacting effects of animal movement and demography and the rate and predictability at which novel conditions i e habitats of varying quality emerge thereby determining the spatial and temporal landscape heterogeneity for example the effect of a wildfire on a caribou population rangifer tarandus can be extremely complex over time going from attraction to avoidance and back to attraction as different processes such as windfallen trees arise schaefer and pruitt 1991 when foraging animal movement balances the need to leave recently depleted locations return to known high quality patches charnov 1976 van moorter et al 2009 and find new high quality habitat fahrig 2007 when disturbances are frequent and memory of high quality habitat locations is less reliable some species prioritize exploration leading to increased discovery and use of novel habitat travis and dytham 1999 mueller and fagan 2008 riotte lambert and matthiopoulos 2020 for example mongolian gazelle populations procapra gutturosa experiencing unpredictable resource variations due to stochastic rainfalls display nomadic behaviour i e low level of movement coordination mueller et al 2011 similarly for red kangaroo populations macropus rufus resource unpredictability leads to occasional and irregular excursions outside of the home range norbury et al 1994 in contrast barren ground caribou populations experiencing predictable seasonal variations of their resources display regular seasonal migration patterns mueller et al 2011 however other species display stronger site fidelity in unpredictable environments for example the gunnison sage grouse centrocercus minimus chooses to always stay at the same nesting location when site quality is unpredictable gerber et al 2019 similarly the green turtle chelonia mydas have a high foraging site fidelity when their habitat is unpredictably disturbed dalleau et al 2019 statistical models such as species distribution models and habitat association models characterize habitat from which abundance can be predicted weber et al 2017 increasing access to geographic information systems remotely sensed data computing power and radio gps telemetry providing precise animal positional data northrup et al 2013 avgar et al 2016 supported the expansion of many environmental statistical modelling approaches including logistic regressions and non parametric equivalents to become valuable approaches for predicting how a species or population is distributed across habitats boyce et al 2016 typically in these methods the environmental characteristics describing habitat are constant over time nielsen et al 2010 and habitat use reflects the quality and abundance of resources fretwell and lucas 1969 boyce and mcdonald 1999 these assumptions mean that the target population has reached an equilibrium boyce and mcdonald 1999 i e individuals distribute themselves in the landscape proportionally to the resources when resource distribution or spatial availability and population demography vary over time habitat models would fail to accurately predict population spatial distribution and abundance researchers have developed models that consider the unequal access to all locations of a domain e g forester et al 2009 avgar et al 2013 latombe et al 2014 furthermore models can be modified to include temporal changes in the habitat characteristics e g keith et al 2008 nielsen et al 2010 zeller et al 2020 but implementing temporal dynamics requires regular measures of the habitat characteristics which is considerably more data than for a static landscapes or at least an understanding of the mechanisms underlying landscape changes in order to simulate these variations without inclusion of an estimate of the relative effects and the associated uncertainty of animal movement demography and landscape heterogeneity on the probability of use of novel habitat model predictions of species population or distribution across dynamic environmental conditions will be biased in time or space e g vallecillo et al 2009 the objective of this study is to use a simulation model that includes dynamic and unpredictable habitat disturbances exploration heterogeneous resource access dispersal and demography in the study species to evaluate how these variables impact the accuracy of relative abundance predictions based on a static representation of recent habitat the results could help understand the consequences of violating a key assumption of commonly used habitat models a population at equilibrium in a static landscape or rapid arrival at equilibrium in a dynamic landscape such that landscape dynamics can be ignored 2 material and methods we used the r software r core team 2020 for all simulations and calculations we created a spatially explicit landscape in silica that was subject to dynamic and unpredictable disturbances after disturbances habitats gradually returned to their previous states prior to disturbance but disturbances provided windows of opportunities for any intraspecific aspect such as foraging nesting territory thereafter called resources in this idealized system we simulated movement of our target animals using a modular individual based simulation model that included demography dispersal exploration and movement target animals were of a theoretical species with the following characteristics individuals notice habitat changes and respond to them via movement an increase in population density decreases habitat quality for this purpose we used hall et al 1997 s definition of habitat quality i e the ability of the environment to provide conditions appropriate for individual and population persistence disturbances create resources thereby increasing habitat quality which prompts a positive response from the individuals we chose these characteristics with species of large primary consumers in a forested habitat in mind however any species following these characteristics would fit in the context of this study note that we did not include temporal changes in habitat preference therefore migration patterns or population adaptation which could either encourage or prevent new habitat discovery depending on the context are not represented in this study in order to investigate the effects of local variations in the ecosystem dynamics and life history of our target animal we simulated scenarios of individual movement on a theoretical but spatially explicit domain described in section 2 1 using the movement model developed by avgar et al 2013 described in section 2 3 then we used the individual trajectories obtained by the simulations and the habitat characteristics of our domain to estimate a resource selection function rsf and predict the spatial relative abundance of the population section 2 4 finally we compared the predicted spatial relative abundance to the one observed at the end of the simulations section 2 4 a conceptual diagram summarizes these processes fig 1 we defined five different scenarios such that each scenario addressed a source of local variation in the control scenario a single individual moved in a dynamic landscape resource depletion and regeneration without disturbances in the other four scenarios the domain was subjected to the habitat dynamics with disturbances described in section 2 2 in the disturbance only scenario a single individual moved in a dynamic landscape section 2 6 in the barriers scenario a single individual moved in a dynamic landscape featuring geographical barriers to movement section 2 7 in the scramble competition scenario several individuals shared the same dynamic landscape and depleted resources resulting in negative density dependence section 2 8 in the demography scenario several individuals shared the same dynamic landscape and were subjected to demographic processes section 2 9 we chose these scenarios to assess how habitat disturbances can break the population equilibrium assumption on their own and in combination with other common local spatio temporal variations barriers to movement population density and demographic processes we would expect that increased step length or the addition of juvenile dispersal should decrease differences between the utilization distribution proportional to resources and the simulated population abundance because individuals are able to reach better resources more easily introducing barriers to movement would have the opposite effect by preventing individuals from reaching better resources increasing population density would push individuals away due to local decreases in resource forcing them to distribute themselves proportionally to the resources 2 1 spatial domain we defined a 32 32 squared landscape composed of 1166 hexagonal cells where each cell had a resource value between 0 low and 1 high we chose a hexagonal grid as it is more appropriate than a rectangular grid to model landscape connectivity and movement paths birch et al 2007 in all scenarios but the barriers scenario the resource values were spatially distributed according to a midpoint displacement neutral landscape model i e fractal using the function mpd of the nlmpy python package with a level of autocorrelation set to 0 7 etherington et al 2015 therefore cells with high level of resources were spatially arranged in patches see fig 2a for the example of the disturbances only scenario we defined the domain as a torus which meant that individuals disappearing on one side would reappear on the opposite side in the barriers scenario the domain consisted of two layers a resource layer and a barrier to movement layer fig 2b we manually organized cells with medium to high resource level to be surrounded by cells with low resource level fig 2b right panel in order to reproduce an example of a realistic landscape furthermore the low resource cells could act as partial or complete barriers to movement value of 1 complete barrier or facilitated movement value of 0 no barrier fig 2b left panel the medium to high resource cells neither restrained nor facilitated movement value of 0 5 values were smoothed in between these features by spline interpolation using the interp function of the r package akima akima and gebhardt 2020 in this scenario the domain boundaries were reflective as a torus would defeat the purpose of the barriers in the context of an ungulate this landscape could be interpreted as valleys medium to high resources no impact on movement surrounded by mountains low resources barriers to movement and connected by roads low resources facilitate movement in the context of a small mammal or reptile this landscape could be interpreted as foraging or nesting areas surrounded by barriers such as roads and other human infrastructures and connected by blue and or green corridors 2 2 disturbance regime we disturbed the domain described in section 2 1 i e created novel habitat by changing the resource values in affected cells at each time step affected cells were located within a circle with its centre randomly selected within the entire domain except for the barrier scenario see section 2 7 and radius drawn from a power law distribution therefore at the scale of a cell the disturbance frequency depended on the power law scaling parameter k the disturbance magnitude was constant we set the average resource value of the affected cells just after disturbance to 0 95 which means that disturbances created resources thus generating new habitats this represents for example a fire creating an open area in a forest where shrubs can grow and provide resources for ungulates to investigate the changes in population spatial relative abundance due to the disturbance rate we explored the values 2 0 to 3 0 by increments of 0 1 for the power law scaling parameter k representing the disturbance rate this range of values covers landscapes subjected to few disturbances to highly disturbed landscapes supplementary information fig s 1 a value of 3 0 would lead to fewer disturbances than a value of 2 0 after the simulations we recorded the cumulative number of cells affected by a disturbance over time and space for a same combination of parameters in each scenario we kept the disturbance locations and sizes the same over the simulations to be able to combine the simulation results for the rest of the analysis therefore different scenarios or parameter combinations had different realized values of disturbance locations and sizes 2 3 movement model we used the movement model from avgar et al 2013 in which an individual chooses its next location in the domain depending on the attractiveness of each cell calculated from the habitat quality as perceived by the individual we chose this model because it captures the processes by which we hypothesize an individual animal discovers and uses new habitat namely habitat quality experience and memory which lead to the use and loss of information eq 1 2 and 3 are reproduced from avgar et al 2013 for a single habitat component see supplementary information table s 1 for parameter values the perceived habitat quality q j t in spatial cell j at time t was calculated following 1 q j t e α d j t δ t q j t 1 e α d j t δ t e β δ t q j t δ t 1 e β δ t q where d j t was the euclidean distance or cost distance in section 2 7 between the current location and cell j q j t was the actual habitat quality α was the sensory attenuation coefficient δ t was the time step β was the memory decay coefficient and q was the default expectation of habitat quality therefore the individual s perception of a cell s quality changed from perfect knowledge to default expectation as distance to the individual and time to last visit increased the attractiveness a j t of a cell j at time t was calculated following the equation 2 a j t e γ d j t δ t q j t ω where γ was the friction coefficient and ω was the attraction toward the habitat a negative value represents repulsion therefore cell attractiveness depended on perceived habitat quality and was higher for the cells that were within the animal s reach the probability p j t of the individual relocating at location j at time t was 3 p j t i d j t d max a j t j i d j t d max a j t θ where i was an indicator function with value 1 if the argument was true and 0 otherwise and d max δ t ln 0 01 γ i e the redistribution kernel was truncated where the travelling propensity was below 1 this process helped reduce the computing power required by dropping very low probabilities to zero we added to the avgar et al 2013 model the exponent θ which controls the level of determinism of the cell selection process θ 0 represented a random choice whereas θ represented a deterministic choice i e the location with the highest probability was always selected the animal s next step was then randomly selected in the domain according to the probability distribution p j t the individual started in a random location in the domain except for the barrier scenario where the individual started in the centre of the landscape section 2 7 and moved for 300 time steps to have a better understanding of how the scale of movement step length impacts spatial abundance we explored the values 4 5 0 915 0 46 0 307 0 23 0 184 0 1535 0 1151 0 0921 0 0614 and 0 04605 for the movement friction coefficient γ which corresponded to the values 1 5 10 15 20 25 30 40 50 75 and 100 for the maximum distance covered in one time step d max values between 75 and 100 allow an individual to cover the entire domain in one time step whereas values between 1 and 10 restrain individuals to the nearest locations after the simulations we recorded the average of the realized animal step length over time number of individuals and number of simulations in preliminary simulations values of d max 100 did not correspond to higher values of realized step length see supplementary information fig s 2 2 4 resource selection function and spatial relative abundance we compared the predicted relative abundance of animal locations modelled from an rsf and the observed relative abundance obtained at the end of the simulations for each parameter combination and scenario we randomly selected a subset of 30 individual trajectories from the last 50 time steps of the movement model output all simulations pooled we then randomly generated 1166 alternative locations in the entire domain i e on average one alternative location per cell finally we fitted a logistic regression modelling the response variable used step which takes the value used for the 30 individual trajectories and available for the 1166 alternative locations as a function of the simulated landscape habitat values to this newly created used available dataset see supplementary information a for details on the choice of rsf over step selection function we calculated the predicted relative abundance over space by taking the probability density u pred j for each cell j using the following equation 4 u pred j w j 1 j w j 1 where each cell had an area of 1 and the logistic discriminant w j exp β x j was obtained using the coefficient β from the logistic regression and a new dataset x j consisting of the average of the resource during the last 50 time steps for each cell j we used the average of the last 50 time steps in order to reproduce what could be predicted of a future landscape under disturbances in additional simulations using the average of the last 50 time steps lead to less prediction error than using the last two time steps supplementary information b we calculated the observed relative abundance over space by taking the probability density u obsv j for each cell j using the final location of all individuals all simulations pooled as described by the following equation 5 u obsv j number of individuals in cell j j number of individuals in cell j we compared the observed and predicted relative abundances using the earth mover s distance emd rubner et al 2000 using the function emd of the r package emdist urbanek and rubner 2012 the emd also called the wasserstein metric is a measure of the difference between two distributions by calculating the cost of transforming one distribution into the other this metric allowed us to obtain a single number representing the difference between two 2 dimensional distributions 2 5 control a single individual moved on a landscape where resources could be depleted and regenerated over time we performed 5000 simulations with a very large step length γ 0 001 corresponding to d max 4605 and no disturbances and repeated this process 100 times at each time step we 1 selected the animal s new location l t according to p j t 2 depleted the resource at location l t by an amount n depl 0 01 3 updated the habitat quality perceived value at location l t to be the real habitat quality after resource depletion 4 regenerated the habitat quality of each cell of the entire domain toward the initial values q j 1 decrease or increase by an amount n reg 0 01 which allows habitat recovery after depletion up to time t and after disturbances absent in the control scenario up to time t 1 2 6 disturbances only in the disturbances only scenario a single individual moved in a dynamic landscape where resources could be depleted regenerated or exposed to disturbances we repeated simulations 5000 times for each combination of γ and k 121 combinations so we obtained 5000 individual trajectories per combination in addition to the steps described in section 2 5 we 5 introduced one disturbance of radius p ℓ min 0 2 k randomly located in the domain where p ℓ is the power law distribution and 6 modified the resource value of the cells affected by the disturbance to an amount n dis 0 02 2 7 barriers to movement scenario this scenario implemented the habitat dynamics described in section 2 6 with disturbances only located in the top left corner of the domain see below we implemented barriers to movement described in section 2 1 by adjusting the cost of movement across the landscape using graph theory and the least cost path method specifically we created a landscape of resistance fig 2b left panel where a value of 1 characterize a location where movement was impeded whereas a value of 0 represented a location where movement was facilitated using these resistance values as weight we calculated the length of all the shortest paths from or to the locations in the domain using the function distances of the r package igraph csardi and nepusz 2006 we then used the resulting matrix of cost distance as opposed to euclidean distance in eqs 1 2 and 3 for the parameter d j t the main barriers to movement isolated the top left corner of the domain which was only accessible by a small opening fig 2b another barrier in the bottom right corner helped define other resource areas but did not isolate part of the landscape the individual started in the middle of the domain on this side there were resource patches of medium quality in the top left corner area however disturbances created several new patches of high quality over time see second row of supplementary information fig s 1 this scenario can be interpreted as a disturbance creating a high amount of resources in an area previously unused by a population however the access was limited which means that individuals did not have free and equal access to the entire domain 2 8 scramble competition scenario this scenario implemented the habitat dynamics described in section 2 6 with one exception multiple animals interacted with the same landscape at the same time as resources were locally depleted by individuals they became unavailable for others such that individuals moved away to more abundant locations and thereby this process introduced negative density dependence in their movements we simulated animal densities ranging from 1 to 700 individuals the number of simulations for each combination of γ k and density 1452 combinations was 5000 divided by the density and rounded up this calculation allowed us to get approximately 5000 individual trajectories per combination matching the other scenarios at each time step we selected the new locations l t of all animals according to the corresponding perceived habitat quality p j t of each individual then we simulated the habitat dynamics described in section 2 6 with the following modification resource depletion happened at all locations l t and if several animals shared the same location depletion was accumulated 2 9 demography scenario this scenario implemented the habitat dynamics described in section 2 6 and the scramble competition described in section 2 8 with an initial density of 50 individuals over the entire landscape additionally we implemented four demographic processes adult survival fecundity juvenile dispersal and recruitment we tested three subscenarios increasing stable and decreasing population size over time we specified this change in population size using the values of the demographic processes described below supplementary information table s 1 we performed 50 simulations for each combination of γ k and population size change 363 combinations which allowed us to obtain on average 3341 individual trajectories per combination in this case the computing power available i e 20 cpu cores intel xeon e5 2689 v4 3 1 ghz with 512 gb ram limited the number of simulations 2 9 1 adult survival to account for survival over time as a function of the habitat recently encountered by individuals we calculated the probability of survival of an individual at each time step according to 6 s t ind a 1 m a 1 q past λ 0 q past 1 where λ was the hazard constant over the landscape and time period 0 λ 1 m a was the added mortality if the individual s two previous locations were of quality 0 0 m a 1 λ and q past was the actual past habitat quality of the habitat the two previous time steps at the location of the individual the past quality of a location at the last two time steps was calculated according to 7 q past 1 2 i 2 q j t i if ω 0 1 2 i 2 1 q j t i otherwise this allowed us to take into account how the individual relied on the habitat type repulsion or attraction represented by ω therefore the survival probability of an individual up to time declined over time and survival was more likely when the individual was located in locations of good quality the previous two time steps we drew the survival event at t from a bernoulli distribution with probability of survival s t ind a 2 9 2 fecundity to account for fecundity as a function of the habitat recently encountered by individuals we calculated the probability for each individual to produce a youngling at each time step according to 8 f t ind f q past if population size k 0 otherwise where f was the birth rate of new individuals in an habitat of past quality 1 0 f 1 and k was the carrying capacity of the domain therefore individuals who had access to high quality resources were more likely to reproduce we drew the birth event at t from a bernoulli distribution with probability f t ind 2 9 3 juvenile dispersal and recruitment juveniles did not have the adult s memory of the environment so their perceived habitat quality was set to the default expected quality q juveniles immediately dispersed from the parent location randomly in any direction by a distance n d y 5 where d y was the average juvenile dispersal distance we set this value to half of the domain size i e 16 we assumed that juveniles dispersed on a straight line we assumed juveniles recruited to adults and joined the population if they survived dispersal which was a function of habitat encountered during its dispersal journey described by 9 s t ind y 1 m y 1 q journey y where q journey y was the average quality of the locations on the juvenile s dispersal journey and m y was the probability of the juvenile dying if the locations on its dispersal journey were of average quality 0 0 m y 1 the average quality of the locations on the juvenile s dispersal journey was calculated according to 10 q journey y 1 path length j path q j t if ω 0 1 path length j path 1 q j t otherwise therefore juvenile recruitment after dispersal increased with the average habitat quality along the dispersal path we drew the juvenile survival event at t from a bernoulli distribution with probability of survival s t ind y if the juvenile survived it became adult and followed the regular movement rules on the following time step 2 10 statistical analysis the response variable emd represented the error between the rsf predictions and the observations of relative abundance measured at the end of each scenario we performed pairwise mann whitney rank sum tests with bonferroni correction on the emd values among scenarios pairwise wilcox test function of the r package stats we used a non parametric test since the emd does not follow a normal distribution furthermore to reveal non linear patterns in the relationships between the covariates step length or disturbance rate and the response variable emd we used a generalized additive model gam approach using the gam function of the r package mgcv wood et al 2016 additionally we added to the model the covariate animal density for the scramble competition scenario and the factor change in population size for the demography scenario each covariate was passed into a smoothing function with parameters selected by a restricted maximum likelihood approach reml wood 2011 wood et al 2016 before being passed into a linear model 3 results the error of relative abundance predictions i e emd calculated using the rsf in scenarios with disturbances barriers to movement density dependence demography and dispersal were four to ten times larger than when they were no disturbances pairwise mann whitney rank sum tests with bonferroni correction p values 0 001 n 2 157 fig 3a moreover the prediction error from the disturbances only scenario was slightly lower in average than the prediction error from the scramble competition and demography scenarios pairwise mann whitney rank sum tests with bonferroni correction respectively p value 0 001 and p value 0 038 n 2 157 fig 3a the population relative abundance predicted using the rsf function was always more spatially uniform than the one observed at the end of the simulations in all scenarios examples in fig 3b overall the emd showed highly non linear relationships with the average step length and the cumulative number of cells affected by disturbances table 1 fig 4 fig 5 however the gams were a poor fit to data see deviance explained in table 1 fig 4 except for the barriers scenario in this scenario the emd decreased 5 fold for a small step length increase and then plateaued additionally the emd was 5 times higher when the domain was highly disturbed than when it was little disturbed fig 4 second row 4 discussion in this study we show that population disequilibrium arising from realistic landscape dynamics resources access demography and survival highly impact the spatial abundance of individuals through their movement therefore our results confirm that predictive models that assume populations at equilibrium and a static landscape produce biased spatial relative abundance furthermore the prediction error is higher on a landscape with disturbances than without whether life history and demographic processes are present or not this result suggests that population spatial abundance can be more sensitive to local variations in landscape dynamics such as unpredictable disturbances rather than variations arising from life history and demographic processes at a small spatio temporal scale when a population is not at equilibrium boyce et al 2016 suggests to include population density to model abundance we show that under frequent disturbances this is not enough even when there are no other factors influencing fitness increases in the disturbance rate generally increases the prediction error and the animal step length has a varied impact on the prediction error depending on the scenario however the low deviance explained by the models with the exception of the barrier scenario highlights the high variability in prediction error which prevents us from drawing strong conclusions from these patterns this high uncertainty in the result suggests that disturbances have a highly varying effect on population spatial relative abundance increases in exploratory behaviour often result from low environmental predictability mueller and fagan 2008 riotte lambert and matthiopoulos 2020 when this movement pattern follows stochastic occurrences of novel habitat the resulting population spatial distribution would indeed randomly deviate from the habitat model predictions we would expect that increased movement should decrease differences between the proportional distribution of individuals to the resources and the simulated population abundance because individuals are able to reach better resources more easily moorcroft and barnett 2008 we would also expect that adding juvenile dispersal over distances larger than the average step length would enable individuals to reach good habitat quickly this should make simulated results proportional to resources and the deviations of the habitat model predictions from simulations should decrease however increasing step length i e increasing accessibility in our model does not decrease the prediction error except for the barrier scenario and neither does the inclusion of juvenile dispersal demography scenario a possible explanation is that in our simulations the resource availability used by the model i e the entire domain is likely representative of what is actually available to the simulated individuals in the case where there are no movement impediments thus habitat selection in our simulations is done at the scale of the home range or within the home range second and third order selection johnson 1980 in a larger simulated domain i e in a domain with areas that are unaccessible to individuals with small step length such decrease of the prediction error should become apparent similarly to what we observe in the barriers scenario moreover these results differ from barnett and moorcroft 2008 where step length dictates the population spatial abundance in a habitat constant in time without disturbances at very large step length the population spatial abundance steady state is proportional to the rsf whereas it is proportional to its square at very small step lengths therefore including disturbances changes this relationship due to their transient and stochastic nature similarly transient population dynamics allowed in the demography scenario can affect local survival and therefore the final population spatial abundance e g courtois et al 2007 shriver et al 2019 these local changes in population and habitat dynamics are expected yet they are not taken into account when predicting population spatial abundance using habitat models while climate change is driving more variability in natural disturbances regime in boreal forests it is essential to account for uncertainties arising from unpredictable ecosystem dynamics vallecillo et al 2009 schindler and hilborn 2015 management plans built from deterministic projections of central tendencies of ecosystem dynamic drivers lose efficiency by failing to take into account uncertainty daniel et al 2017 in our simulations we show that the error amplitude that results from ignoring animal movement and demography in response to landscape dynamics when projecting relative abundance is significant dynamic habitat models where the resource quality is derived for each time step are a possible methodological solution to unpredictable ecosystems nielsen et al 2010 however forecasting the resource variations under climate change needed for this method can be challenging or highly uncertain in itself e g braunisch et al 2013 our results suggest that models that account for local variations in ecosystem dynamics animal distribution behaviour and demography will provide improved estimates of uncertainty when enough simulations are run whereas the model we created in this study could be used for that purpose it requires extensive parametrization and prior information concerning animal vital rates movement and cognition when such information is missing we recommend the inclusion of as much information of this kind as possible even if only the species current distribution generation time or movement speed nonetheless researchers must account for landscape dynamics and the associated animal life history response in areas affected by disturbances in order to address the uncertainty around spatial abundance projections our model does not account for the fact that disturbances can be a novel phenomenon for individuals they might be reticent in using the resource created depending on their risk taking level our analysis also omits the potential immediate negative effects of disturbances and focuses only on resource creation indeed we used a positive magnitude for disturbances creating novel habitat on the landscape whereas disturbances can have a variable impact on resource levels e g lafontaine et al 2019 johnson et al 2020 stewart et al 2020 a more complex behaviour of recently disturbed areas could be implemented following for example the observations of caribou reactions to recent burns from silva et al 2020 or the temporal changes in bird species abundance in response to wildfires in mediterranean ecosystems from jacquet and prodon 2009 purely negative responses to disturbances could also change the conclusions given that this situation would push individuals out of their current habitat instead of providing other resource options 5 conclusion given increasing anthropogenic pressures and natural disturbances exacerbated by climate change managing populations of invasive and or species at risk requires flexible decision making tools to adapt to the uncertainty and complexity of rapidly changing landscapes in this study we show that local variations in ecosystem dynamics such as unpredictable disturbances as well as animal location and movement impact emergent properties at a population level such as spatial abundance we provide a quantitative assessment of the error associated with the assumption that population are at equilibrium in a static landscape in habitat models the implications for species at risk recovery planning are twofold first given foraging and density dependence assumptions animal movement responds dramatically to the presence of disturbances second in an area that is subject to more severe or frequent climate derived disturbances using habitat models to forecast animal location or abundance will likely produce inaccurate projections however researchers should not discard static habitat components when they are the best information available instead they should determine the potential for bias given the specifics of their study area population management and conservation plans require habitat and population abundance forecasts without knowledge or understanding of the effect of landscape dynamics on animal space use a population may be projected to do well or poorly in a domain with insufficient or mismatched resources heinrichs et al 2017 therefore it is essential that land managers and researchers collaborate to produce models that improve decision making bodner et al 2021 i e models providing accurate predictions

24432,heavy metal contamination of the soil is a global problem that produces different harmful effects from an environmental and public health perspective although there have been numerous efforts to solve this problem there is no precise methodology to decontaminate heavy metal polluted soils one of the strategies to develop such methods relies on mathematical modelling pursuing this goal we propose a novel mathematical compartmental model consisting of a linear system of differential equations to address the suitability of the model plant chenopodium album l for the remediation of contaminated areas such as sewage sludge lagoons our results show a tendency to maintain high concentrations of copper cu in the roots with the possibility of continuing with good plants dynamics moreover the model theoretically proposes contaminant concentration in the plants shoots and roots and predicts a more prolonged tendency to accumulate copper concentrations in the shoots and disrupt the shoots dynamics these results provide complementary support for the suitability of this model plant to be used in contaminated areas in addition we present asymptotic tendencies of the plants biomass content and nitrogen assimilatory nitrate reductase nr enzyme activity in this way we project the relationship between contaminant accumulation and plants measurements these projections are essential as they can potentially be used for optimization purposes and strategic harvesting planning finally we present a parameter sensitivity analysis to complement the model examination keywords mathematical modelling chenopodium album l copper induced stress sewage sludge lagoons metal contamination remediation 1 introduction heavy metal contamination produces harmful effects on plant development and it is also an environmental threat of great magnitude for all living beings growth inhibition is the most common change observed in plants exposed to high heavy metal s concentrations prasad 2004 in gajewska and sklodowska 2010 the authors stated that the primary plant part interacting with heavy metals is the root system therefore the decrease in growth is observed more clearly in the roots than in the shoots heavy metals are taken into the cell through the roots nutrient uptake pathways consequently heavy metals may compete with essential elements plant absorption therefore the inability of the plant to absorb crucial nutrients may cause harmful effects on cellular structures primary metabolism and transport processes boojar and goodarzi 2007 nedjimi and daoud 2009 sharma and dietz 2009 nitrogen is one of the main structural components of the plant and constitutes 1 5 2 of the dry weight of the plant frink et al 1999 therefore it is crucial to infer nitrogen concentration in plants through different measurements plants usually take up nitrogen as nitrate no 3 in order to fulfil the essential metabolic functions nitrate taken by the roots must first be reduced to nitrite and then to ammonia nitrate reductase nr and nitrite reductase nir enzymes actively reduce nitrate to ammonia in particular nr is one of the most important enzymes to infer the predominant form of nitrogen in plants marschner 1995 solanki and dhankhar 2011 nr is highly sensitive to the presence of nitrates for this reason it is suggested that nr activity reflects the nitrate content of the habitat where the plant is located lee and stewart 1978 indeed nr activity is accepted in ecological studies as an indicator of nitrate presence gebauer et al 1988 olsson and falkengren grerup 2003 nir enzyme comes into play when nr enzyme converts nitrogen in nitrate form to nitrite in particular nir is responsible for the reduction of nitrite to ammonia with the assimilation of ammonia that occurs as a result of nitrogen fixation the nitrogen source needed by the plants is converted to glutamine and glutamate by specific reactions and amino acids and protein compounds are formed from these molecules zheng xun et al 2007 moschou et al 2012 scientific evidence shows adverse effects of increased heavy metal concentration in the growing environment plant development and water malec et al 2008 2009 due to this fact various physiological biochemical and molecular markers have been established to determine the effects of heavy metal contamination malec et al 2008 2009 maleva et al 2009 wan et al 2011 kumar et al 2012 in this work we are particularly interested in alterations from these markers under cu contamination some of the adverse effects on plants due to cu pollution have already been established for example the change in the plant s nr activity is a consequence of the decrease in the plant s nitrate uptake due to copper pollution llorens et al 2000 xiong et al 2006 in addition a reduction in nr enzyme activity may also occur due to the tendency of reactive cu ions to bind to the sulfhydryl compounds sh contained in the nr enzyme this state causes structural deterioration of the nr enzyme resulting in irreversible consequences similarly the nr enzyme may deteriorate structurally as a result of low molybdenum mo intake from micronutrients due to high cu concentrations specifically mo is a cofactor in the structure of nr and its insufficient uptake reduces nr enzyme activity phytoremediation which is also called a green solution has a strategic potential to address the heavy metal pollution problem in the environment and it has been implemented worldwide swaileh et al 2004 zeidler 2005 gonzález and gonzález chávez 2006 ali et al 2013 phytoremediation aims to reduce the contaminant concentrations or toxic effects in the environment by using heavy metal tolerant plants and related soil bacteria greipsoon 2011 rajkumar et al 2013 scientific studies have shown that some plants such as chenopodium album l can survive in sewage sludge lagoons akpinar 2021 or heavy metal contaminated areas mohan et al 2019 bhargava et al 2007 tozser et al 2019 alipour et al 2015 zulfiqar et al 2012 gupta and sinha 2007 therefore chenopodium album l is a candidate for monitoring heavy metal pollution in degraded areas biomonitoring and phytoremediation of heavy metals in contaminated sites hand in hand studies of theoretical and experimental researchers play a significant role in unveiling the underlying working principles of biological mechanisms mathematical modelling is the primary tool used in theoretical studies this approach provides a multidisciplinary framework for complementing supporting and producing new experimental settings of a system s dynamics a mathematical model can potentially project a system s long term behaviour under different physical constraints on the one hand a specialized model can include specific factors and relationships of the system at the cost of increasing the complexity of the model and hence limiting the incorporation of experimental data on the other hand a less complex mathematical model so called a toy model can attenuate this complexity at the cost of missing specific features of the system a toy model is primarily used for understanding the big picture more than the details therefore a possible approach in mathematical modelling is to incorporate a minimum set of system features without losing the model tractability of the main variables additionally one of the options when establishing a mathematical modelling strategy is to develop a compartmental model the basis of compartmental models is to divide the system into multiple compartments to be analysed independently which is supported by the so called modular plant architecture approach however the meristematic nature of plants restricts the assertiveness of this approach cheeseman et al 1996 this is because there is no exact distinction between a root and a shoot compartment in an actual plant nevertheless this simplifying assumption can build up basic models to extract a set of the main dynamics that can be further refined later in particular a linear mathematical model provides a simple scenario to investigate the otherwise complex dynamics of a system various mathematical models have been proposed to investigate and optimize phytoremediation techniques we found a model for the phytoremediation of petroleum contaminated soil thoma et al 2003 an optimization model to comply with environmental criteria thomas and vandemuelebroeke 2005 a model for the accumulation of heavy metals in benthic algae seip 1979 among many others cârdei et al 2021 d acunto et al 2019 torres bejarano et al 2019 tantemsapya et al 2011 tawfiq and wirojanagud 2016 we also found a heuristic mathematical model to assess a contamination level or plan a harvesting strategy in these models however as far as the authors know there is currently no mathematical model relating both the nr enzyme activity and the biomass content to the accumulation of contaminants in a plant we propose that incorporating these feature dynamics into a mathematical model is crucial therefore this approach relates contaminant accumulation to measurable experimental quantities intrinsic to the plant s dynamics the model here developed aims to theoretically support the plausibility of the model plant to be used in a copper contaminated environment by relating the model to experimental data this work shows different scenarios of the main variables under copper induced stress furthermore our results provide model plants consistent features with qualities observed in indicator species in addition our mathematical model assesses and predicts the nr enzyme activity biomass content and contaminant level in each of the plant s compartments as time evolves the work in this manuscript is developed as follows in section 2 we establish the experimental analysis of chenopodium album l under copper induced stress section 3 sets the biological and mathematical fundaments that support our mathematical model section 4 establishes the mathematical model and analyzes different scenarios of the model plant under copper induced stress our model parameters are calibrated and validated by the experimental data using these parameters we provide longer time projections of the variables in addition to our forecasts we provide asymptotic dynamics of the model s main variables including information about the system s more extended time dynamics in section 4 we also provide parameter sensitivity analysis to address the model components and complement our mathematical analysis finally in section 5 we discuss some of the model s implications and limitations and in section 6 we establish our conclusions and future work to be developed 2 materials and methods chenopodium album l which is seen to grow naturally in sewage sludge lagoons akpinar 2021 was chosen as the model plant in this study uniform seedlings belonging to the c album were collected from their natural environments in turkey s bursa province they were exposed to different concentrations of cu 0 μ m control 50 μ m and 500 μ m plants were harvested on the 1st 3rd and 7th days after the cu treatments then they were washed thoroughly with de ionized water and the roots and shoots were separated leaves stems the nr enzyme activity was immediately analysed in fresh plant material nr in the fresh roots and shoots was determined according to the in vivo test described by hageman and hucklesby 1971 jaworski 1971 and modified by gebauer et al 1984 this spectrophotometric method is based on measuring the absorbance of nitrite no 2 formed by the nitrate reduction in the incubation medium nr μ m no 2 g 1 dw h 1 was calculated using the absorption value on a dry weight dw basis dry biomass was measured after oven drying plant materials at 80 c until constant weight the biomass of roots and shoots was also measured on a dw basis the same method indicated in akpinar 2021 was used to determine cu accumulation in plant parts 3 theory in this section we provide the theory that supports the development of our mathematical model to begin we design a compartmental setting the compartments are determined by the environment e the roots r and the shoots s as is described in fig 1 we aim to incorporate the dynamics of a metal contaminant into each of these compartments in a simplified setting therefore we assume that the independent compartments are only affected by the metal contaminant we establish a linear system of 9 first order differential equations with 13 free parameters that describe different plant dynamics although we greatly simplify the biological process by considering a simple linear model we remain with the challenge of determining a plausible range for the model parameters to study the effect of copper pollution on the model plant therefore we determine the parameters of our mathematical model by the experimental data described in section 2 this provides a setting in which we theoretically explore the suitability of the model plant chenopodium album l to be used in contaminated areas and assess the plant s contaminant concentration our main variables are determined by the biomass and the nitrogen assimilatory enzyme nr activities the latter measurement indirectly provides information about the plant s nitrogen n indeed as previously mentioned nr has been established as one of the most important enzymes to determine the predominant form of nitrogen in plants in addition the dynamics of the nitrogen content and the nr enzyme activity had been successfully modelled as oscillatory in higher plants yang and midmore 2005 alluding to circadian oscillations therefore we propose an initial model of nr enzyme activity described by a second order constantly forced damped harmonic oscillator strogatz 2015 to simplify the model simulations we transform the second order differential equation into two first order differential equations that is we consider 1 d n r d t t d t d t d b t a n r where t d n r d t is the rate of change of nr enzyme activity and a b c are constants such that a 0 b 0 and d 0 we propose that the rate of change in nitrogen content nc is proportional to the rate of change in nitrate reductase enzyme activity 2 d n c d t k 1 d n r d t for some constant k 1 0 furthermore we propose that the biomass b content is determined by the dynamics of the nitrogen content which is directly related to the amount of the nr enzyme in each compartment specifically we propose that the biomass is determined by the difference between the amount of nitrogen and the decaying growth verkroost and wassen 2005 that is 3 d b d t k 2 n c k 3 b for some constants k 2 0 and k 3 0 since we are primarily concerned with the nr enzyme activity we combine eqs 2 and 3 and we propose the equation 4 d b d t k 1 n r k 2 b for some positive constants k 1 and k 2 the contaminant dynamics of the model are motivated by the work of thomas and vandemuelebroeke 2005 a mathematical model is established in the abovementioned work to optimize harvesting strategies for metal phytoremediation however compared to thomas and vandemuelebroeke 2005 we directly relate the contaminant accumulation to the plant s intrinsic dynamics finally we assume that the metal accumulation directly affects the nitrogen content as a negative linear forcing term that is we propose the following equation to describe the amount of the nr enzyme content under copper induced stress 5 d n r d t t d t d t d b t a n r e m where m is the amount of metal absorbed by the plant and e is the uptake rate of the contaminant we limit our analysis to the previously described features in the present model a future version of the model should include different elements such as carbon dynamics as carbon is one of the plants essential structural components an additional model description including specific information about water content photosynthetic activity temperature humidity ph among others should also be addressed in the future the main assumptions and variables of the model are summarized as follows the model establishes two independent compartments of the plant determined by the plant roots and shoots that are independently affected by the contaminant there is an additional compartment determined by the plant growing conditions which are simplified and described as the environment we exclude the intrinsic dynamics of the environment we assume that a single contaminant dose is initially added to the environment the main variables of the model are the nr enzyme activity biomass content and contaminant concentration in both the roots and the shoots the experimental data constrains the nr enzyme activity and the biomass content variable in addition the contaminant concentration variable is constrained by the initial amount of contaminant added to the environment at the beginning of the experiment the nr content is modelled as a damped harmonic oscillator the forcing of this oscillator accounts for all external factors not considered in the modelling process this is a central simplifying assumption aimed to minimize the number of variables in the system the biomass content is related to the nitrogen content the amount of metal in the environment affects the plant s roots and shoots linearly the amount of contaminant in the system remains fixed at all times an amount of metal is taken up directly by the roots and another percentage goes immediately to the shoots a portion of the contaminant not absorbed by the shoots is returned to the environment all of the model parameters are assumed positive these parameters are not directly measured from experimental data instead they are determined by solving an optimization problem in which the nr enzyme activity biomass content and contaminant content variables fit the data 4 results 4 1 mathematical model inspired by the experimental studies we establish a model to capture the relationship between contaminant uptake biomass content and nr enzyme activity the model is developed considering the simplifying assumptions previously established to simplify notation we denote the nr enzyme activity variable simply as n j t we also denote b j t as the biomass content t j t as the rate of change of the n j variable over time i e t j t d n j t d

initial conditions are determined by the experimental initial conditions in each of the different scenarios herein presented considering the last three equations we observe that 7 d m e d t t d m r d t t d m s d t t 0 implying that the amount of contaminant in the three compartments remains fixed at all times that is m e t m r t m s t n where n is the total amount of contaminant in the system we consider the proposed model under different parameter scenarios motivated by the experimental data under convenient parameter choices a mathematical model can make either quantitative or qualitative predictions we focus on quantitative predictions however we will show that the metal accumulation projections of our model might also be used to determine qualitative dynamics the parameters of each of the scenarios studied here were obtained by solving an optimization problem defined by a higher order interpolation of the experimental data the optimization problem was solved using the matlab fmincon function matlab 2017 in all of the scenarios shown here subjects a f in table 2 we calibrate the model parameters by considering the first five days subjects a b c and d or six days subjects e and f of the experimental data the remaining days of the experiment were used to validate the model s results since we aim to observe the effects of the contaminant in the system s dynamics we use the model to project more extended time dynamics after the experiment it is important to remark that since our model parameters are calibrated by data interpolation future experimental settings that provide more satisfactory time resolution can give a more accurate description of the system s dynamics in figs 2 7 we consider the dynamics of different experiments under cu contaminant levels each figure consists of a series of subfigures to describe the system s dynamics in the following way in subfigures a b e we observe the model calibration and validation periods in subfigures c d f we follow the projected long term 14 days dynamics of the model variables in all the subfigures the experimental data are shown in red and the model simulations are shown in blue in fig 2 we consider the dynamics of the control experiment subject a in this case no contaminant is added to the plant growing condition we observe a good resemblance between the experimental data and the model during the 7 day calibration and validation period in figs 2 a b we observe a slightly oscillatory behaviour of the data especially noticeable in the nr enzyme activity in the shoots further refinement in experimental settings may provide a more accurate description of oscillatory dynamics in figs 2 c d we observe the projected 14 days dynamics of activities in this control scenario we observe a tendency of the shoots biomass and nr enzyme activity to remain around healthy states in the case of the roots variables slight oscillations are observed around positive states that can also be considered healthy states of activity in both the shoots and the roots variables the preferred states in the long time projection of the model are consistent with the observed activities during the experiment in fig 2 e we observe a slight and almost insignificant increase in metal contaminant that might be naturally present in the environment and does not significantly affect the plant s dynamics fig 2 f shows a slight contaminant increase in the projected model dynamics overall the increase of the projected contaminant in both the roots and the shoots is less than 1 dw unit additionally in table 2 we notice that the parameters for the control experiment differ in several orders of magnitude compared to the rest of the experiments in which cu contaminant is added to the plant growing condition in figs 3 5 we consider the model dynamics under the addition of 50 μ m of cu to the plant growing conditions subject b c and d respectively there is a good resemblance between the experimental data and the model during the 7 day calibration and validation period in the three scenarios in figs 3 a b we observe a slightly oscillatory behaviour in the roots variables there is a more pronounced oscillatory behaviour in the shoots variables in the projected model dynamics we observe consistent oscillatory dynamics in the roots and a long term toxic effect in the shoots disrupting the shoots variables after day 8 nr enzyme activity or day 13 biomass content the concentration of the contaminant is mainly in the roots during the experiment and the long term projection the model cu concentration in the roots reaches around 140 dw units 150 dw units in the data at the end of the experiment and about 220 dw units at the end of the projected time the model cu concentration in the shoots reaches around 90 dw units 80 dw units in the data at the end of the experiment and around 140 dw units at the end of the projected time in fig 4 we observe different model projections compared to fig 3 there are oscillatory dynamics for both the roots and the shoots variables during the experiment during the projected longer time dynamics of the system the variables remain near slightly decreased positive activity states in the shoots variables there is projected a slight and slow decrease in both variables the preferred states of each variable are consistent with the activity during the experiment thus in this case there is no disruption of the activity in the shoots but rather a slight decrease in its variables additionally the contaminant is mainly absorbed in the roots the cu concentration in the roots reaches around 160 dw units 150 dw units in the data at the end of the experiment and around 240 dw units at the end of the projected time the cu concentration in the shoots reaches around 85 dw units 85 dw units in the data at the end of the experiment and around 130 dw units at the end of the projected time in figs 5 a d we observe a medium oscillatory behaviour of the variables the long term projections show no significant change in the variables compared to the experiment there is a long tendency to maintain positive healthy states the concentration of the contaminant is mainly in the roots during the experiment and the projected activity the cu concentration in the roots reaches around 140 dw units at the end of the experiment slightly different from the 160 dw units in the data and approximately 220 dw units at the end of the projected time the cu concentration in the shoots reaches around 80 dw units at the end of the experiment and around 130 dw units at the end of the projected time in the overall analysis of figs 3 5 we found that the activity shown is consistent with the roots ability to absorb contaminants facing the possibility fig 3 of a longer time toxic effect in the shoots these three scenarios support the viability of the plant to be used in copper contaminated areas moreover there is a consistent metal accumulation in the proposed model in the three cases at the end of the experiment the model contaminant concentration in the roots ranges from 140 to 160 dw units and from 220 to 240 dw units for the long time projected dynamics on the other hand the model contaminant concentration in the shoots ranges from 80 to 90 dw units at the end of the experiment and from 130 to 140 dw for the long time projected dynamics figs 6 7 consider the model dynamics under 500 μ m of cu added to the plant growing condition subjects e and f respectively the resemblance between the experimental data and the model during the 7 day calibration validation period is reasonable in the two cases in fig 6 we observe a slightly oscillatory behaviour with a tendency to decrease over time during the experiment the only exception is the shoots biomass content that remains near a diminished activity state the long term model dynamics show a consistent toxic effect and an activity decrease as time evolves such reduction is oscillatory in the roots variables in addition the nr enzyme activity in the shoots has the most significant activity decrease over time the biomass content in the shoots is projected to stay near a stable state similar to the experiment the metal concentration in the roots reaches around 360 dw units at the end of the experiment slightly different from the 330 dw units in the data and approximately 450 dw units at the end of the projected time the metal concentration in the shoots reaches around 200 dw units 180 dw units in the data at the end of the experiment and around 390 dw units at the end of the projected time in fig 7 we observe oscillatory dynamics of the data during the experiment with a tendency to decrease over time the projected activities in the roots variables show a significant decrease tending to disrupt the nr enzyme activity and the biomass content on the other hand the projected activities in the shoots variables show oscillatory components tending to disrupt activity around day 14 the metal concentration in the roots reaches around 390 dw units 360 dw units in the data at the end of the experiment and around 480 dw units at the end of the projected time the metal concentration in the shoots reaches around 200 dw units 200 dw units in the data at the end of the experiment and around 390 dw units at the end of the projected time in the analysis of figs 6 7 our results show that the projected dynamics are consistent with the roots ability to absorb contaminants facing either a decrease in the shoots variables or disruption of activities these scenarios also support the viability of the model plant to be used in copper contaminated areas at the end of the experiment the model contaminant concentration in the roots is around 360 dw units and ranges from 450 to 480 dw units for the projected dynamics on the other hand the model contaminant concentration in the shoots lies around 200 dw units at the end of the experiment and around 390 dw units for the long time projected dynamics in conclusion there is a toxic effect in both of these scenarios due to the contaminant however the time scale in which this harmful effect is present is slow which provides a solid indication and plausible theoretical and modelling justification of the model plant to serve as an indicator species as a final model analysis we observe that the data and model dynamics are consistent during the first 7 days the ranges of metal accumulation at the end of the experiment and the end of the long time projections remain consistent for the different scenarios in each of the cases considered moreover when analysing the parameter values in table 2 we observe that the parameters related to the contaminant uptake e g e r e s r 1 r 2 and r 3 lie in similar ranges in particular the contaminant uptake rate in the roots r 1 the contaminant uptake rate in the shoots r 2 and the contaminant return rate to the environment r 3 are nearly identical in each of the cases considered last three rows in table 2 the long time tendency of the system s variables i e the equilibrium solutions is dependent on the different model parameters as is detailed in the appendix here and motivated by our previous results we analyse the contaminant s toxic effect in the shoots activities fig 8 establishes a model scenario under an in silica experimental setting in our results we obtain that the long term tendency of the shoots nr enzyme activity and biomass content is determined by three factors the environmental factors the amount of contaminant and the absorption rates in the shoots in particular the longer time tendency of the system is established by the following relationships 8 n s d s e s n a s and 9 b s α s d s e s n β s a s where n s is the projected nr enzyme activity in the shoots and b s is the projected biomass content in the shoots as shown in fig 8 strategic harvesting can be planned from the previous relationships as the variables can provide a plausible scenario for the amount of contaminants in the environment and a theoretically proposed uptake rate in particular a minimum harvesting time can also be established especially contemplating a framework in which the contaminant concentration in the environment is unknown 4 2 parameter sensitivity analysis sensitivity analysis serves to quantify how important each parameter is to each model variable sensitivity analysis is used to measure the effects of uncertainties on both the model s input and output this mathematical tool can help create more accurate models by identifying key parameters that predominantly affect the model dynamics in this case the normalized forward sensitivity index can measure the output variable s relative change regarding a change in a chosen input parameter the normalized forward sensitivity index is defined in arriola and hyman 2009 as 10 s u p lim δ p 0 δ u u δ p p 1 p u u p where u is a model variable and p is a fixed model parameter we are interested in quantifying which parameters influence the equilibrium solution most as the stability of such an equilibrium solution is well understood therefore we now measure the normalized sensitivity index of the biomass content and the nr enzyme activity in both the shoots and the roots to better understand the critical model dynamics in table 3 we show the non trivial sensitivity indexes of our model the most sensible parameters on the shoots biomass variable are the constant environmental forcing term and the nr influence on the biomass change rate in particular increasing d s or α s by 10 implies modifying the shoots biomass asymptotic tendency by more than 10 as the sensitivity is greater than 1 in the same way increasing d s by 10 implies modifying the shoots nr enzyme activity by more than 10 also we observe that changing the shoots contaminant influence rate e s by 10 implies modifying the shoots nr enzyme activity by less than 10 as the sensitivity index is smaller than 1 5 discussion in the present study we proposed a novel mathematical model providing a setting to relate the nitrogen assimilatory enzyme activity and the biomass content to contaminant levels the model parameters are calibrated and validated by experimental data to make the model biologically more plausible furthermore different scenarios were considered to model contaminant induced stress in the model plant in this work we have shown the suitability of c album to be considered in contaminated areas through mathematical modelling and numerical simulation our results show a tendency of the roots to maintain healthy levels of activity despite the presence of high levels of cu this roots characteristic has provided the ability of the model plant to survive in sewage sludge lagoons indeed in akpinar 2021 chenopodium album l was observed naturally established in such an environment different studies have analysed the plausibility of c album for remediation of contaminated soil notably in mohan et al 2019 the model plant removed heavy metals from the ground through a phytoremediation process in bhargava et al 2007 there was an extensive study investigating the plausibility of chenopodium spp to endure six heavy metal contaminants the abovementioned study established scientific evidence of c album being a good copper accumulator it was also suggested that the metal accumulation effectiveness of chenopodium spp made it a suitable choice for phytoextraction in both of the previous studies the assessment of metal uptake was made through different experimental settings in comparison our results of the experimental settings are supported through the evolution of the main model variables over time this suggests that the ability of c album shown in the experimental data to concentrate heavy metals in the roots and the shoots can also be maintained for longer times tozser et al 2019 analysed metal uptakes in c album in this study it was suggested that to achieve efficiency in the remediation process it is necessary to remove the plant organs lying above the ground once the contaminant is accumulated our model could potentially provide a theoretical strategy for such a removal process indeed the removal process could be established as an optimization problem based on an estimated amount of contaminant in the soil different studies have also assessed the ability of c album to be suitable for phytoextraction of lead alipour et al 2015 phytoextraction of different metals gupta and sinha 2007 and phytoremediation of cadmium from the soil zulfiqar et al 2012 and they have obtained promising results additionally we observe that the relevant contaminants previously mentioned have similar equivalence cu 2 cd 2 among others therefore mathematical modelling considering different contaminants with similar equivalence can provide information about the plausible long term plant dynamics under various heavy metal contaminants in this case our model provided theoretical evidence of the capability of the model plant to maintain functional dynamics in the roots under cu induced stress our results show that increasing contaminant concentrations mainly affect the shoot activities and toxic effects can be observed another important observation of the model is that there is root capability to absorb the contaminant initially however as time increases the shoots have a slower tendency to absorb contaminants as is shown in fig 8 the slower trend of the shoots to assimilate contaminants is severely affected by the concentration in the system in particular as contaminant concentration increments the activity in the shoots tends to be disrupted thus being exposed to higher contaminant levels implies a higher absorption of contaminant and quicker disruption of healthy dynamics therefore under the scenario shown in fig 8 our model can potentially establish a harvesting strategy dependent on the environmental dynamics a mathematical model is always improvable thus future work can be directed to improve some of the model s limitations a main future goal is to relate the shoots and the roots dynamics here considered independent by coupling the corresponding variables however this can potentially increase the model s complexity and ability to relate to experimental observations therefore this modification needs to be carefully established to combine a more realistic model without losing the model s tractability and ability to relate to the experimental data also further inclusion of plant features such as chlorophyll contents and total proteins content needs to be addressed in future modelling our sensitivity analysis also shows that the model is sensitive to modifying the parameters d s α s d r and α r therefore even though our model can correctly capture the contaminant dynamics and its accumulation in the shoots and roots our simple model needs to be improved to consider more realistic complex internal processes in the plant s dynamics 6 conclusions in this work we established a mathematical model to support the suitability of the model plant chenopodium album l to be used in contaminated areas here we provided a model for the nitrogen assimilatory enzyme activity the biomass content and the contaminant concentration in the plant as far as the authors know there is no similar existent model our numerical model simulation results provided qualitatively similar activities compared to the experimental data indeed the main goal of the model was to give a qualitative description of the main variables and long term projections of their dynamics in these long term projections we observed a consistent tendency of maintaining normal or diminished activities of the main variables depending on the contaminant induced stress we observed a plausible tendency to disrupt regular shoots dynamics whereas a consistent trend to maintain normal roots dynamics moreover we observed a consistent and longer term tendency to absorb more significant amounts of contaminants in the roots even though our main goal was to provide a qualitative description of the main variables our results can potentially be used to describe quantitative features of the main variables e g the amount of metal accumulation in the plant due to their ability to resemble the experimental data therefore this model provides scientific progress related to quantifiable plant dynamics related to contaminant accumulation and provides the basis for further experimental observations our theoretical results provided expressions for the long term dynamics in the shoots variables this complements the analysis developed in the manuscript and it is a straightforward way to analyse the long term dynamics of the system also our sensitivity analysis provided information about some of the model s limitations and further directions for the mathematical improvement of the model our mathematical model complemented experimental studies performed under copper induced stress of chenopodium album and provided the foundation of main variables to be analysed in future experimental settings in this way both experimental studies and mathematical modelling can provide complementary information that supports biological hypotheses future research opportunities can be directed towards incorporating more biological variables of the model increasing model complexity and comparing model performance under different heavy metal contaminants there is a need for continuing efforts to join both theoretical and experimental designs to establish further scientific advances to address the problem of heavy metal contamination in the environment multidisciplinary research teams need to continue working on this direction as it has successfully shown that better results can be achieved than solely theoretical or experimental approaches credit authorship contribution statement laura r gonzález ramírez conceptualization methodology investigation formal analysis writing

24432,heavy metal contamination of the soil is a global problem that produces different harmful effects from an environmental and public health perspective although there have been numerous efforts to solve this problem there is no precise methodology to decontaminate heavy metal polluted soils one of the strategies to develop such methods relies on mathematical modelling pursuing this goal we propose a novel mathematical compartmental model consisting of a linear system of differential equations to address the suitability of the model plant chenopodium album l for the remediation of contaminated areas such as sewage sludge lagoons our results show a tendency to maintain high concentrations of copper cu in the roots with the possibility of continuing with good plants dynamics moreover the model theoretically proposes contaminant concentration in the plants shoots and roots and predicts a more prolonged tendency to accumulate copper concentrations in the shoots and disrupt the shoots dynamics these results provide complementary support for the suitability of this model plant to be used in contaminated areas in addition we present asymptotic tendencies of the plants biomass content and nitrogen assimilatory nitrate reductase nr enzyme activity in this way we project the relationship between contaminant accumulation and plants measurements these projections are essential as they can potentially be used for optimization purposes and strategic harvesting planning finally we present a parameter sensitivity analysis to complement the model examination keywords mathematical modelling chenopodium album l copper induced stress sewage sludge lagoons metal contamination remediation 1 introduction heavy metal contamination produces harmful effects on plant development and it is also an environmental threat of great magnitude for all living beings growth inhibition is the most common change observed in plants exposed to high heavy metal s concentrations prasad 2004 in gajewska and sklodowska 2010 the authors stated that the primary plant part interacting with heavy metals is the root system therefore the decrease in growth is observed more clearly in the roots than in the shoots heavy metals are taken into the cell through the roots nutrient uptake pathways consequently heavy metals may compete with essential elements plant absorption therefore the inability of the plant to absorb crucial nutrients may cause harmful effects on cellular structures primary metabolism and transport processes boojar and goodarzi 2007 nedjimi and daoud 2009 sharma and dietz 2009 nitrogen is one of the main structural components of the plant and constitutes 1 5 2 of the dry weight of the plant frink et al 1999 therefore it is crucial to infer nitrogen concentration in plants through different measurements plants usually take up nitrogen as nitrate no 3 in order to fulfil the essential metabolic functions nitrate taken by the roots must first be reduced to nitrite and then to ammonia nitrate reductase nr and nitrite reductase nir enzymes actively reduce nitrate to ammonia in particular nr is one of the most important enzymes to infer the predominant form of nitrogen in plants marschner 1995 solanki and dhankhar 2011 nr is highly sensitive to the presence of nitrates for this reason it is suggested that nr activity reflects the nitrate content of the habitat where the plant is located lee and stewart 1978 indeed nr activity is accepted in ecological studies as an indicator of nitrate presence gebauer et al 1988 olsson and falkengren grerup 2003 nir enzyme comes into play when nr enzyme converts nitrogen in nitrate form to nitrite in particular nir is responsible for the reduction of nitrite to ammonia with the assimilation of ammonia that occurs as a result of nitrogen fixation the nitrogen source needed by the plants is converted to glutamine and glutamate by specific reactions and amino acids and protein compounds are formed from these molecules zheng xun et al 2007 moschou et al 2012 scientific evidence shows adverse effects of increased heavy metal concentration in the growing environment plant development and water malec et al 2008 2009 due to this fact various physiological biochemical and molecular markers have been established to determine the effects of heavy metal contamination malec et al 2008 2009 maleva et al 2009 wan et al 2011 kumar et al 2012 in this work we are particularly interested in alterations from these markers under cu contamination some of the adverse effects on plants due to cu pollution have already been established for example the change in the plant s nr activity is a consequence of the decrease in the plant s nitrate uptake due to copper pollution llorens et al 2000 xiong et al 2006 in addition a reduction in nr enzyme activity may also occur due to the tendency of reactive cu ions to bind to the sulfhydryl compounds sh contained in the nr enzyme this state causes structural deterioration of the nr enzyme resulting in irreversible consequences similarly the nr enzyme may deteriorate structurally as a result of low molybdenum mo intake from micronutrients due to high cu concentrations specifically mo is a cofactor in the structure of nr and its insufficient uptake reduces nr enzyme activity phytoremediation which is also called a green solution has a strategic potential to address the heavy metal pollution problem in the environment and it has been implemented worldwide swaileh et al 2004 zeidler 2005 gonzález and gonzález chávez 2006 ali et al 2013 phytoremediation aims to reduce the contaminant concentrations or toxic effects in the environment by using heavy metal tolerant plants and related soil bacteria greipsoon 2011 rajkumar et al 2013 scientific studies have shown that some plants such as chenopodium album l can survive in sewage sludge lagoons akpinar 2021 or heavy metal contaminated areas mohan et al 2019 bhargava et al 2007 tozser et al 2019 alipour et al 2015 zulfiqar et al 2012 gupta and sinha 2007 therefore chenopodium album l is a candidate for monitoring heavy metal pollution in degraded areas biomonitoring and phytoremediation of heavy metals in contaminated sites hand in hand studies of theoretical and experimental researchers play a significant role in unveiling the underlying working principles of biological mechanisms mathematical modelling is the primary tool used in theoretical studies this approach provides a multidisciplinary framework for complementing supporting and producing new experimental settings of a system s dynamics a mathematical model can potentially project a system s long term behaviour under different physical constraints on the one hand a specialized model can include specific factors and relationships of the system at the cost of increasing the complexity of the model and hence limiting the incorporation of experimental data on the other hand a less complex mathematical model so called a toy model can attenuate this complexity at the cost of missing specific features of the system a toy model is primarily used for understanding the big picture more than the details therefore a possible approach in mathematical modelling is to incorporate a minimum set of system features without losing the model tractability of the main variables additionally one of the options when establishing a mathematical modelling strategy is to develop a compartmental model the basis of compartmental models is to divide the system into multiple compartments to be analysed independently which is supported by the so called modular plant architecture approach however the meristematic nature of plants restricts the assertiveness of this approach cheeseman et al 1996 this is because there is no exact distinction between a root and a shoot compartment in an actual plant nevertheless this simplifying assumption can build up basic models to extract a set of the main dynamics that can be further refined later in particular a linear mathematical model provides a simple scenario to investigate the otherwise complex dynamics of a system various mathematical models have been proposed to investigate and optimize phytoremediation techniques we found a model for the phytoremediation of petroleum contaminated soil thoma et al 2003 an optimization model to comply with environmental criteria thomas and vandemuelebroeke 2005 a model for the accumulation of heavy metals in benthic algae seip 1979 among many others cârdei et al 2021 d acunto et al 2019 torres bejarano et al 2019 tantemsapya et al 2011 tawfiq and wirojanagud 2016 we also found a heuristic mathematical model to assess a contamination level or plan a harvesting strategy in these models however as far as the authors know there is currently no mathematical model relating both the nr enzyme activity and the biomass content to the accumulation of contaminants in a plant we propose that incorporating these feature dynamics into a mathematical model is crucial therefore this approach relates contaminant accumulation to measurable experimental quantities intrinsic to the plant s dynamics the model here developed aims to theoretically support the plausibility of the model plant to be used in a copper contaminated environment by relating the model to experimental data this work shows different scenarios of the main variables under copper induced stress furthermore our results provide model plants consistent features with qualities observed in indicator species in addition our mathematical model assesses and predicts the nr enzyme activity biomass content and contaminant level in each of the plant s compartments as time evolves the work in this manuscript is developed as follows in section 2 we establish the experimental analysis of chenopodium album l under copper induced stress section 3 sets the biological and mathematical fundaments that support our mathematical model section 4 establishes the mathematical model and analyzes different scenarios of the model plant under copper induced stress our model parameters are calibrated and validated by the experimental data using these parameters we provide longer time projections of the variables in addition to our forecasts we provide asymptotic dynamics of the model s main variables including information about the system s more extended time dynamics in section 4 we also provide parameter sensitivity analysis to address the model components and complement our mathematical analysis finally in section 5 we discuss some of the model s implications and limitations and in section 6 we establish our conclusions and future work to be developed 2 materials and methods chenopodium album l which is seen to grow naturally in sewage sludge lagoons akpinar 2021 was chosen as the model plant in this study uniform seedlings belonging to the c album were collected from their natural environments in turkey s bursa province they were exposed to different concentrations of cu 0 μ m control 50 μ m and 500 μ m plants were harvested on the 1st 3rd and 7th days after the cu treatments then they were washed thoroughly with de ionized water and the roots and shoots were separated leaves stems the nr enzyme activity was immediately analysed in fresh plant material nr in the fresh roots and shoots was determined according to the in vivo test described by hageman and hucklesby 1971 jaworski 1971 and modified by gebauer et al 1984 this spectrophotometric method is based on measuring the absorbance of nitrite no 2 formed by the nitrate reduction in the incubation medium nr μ m no 2 g 1 dw h 1 was calculated using the absorption value on a dry weight dw basis dry biomass was measured after oven drying plant materials at 80 c until constant weight the biomass of roots and shoots was also measured on a dw basis the same method indicated in akpinar 2021 was used to determine cu accumulation in plant parts 3 theory in this section we provide the theory that supports the development of our mathematical model to begin we design a compartmental setting the compartments are determined by the environment e the roots r and the shoots s as is described in fig 1 we aim to incorporate the dynamics of a metal contaminant into each of these compartments in a simplified setting therefore we assume that the independent compartments are only affected by the metal contaminant we establish a linear system of 9 first order differential equations with 13 free parameters that describe different plant dynamics although we greatly simplify the biological process by considering a simple linear model we remain with the challenge of determining a plausible range for the model parameters to study the effect of copper pollution on the model plant therefore we determine the parameters of our mathematical model by the experimental data described in section 2 this provides a setting in which we theoretically explore the suitability of the model plant chenopodium album l to be used in contaminated areas and assess the plant s contaminant concentration our main variables are determined by the biomass and the nitrogen assimilatory enzyme nr activities the latter measurement indirectly provides information about the plant s nitrogen n indeed as previously mentioned nr has been established as one of the most important enzymes to determine the predominant form of nitrogen in plants in addition the dynamics of the nitrogen content and the nr enzyme activity had been successfully modelled as oscillatory in higher plants yang and midmore 2005 alluding to circadian oscillations therefore we propose an initial model of nr enzyme activity described by a second order constantly forced damped harmonic oscillator strogatz 2015 to simplify the model simulations we transform the second order differential equation into two first order differential equations that is we consider 1 d n r d t t d t d t d b t a n r where t d n r d t is the rate of change of nr enzyme activity and a b c are constants such that a 0 b 0 and d 0 we propose that the rate of change in nitrogen content nc is proportional to the rate of change in nitrate reductase enzyme activity 2 d n c d t k 1 d n r d t for some constant k 1 0 furthermore we propose that the biomass b content is determined by the dynamics of the nitrogen content which is directly related to the amount of the nr enzyme in each compartment specifically we propose that the biomass is determined by the difference between the amount of nitrogen and the decaying growth verkroost and wassen 2005 that is 3 d b d t k 2 n c k 3 b for some constants k 2 0 and k 3 0 since we are primarily concerned with the nr enzyme activity we combine eqs 2 and 3 and we propose the equation 4 d b d t k 1 n r k 2 b for some positive constants k 1 and k 2 the contaminant dynamics of the model are motivated by the work of thomas and vandemuelebroeke 2005 a mathematical model is established in the abovementioned work to optimize harvesting strategies for metal phytoremediation however compared to thomas and vandemuelebroeke 2005 we directly relate the contaminant accumulation to the plant s intrinsic dynamics finally we assume that the metal accumulation directly affects the nitrogen content as a negative linear forcing term that is we propose the following equation to describe the amount of the nr enzyme content under copper induced stress 5 d n r d t t d t d t d b t a n r e m where m is the amount of metal absorbed by the plant and e is the uptake rate of the contaminant we limit our analysis to the previously described features in the present model a future version of the model should include different elements such as carbon dynamics as carbon is one of the plants essential structural components an additional model description including specific information about water content photosynthetic activity temperature humidity ph among others should also be addressed in the future the main assumptions and variables of the model are summarized as follows the model establishes two independent compartments of the plant determined by the plant roots and shoots that are independently affected by the contaminant there is an additional compartment determined by the plant growing conditions which are simplified and described as the environment we exclude the intrinsic dynamics of the environment we assume that a single contaminant dose is initially added to the environment the main variables of the model are the nr enzyme activity biomass content and contaminant concentration in both the roots and the shoots the experimental data constrains the nr enzyme activity and the biomass content variable in addition the contaminant concentration variable is constrained by the initial amount of contaminant added to the environment at the beginning of the experiment the nr content is modelled as a damped harmonic oscillator the forcing of this oscillator accounts for all external factors not considered in the modelling process this is a central simplifying assumption aimed to minimize the number of variables in the system the biomass content is related to the nitrogen content the amount of metal in the environment affects the plant s roots and shoots linearly the amount of contaminant in the system remains fixed at all times an amount of metal is taken up directly by the roots and another percentage goes immediately to the shoots a portion of the contaminant not absorbed by the shoots is returned to the environment all of the model parameters are assumed positive these parameters are not directly measured from experimental data instead they are determined by solving an optimization problem in which the nr enzyme activity biomass content and contaminant content variables fit the data 4 results 4 1 mathematical model inspired by the experimental studies we establish a model to capture the relationship between contaminant uptake biomass content and nr enzyme activity the model is developed considering the simplifying assumptions previously established to simplify notation we denote the nr enzyme activity variable simply as n j t we also denote b j t as the biomass content t j t as the rate of change of the n j variable over time i e t j t d n j t d t and m j t as the amount of contaminant all of the previous variables are evaluated at time t and the subscripts j r s e denote the different compartments r roots s shoots and e environment the time is measured in days all of the parameters are assumed positive and their biological significance is described in table 1 the proposed model is 6 d n r d t t r d t r d t d r b r t r a r n r e r m r d b

initial conditions are determined by the experimental initial conditions in each of the different scenarios herein presented considering the last three equations we observe that 7 d m e d t t d m r d t t d m s d t t 0 implying that the amount of contaminant in the three compartments remains fixed at all times that is m e t m r t m s t n where n is the total amount of contaminant in the system we consider the proposed model under different parameter scenarios motivated by the experimental data under convenient parameter choices a mathematical model can make either quantitative or qualitative predictions we focus on quantitative predictions however we will show that the metal accumulation projections of our model might also be used to determine qualitative dynamics the parameters of each of the scenarios studied here were obtained by solving an optimization problem defined by a higher order interpolation of the experimental data the optimization problem was solved using the matlab fmincon function matlab 2017 in all of the scenarios shown here subjects a f in table 2 we calibrate the model parameters by considering the first five days subjects a b c and d or six days subjects e and f of the experimental data the remaining days of the experiment were used to validate the model s results since we aim to observe the effects of the contaminant in the system s dynamics we use the model to project more extended time dynamics after the experiment it is important to remark that since our model parameters are calibrated by data interpolation future experimental settings that provide more satisfactory time resolution can give a more accurate description of the system s dynamics in figs 2 7 we consider the dynamics of different experiments under cu contaminant levels each figure consists of a series of subfigures to describe the system s dynamics in the following way in subfigures a b e we observe the model calibration and validation periods in subfigures c d f we follow the projected long term 14 days dynamics of the model variables in all the subfigures the experimental data are shown in red and the model simulations are shown in blue in fig 2 we consider the dynamics of the control experiment subject a in this case no contaminant is added to the plant growing condition we observe a good resemblance between the experimental data and the model during the 7 day calibration and validation period in figs 2 a b we observe a slightly oscillatory behaviour of the data especially noticeable in the nr enzyme activity in the shoots further refinement in experimental settings may provide a more accurate description of oscillatory dynamics in figs 2 c d we observe the projected 14 days dynamics of activities in this control scenario we observe a tendency of the shoots biomass and nr enzyme activity to remain around healthy states in the case of the roots variables slight oscillations are observed around positive states that can also be considered healthy states of activity in both the shoots and the roots variables the preferred states in the long time projection of the model are consistent with the observed activities during the experiment in fig 2 e we observe a slight and almost insignificant increase in metal contaminant that might be naturally present in the environment and does not significantly affect the plant s dynamics fig 2 f shows a slight contaminant increase in the projected model dynamics overall the increase of the projected contaminant in both the roots and the shoots is less than 1 dw unit additionally in table 2 we notice that the parameters for the control experiment differ in several orders of magnitude compared to the rest of the experiments in which cu contaminant is added to the plant growing condition in figs 3 5 we consider the model dynamics under the addition of 50 μ m of cu to the plant growing conditions subject b c and d respectively there is a good resemblance between the experimental data and the model during the 7 day calibration and validation period in the three scenarios in figs 3 a b we observe a slightly oscillatory behaviour in the roots variables there is a more pronounced oscillatory behaviour in the shoots variables in the projected model dynamics we observe consistent oscillatory dynamics in the roots and a long term toxic effect in the shoots disrupting the shoots variables after day 8 nr enzyme activity or day 13 biomass content the concentration of the contaminant is mainly in the roots during the experiment and the long term projection the model cu concentration in the roots reaches around 140 dw units 150 dw units in the data at the end of the experiment and about 220 dw units at the end of the projected time the model cu concentration in the shoots reaches around 90 dw units 80 dw units in the data at the end of the experiment and around 140 dw units at the end of the projected time in fig 4 we observe different model projections compared to fig 3 there are oscillatory dynamics for both the roots and the shoots variables during the experiment during the projected longer time dynamics of the system the variables remain near slightly decreased positive activity states in the shoots variables there is projected a slight and slow decrease in both variables the preferred states of each variable are consistent with the activity during the experiment thus in this case there is no disruption of the activity in the shoots but rather a slight decrease in its variables additionally the contaminant is mainly absorbed in the roots the cu concentration in the roots reaches around 160 dw units 150 dw units in the data at the end of the experiment and around 240 dw units at the end of the projected time the cu concentration in the shoots reaches around 85 dw units 85 dw units in the data at the end of the experiment and around 130 dw units at the end of the projected time in figs 5 a d we observe a medium oscillatory behaviour of the variables the long term projections show no significant change in the variables compared to the experiment there is a long tendency to maintain positive healthy states the concentration of the contaminant is mainly in the roots during the experiment and the projected activity the cu concentration in the roots reaches around 140 dw units at the end of the experiment slightly different from the 160 dw units in the data and approximately 220 dw units at the end of the projected time the cu concentration in the shoots reaches around 80 dw units at the end of the experiment and around 130 dw units at the end of the projected time in the overall analysis of figs 3 5 we found that the activity shown is consistent with the roots ability to absorb contaminants facing the possibility fig 3 of a longer time toxic effect in the shoots these three scenarios support the viability of the plant to be used in copper contaminated areas moreover there is a consistent metal accumulation in the proposed model in the three cases at the end of the experiment the model contaminant concentration in the roots ranges from 140 to 160 dw units and from 220 to 240 dw units for the long time projected dynamics on the other hand the model contaminant concentration in the shoots ranges from 80 to 90 dw units at the end of the experiment and from 130 to 140 dw for the long time projected dynamics figs 6 7 consider the model dynamics under 500 μ m of cu added to the plant growing condition subjects e and f respectively the resemblance between the experimental data and the model during the 7 day calibration validation period is reasonable in the two cases in fig 6 we observe a slightly oscillatory behaviour with a tendency to decrease over time during the experiment the only exception is the shoots biomass content that remains near a diminished activity state the long term model dynamics show a consistent toxic effect and an activity decrease as time evolves such reduction is oscillatory in the roots variables in addition the nr enzyme activity in the shoots has the most significant activity decrease over time the biomass content in the shoots is projected to stay near a stable state similar to the experiment the metal concentration in the roots reaches around 360 dw units at the end of the experiment slightly different from the 330 dw units in the data and approximately 450 dw units at the end of the projected time the metal concentration in the shoots reaches around 200 dw units 180 dw units in the data at the end of the experiment and around 390 dw units at the end of the projected time in fig 7 we observe oscillatory dynamics of the data during the experiment with a tendency to decrease over time the projected activities in the roots variables show a significant decrease tending to disrupt the nr enzyme activity and the biomass content on the other hand the projected activities in the shoots variables show oscillatory components tending to disrupt activity around day 14 the metal concentration in the roots reaches around 390 dw units 360 dw units in the data at the end of the experiment and around 480 dw units at the end of the projected time the metal concentration in the shoots reaches around 200 dw units 200 dw units in the data at the end of the experiment and around 390 dw units at the end of the projected time in the analysis of figs 6 7 our results show that the projected dynamics are consistent with the roots ability to absorb contaminants facing either a decrease in the shoots variables or disruption of activities these scenarios also support the viability of the model plant to be used in copper contaminated areas at the end of the experiment the model contaminant concentration in the roots is around 360 dw units and ranges from 450 to 480 dw units for the projected dynamics on the other hand the model contaminant concentration in the shoots lies around 200 dw units at the end of the experiment and around 390 dw units for the long time projected dynamics in conclusion there is a toxic effect in both of these scenarios due to the contaminant however the time scale in which this harmful effect is present is slow which provides a solid indication and plausible theoretical and modelling justification of the model plant to serve as an indicator species as a final model analysis we observe that the data and model dynamics are consistent during the first 7 days the ranges of metal accumulation at the end of the experiment and the end of the long time projections remain consistent for the different scenarios in each of the cases considered moreover when analysing the parameter values in table 2 we observe that the parameters related to the contaminant uptake e g e r e s r 1 r 2 and r 3 lie in similar ranges in particular the contaminant uptake rate in the roots r 1 the contaminant uptake rate in the shoots r 2 and the contaminant return rate to the environment r 3 are nearly identical in each of the cases considered last three rows in table 2 the long time tendency of the system s variables i e the equilibrium solutions is dependent on the different model parameters as is detailed in the appendix here and motivated by our previous results we analyse the contaminant s toxic effect in the shoots activities fig 8 establishes a model scenario under an in silica experimental setting in our results we obtain that the long term tendency of the shoots nr enzyme activity and biomass content is determined by three factors the environmental factors the amount of contaminant and the absorption rates in the shoots in particular the longer time tendency of the system is established by the following relationships 8 n s d s e s n a s and 9 b s α s d s e s n β s a s where n s is the projected nr enzyme activity in the shoots and b s is the projected biomass content in the shoots as shown in fig 8 strategic harvesting can be planned from the previous relationships as the variables can provide a plausible scenario for the amount of contaminants in the environment and a theoretically proposed uptake rate in particular a minimum harvesting time can also be established especially contemplating a framework in which the contaminant concentration in the environment is unknown 4 2 parameter sensitivity analysis sensitivity analysis serves to quantify how important each parameter is to each model variable sensitivity analysis is used to measure the effects of uncertainties on both the model s input and output this mathematical tool can help create more accurate models by identifying key parameters that predominantly affect the model dynamics in this case the normalized forward sensitivity index can measure the output variable s relative change regarding a change in a chosen input parameter the normalized forward sensitivity index is defined in arriola and hyman 2009 as 10 s u p lim δ p 0 δ u u δ p p 1 p u u p where u is a model variable and p is a fixed model parameter we are interested in quantifying which parameters influence the equilibrium solution most as the stability of such an equilibrium solution is well understood therefore we now measure the normalized sensitivity index of the biomass content and the nr enzyme activity in both the shoots and the roots to better understand the critical model dynamics in table 3 we show the non trivial sensitivity indexes of our model the most sensible parameters on the shoots biomass variable are the constant environmental forcing term and the nr influence on the biomass change rate in particular increasing d s or α s by 10 implies modifying the shoots biomass asymptotic tendency by more than 10 as the sensitivity is greater than 1 in the same way increasing d s by 10 implies modifying the shoots nr enzyme activity by more than 10 also we observe that changing the shoots contaminant influence rate e s by 10 implies modifying the shoots nr enzyme activity by less than 10 as the sensitivity index is smaller than 1 5 discussion in the present study we proposed a novel mathematical model providing a setting to relate the nitrogen assimilatory enzyme activity and the biomass content to contaminant levels the model parameters are calibrated and validated by experimental data to make the model biologically more plausible furthermore different scenarios were considered to model contaminant induced stress in the model plant in this work we have shown the suitability of c album to be considered in contaminated areas through mathematical modelling and numerical simulation our results show a tendency of the roots to maintain healthy levels of activity despite the presence of high levels of cu this roots characteristic has provided the ability of the model plant to survive in sewage sludge lagoons indeed in akpinar 2021 chenopodium album l was observed naturally established in such an environment different studies have analysed the plausibility of c album for remediation of contaminated soil notably in mohan et al 2019 the model plant removed heavy metals from the ground through a phytoremediation process in bhargava et al 2007 there was an extensive study investigating the plausibility of chenopodium spp to endure six heavy metal contaminants the abovementioned study established scientific evidence of c album being a good copper accumulator it was also suggested that the metal accumulation effectiveness of chenopodium spp made it a suitable choice for phytoextraction in both of the previous studies the assessment of metal uptake was made through different experimental settings in comparison our results of the experimental settings are supported through the evolution of the main model variables over time this suggests that the ability of c album shown in the experimental data to concentrate heavy metals in the roots and the shoots can also be maintained for longer times tozser et al 2019 analysed metal uptakes in c album in this study it was suggested that to achieve efficiency in the remediation process it is necessary to remove the plant organs lying above the ground once the contaminant is accumulated our model could potentially provide a theoretical strategy for such a removal process indeed the removal process could be established as an optimization problem based on an estimated amount of contaminant in the soil different studies have also assessed the ability of c album to be suitable for phytoextraction of lead alipour et al 2015 phytoextraction of different metals gupta and sinha 2007 and phytoremediation of cadmium from the soil zulfiqar et al 2012 and they have obtained promising results additionally we observe that the relevant contaminants previously mentioned have similar equivalence cu 2 cd 2 among others therefore mathematical modelling considering different contaminants with similar equivalence can provide information about the plausible long term plant dynamics under various heavy metal contaminants in this case our model provided theoretical evidence of the capability of the model plant to maintain functional dynamics in the roots under cu induced stress our results show that increasing contaminant concentrations mainly affect the shoot activities and toxic effects can be observed another important observation of the model is that there is root capability to absorb the contaminant initially however as time increases the shoots have a slower tendency to absorb contaminants as is shown in fig 8 the slower trend of the shoots to assimilate contaminants is severely affected by the concentration in the system in particular as contaminant concentration increments the activity in the shoots tends to be disrupted thus being exposed to higher contaminant levels implies a higher absorption of contaminant and quicker disruption of healthy dynamics therefore under the scenario shown in fig 8 our model can potentially establish a harvesting strategy dependent on the environmental dynamics a mathematical model is always improvable thus future work can be directed to improve some of the model s limitations a main future goal is to relate the shoots and the roots dynamics here considered independent by coupling the corresponding variables however this can potentially increase the model s complexity and ability to relate to experimental observations therefore this modification needs to be carefully established to combine a more realistic model without losing the model s tractability and ability to relate to the experimental data also further inclusion of plant features such as chlorophyll contents and total proteins content needs to be addressed in future modelling our sensitivity analysis also shows that the model is sensitive to modifying the parameters d s α s d r and α r therefore even though our model can correctly capture the contaminant dynamics and its accumulation in the shoots and roots our simple model needs to be improved to consider more realistic complex internal processes in the plant s dynamics 6 conclusions in this work we established a mathematical model to support the suitability of the model plant chenopodium album l to be used in contaminated areas here we provided a model for the nitrogen assimilatory enzyme activity the biomass content and the contaminant concentration in the plant as far as the authors know there is no similar existent model our numerical model simulation results provided qualitatively similar activities compared to the experimental data indeed the main goal of the model was to give a qualitative description of the main variables and long term projections of their dynamics in these long term projections we observed a consistent tendency of maintaining normal or diminished activities of the main variables depending on the contaminant induced stress we observed a plausible tendency to disrupt regular shoots dynamics whereas a consistent trend to maintain normal roots dynamics moreover we observed a consistent and longer term tendency to absorb more significant amounts of contaminants in the roots even though our main goal was to provide a qualitative description of the main variables our results can potentially be used to describe quantitative features of the main variables e g the amount of metal accumulation in the plant due to their ability to resemble the experimental data therefore this model provides scientific progress related to quantifiable plant dynamics related to contaminant accumulation and provides the basis for further experimental observations our theoretical results provided expressions for the long term dynamics in the shoots variables this complements the analysis developed in the manuscript and it is a straightforward way to analyse the long term dynamics of the system also our sensitivity analysis provided information about some of the model s limitations and further directions for the mathematical improvement of the model our mathematical model complemented experimental studies performed under copper induced stress of chenopodium album and provided the foundation of main variables to be analysed in future experimental settings in this way both experimental studies and mathematical modelling can provide complementary information that supports biological hypotheses future research opportunities can be directed towards incorporating more biological variables of the model increasing model complexity and comparing model performance under different heavy metal contaminants there is a need for continuing efforts to join both theoretical and experimental designs to establish further scientific advances to address the problem of heavy metal contamination in the environment multidisciplinary research teams need to continue working on this direction as it has successfully shown that better results can be achieved than solely theoretical or experimental approaches credit authorship contribution statement laura r gonzález ramírez conceptualization methodology investigation formal analysis writing

24433,ecologists have produced substantial literature about the impact of biological invasions on species diversity however due to scale dependent factors no consistent conclusion has been reached regarding whether biological invasion leads to a loss of species diversity in this project we incorporate an invasion scenario into community assembly theories through spatially explicit individual based models we explore how invader dominance shifts community richness at local scales and how local scale extinctions translate to broader scales to do so native community dynamics are simulated according to the niche neutral continuum theory and constructed on a heterogeneous landscape with a limited environmental gradient we synthetically assume that the establishment of invaders is wholly affected by their niche or fitness difference from native populations by analyzing richness changes across all sample sizes we obtained the following results 1 for randomly distributed habitat resources the magnitude of richness loss linearly decreases with sample size when strong niche overlap occurs but the magnitude is more nonlinearly shaped in communities assembled by niche departures 2 spatially structured native populations could have greater resistance to invasion competition and if on clustered habitats and the species suffering more niche overlap then larger extinction events would occur at broader scales and 3 these invasion modification trends could be linked with native population spatial structures and abundance evenness the above findings are solely based on simulation experiments and implemented under several synthetic assumptions this suggests theoretical linkages between invasion scale dependent influences and mechanistic issues such as the properties of the invader and invaded communities which can inform invasive species management and restoration keywords species richness alien species effect niche neutral continuum spatial scale fitness difference 1 introduction since invasive species cause substantial economic and environmental damage species invasion has long been studied by ecologists julie et al 2007 whether species invasion poses a great threat to native diversity is continually debated i e invasion paradox fridley et al 2007b gilbert and levine 2013 meta analyses have indicated that invasion processes have direct or indirect negative impacts on local biodiversity aguilera et al 2010 christian and wilson 1999 fridley et al 2007a for example while many well documented extinctions of native species have been caused by predators or parasites especially for islands and lakes fritts and rodda 1998 kaufman 1992 clavero and garcia berthou 2005 evidence of extinction from competition is rare davis 2003 gurevitch and padilla 2004 sax and gaines 2008 furthermore alien species can even increase native species number by facilitation in some cases gaertner et al 2009 ricciardi et al 2013 sax et al 2002 or can have no significant impacts hejda and pysek 2006 meffin et al 2010 a common explanation for the above inconsistency in the consequences of invasion is the spatial scale namely the area of observational extent powell et al 2011 pysek et al 2012 ricciardi et al 2013 stohlgren et al 2006 vila et al 2011 for instance gaertner et al 2009 obtained a negative correlation between species diversity loss and spatial scale in a mediterranean ecosystem large scale studies often report an increase or no great change in community richness after invasion gurevitch and padilla 2004 stohigren et al 2008 while studies carried out at smaller scales 25 m2 frequently report invasion mediated reductions in biodiversity fridley et al 2007b ricciardi et al 2013 in a study of species area relationships powell et al 2013 compared heavily invaded and uninvaded sites in three biomes and found that due to neutral sampling effects on the individual number of communities the invaded communities log richness log area regression lines had lower intercepts and steeper slopes than those of uninvaded communities in other words species accumulated in invaded communities with increases in area more quickly than species in uninvaded communities however extinction trends across spatial scales are not universal chase et al 2019 stohigren et al 2008 and there is little evidence of a consistent relationship between native and exotic richness as an example the alteration to native richness by a single exotic species could be positive neutral or negative dong et al 2015 some studies have sought to summarize scale dependent diversity changes caused by anthropogenic pressures chase and knight 2013 chase et al 2019 however these studies have mostly focused on effect patterns mechanistic investigations are critical and are also important for decision making nelson et al 2017 few studies have combined patterns especially scale dependent patterns with properties of invaders or invaded communities in fact the effects of invasion are often density dependent davies 2011 gooden et al 2009 michelan et al 2018 valone and weyers 2019 that is the higher the density of the invader is the greater the negative effects on natives invasion caused variation in species area relationships could also be modulated by invasion intensity rejmanek and stohlgren 2015 on the other hand from the community ecology view whether alien individuals successfully establish a population depends on the niche opportunity provided by the native community shea and chesson 2002 highly novel invaders who use untapped resource pools have been predicted to succeed more readily fargione et al 2003 native environmental heterogeneity can reduce invasion impacts through a process that cannot occur in homogeneous environments melbourne et al 2007 if nonnative species exploit shared and limited resources then those equipped with a higher competitive ability are likely to have strong direct effects on the resident species elton 1958 we applied an individual based spatially explicit model to investigate the linkage between potential scale dependent influences and possible mechanisms the simulated native community was constructed as generally as possible using an extension of classical niche neutral continuum theory e g gravel et al 2006 to include a species filtering process on a heterogeneous lattice since pure neutral or niche hypotheses have their own shortcomings mcgill 2003 the niche neutral continuum which integrates the two has been strongly supported by empirical data for example hubbell 2001 notes that the change in community construction mechanism from temperate to tropical forest is very similar to that of the continuum research on the relationship between species abundance and seed size in the secondary succession process of alpine meadows on plateaus also supports this hypothesis chu et al 2007 in addition to date niche neutral continuum community assembly has not been related to any invasion model latombe et al 2021 therefore we included invasion spread in this extended niche neutral continuum model the species response curves were treated as gaussian and assumed to be evenly spaced along a limited environmental gradient the system could be controlled from neutral to complete niche differentiation by changing only one parameter in this simple model framework mutshinda and o hara 2011 which corresponded well to natural communities how alien species successfully establish populations in new environments is not simple however a common prediction by many investigations is that successful invaders are fundamentally different from native species macarthur and wilson 1967 daehler 2003 in the coexistence literature species difference is largely due to niche difference and fitness difference chesson 2000 with a niche dissimilarity mechanism successful alien species may differ strongly from natives in the resources they use allowing their establishment despite being rare carboni et al 2021 if competing for a common resource the invader could have increased fecundity or dispersal abilities baker 1965 van kleunen et al 2015 that create fitness differences favouring the alien over the resident species godoy 2019 under chession s framework macdougall et al 2009 distinguished the niche differences from fitness differences and refined numerous invasion hypotheses into these two difference axes thus all mechanisms known to influence invasion success may do so via their influence on one or both of these differences here we used the hypothesis of macdougall et al 2009 namely assuming that invader establishment mainly depends on their niche or fitness differences from resident species by doing so we conceptually framed invasion issues within the field of community assembly pearson et al 2018 and unified previous invasion hypotheses along fitness and niche difference axes gioria and osborne 2014 exotic species are randomly involved after native communities achieve the equilibrium state after considering the scale dependent invasion effect versus community position on the niche neutral continuum environmental resource distribution and survival rate of invaders we wanted to explore 1 whether competitive invasions result in spatial scale dependent effects 2 the way in which these impacts vary with the mechanism issues and 3 the regulation of habitat structure 2 method 2 1 community assembly we used an expanded version of the general lottery model of gravel et al 2006 to simulate the species dynamics on the niche neutral continuum all parameters are explained in table 1 the native community was assumed to be a n n lattice cell with wrap around boundaries and filled by structured environmental variables species recruitment depends on both environmental factors and their own niche such as niche optimum and breadth therefore we first assigned the heterogeneous habitat and then the community belonging to the niche neutral continuum was assembled on this lattice 2 1 1 heterogeneous environment each landscape grid was labelled by a certain environmental value e 0 e r a n g e by using a simple recursive quadtree division algorithm which was originally established to represent hierarchical regional stochasticity gu et al 2002 and applied in the field of habitat loss rybicki and hanski 2013 we obtained a spatially autocorrelated landscape fig 1 specifically an initial zero grid was recursively divided into four squares of equal size until the unit cell was reached each square at the kth recursive step was labelled by one uniformly random number from 0 1 by giving different weights h k h h k to each recursive level and weighted sum across all random numbers the unit sites gained environmental values detailed algorithms can be seen in appendix a parameter h represented the tunable degree of autocorrelation a larger value of h indicated a greater spatial autocorrelation when the h 0 environmental lattice tended to be randomly arranged 2 1 2 niche neutral continuum we constructed our native community on the niche neutral continuum and managed it by structured habitats fig 1 since a large body of work has shown the key position of stochastics and immigration in the community assembly process hubbell 1997 maurer and mcgill 2004 volkov et al 2004 the system dynamics were simulated under the main land framework that is in addition to considering spread within local distances we also allowed immigrations from outside such as the species pool the species pool followed hubbell s neutral algorithm and constantly supplied individual sources to the local community hubbell 2001 we assumed that the local community contained a fixed number of individuals and was under the zero sum hypothesis schwilk and ackerly 2005 that is at each time step a given proportion d of individuals died the resulting empty sites were reoccupied either by offspring from the species pool with probability m or by immigrants from the nearest neighbor with probability 1 m if more than one propagule arrived at the same site then successful occupations totally depended on their recruitment probabilities r i i 1 2 s r i was calculated by a weighted sum of the recruits produced by conspecific organisms at the nearest distance by given the immigration rate m being homogeneous across species then 1 r i 1 m λ i n i j 1 s λ j n j m p i where s represents the total number of species the survival probability λ i is a function of the environmental axis e and takes a normal shape curve gravel et al 2006 tilman 2004 fig 1 n i suggests the surrounding individual abundance of species i at the nearest neighbor p i expresses the relative abundance of species i in the regional pool the first term describes the propagule supply of species i from local neighbours while the second term indicates the contribution of individual supply from the species pool niche departure here was based on species variation in juvenile survival by fixing the breadth of the species fundamental niche as σ λ i predominantly depended on the gap between their own optimal niche and environmental label 2 λ i 1 2 e x p e μ i 2 2 σ 2 where μ i denotes the optimal niche condition for species i a critical feature of our model was the integration of environmental heterogeneity to allow for niches we evenly arranged local species niche optima on the extent of environmental heterogeneity represented in the local community schwilk and ackerly 2005 then the optimal niche value for species i is as follows 3 μ i i 1 e r a n g e s 1 2 s decreasing or increasing e r a n g e values can make species more or less similar in their niche optima species could have more or less niche overlap by setting e r a n g e 0 all species possessed the same niche optima 1 2 s where the community was in line with the neutral circumstance panels on the x axis of fig 1 the maximum value of e r a n g e we set could reach 6 σ s since niche breadth was fixed parameter value of e r a n g e determined the degree of niche overlap 2 2 invasion process our assignment for invasion followed the synthetic hypothesis of macdougall et al 2009 where biological invasion may result from niche differences that allow the establishment of invader or fitness differences here refers to the competitive ability that favor the dominance of the invader we assumed the survival rate of the invader to be 4 λ i r e x p e μ i 2 2 σ 2 where r controls the maximum survival rate of the invader at optimum niche position μ i invaders shared resources namely niche overlap with indigenous species in our model fig 2 since the maximum survival rate of natives at their optimum niche position was fixed as 1 2 see eq 3 if r 1 2 invaders generally possessed a higher survival rate than natives 2 3 implementations 2 3 1 main simulation assignments simulations were performed on lattices with n n 256 256 and an initial s 40 species with equal intraspecific individual numbers the intrinsic mortality rate of species was d 0 02 the offspring immigration rate from species pool m was fixed at 0 075 which was obtained from real communities chisholm and lichstein 2009 all species niche widths σ σ i 0 3 and their optimal environmental conditions were assigned by eq 3 we considered four magnitudes of habitat resource clusters with h 0 5 1 1 5 and 2 when h changed from 0 5 to 2 the native environmental value was distributed from random to aggregate the community was set with four niche overlap degrees complete e r a n g e 50 4 medium e r a n g e 36 weak niche differentiation e r a n g e 7 2 and neutral like assembled e r a n g e 3 6 there were three levels of invasion survival rate r 0 1 0 5 and 1 to convey weak medium and strong invasion intensity respectively we simulated our model until 8000 time steps for each combination value of parameters our simulation ran 50 repeats the method to determine equilibrium density was as follows after 5000 steps we recorded global density values every 100 steps the system was regarded as being in an equilibrium state when the records for each density differed by less than 0 1 yang et al 2014 2 3 2 sensitivity analysis the above simulation assignment explored the scale dependent change in richness caused by invader competition and assessed how these changes differ from the invasion survival rate r and properties of the native community such as habitat resource structure h and degree of niche differentiation e r a n g e except for these main simulation experiments we also included an analysis of additional parameters in our model the parameters assessed in this analysis are the size of lattice cells n species number s immigration rate from species pool m and intrinsic death rate of species d we considered different magnitudes of n and s alone and in combination with m and d table 2 for the invasion process two other different introduction methods of the invader population multiple focal points and a single focal point were included 3 result 3 1 scale dependent effect on native species richness since our main focus was the alteration of species richness across spatial scales as a result of invasion we first analyzed the difference in species area relationships sar the blue and red lines in fig 3 a shew how the species number accumulated with sample area size before and after invasion respectively when the native community was assembled by weak niche differentiation e r a n g e 7 2 and on the autocorrelative landscape h 1 5 the intercept of sar decreased invasion resulted in a steeper slope line furthermore we calculated the mean decline magnitude of species richness for each sample size and checked the significance level of the species number difference before and after invasion fig 3b it was shown that the invasion negative effect was linearly weakened along the sample area axis species richness at smaller scales was more significantly affected by invasion than that observed at larger scales from the generalized framework of chase et al 2019 this type of modification could indicate a less similar local community namely an increase in β diversity the above analysis was permutated under a single parameter combination value certain property of invader and native community we then analyzed the magnitude change in the impact scale relation across other parameter value combinations 3 2 native community properties and invasion ability fig 4 shows the influence tendency across different parameter values such as the survival rate of alien species r habitat autocorrelation h and degree of niche differentiation e r a n g e the rows in fig 4 a c are three different invader fecundities r 0 1 0 5 and 1 these three levels of value suggested weak medium and strong invasion intensities columns correspond to four levels of habitat autocorrelation for each panel figure we used different colors to present community assembly methods from neutral to complete niche differentiation e r a n g e 3 6 7 2 36 50 4 thus we were able to analyze the variation in the influence pattern mediated by the properties of the invader and invaded community overall both the invasion mechanism niche differentiation and higher competitive ability and habitat structure played a critical role in the impact of a biological invasion environments with more autocorrelation h 1 1 5 2 resisted biological invasion better as long as the invasion intensity was not too strong e g with a relatively low survival rate r 0 1 and 0 5 species richness was not substantially modified lines in columns 2 4 of fig 4a b for the impact scale relationship in the first column of fig 4 h 0 5 random habitat the red lines niche departure case are always located below the blue lines neutral community and have a stronger scale dependent response compared to neutral like communities e r a n g e 3 6 7 2 niche differentiated communities e r a n g e 36 50 4 presented a more nonlinear scale dependent pattern their magnitude of richness loss at any given scale was a skewed u shape however in the clustered habitat the last two columns of fig 4 the opposite was true the blue lines in fig 4 are located below the red lines with enough invasion intensity r 1 communities with strong niche overlap experienced more severe biodiversity loss this dramatic decline also occurred at broader sample sizes 3 3 changes in emerged abundance and spatial patterns to explain the influence patterns above we analyzed the invasion caused alterations in species spatial distribution and community abundance skewness fig 5 for random habitat h 0 5 and fig 6 for aggregated habitat h 1 5 the overall population spatial autocorrelation was measured by the correlation coefficient moran s i moran 1950 which has been widely used in the fields of geography and geographic information science getis 2010 helbich et al 2012 we quantified abundance skewness through the index r logskew it was the third moment of a probability distribution and represented the number of rare species r logskew l o g n i μ 3 s l o g n i μ 2 s 3 2 s s 2 s 1 s this metric measures asymmetry relative to the log normal and is more independent of species number s mcgill 2011 a positive value indicates more probability on the right abundant side and small skewness a negative value suggests more rare species mcgill 2003 namely large skewness as such δ logskew r logskew after r logskew before 0 indicates skewness declines while δ moran s i moran s i after moran s i before 0 suggests that the community tends to have a more aggregated distribution from figs 5 to 6 we see that how competitive invasion modified native population spatial distribution and abundance skewness is consistent with the richness results in fig 4 as shown in fig 5a b in a strong neutral community e r a n g e 3 6 7 2 the invasion process significantly modified the native population spatial distribution rather than the abundance skewness alien species on the lattice exhibited a scattered spreading pattern in space fig 5c d this type of invasion drove native species to be more clustered with their own individuals by which the degree of native community aggregation increased and then δ moran s i moran s i after moran s i before 0 therefore we observed a linear scale dependent decline in fig 4 for communities assembled by niche departure e r a n g e 36 50 4 species were influenced more on abundance structure while native population spatial distributions were not significantly modified fig 5 a b invasive establishment resulted in the abundance of the native community becoming less skewed δ logskew 0 due to the strong niche differentiation in this scenario many indigenous species survived only in an environment that closely matched their physiological optimum the other cells on the lattice were then occupied by offspring from the species pool and the most abundant species as such we observed a wide range of common species and several scattered rare species before invasion blue cells in fig 5e when exotic species were randomly introduced species with small population sizes had a greater risk of extinction but common species were not as influenced on average there was less extinction within extremely small and regional sample sizes most reductions in species number occurred within a certain window scale overall we observed a nonlinear impact scale curve on a clustered landscape h 1 5 given the structured resources the invader survival rate r 0 5 was not adequate for a successful invasion if r 1 fig 6 then the invasion process could break the original highly clustered distribution of populations for strong neutral communities e r a n g e 3 6 7 2 on this kind of habitat the native abundance distribution became less skewed δ logskew 0 fig 6a and δ moran s i 0 fig 6b exotic species diffused as large patches fig 6c d under competition pressures rare species were then influenced more than common species and abundance skewness decreased to some degree finally for niche differentiated communities e r a n g e 36 50 4 we could see that environmental heterogeneity and niche departure processes prevented the invasion extension to some degree fig 6e consequently the species spatial pattern and abundance skewness did not substantially vary 3 4 sensitivity of the model from the results of the sensitivity analysis we knew that the additional value of lattice size and initial species number had limited influence on our results see fig b 1 fig b 4 in appendix b although the initial species number in the local community modified the magnitude of richness decline to some degree our main tendency was attained such as in random habitats fig 7 a completely niche departure curves solid lines e r a n g e 50 4 positioned below weak niche differentiation cases dash lines e r a n g e 7 2 and linear scale influence patterns occurring in the former communities when habitat resources were highly clustered fig 7b we obtained the reverse trend the species immigration rate m from the species pool also had a weak effect on our model results fig 7 which was particularly evident in aggregated habitats h 2 similar conclusions were drawn for the combinations of intrinsic death rate d and immigration rate m fig b 5 fig b 6 we also considered the effect of invasion introduction methods such as focal points or multiple points the details of the tests we performed can be found in fig b 7 and fig b 8 of appendix b 4 discussion here we integrated alien species invasion processes into the niche neutral continuum model by spatially explicit simulations after exploring the scale dependent change in species richness across parameter values and linking it with the modifications of population spatial structure and abundance skewness we gained some influence patterns of invasion on richness and explained them from certain ecological principles our findings showed that the impact of an invasion process on the native community was indeed scale dependent however the pattern of this scaling would differ with habitat resource structure and native community assembly methods first competitive invasion could reduce native species richness at certain spatial scales this was also observed in many assessments of invasive impact byers et al 2002 hejda et al 2009 parker et al 1999 we observed the magnitudes of richness change along the sample size axis our model suggested that for a weak niche departure community with autocorrelated resources this decline exhibited a linearly weakening tendency namely the negative modification of species number by the invasion process was proportionally weakened as sample size increased in fact small scale research more often suggests a threat of invasion to biodiversity gerber et al 2008 vilà et al 2011 whereas large scale research tends to report a negligible impact planty tabacchi et al 1996 maskell et al 2006 for the species area relationship sar our simulations showed that the invasion process increased the speed of species accumulation with increasing area namely the slope of sar by a declining sar intercept also in line with the result from powell et al 2011 2013 gaertner et al 2009 who conducted similar analyses for 11 studies in mediterranean ecosystems found a negative relationship between the loss of species richness and spatial scale however studies have highlighted that the modification of the species area curve is dependent on community systems chase and knight 2013 chase et al 2019 and the dominance of competitive invasive plants czarniecka wiera et al 2019 any change in species richness across scales can remain the same increase decrease or become unimodal within a realistic community chase et al 2019 stohlgren and rejmanek 2014 used two large unbiased datasets to suggest that due to species characteristics hejda et al 2009 invasion time soil fertility species interaction and many other factors levine et al 2003 powell et al 2013 invasion impacts are different in space and time it is therefore unclear whether the linear impact scale pattern observed is valid in other realistic scenarios identifying a universal trend from only subjective and haphazard studies would be impossible dong et al 2015 by exploring the impact scale relationship vs resource aggregation degree invader fitness difference defined here as survival rate and niche differentiation macdougall et al 2009 we investigated how invasion scale dependent influence patterns differ with native resource structure community assembly method and invader properties first our results suggested that alien species were difficult to spread in communities with autocorrelative environment it is compatible with the finding of giometto et al 2017 in which they theoretically and experimentally shew a reduction in the speed of species spread when increasing the resource autocorrelation length other investigations also emphasized the importance of environmental configuration on invasion spread urban et al 2008 manning et al 2007 melbourne et al 2007 siesa et al 2011 then for the scale dependent pattern simulated we found that the obtained impact scale curves varied in shape in randomly distributed habitats except for the linear scale dependent trend for neutral communities nonlinear shapes reverse hump shaped with scale occurred when native and exotic species coexisted through niche departure the maximum decline in richness occurred at intermediate sample scales invasion success did not necessarily translate into greater impacts at a local scale parker et al 1999 the above findings could be explained by the explicit recognition of how invader dominance shifted the abundance of native species at local scales and how local scale extinctions could scale up to broader areas powell et al 2011 we further explored the modifications of both abundance distribution and population spatial structures since in randomly structured habitats simulated species with strong niche overlap increased the role of demographic stochasticity in determining community composition native populations were well mixed our measures of change such as skewness and moran s i matrices suggested that a later introduced invasion drove the native populations to become more clustered as such when increasing the observation window we encompassed more structured species viana and chase 2019 since locally rare species can still have high patch occupancy regionally little extinction occurred at a larger scale thus we have generally observed more species extinctions within a small sample area and less biodiversity loss within a broader spatial scale showing a proportional descending trend for the impact scale curve for communities assembled by niche departure species response curves were separately posited on an environmental gradient in our model which caused species narrow distributions of resources and most species to be poorly adapted to environmental conditions at most sites then few species were suitable for the prevailing conditions that dominated the community bar massada et al 2014 in these cases locally rare species also tended to appear in only a few local communities enquist et al 2019 invaders overlapped with a limited number of indigenous species which resulted in a relatively slight competitive influence macdougall et al 2009 in this scenario we observed fewer population spatial distribution changes than those in other scenarios species abundance distribution became more log right skew extinctions seldom occurred at extremely small or regional scales species losses were greatest in the sample area with a specific size and thus the impact scale curve presented more nonlinearly on the other hand if native habitat was structured with highly clustered resources then the results contrasted with those for randomly distributed habitat cases neutral native communities showed a greater nonlinear accumulation pattern large extinctions occurred at broader spatial scales in reality many types of environmental variation are positively autocorrelated steele 1985 halley 1996 király et al 2006 this scale dependent tendency was consistent with empirical studies for example invasions of the forb species heracleum mantegazzianum giant hog weed into submontane meadow communities in the czech republic caused declines in both local and landscape scale species richness hejda et al 2009 lebbink et al 2021 examined plots with varying degrees of invasion by bothriochloa pertusa at multiple spatial scales up to 1000 m2 they found that local scale species richness declined with increasing bothriochloa pertusa cover but the rate of species accumulation with increasing area remained the same there is also evidence suggesting that bothriochloa pertusa invasion to native forbs and perennial grass in small areas 1 m2 led to the loss of richness and cover kutt and kemp 2012 and its observed dominance over broader scales was suggestive of large scale richness declines lebbink et al 2021 additionally we still tried to explain the above patterns by diversity metrics change skewness and moran s i matrices due to habitat preference native species were relatively aggregated harms et al 2001 kikvidze et al 2005 shen et al 2013 under this structure and competitive advantages of alien species the invasion process presented sheet like diffusion in our simulation since locally common species might have low lattice occupation across a region massive invasive competition should cause extinctions for example extinctions could occur when invaders occupy low nutrient sites or sites with high endemicity funk and vitousek 2007 miller et al 2010 therefore in this scenario we observed broad scale species losses our investigations here are mainly under relatively strict and synthetic model assumptions for example we assume species response curves to be very simple gaussian shapes with limited environmental gradients a number of modellers have looked at more complex species responses to gradients using either more flexible functions e g a beta function more diverse niche differentiation patterns or both e g austin 1980 minchin 1987 oksanen and michin 2002 however since more parameters would occur with complex response curves and be difficult to combine with niche neutral models such complexity may be beyond the scope of this effort furthermore there are unstated assumptions in our model such as assuming a fixed number of individuals in the local community this makes some equivalent assumptions 1 no interspecific differences in fecundity by species 2 no variation in propagule production as a function of the age size or fitness of parents 3 one and only one crop of propagules is produced by all species at each time step and 4 the community is composed of similar life forms of approximately equal scale e g all trees or all perennial plants therefore when compared to actual communities our interpretations should be cautiously applied simultaneously for invasion assumptions we assume alien species to behave under a relatively synthetic framework all these are more mathematically tractable but less realistic and applicable although the simulations reported here are unrealistic in many respects we argue that these synthetic hypotheses could apply to a wide range of communities especially for plant and forest communities our model makes the first attempt to address this issue and can provide new insights into the combination of community assembly mechanisms with invasion issues future studies could carry out more empirical evidence to support our conclusions and give attention to how invasion mechanisms are reconciled with classical community ecology theories for our scale dependent results the summary statistics for native communities in response to the presence of invasive species have provided information about community level changes brown et al 2006 hejda and pysek 2006 however we have not focused on population level insights e g evaluating the abundance rank change or the relative proportional influence of an invader at each sample scale to gain a more complete understanding of invasion effects investigations from a population perspective are of utmost importance comita et al 2010 ricciardi 2004 future studies on biodiversity change and its potential drivers should

24433,ecologists have produced substantial literature about the impact of biological invasions on species diversity however due to scale dependent factors no consistent conclusion has been reached regarding whether biological invasion leads to a loss of species diversity in this project we incorporate an invasion scenario into community assembly theories through spatially explicit individual based models we explore how invader dominance shifts community richness at local scales and how local scale extinctions translate to broader scales to do so native community dynamics are simulated according to the niche neutral continuum theory and constructed on a heterogeneous landscape with a limited environmental gradient we synthetically assume that the establishment of invaders is wholly affected by their niche or fitness difference from native populations by analyzing richness changes across all sample sizes we obtained the following results 1 for randomly distributed habitat resources the magnitude of richness loss linearly decreases with sample size when strong niche overlap occurs but the magnitude is more nonlinearly shaped in communities assembled by niche departures 2 spatially structured native populations could have greater resistance to invasion competition and if on clustered habitats and the species suffering more niche overlap then larger extinction events would occur at broader scales and 3 these invasion modification trends could be linked with native population spatial structures and abundance evenness the above findings are solely based on simulation experiments and implemented under several synthetic assumptions this suggests theoretical linkages between invasion scale dependent influences and mechanistic issues such as the properties of the invader and invaded communities which can inform invasive species management and restoration keywords species richness alien species effect niche neutral continuum spatial scale fitness difference 1 introduction since invasive species cause substantial economic and environmental damage species invasion has long been studied by ecologists julie et al 2007 whether species invasion poses a great threat to native diversity is continually debated i e invasion paradox fridley et al 2007b gilbert and levine 2013 meta analyses have indicated that invasion processes have direct or indirect negative impacts on local biodiversity aguilera et al 2010 christian and wilson 1999 fridley et al 2007a for example while many well documented extinctions of native species have been caused by predators or parasites especially for islands and lakes fritts and rodda 1998 kaufman 1992 clavero and garcia berthou 2005 evidence of extinction from competition is rare davis 2003 gurevitch and padilla 2004 sax and gaines 2008 furthermore alien species can even increase native species number by facilitation in some cases gaertner et al 2009 ricciardi et al 2013 sax et al 2002 or can have no significant impacts hejda and pysek 2006 meffin et al 2010 a common explanation for the above inconsistency in the consequences of invasion is the spatial scale namely the area of observational extent powell et al 2011 pysek et al 2012 ricciardi et al 2013 stohlgren et al 2006 vila et al 2011 for instance gaertner et al 2009 obtained a negative correlation between species diversity loss and spatial scale in a mediterranean ecosystem large scale studies often report an increase or no great change in community richness after invasion gurevitch and padilla 2004 stohigren et al 2008 while studies carried out at smaller scales 25 m2 frequently report invasion mediated reductions in biodiversity fridley et al 2007b ricciardi et al 2013 in a study of species area relationships powell et al 2013 compared heavily invaded and uninvaded sites in three biomes and found that due to neutral sampling effects on the individual number of communities the invaded communities log richness log area regression lines had lower intercepts and steeper slopes than those of uninvaded communities in other words species accumulated in invaded communities with increases in area more quickly than species in uninvaded communities however extinction trends across spatial scales are not universal chase et al 2019 stohigren et al 2008 and there is little evidence of a consistent relationship between native and exotic richness as an example the alteration to native richness by a single exotic species could be positive neutral or negative dong et al 2015 some studies have sought to summarize scale dependent diversity changes caused by anthropogenic pressures chase and knight 2013 chase et al 2019 however these studies have mostly focused on effect patterns mechanistic investigations are critical and are also important for decision making nelson et al 2017 few studies have combined patterns especially scale dependent patterns with properties of invaders or invaded communities in fact the effects of invasion are often density dependent davies 2011 gooden et al 2009 michelan et al 2018 valone and weyers 2019 that is the higher the density of the invader is the greater the negative effects on natives invasion caused variation in species area relationships could also be modulated by invasion intensity rejmanek and stohlgren 2015 on the other hand from the community ecology view whether alien individuals successfully establish a population depends on the niche opportunity provided by the native community shea and chesson 2002 highly novel invaders who use untapped resource pools have been predicted to succeed more readily fargione et al 2003 native environmental heterogeneity can reduce invasion impacts through a process that cannot occur in homogeneous environments melbourne et al 2007 if nonnative species exploit shared and limited resources then those equipped with a higher competitive ability are likely to have strong direct effects on the resident species elton 1958 we applied an individual based spatially explicit model to investigate the linkage between potential scale dependent influences and possible mechanisms the simulated native community was constructed as generally as possible using an extension of classical niche neutral continuum theory e g gravel et al 2006 to include a species filtering process on a heterogeneous lattice since pure neutral or niche hypotheses have their own shortcomings mcgill 2003 the niche neutral continuum which integrates the two has been strongly supported by empirical data for example hubbell 2001 notes that the change in community construction mechanism from temperate to tropical forest is very similar to that of the continuum research on the relationship between species abundance and seed size in the secondary succession process of alpine meadows on plateaus also supports this hypothesis chu et al 2007 in addition to date niche neutral continuum community assembly has not been related to any invasion model latombe et al 2021 therefore we included invasion spread in this extended niche neutral continuum model the species response curves were treated as gaussian and assumed to be evenly spaced along a limited environmental gradient the system could be controlled from neutral to complete niche differentiation by changing only one parameter in this simple model framework mutshinda and o hara 2011 which corresponded well to natural communities how alien species successfully establish populations in new environments is not simple however a common prediction by many investigations is that successful invaders are fundamentally different from native species macarthur and wilson 1967 daehler 2003 in the coexistence literature species difference is largely due to niche difference and fitness difference chesson 2000 with a niche dissimilarity mechanism successful alien species may differ strongly from natives in the resources they use allowing their establishment despite being rare carboni et al 2021 if competing for a common resource the invader could have increased fecundity or dispersal abilities baker 1965 van kleunen et al 2015 that create fitness differences favouring the alien over the resident species godoy 2019 under chession s framework macdougall et al 2009 distinguished the niche differences from fitness differences and refined numerous invasion hypotheses into these two difference axes thus all mechanisms known to influence invasion success may do so via their influence on one or both of these differences here we used the hypothesis of macdougall et al 2009 namely assuming that invader establishment mainly depends on their niche or fitness differences from resident species by doing so we conceptually framed invasion issues within the field of community assembly pearson et al 2018 and unified previous invasion hypotheses along fitness and niche difference axes gioria and osborne 2014 exotic species are randomly involved after native communities achieve the equilibrium state after considering the scale dependent invasion effect versus community position on the niche neutral continuum environmental resource distribution and survival rate of invaders we wanted to explore 1 whether competitive invasions result in spatial scale dependent effects 2 the way in which these impacts vary with the mechanism issues and 3 the regulation of habitat structure 2 method 2 1 community assembly we used an expanded version of the general lottery model of gravel et al 2006 to simulate the species dynamics on the niche neutral continuum all parameters are explained in table 1 the native community was assumed to be a n n lattice cell with wrap around boundaries and filled by structured environmental variables species recruitment depends on both environmental factors and their own niche such as niche optimum and breadth therefore we first assigned the heterogeneous habitat and then the community belonging to the niche neutral continuum was assembled on this lattice 2 1 1 heterogeneous environment each landscape grid was labelled by a certain environmental value e 0 e r a n g e by using a simple recursive quadtree division algorithm which was originally established to represent hierarchical regional stochasticity gu et al 2002 and applied in the field of habitat loss rybicki and hanski 2013 we obtained a spatially autocorrelated landscape fig 1 specifically an initial zero grid was recursively divided into four squares of equal size until the unit cell was reached each square at the kth recursive step was labelled by one uniformly random number from 0 1 by giving different weights h k h h k to each recursive level and weighted sum across all random numbers the unit sites gained environmental values detailed algorithms can be seen in appendix a parameter h represented the tunable degree of autocorrelation a larger value of h indicated a greater spatial autocorrelation when the h 0 environmental lattice tended to be randomly arranged 2 1 2 niche neutral continuum we constructed our native community on the niche neutral continuum and managed it by structured habitats fig 1 since a large body of work has shown the key position of stochastics and immigration in the community assembly process hubbell 1997 maurer and mcgill 2004 volkov et al 2004 the system dynamics were simulated under the main land framework that is in addition to considering spread within local distances we also allowed immigrations from outside such as the species pool the species pool followed hubbell s neutral algorithm and constantly supplied individual sources to the local community hubbell 2001 we assumed that the local community contained a fixed number of individuals and was under the zero sum hypothesis schwilk and ackerly 2005 that is at each time step a given proportion d of individuals died the resulting empty sites were reoccupied either by offspring from the species pool with probability m or by immigrants from the nearest neighbor with probability 1 m if more than one propagule arrived at the same site then successful occupations totally depended on their recruitment probabilities r i i 1 2 s r i was calculated by a weighted sum of the recruits produced by conspecific organisms at the nearest distance by given the immigration rate m being homogeneous across species then 1 r i 1 m λ i n i j 1 s λ j n j m p i where s represents the total number of species the survival probability λ i is a function of the environmental axis e and takes a normal shape curve gravel et al 2006 tilman 2004 fig 1 n i suggests the surrounding individual abundance of species i at the nearest neighbor p i expresses the relative abundance of species i in the regional pool the first term describes the propagule supply of species i from local neighbours while the second term indicates the contribution of individual supply from the species pool niche departure here was based on species variation in juvenile survival by fixing the breadth of the species fundamental niche as σ λ i predominantly depended on the gap between their own optimal niche and environmental label 2 λ i 1 2 e x p e μ i 2 2 σ 2 where μ i denotes the optimal niche condition for species i a critical feature of our model was the integration of environmental heterogeneity to allow for niches we evenly arranged local species niche optima on the extent of environmental heterogeneity represented in the local community schwilk and ackerly 2005 then the optimal niche value for species i is as follows 3 μ i i 1 e r a n g e s 1 2 s decreasing or increasing e r a n g e values can make species more or less similar in their niche optima species could have more or less niche overlap by setting e r a n g e 0 all species possessed the same niche optima 1 2 s where the community was in line with the neutral circumstance panels on the x axis of fig 1 the maximum value of e r a n g e we set could reach 6 σ s since niche breadth was fixed parameter value of e r a n g e determined the degree of niche overlap 2 2 invasion process our assignment for invasion followed the synthetic hypothesis of macdougall et al 2009 where biological invasion may result from niche differences that allow the establishment of invader or fitness differences here refers to the competitive ability that favor the dominance of the invader we assumed the survival rate of the invader to be 4 λ i r e x p e μ i 2 2 σ 2 where r controls the maximum survival rate of the invader at optimum niche position μ i invaders shared resources namely niche overlap with indigenous species in our model fig 2 since the maximum survival rate of natives at their optimum niche position was fixed as 1 2 see eq 3 if r 1 2 invaders generally possessed a higher survival rate than natives 2 3 implementations 2 3 1 main simulation assignments simulations were performed on lattices with n n 256 256 and an initial s 40 species with equal intraspecific individual numbers the intrinsic mortality rate of species was d 0 02 the offspring immigration rate from species pool m was fixed at 0 075 which was obtained from real communities chisholm and lichstein 2009 all species niche widths σ σ i 0 3 and their optimal environmental conditions were assigned by eq 3 we considered four magnitudes of habitat resource clusters with h 0 5 1 1 5 and 2 when h changed from 0 5 to 2 the native environmental value was distributed from random to aggregate the community was set with four niche overlap degrees complete e r a n g e 50 4 medium e r a n g e 36 weak niche differentiation e r a n g e 7 2 and neutral like assembled e r a n g e 3 6 there were three levels of invasion survival rate r 0 1 0 5 and 1 to convey weak medium and strong invasion intensity respectively we simulated our model until 8000 time steps for each combination value of parameters our simulation ran 50 repeats the method to determine equilibrium density was as follows after 5000 steps we recorded global density values every 100 steps the system was regarded as being in an equilibrium state when the records for each density differed by less than 0 1 yang et al 2014 2 3 2 sensitivity analysis the above simulation assignment explored the scale dependent change in richness caused by invader competition and assessed how these changes differ from the invasion survival rate r and properties of the native community such as habitat resource structure h and degree of niche differentiation e r a n g e except for these main simulation experiments we also included an analysis of additional parameters in our model the parameters assessed in this analysis are the size of lattice cells n species number s immigration rate from species pool m and intrinsic death rate of species d we considered different magnitudes of n and s alone and in combination with m and d table 2 for the invasion process two other different introduction methods of the invader population multiple focal points and a single focal point were included 3 result 3 1 scale dependent effect on native species richness since our main focus was the alteration of species richness across spatial scales as a result of invasion we first analyzed the difference in species area relationships sar the blue and red lines in fig 3 a shew how the species number accumulated with sample area size before and after invasion respectively when the native community was assembled by weak niche differentiation e r a n g e 7 2 and on the autocorrelative landscape h 1 5 the intercept of sar decreased invasion resulted in a steeper slope line furthermore we calculated the mean decline magnitude of species richness for each sample size and checked the significance level of the species number difference before and after invasion fig 3b it was shown that the invasion negative effect was linearly weakened along the sample area axis species richness at smaller scales was more significantly affected by invasion than that observed at larger scales from the generalized framework of chase et al 2019 this type of modification could indicate a less similar local community namely an increase in β diversity the above analysis was permutated under a single parameter combination value certain property of invader and native community we then analyzed the magnitude change in the impact scale relation across other parameter value combinations 3 2 native community properties and invasion ability fig 4 shows the influence tendency across different parameter values such as the survival rate of alien species r habitat autocorrelation h and degree of niche differentiation e r a n g e the rows in fig 4 a c are three different invader fecundities r 0 1 0 5 and 1 these three levels of value suggested weak medium and strong invasion intensities columns correspond to four levels of habitat autocorrelation for each panel figure we used different colors to present community assembly methods from neutral to complete niche differentiation e r a n g e 3 6 7 2 36 50 4 thus we were able to analyze the variation in the influence pattern mediated by the properties of the invader and invaded community overall both the invasion mechanism niche differentiation and higher competitive ability and habitat structure played a critical role in the impact of a biological invasion environments with more autocorrelation h 1 1 5 2 resisted biological invasion better as long as the invasion intensity was not too strong e g with a relatively low survival rate r 0 1 and 0 5 species richness was not substantially modified lines in columns 2 4 of fig 4a b for the impact scale relationship in the first column of fig 4 h 0 5 random habitat the red lines niche departure case are always located below the blue lines neutral community and have a stronger scale dependent response compared to neutral like communities e r a n g e 3 6 7 2 niche differentiated communities e r a n g e 36 50 4 presented a more nonlinear scale dependent pattern their magnitude of richness loss at any given scale was a skewed u shape however in the clustered habitat the last two columns of fig 4 the opposite was true the blue lines in fig 4 are located below the red lines with enough invasion intensity r 1 communities with strong niche overlap experienced more severe biodiversity loss this dramatic decline also occurred at broader sample sizes 3 3 changes in emerged abundance and spatial patterns to explain the influence patterns above we analyzed the invasion caused alterations in species spatial distribution and community abundance skewness fig 5 for random habitat h 0 5 and fig 6 for aggregated habitat h 1 5 the overall population spatial autocorrelation was measured by the correlation coefficient moran s i moran 1950 which has been widely used in the fields of geography and geographic information science getis 2010 helbich et al 2012 we quantified abundance skewness through the index r logskew it was the third moment of a probability distribution and represented the number of rare species r logskew l o g n i μ 3 s l o g n i μ 2 s 3 2 s s 2 s 1 s this metric measures asymmetry relative to the log normal and is more independent of species number s mcgill 2011 a positive value indicates more probability on the right abundant side and small skewness a negative value suggests more rare species mcgill 2003 namely large skewness as such δ logskew r logskew after r logskew before 0 indicates skewness declines while δ moran s i moran s i after moran s i before 0 suggests that the community tends to have a more aggregated distribution from figs 5 to 6 we see that how competitive invasion modified native population spatial distribution and abundance skewness is consistent with the richness results in fig 4 as shown in fig 5a b in a strong neutral community e r a n g e 3 6 7 2 the invasion process significantly modified the native population spatial distribution rather than the abundance skewness alien species on the lattice exhibited a scattered spreading pattern in space fig 5c d this type of invasion drove native species to be more clustered with their own individuals by which the degree of native community aggregation increased and then δ moran s i moran s i after moran s i before 0 therefore we observed a linear scale dependent decline in fig 4 for communities assembled by niche departure e r a n g e 36 50 4 species were influenced more on abundance structure while native population spatial distributions were not significantly modified fig 5 a b invasive establishment resulted in the abundance of the native community becoming less skewed δ logskew 0 due to the strong niche differentiation in this scenario many indigenous species survived only in an environment that closely matched their physiological optimum the other cells on the lattice were then occupied by offspring from the species pool and the most abundant species as such we observed a wide range of common species and several scattered rare species before invasion blue cells in fig 5e when exotic species were randomly introduced species with small population sizes had a greater risk of extinction but common species were not as influenced on average there was less extinction within extremely small and regional sample sizes most reductions in species number occurred within a certain window scale overall we observed a nonlinear impact scale curve on a clustered landscape h 1 5 given the structured resources the invader survival rate r 0 5 was not adequate for a successful invasion if r 1 fig 6 then the invasion process could break the original highly clustered distribution of populations for strong neutral communities e r a n g e 3 6 7 2 on this kind of habitat the native abundance distribution became less skewed δ logskew 0 fig 6a and δ moran s i 0 fig 6b exotic species diffused as large patches fig 6c d under competition pressures rare species were then influenced more than common species and abundance skewness decreased to some degree finally for niche differentiated communities e r a n g e 36 50 4 we could see that environmental heterogeneity and niche departure processes prevented the invasion extension to some degree fig 6e consequently the species spatial pattern and abundance skewness did not substantially vary 3 4 sensitivity of the model from the results of the sensitivity analysis we knew that the additional value of lattice size and initial species number had limited influence on our results see fig b 1 fig b 4 in appendix b although the initial species number in the local community modified the magnitude of richness decline to some degree our main tendency was attained such as in random habitats fig 7 a completely niche departure curves solid lines e r a n g e 50 4 positioned below weak niche differentiation cases dash lines e r a n g e 7 2 and linear scale influence patterns occurring in the former communities when habitat resources were highly clustered fig 7b we obtained the reverse trend the species immigration rate m from the species pool also had a weak effect on our model results fig 7 which was particularly evident in aggregated habitats h 2 similar conclusions were drawn for the combinations of intrinsic death rate d and immigration rate m fig b 5 fig b 6 we also considered the effect of invasion introduction methods such as focal points or multiple points the details of the tests we performed can be found in fig b 7 and fig b 8 of appendix b 4 discussion here we integrated alien species invasion processes into the niche neutral continuum model by spatially explicit simulations after exploring the scale dependent change in species richness across parameter values and linking it with the modifications of population spatial structure and abundance skewness we gained some influence patterns of invasion on richness and explained them from certain ecological principles our findings showed that the impact of an invasion process on the native community was indeed scale dependent however the pattern of this scaling would differ with habitat resource structure and native community assembly methods first competitive invasion could reduce native species richness at certain spatial scales this was also observed in many assessments of invasive impact byers et al 2002 hejda et al 2009 parker et al 1999 we observed the magnitudes of richness change along the sample size axis our model suggested that for a weak niche departure community with autocorrelated resources this decline exhibited a linearly weakening tendency namely the negative modification of species number by the invasion process was proportionally weakened as sample size increased in fact small scale research more often suggests a threat of invasion to biodiversity gerber et al 2008 vilà et al 2011 whereas large scale research tends to report a negligible impact planty tabacchi et al 1996 maskell et al 2006 for the species area relationship sar our simulations showed that the invasion process increased the speed of species accumulation with increasing area namely the slope of sar by a declining sar intercept also in line with the result from powell et al 2011 2013 gaertner et al 2009 who conducted similar analyses for 11 studies in mediterranean ecosystems found a negative relationship between the loss of species richness and spatial scale however studies have highlighted that the modification of the species area curve is dependent on community systems chase and knight 2013 chase et al 2019 and the dominance of competitive invasive plants czarniecka wiera et al 2019 any change in species richness across scales can remain the same increase decrease or become unimodal within a realistic community chase et al 2019 stohlgren and rejmanek 2014 used two large unbiased datasets to suggest that due to species characteristics hejda et al 2009 invasion time soil fertility species interaction and many other factors levine et al 2003 powell et al 2013 invasion impacts are different in space and time it is therefore unclear whether the linear impact scale pattern observed is valid in other realistic scenarios identifying a universal trend from only subjective and haphazard studies would be impossible dong et al 2015 by exploring the impact scale relationship vs resource aggregation degree invader fitness difference defined here as survival rate and niche differentiation macdougall et al 2009 we investigated how invasion scale dependent influence patterns differ with native resource structure community assembly method and invader properties first our results suggested that alien species were difficult to spread in communities with autocorrelative environment it is compatible with the finding of giometto et al 2017 in which they theoretically and experimentally shew a reduction in the speed of species spread when increasing the resource autocorrelation length other investigations also emphasized the importance of environmental configuration on invasion spread urban et al 2008 manning et al 2007 melbourne et al 2007 siesa et al 2011 then for the scale dependent pattern simulated we found that the obtained impact scale curves varied in shape in randomly distributed habitats except for the linear scale dependent trend for neutral communities nonlinear shapes reverse hump shaped with scale occurred when native and exotic species coexisted through niche departure the maximum decline in richness occurred at intermediate sample scales invasion success did not necessarily translate into greater impacts at a local scale parker et al 1999 the above findings could be explained by the explicit recognition of how invader dominance shifted the abundance of native species at local scales and how local scale extinctions could scale up to broader areas powell et al 2011 we further explored the modifications of both abundance distribution and population spatial structures since in randomly structured habitats simulated species with strong niche overlap increased the role of demographic stochasticity in determining community composition native populations were well mixed our measures of change such as skewness and moran s i matrices suggested that a later introduced invasion drove the native populations to become more clustered as such when increasing the observation window we encompassed more structured species viana and chase 2019 since locally rare species can still have high patch occupancy regionally little extinction occurred at a larger scale thus we have generally observed more species extinctions within a small sample area and less biodiversity loss within a broader spatial scale showing a proportional descending trend for the impact scale curve for communities assembled by niche departure species response curves were separately posited on an environmental gradient in our model which caused species narrow distributions of resources and most species to be poorly adapted to environmental conditions at most sites then few species were suitable for the prevailing conditions that dominated the community bar massada et al 2014 in these cases locally rare species also tended to appear in only a few local communities enquist et al 2019 invaders overlapped with a limited number of indigenous species which resulted in a relatively slight competitive influence macdougall et al 2009 in this scenario we observed fewer population spatial distribution changes than those in other scenarios species abundance distribution became more log right skew extinctions seldom occurred at extremely small or regional scales species losses were greatest in the sample area with a specific size and thus the impact scale curve presented more nonlinearly on the other hand if native habitat was structured with highly clustered resources then the results contrasted with those for randomly distributed habitat cases neutral native communities showed a greater nonlinear accumulation pattern large extinctions occurred at broader spatial scales in reality many types of environmental variation are positively autocorrelated steele 1985 halley 1996 király et al 2006 this scale dependent tendency was consistent with empirical studies for example invasions of the forb species heracleum mantegazzianum giant hog weed into submontane meadow communities in the czech republic caused declines in both local and landscape scale species richness hejda et al 2009 lebbink et al 2021 examined plots with varying degrees of invasion by bothriochloa pertusa at multiple spatial scales up to 1000 m2 they found that local scale species richness declined with increasing bothriochloa pertusa cover but the rate of species accumulation with increasing area remained the same there is also evidence suggesting that bothriochloa pertusa invasion to native forbs and perennial grass in small areas 1 m2 led to the loss of richness and cover kutt and kemp 2012 and its observed dominance over broader scales was suggestive of large scale richness declines lebbink et al 2021 additionally we still tried to explain the above patterns by diversity metrics change skewness and moran s i matrices due to habitat preference native species were relatively aggregated harms et al 2001 kikvidze et al 2005 shen et al 2013 under this structure and competitive advantages of alien species the invasion process presented sheet like diffusion in our simulation since locally common species might have low lattice occupation across a region massive invasive competition should cause extinctions for example extinctions could occur when invaders occupy low nutrient sites or sites with high endemicity funk and vitousek 2007 miller et al 2010 therefore in this scenario we observed broad scale species losses our investigations here are mainly under relatively strict and synthetic model assumptions for example we assume species response curves to be very simple gaussian shapes with limited environmental gradients a number of modellers have looked at more complex species responses to gradients using either more flexible functions e g a beta function more diverse niche differentiation patterns or both e g austin 1980 minchin 1987 oksanen and michin 2002 however since more parameters would occur with complex response curves and be difficult to combine with niche neutral models such complexity may be beyond the scope of this effort furthermore there are unstated assumptions in our model such as assuming a fixed number of individuals in the local community this makes some equivalent assumptions 1 no interspecific differences in fecundity by species 2 no variation in propagule production as a function of the age size or fitness of parents 3 one and only one crop of propagules is produced by all species at each time step and 4 the community is composed of similar life forms of approximately equal scale e g all trees or all perennial plants therefore when compared to actual communities our interpretations should be cautiously applied simultaneously for invasion assumptions we assume alien species to behave under a relatively synthetic framework all these are more mathematically tractable but less realistic and applicable although the simulations reported here are unrealistic in many respects we argue that these synthetic hypotheses could apply to a wide range of communities especially for plant and forest communities our model makes the first attempt to address this issue and can provide new insights into the combination of community assembly mechanisms with invasion issues future studies could carry out more empirical evidence to support our conclusions and give attention to how invasion mechanisms are reconciled with classical community ecology theories for our scale dependent results the summary statistics for native communities in response to the presence of invasive species have provided information about community level changes brown et al 2006 hejda and pysek 2006 however we have not focused on population level insights e g evaluating the abundance rank change or the relative proportional influence of an invader at each sample scale to gain a more complete understanding of invasion effects investigations from a population perspective are of utmost importance comita et al 2010 ricciardi 2004 future studies on biodiversity change and its potential drivers should

24434,to assess the effect of sea level rise slr on a 3 800 ha eelgrass meadow in padilla bay national estuarine research reserve in puget sound washington usa we coupled the marsh equilibrium model mem with the relative elevation model rem combining their respective strengths in simulating aboveground and belowground processes we then modified the hybrid model to reflect an empirical relationship between eelgrass stem density and sediment accretion making it the first model of its kind to do so we used field data to initialize and calibrate the model then simulated surface elevation change under various slr and suspended sediment scenarios and tested it against a 12 year surface elevation table dataset from the site 100 year simulations projected relative elevation loss along at least half of the elevation gradient for all slr scenarios and along the entire gradient for three slr scenarios with greater loss at higher elevations the current suspended sediment concentration is thus insufficient for the entire eelgrass meadow to keep pace with slr with up to a four fold increase required however this presents a management conundrum in that the required sediment load may prevent eelgrass from meeting its light requirements the main contributions of this study thus include the novel combination of mem and rem models the inclusion of stem density as a factor controlling accretion the use of a long term data record for model initialization calibration and validation and the finding that increasing sediment inputs to maintain the elevation of the habitat in the long term may be detrimental to eelgrass health in the short term keywords sea level rise seagrass surface elevation model accretion ecogeomorphology 1 introduction coastal wetlands provide numerous ecosystem goods and services costanza et al 2014 but their sustainability is currently under threat from sea level rise and land use change kirwan and megonigal 2013 törnqvist et al 2021 these habitats which include salt marshes tidal forests and seagrass meadows have kept pace with sea level rise slr through system feedbacks involving plant productivity sedimentation and changes in rates of decomposition in response to changing sea levels morris et al 2002 changes in relative elevation affect intertidal plant characteristics which in turn influence sediment dynamics that feed back to alter relative elevation these ecogeomorphic feedbacks have allowed intertidal wetlands to persist in their current location despite changing sea levels for thousands of years kirwan and megonigal 2013 kirwan et al 2016 saintilan et al 2020 however there is likely a threshold rate of slr at which the wetland can no longer accumulate sediment fast enough to maintain equilibrium the plants can no longer thrive and the habitat is converted to open ocean morris et al 2021 while the current rate of slr cannot be controlled we do have more immediate control over local sediment supply two dominant factors causing the drowning of intertidal habitats worldwide are rising sea levels and a paucity of available sediment d alpaos et al 2011 giosan et al 2014 weston 2014 in fact anthropogenic alteration of sediment inputs may be a greater threat to estuarine habitat sustainability than slr kirwan and megonigal 2013 and references therein the widespread reduction in estuarine sediment inputs is caused in many cases by streams and coastlines hardened by dams dikes and levees which reduce natural downstream sediment transport and sediment deposition in the estuaries syvitski et al 2005 although rates of sediment accretion and elevation change are often used to assess the sustainability of coastal wetlands in the face of sea level rise these rates are not the only indicators of future wetland conditions due to the feedbacks between plant growth decomposition sedimentation and sea level models can incorporate these non linear feedbacks and more accurately predict wetland sustainability for a range of slr scenarios several different predictive surface elevation models have been used in recent years to estimate future slr impacts on coastal wetlands rybczyk and callaway 2009 fagherazzi et al 2012 existing surface elevation models vary in their spatial extent and the processes they include zero dimensional surface elevation models have typically fallen into one of two categories focusing on either mineral sedimentation or organic sediment processes rybczyk and callaway 2009 these models have typically included sediment deposition as a linear function of elevation because sediment availability increases with the duration of tidal inundation some of these models have also added the effect of vegetation on accretion rates marani et al 2007 morris et al 2002 mudd et al 2009 swanson et al 2013 including an accretion component modeled as a function of plant biomass or productivity several studies have examined this plant accretion relationship and the mechanisms behind it finding that vegetation plays an important role in facilitating sediment accretion fonseca et al 1982 gacia et al 1999 gacia and duarte 2001 baustian et al 2012 cahoon et al 2020 the hybrid model presented here is a mechanistic non linear zero dimensional model based on two earlier elevation change models the marsh equilibrium model mem from morris et al 2012 and the relative elevation model rem from kairis and rybczyk 2010 the mem is an analytical model originally developed by morris et al 2002 for a south carolina spartina salt marsh it simulates the effects of aboveground plant biomass on accretion and includes suspended sediment concentration ssc as an input allowing for experiment model runs to identify a target ssc the mem was later modified by morris 2006 to include multiple plant species and again by morris et al 2012 to include the growth and decomposition of belowground plant biomass the rem is a mechanistic numerical model originally developed by rybczyk et al 1998 for a louisiana hardwood swamp this model simulates sedimentation as a function of elevation but also includes the simulation of belowground processes such as decomposition and compaction tracking these processes within individual sediment cohorts across depth and time in this way the rem produces a simulated sediment core that can be calibrated against an actual core with commonly measured soil properties such as bulk density organic matter content and porosity whereas the mem focuses on plant roots but does not integrate them into a sediment column that can be used for calibration thus where the mem s strength is in simulating aboveground processes such as plant growth and sediment accretion the rem s strength is in simulating belowground processes such as decomposition and compaction the combination of these two models creates a hybrid that is stronger than its predecessors not only simulating both aboveground and belowground processes in more detail but also providing additional opportunities for model calibration the rem was derived from earlier models by morris and bowden 1986 and callaway et al 1996 the latter being later modified as warmer e g swanson et al 2013 existing surface elevation models have been applied to every coastal wetland type from tidal forests to marshes to seagrass meadows of those three habitat types seagrass meadow elevation change has been relatively under modeled however slr still affects water column light availability which is vital to seagrass productivity green and short 2003 this warrants the application of surface elevation models to seagrass habitats whether intertidal or subtidal kairis and rybczyk 2010 did just that in applying the rem to padilla bay a largely intertidal eelgrass meadow in the northeast pacific projecting shoreward migration and increased total seagrass extent over a 100 year timeframe our objective was to improve upon that study by building and applying a mem rem hybrid model to padilla bay to add the role of eelgrass as a modulator of sediment accretion padilla bay s extensive intertidal seagrass meadow and existing monitoring datasets of plant characteristics suspended sediment and elevation change make it an ideal study site for the application of this model padilla bay is a 4 200 ha estuary in puget sound with over 3 800 ha of eelgrass zostera marina and z japonica making it the largest contiguous seagrass stand on the north american pacific coast bulthuis and shull 2006 these eelgrass habitats support a diverse productive and economically important assemblage of species including oysters clams crabs salmon migratory waterfowl and shorebirds and a variety of marine mammals eelgrass is constrained subtidally by light penetration with depth and by desiccation at the upper limits of the intertidal zone thus any changes in sediment elevation relative to sea level can greatly influence eelgrass distribution and productivity kairis and rybczyk 2010 in padilla bay z japonica is found higher in the intertidal zone than z marina and is considered to be more resistant to desiccation z marina and z japonica are intermixed near the upper distribution limit for z marina and z marina outcompetes z japonica for light in the lower intertidal and subtidal zones bulthuis 1995 padilla bay has been cut off from its skagit river distributaries now filled and converted to farmland that were historically its primary sediment supply this has caused the estuary to become a net erosional system poppe 2016 the former network of wetlands across the skagit floodplain would have also delivered sediment in overland flow during river flood events collins 2000 in addition much of the padilla bay shoreline is modified with dikes that prevent tidal action from reaching upland farms and preventing upslope migration of intertidal wetlands padilla bay s reduced sediment inputs and modified shoreline exemplify a worldwide trend threatening estuarine habitat sustainability the objectives of this modeling study were to 1 develop a hybrid model of surface elevation change by linking two existing models calibrating and possibly even modifying the model structure itself in accordance with site specific field data to apply to padilla bay s intertidal eelgrass habitat 2 simulate long term relative elevation change under a variety of slr scenarios and 3 determine the ssc necessary to maintain a relative elevation equilibrium under each slr scenario 2 materials and methods 2 1 model description we created the hybrid model using select components from both the mem and rem fig 1 the hybrid model was programmed using stella iconographic modeling software high performance systems inc 2002 with a timestep of one week and dt of 0 25 the model was organized with separate mem and rem components with the rem component including sub models for primary productivity sediment dynamics and relative elevation we included the sediment deposition algorithm from the mem which simulates sediment deposition based on plant biomass relative elevation tidal range and ssc the ssc input typically uses measurements of total suspended solids which are more readily available than the sediment deposition rate used as an rem input the mem sediment deposition algorithm is linked to the rem sediment dynamics sub model which decomposes and compacts the organic and mineral soil column inputs the rem relative elevation sub model translates the simulated soil column height into a relative elevation which then feeds into the rem primary productivity sub model and back to the mem sediment deposition sub model the combination of the mem with the rem thus adds another layer to the feedbacks governing relative elevation rather than increasing sediment deposition rates linearly with a decrease in relative elevation the modified mem component adds an increase in sediment deposition with eelgrass stem density which varies non linearly with elevation 2 1 1 marsh equilibrium model mem component 2 1 1 1 sediment deposition sub model we modified the mem component from morris et al 2012 replacing the aboveground biomass variable with stem density based on empirical relationships between sediment accretion biomass stem density and relative elevation in padilla bay fig 2 our field data indicated that stem density rather than biomass or elevation is the primary driver of sediment accretion in this multi species eelgrass meadow see section 2 4 field data several studies have determined stem density to be an important modulator of sediment accretion in coastal wetlands baustian et al 2012 bos et al 2007 gleason et al 1979 hendriks et al 2008 leonard and luther 1995 li and yang 2009 neumeier and ciavola 2004 yet the hybrid model as far as we know is the first model of its kind to incorporate stem density as a controlling factor which is appropriate for a frequently inundated environment where plant litter itself contributes relatively little to accreted material and multiple plant species are present with vastly different biomass density relationships with this and other modifications to allow for a link with the rem component the modified mem component of the hybrid model describes mass based sediment deposition s as if h r 0 d s d t q k p m t h r 2 t else d s d t q k p m t where q is the settling rate of suspended sediments week 1 k is the sediment trapping coefficient cm2 shoot 1 week 1 p is stem density shoots cm 2 m is suspended sediment concentration g cm 3 h r is surface elevation with respect to mllw cm and t is maximum tidal range from mllw mhhw cm elevation dependent stem density p equations were developed for both z marina and z japonica from field based annual mean stem density values along an elevation gradient fig 3 eelgrass occurring above 0 mllw is considered intertidal and at risk of desiccation during exposure while eelgrass below 0 mllw is considered subtidal and at risk of receiving insufficient light for photosynthesis 2 1 2 relative elevation model rem component the rem component of the hybrid model and its three sub models are described by kairis and rybczyk 2010 and again here to note a few modifications the major modification here was the removal of the rem mineral input algorithm to allow mineral inputs to be simulated instead by the mem component as a function of both relative elevation and stem density instead of elevation alone regardless of stem density in an intertidal environment mineral inputs increase as relative elevation decreases due to a longer duration of tidal inundation below mllw however inundation frequency no longer increases and mineral inputs are programmed to be unaffected by relative elevation beyond mllw the mineral input s is delivered at each timestep from the mem component to the surface sediment cohort in the rem sediment dynamics sub model we begin with a description of the primary productivity sub model here as the organic matter produced from that sub model is also an input to the sediment dynamics sub model in addition to the mineral inputs from the mem component 2 1 2 1 primary productivity sub model net primary productivity npp is used in this model to estimate rates of leaf and root litter production which are the predominant sources of organic material to the soil surface and the soil column respectively aboveground biomass was included as a stepwise elevation function based on biomass data from our study sites table 1 npp was modified for this hybrid model to be a function of mean annual aboveground biomass instead of a direct function of relative elevation as kairis and rybczyk 2010 used we derived this npp biomass relationship from field measurements by thom 1990 with separate linear functions for each eelgrass species z marina npp 5 71 biomass z japonica npp 4 68 biomass belowground productivity was calculated as a constant fraction of aboveground productivity based on the annual mean eelgrass root to shoot biomass ratio of 1 34 0 34 from our study sites 2 1 2 2 sediment dynamics sub model the sediment dynamics sub model simulates longer term processes within the sediment column such as decomposition and compaction using mineral and leaf litter inputs from the sediment surface and root inputs within the soil column discrete sediment packets are transferred from the surface cohort to the bottom through 18 cohort layers each cohort is programmed to have unique decomposition rates and transfer rates based on its relative depth within the sediment column while the actual height of each cohort changes over time depending on its content the 18 cohort layers allows for a precise calibration matching the typical resolution and length of field collected sediment cores rybczyk et al 1998 we retained cohort transfer rates from kairis and rybczyk 2010 from the surface to the bottom cohort sediment packets were transferred to the subsequent cohort at a time sequence of 1 5 5 5 5 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 20 20 and 20 years we ran the model for 400 simulated years to build a sediment column to then use as the starting state for calibration and simulation runs simulated bulk density organic and mineral content and porosity of each cohort are used to calibrate this sub model the algorithms for mineral input root distribution and sediment compaction are described below the mineral input s is delivered at each timestep to the surface sediment cohort where it is then transferred to subsequent cohorts at a rate determined by the equation developed by day et al 1999 if n 1 d m n d t s z m n m n else d m n d t z m n 1 m n 1 z m n m n where m n is mineral matter in cohort n g cm 2 s is mineral input at the sediment surface g cm 2 week 1 z m n 1 is the transfer rate of mineral matter from the overlying cohort g cm 2 week 1 m n 1 is mineral matter in the overlying cohort g cm 2 and z m n is the transfer rate of mineral matter to the underlying cohort g cm 2 week 1 shorter time scale transfers allow for better resolution in the upper part of the simulated core where rates of decay and compaction are highest root productivity simulated in the primary productivity sub model is distributed as an exponential decline with depth in the soil column the root distribution equation was developed by morris and bowden 1986 to simulate exponential decline in root biomass at depth h r h s e rh where r h is root biomass at depth h g dw cm 2 s is root biomass at the sediment surface g

on a z marina decomposition study that study was also used to determine decomposition rates for surface labile and refractory matter and deep labile and refractory matter kairis and rybczyk 2010 used a standard exponential decay equation with depth in the soil column to determine the values of these constants k 1 ln n t n 0 t where k 1 is the decomposition constant day 1 n t is mass remaining at

decomposition study in north carolina kenworthy and thayer 1984 the model uses the following equation from day et al 1999 with each timestep to simulate labile organic matter decomposition and

depth simulating pore space within each cohort as a function of the mass of material above it p s n p m p x p m c func n where p s n is pore space in cohort n p m is minimum pore space for the entire sediment column p x is maximum pore space for the entire sediment column and c func n is determined as c func n 1 g n p k g n where c func n is the michaelis menten reduction in pore space unitless g n is the total mass of sediment overlying cohort n g cm 2 and p k is the half saturation compaction constant g cm 2 we determined p m p x and p k from a representative pore space profile from five sediment cores fig 4 with a non linear regression fitting an asymptotic curve to a plot of pore space versus overlying sediment mass porespace a b 1 t m a s s c where porespace is the pore space in a given core section tmass is the total mass above the core section g cm 2 and a b c are fitting parameters with fitting parameters initialized at 0 001 the half saturation compaction constant p k was determined as the total sediment mass above the depth where pore space was halfway between the minimum and maximum values on the fitted curve 2 1 2 3 relative elevation sub model the relative elevation sub model determines relative surface elevation based on the total height of the sediment column exported from the sediment dynamics sub model in addition to changes in water depth using local rates of relative sea level rise rslr and erosion as external forcing functions relative sea level rise is the difference between eustatic sea level rise eslr and local vertical land movement the total height of the sediment column incorporates both accretion and shallow subsidence shallow subsidence here includes the primary compaction decomposition and dewatering characteristic of upper sediments and does not include the secondary compaction geosynclinic downwarping or tectonic activity incorporated into deep subsidence rybczyk and callaway 2009 we modified this sub model from kairis and rybczyk 2010 replacing eslr and deep subsidence with rslr and adding a seasonal erosion forcing function to describe surface elevation relative to mllw h r as h r h t r n i r where h t is total height of the sediment column r is cumulative relative sea level rise n is cumulative erosion and i r is initial elevation relative to mllw we added the erosion term based on field observations of both lost marker horizons and scour at several surface elevation table set sites during the winter erosion was included by removing a constant height from relative elevation for 26 weeks during the winter to allow the system to accrete during the growing season as observed in the field erosion was set to zero at elevations below mllw 2 2 initialization calibration and validation we built the sediment column by running the model for 400 simulated years with a timestep of 1 week the resulting stocks of mineral matter labile organic matter and refractory organic matter in each sediment cohort were then used as starting values for calibration runs we used a 100 year simulation run for model calibration sediment trapping and settling coefficients were adjusted first until the simulated height of the year old surface cohort best approximated field based accretion rates the sediment dynamics sub model was then calibrated by comparing simulated bulk density organic matter and pore space profiles to the mean measured profiles for these same parameters using values from kairis and rybczyk 2010 as starting points decomposition compaction and root distribution constants were adjusted until the simulated profiles matched mean measured profiles within one standard deviation when possible we tested the model by running it for 12 simulated years and compared the simulated rate of relative elevation change to the observed rate from a network of 20 sets measured in 2002 2014 2 3 slr simulations we ran the model for 100 simulated years starting in model year 2002 using six rslr scenarios ranging from the current rate 0 113 cm yr 1 to the highest ipcc rate 0 753 cm yr 1 table 2 ipcc rates of global mean eslr were converted to rslr by subtracting the regional vertical land movement rate of 0 10 cm yr 1 nrc 2012 we then ran experimental simulations to determine the minimum ssc required to maintain relative elevation equilibrium over a 100 year timeframe we performed these experimental simulations separately for the seven initial relative elevations corresponding to the accretion monitoring sites and for each rslr scenario 2 4 field data we used site specific data obtained as part of both this research and other studies for model initialization calibration and validation table 3 measurements of ssc tidal range plant productivity above and belowground biomass and stem density as a function of relative elevation were used to initialize the mem and rem primary productivity sub models wire mesh screens were used as a marker horizon to estimate short term one year accretion rates to calibrate the mem sub model sediment characteristics from cores bulk density organic content and porosity and decomposition studies were used to calibrate the rem sediment dynamics sub model detailed methods and results for the field studies are presented in poppe 2016 for model validation we used a 12 year elevation change dataset from a network of 20 established surface elevation tables sets throughout padilla bay which are devices used to monitor long term surface elevation change relative to a shallow subsurface datum boumans and day 1993 sediment accretion rates and cores were collected from seven sites along an established biomonitoring transect that runs perpendicular to shore to capture the entire intertidal elevation range in the northern portion of padilla bay wa these seven sites along the transect encompassed an elevation range from 80 8 cm mllw to 66 5 cm mllw table 4 with unvegetated mudflat at the highest site to z marina at the lowest site and a mix of z marina and z japonica in between eelgrass biomass and stem density were monitored monthly by the padilla bay national estuarine research reserve pbnerr along the same transect elevation ssc and tidal range data were also obtained from pbnerr 3 results 3 1 validation the validation simulation resulted in a mean elevation change rate of 0 33 0 37 cm yr 1 model performance was evaluated with a resulting efficiency ef of 2 ef is defined by loague and greene 1991 and based on observed values simulated values and the mean of observed values across a range of sites ef was used here because it has also been used by previous versions of the rem rybczyk et al 1998 the ef has an upper limit of 1 and a lower limit of negative infinity an ef value of 1 indicates a perfect match between simulated and observed values 3 2 slr simulations all six rslr scenario projections showed a substantial loss in relative elevation over at least half the transect s elevation gradient while three scenarios predicted relative elevation loss along the entire gradient fig 5 the higher elevation sites particularly the unvegetated mudflat site were predicted to lose the most elevation resulting in an increased cover of z marina and reduced cover of z japonica throughout the bay over a 100 year timeframe for example under the most conservative current rslr scenario the highest site was predicted to lose 38 6 cm in relative elevation while the lowest site would gain 10 8 cm under the most pessimistic ipcc high rslr scenario the highest site would lose 88 6 cm and the lowest site would lose 63 5 cm simulations using the two most conservative rslr scenarios ipcc low and mote revealed some elevation gain at the lower elevations with the threshold between gain and loss at approximately 0 cm mllw all except the two most pessimistic rslr scenarios resulted in a contraction of the transect s elevation gradient around the mllw tide level which is an artifact of the model s elevation threshold for erosion 3 3 experimental ssc simulations the ssc simulations revealed that the current ssc in padilla bay of 3 93 mg l 1 is insufficient for at least some transect sites to remain stable with respect to sea level over a 100 year timeframe under all rslr scenarios and insufficient for all transect sites under the three highest rslr scenarios fig 6 the three lower elevation sites along the transect which experience less erosion are projected to be stable under more conservative scenarios given current ssc conditions the site with the highest relative elevation required substantially more sediment than the other sites up to 300 mg l 1 because this site was located above the limit of eelgrass growth with the exception of this highest site the majority of the eelgrass meadow may remain stable if provided with a suspended sediment concentration of approximately 15 mg l 1 4 discussion 4 1 slr simulations given that recent global mean eslr increases have followed the upper end of previous predictions rahmstorf 2007 the more pessimistic rslr scenarios may in fact be the most likely the elevation loss predicted by the highest rslr scenarios indicates the inability of any ecogeomorphic feedbacks to keep pace with those rates of rslr given current ssc conditions this prediction is not unexpected given the bay s current trend of elevation loss observed at the sets which have shown an average of 0 26 cm yr 1 surface elevation loss over a 12 year period amounting to a 0 37 cm yr 1 loss relative to sea level poppe 2016 under the highest rslr scenarios the z japonica and mudflats are likely to be replaced with z marina by year 2102 and the bay s sediment surface will be entirely at or below the mllw tide level 4 2 experimental ssc simulations the predicted equilibrium ssc of 15 mg l 1 is nearly four times higher than the current ssc but is not outside the realm of possibility for context padilla bay s ssc value is approximately 20 of the low suspended sediment scenario used by morris et al 2002 for the original mem and approximately 5 of their high suspended sediment scenario padilla bay s ssc is much lower than a typical estuary in part because the bay lacks a direct connection to a major river but also because most of its historic indirect river connections have been removed the restoration of some of these skagit river distributaries may be enough to make the bay s eelgrass meadows sustainable at least within a 100 year timeframe however suspended sediment brings with it a risk of blocking incident light and reducing eelgrass photosynthetic capacity ochieng et al 2010 which would be reflected in the model as reduced net primary productivity further research would first be necessary to determine the limit of eelgrass tolerance for ssc here to ensure that any increase in sediment would still permit the eelgrass to meet its light requirements a few studies from other eelgrass meadows have recommended ssc management targets of 15 mg l 1 or lower to maintain adequate incident light batiuk et al 2000 kenworthy et al 2014 moore et al 1996 and although each meadow s ssc tolerance will differ due to other light attenuating factors such as phytoplankton and epiphytes there is a risk that 15 mg l 1 may not be tolerated in padilla bay if conditions here are similar to the abovementioned studies if no increased sediment supply is provided padilla bay s eelgrass habitat could be retained longer with dike setbacks that allow for upland transgression though this would only be a temporary solution 4 3 future model improvements future model improvements could include modifying plant characteristics to vary seasonally and allowing ssc to vary both seasonally and spatially temperature may also be added as a factor affecting eelgrass growth which the model does not currently consider finally a light attenuation component could also be added to define the upper limit of the eelgrass tolerance for ssc this ssc limit would allow for the identification of the ssc value that optimizes both long term resilience to sea level rise and short term plant productivity particularly if the suspended sediment load were to be altered to improve ecosystem sustainability 5 conclusions we created a hybrid surface elevation model by combining two existing models the marsh equilibrium model mem and relative elevation model rem and modifying it to represent site specific field measurements of plant characteristics and sediment dynamics across an elevation gradient in an intertidal eelgrass meadow the model has been initialized and calibrated to reflect the empirical relationship between stem density and sediment accretion but also maintains plant productivity as a contributor to accreted material suspended sediment concentration ssc and erosion parameters have been added for model initialization the hybrid model also includes both eelgrass species that occur in padilla bay which appear to vary dramatically in their biomass density relationships the inclusion of z japonica may be very important given its relatively high stem densities and the significant effect of stem density on sediment accretion rates as indicated by this study several studies have determined stem density to be an important modulator of sediment accretion rates in coastal wetlands yet the hybrid model as far as we know is the first model of its kind to incorporate density as a controlling factor although the hybrid model was initialized calibrated and validated for padilla bay s eelgrass meadows it was developed with the intention to maximize its applicability to other types of coastal wetlands the model was designed to assess the long term sustainability of any intertidal wetland under a variety of suspended sediment and slr scenarios long term model projections predicted a substantial relative elevation loss particularly at higher elevations for the more conservative slr scenarios projections revealed a reduction in the elevation gradient leveling off near the mllw tide level however simulations using the more extreme and perhaps more likely slr scenarios resulted in a consistent relative elevation loss across the entire elevation gradient given current ssc conditions these more extreme scenarios were predicted to require an ssc up to 15 mg l 1 to remain stable with respect to sea level although this ssc value is nearly four times the current annual mean ssc value of 3 93 mg l 1 in padilla bay it is still lower than typical values seen elsewhere the required ssc conditions may be attainable with the restoration of just a small number of skagit river distributaries however it would first need to be determined whether padilla bay s eelgrass could tolerate this amount of suspended sediment while still meeting its light requirements without the provision of an increased sediment supply padilla bay s eelgrass habitat could be retained longer with dike setbacks that allow for upland transgression though this would only be a temporary solution credit authorship contribution statement katrina l poppe investigation methodology formal analysis validation writing

24434,to assess the effect of sea level rise slr on a 3 800 ha eelgrass meadow in padilla bay national estuarine research reserve in puget sound washington usa we coupled the marsh equilibrium model mem with the relative elevation model rem combining their respective strengths in simulating aboveground and belowground processes we then modified the hybrid model to reflect an empirical relationship between eelgrass stem density and sediment accretion making it the first model of its kind to do so we used field data to initialize and calibrate the model then simulated surface elevation change under various slr and suspended sediment scenarios and tested it against a 12 year surface elevation table dataset from the site 100 year simulations projected relative elevation loss along at least half of the elevation gradient for all slr scenarios and along the entire gradient for three slr scenarios with greater loss at higher elevations the current suspended sediment concentration is thus insufficient for the entire eelgrass meadow to keep pace with slr with up to a four fold increase required however this presents a management conundrum in that the required sediment load may prevent eelgrass from meeting its light requirements the main contributions of this study thus include the novel combination of mem and rem models the inclusion of stem density as a factor controlling accretion the use of a long term data record for model initialization calibration and validation and the finding that increasing sediment inputs to maintain the elevation of the habitat in the long term may be detrimental to eelgrass health in the short term keywords sea level rise seagrass surface elevation model accretion ecogeomorphology 1 introduction coastal wetlands provide numerous ecosystem goods and services costanza et al 2014 but their sustainability is currently under threat from sea level rise and land use change kirwan and megonigal 2013 törnqvist et al 2021 these habitats which include salt marshes tidal forests and seagrass meadows have kept pace with sea level rise slr through system feedbacks involving plant productivity sedimentation and changes in rates of decomposition in response to changing sea levels morris et al 2002 changes in relative elevation affect intertidal plant characteristics which in turn influence sediment dynamics that feed back to alter relative elevation these ecogeomorphic feedbacks have allowed intertidal wetlands to persist in their current location despite changing sea levels for thousands of years kirwan and megonigal 2013 kirwan et al 2016 saintilan et al 2020 however there is likely a threshold rate of slr at which the wetland can no longer accumulate sediment fast enough to maintain equilibrium the plants can no longer thrive and the habitat is converted to open ocean morris et al 2021 while the current rate of slr cannot be controlled we do have more immediate control over local sediment supply two dominant factors causing the drowning of intertidal habitats worldwide are rising sea levels and a paucity of available sediment d alpaos et al 2011 giosan et al 2014 weston 2014 in fact anthropogenic alteration of sediment inputs may be a greater threat to estuarine habitat sustainability than slr kirwan and megonigal 2013 and references therein the widespread reduction in estuarine sediment inputs is caused in many cases by streams and coastlines hardened by dams dikes and levees which reduce natural downstream sediment transport and sediment deposition in the estuaries syvitski et al 2005 although rates of sediment accretion and elevation change are often used to assess the sustainability of coastal wetlands in the face of sea level rise these rates are not the only indicators of future wetland conditions due to the feedbacks between plant growth decomposition sedimentation and sea level models can incorporate these non linear feedbacks and more accurately predict wetland sustainability for a range of slr scenarios several different predictive surface elevation models have been used in recent years to estimate future slr impacts on coastal wetlands rybczyk and callaway 2009 fagherazzi et al 2012 existing surface elevation models vary in their spatial extent and the processes they include zero dimensional surface elevation models have typically fallen into one of two categories focusing on either mineral sedimentation or organic sediment processes rybczyk and callaway 2009 these models have typically included sediment deposition as a linear function of elevation because sediment availability increases with the duration of tidal inundation some of these models have also added the effect of vegetation on accretion rates marani et al 2007 morris et al 2002 mudd et al 2009 swanson et al 2013 including an accretion component modeled as a function of plant biomass or productivity several studies have examined this plant accretion relationship and the mechanisms behind it finding that vegetation plays an important role in facilitating sediment accretion fonseca et al 1982 gacia et al 1999 gacia and duarte 2001 baustian et al 2012 cahoon et al 2020 the hybrid model presented here is a mechanistic non linear zero dimensional model based on two earlier elevation change models the marsh equilibrium model mem from morris et al 2012 and the relative elevation model rem from kairis and rybczyk 2010 the mem is an analytical model originally developed by morris et al 2002 for a south carolina spartina salt marsh it simulates the effects of aboveground plant biomass on accretion and includes suspended sediment concentration ssc as an input allowing for experiment model runs to identify a target ssc the mem was later modified by morris 2006 to include multiple plant species and again by morris et al 2012 to include the growth and decomposition of belowground plant biomass the rem is a mechanistic numerical model originally developed by rybczyk et al 1998 for a louisiana hardwood swamp this model simulates sedimentation as a function of elevation but also includes the simulation of belowground processes such as decomposition and compaction tracking these processes within individual sediment cohorts across depth and time in this way the rem produces a simulated sediment core that can be calibrated against an actual core with commonly measured soil properties such as bulk density organic matter content and porosity whereas the mem focuses on plant roots but does not integrate them into a sediment column that can be used for calibration thus where the mem s strength is in simulating aboveground processes such as plant growth and sediment accretion the rem s strength is in simulating belowground processes such as decomposition and compaction the combination of these two models creates a hybrid that is stronger than its predecessors not only simulating both aboveground and belowground processes in more detail but also providing additional opportunities for model calibration the rem was derived from earlier models by morris and bowden 1986 and callaway et al 1996 the latter being later modified as warmer e g swanson et al 2013 existing surface elevation models have been applied to every coastal wetland type from tidal forests to marshes to seagrass meadows of those three habitat types seagrass meadow elevation change has been relatively under modeled however slr still affects water column light availability which is vital to seagrass productivity green and short 2003 this warrants the application of surface elevation models to seagrass habitats whether intertidal or subtidal kairis and rybczyk 2010 did just that in applying the rem to padilla bay a largely intertidal eelgrass meadow in the northeast pacific projecting shoreward migration and increased total seagrass extent over a 100 year timeframe our objective was to improve upon that study by building and applying a mem rem hybrid model to padilla bay to add the role of eelgrass as a modulator of sediment accretion padilla bay s extensive intertidal seagrass meadow and existing monitoring datasets of plant characteristics suspended sediment and elevation change make it an ideal study site for the application of this model padilla bay is a 4 200 ha estuary in puget sound with over 3 800 ha of eelgrass zostera marina and z japonica making it the largest contiguous seagrass stand on the north american pacific coast bulthuis and shull 2006 these eelgrass habitats support a diverse productive and economically important assemblage of species including oysters clams crabs salmon migratory waterfowl and shorebirds and a variety of marine mammals eelgrass is constrained subtidally by light penetration with depth and by desiccation at the upper limits of the intertidal zone thus any changes in sediment elevation relative to sea level can greatly influence eelgrass distribution and productivity kairis and rybczyk 2010 in padilla bay z japonica is found higher in the intertidal zone than z marina and is considered to be more resistant to desiccation z marina and z japonica are intermixed near the upper distribution limit for z marina and z marina outcompetes z japonica for light in the lower intertidal and subtidal zones bulthuis 1995 padilla bay has been cut off from its skagit river distributaries now filled and converted to farmland that were historically its primary sediment supply this has caused the estuary to become a net erosional system poppe 2016 the former network of wetlands across the skagit floodplain would have also delivered sediment in overland flow during river flood events collins 2000 in addition much of the padilla bay shoreline is modified with dikes that prevent tidal action from reaching upland farms and preventing upslope migration of intertidal wetlands padilla bay s reduced sediment inputs and modified shoreline exemplify a worldwide trend threatening estuarine habitat sustainability the objectives of this modeling study were to 1 develop a hybrid model of surface elevation change by linking two existing models calibrating and possibly even modifying the model structure itself in accordance with site specific field data to apply to padilla bay s intertidal eelgrass habitat 2 simulate long term relative elevation change under a variety of slr scenarios and 3 determine the ssc necessary to maintain a relative elevation equilibrium under each slr scenario 2 materials and methods 2 1 model description we created the hybrid model using select components from both the mem and rem fig 1 the hybrid model was programmed using stella iconographic modeling software high performance systems inc 2002 with a timestep of one week and dt of 0 25 the model was organized with separate mem and rem components with the rem component including sub models for primary productivity sediment dynamics and relative elevation we included the sediment deposition algorithm from the mem which simulates sediment deposition based on plant biomass relative elevation tidal range and ssc the ssc input typically uses measurements of total suspended solids which are more readily available than the sediment deposition rate used as an rem input the mem sediment deposition algorithm is linked to the rem sediment dynamics sub model which decomposes and compacts the organic and mineral soil column inputs the rem relative elevation sub model translates the simulated soil column height into a relative elevation which then feeds into the rem primary productivity sub model and back to the mem sediment deposition sub model the combination of the mem with the rem thus adds another layer to the feedbacks governing relative elevation rather than increasing sediment deposition rates linearly with a decrease in relative elevation the modified mem component adds an increase in sediment deposition with eelgrass stem density which varies non linearly with elevation 2 1 1 marsh equilibrium model mem component 2 1 1 1 sediment deposition sub model we modified the mem component from morris et al 2012 replacing the aboveground biomass variable with stem density based on empirical relationships between sediment accretion biomass stem density and relative elevation in padilla bay fig 2 our field data indicated that stem density rather than biomass or elevation is the primary driver of sediment accretion in this multi species eelgrass meadow see section 2 4 field data several studies have determined stem density to be an important modulator of sediment accretion in coastal wetlands baustian et al 2012 bos et al 2007 gleason et al 1979 hendriks et al 2008 leonard and luther 1995 li and yang 2009 neumeier and ciavola 2004 yet the hybrid model as far as we know is the first model of its kind to incorporate stem density as a controlling factor which is appropriate for a frequently inundated environment where plant litter itself contributes relatively little to accreted material and multiple plant species are present with vastly different biomass density relationships with this and other modifications to allow for a link with the rem component the modified mem component of the hybrid model describes mass based sediment deposition s as if h r 0 d s d t q k p m t h r 2 t else d s d t q k p m t where q is the settling rate of suspended sediments week 1 k is the sediment trapping coefficient cm2 shoot 1 week 1 p is stem density shoots cm 2 m is suspended sediment concentration g cm 3 h r is surface elevation with respect to mllw cm and t is maximum tidal range from mllw mhhw cm elevation dependent stem density p equations were developed for both z marina and z japonica from field based annual mean stem density values along an elevation gradient fig 3 eelgrass occurring above 0 mllw is considered intertidal and at risk of desiccation during exposure while eelgrass below 0 mllw is considered subtidal and at risk of receiving insufficient light for photosynthesis 2 1 2 relative elevation model rem component the rem component of the hybrid model and its three sub models are described by kairis and rybczyk 2010 and again here to note a few modifications the major modification here was the removal of the rem mineral input algorithm to allow mineral inputs to be simulated instead by the mem component as a function of both relative elevation and stem density instead of elevation alone regardless of stem density in an intertidal environment mineral inputs increase as relative elevation decreases due to a longer duration of tidal inundation below mllw however inundation frequency no longer increases and mineral inputs are programmed to be unaffected by relative elevation beyond mllw the mineral input s is delivered at each timestep from the mem component to the surface sediment cohort in the rem sediment dynamics sub model we begin with a description of the primary productivity sub model here as the organic matter produced from that sub model is also an input to the sediment dynamics sub model in addition to the mineral inputs from the mem component 2 1 2 1 primary productivity sub model net primary productivity npp is used in this model to estimate rates of leaf and root litter production which are the predominant sources of organic material to the soil surface and the soil column respectively aboveground biomass was included as a stepwise elevation function based on biomass data from our study sites table 1 npp was modified for this hybrid model to be a function of mean annual aboveground biomass instead of a direct function of relative elevation as kairis and rybczyk 2010 used we derived this npp biomass relationship from field measurements by thom 1990 with separate linear functions for each eelgrass species z marina npp 5 71 biomass z japonica npp 4 68 biomass belowground productivity was calculated as a constant fraction of aboveground productivity based on the annual mean eelgrass root to shoot biomass ratio of 1 34 0 34 from our study sites 2 1 2 2 sediment dynamics sub model the sediment dynamics sub model simulates longer term processes within the sediment column such as decomposition and compaction using mineral and leaf litter inputs from the sediment surface and root inputs within the soil column discrete sediment packets are transferred from the surface cohort to the bottom through 18 cohort layers each cohort is programmed to have unique decomposition rates and transfer rates based on its relative depth within the sediment column while the actual height of each cohort changes over time depending on its content the 18 cohort layers allows for a precise calibration matching the typical resolution and length of field collected sediment cores rybczyk et al 1998 we retained cohort transfer rates from kairis and rybczyk 2010 from the surface to the bottom cohort sediment packets were transferred to the subsequent cohort at a time sequence of 1 5 5 5 5 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 20 20 and 20 years we ran the model for 400 simulated years to build a sediment column to then use as the starting state for calibration and simulation runs simulated bulk density organic and mineral content and porosity of each cohort are used to calibrate this sub model the algorithms for mineral input root distribution and sediment compaction are described below the mineral input s is delivered at each timestep to the surface sediment cohort where it is then transferred to subsequent cohorts at a rate determined by the equation developed by day et al 1999 if n 1 d m n d t s z m n m n else d m n d t z m n 1 m n 1 z m n m n where m n is mineral matter in cohort n g cm 2 s is mineral input at the sediment surface g cm 2 week 1 z m n 1 is the transfer rate of mineral matter from the overlying cohort g cm 2 week 1 m n 1 is mineral matter in the overlying cohort g cm 2 and z m n is the transfer rate of mineral matter to the underlying cohort g cm 2 week 1 shorter time scale transfers allow for better resolution in the upper part of the simulated core where rates of decay and compaction are highest root productivity simulated in the primary productivity sub model is distributed as an exponential decline with depth in the soil column the root distribution equation was developed by morris and bowden 1986 to simulate exponential decline in root biomass at depth h r h s e rh where r h is root biomass at depth h g dw cm 2 s is root biomass at the sediment surface g dw cm 2 r is the root distribution constant cm 1 and h is depth within the sediment column cm root biomass within each cohort was calculated using the following equation from the original rem model rybczyk et al 1998 r i n s e r h b e r h a r where r i n is root input to sediment cohort n g dw cm 2 s is root biomass at the sediment surface g dw cm 2 r is the root distribution constant cm 1 h b is depth to the bottom of cohort n cm and h a is depth to the top of cohort n cm leaf and root litter from the primary productivity sub model were each divided into labile and refractory components to model organic matter decomposition leaf litter was exported to the surface cohort of the sediment dynamics model leaf labile and refractory fractions were determined by kairis and rybczyk 2010 based on a z marina decomposition study that study was also used to determine decomposition rates for surface labile and refractory matter and deep labile and refractory matter kairis and rybczyk 2010 used a standard exponential decay equation with depth in the soil column to determine the values of these constants k 1 ln n t n 0 t where k 1 is the decomposition constant day 1 n t is mass remaining at time t g n 0 is mass at start g and t is time since start days root litter was also divided into labile and refractory components by kairis and rybczyk 2010 using results from a z marina root decomposition study in north carolina kenworthy and thayer 1984 the model uses the following equation from day et al 1999 with each timestep to simulate labile organic matter decomposition and transfer through the sediment column if n 1 d q n d t a 1 f 2 r 1 n f 3 q n k x z l n q n else d q n d t r 1 n f 3 z l n 1 q n 1 q n k x z l n q n where q n is labile organic matter in cohort n g dw

dw cm 2 week 1 the surface decomposition constant for labile organic matter k 2 was used for cohort 1 after which the deep decomposition constant k 3 was used for cohorts 2 18 the decomposition of refractory organic matter was modeled similarly with the following equation from day et al 1999 if n 1 db n dt a 1 1 f 2 r 1 n 1 f 3 b n k i z r n b n else db n dt r 1 n 1 f 3 z r n 1 b n 1 b n k i z

depth simulating pore space within each cohort as a function of the mass of material above it p s n p m p x p m c func n where p s n is pore space in cohort n p m is minimum pore space for the entire sediment column p x is maximum pore space for the entire sediment column and c func n is determined as c func n 1 g n p k g n where c func n is the michaelis menten reduction in pore space unitless g n is the total mass of sediment overlying cohort n g cm 2 and p k is the half saturation compaction constant g cm 2 we determined p m p x and p k from a representative pore space profile from five sediment cores fig 4 with a non linear regression fitting an asymptotic curve to a plot of pore space versus overlying sediment mass porespace a b 1 t m a s s c where porespace is the pore space in a given core section tmass is the total mass above the core section g cm 2 and a b c are fitting parameters with fitting parameters initialized at 0 001 the half saturation compaction constant p k was determined as the total sediment mass above the depth where pore space was halfway between the minimum and maximum values on the fitted curve 2 1 2 3 relative elevation sub model the relative elevation sub model determines relative surface elevation based on the total height of the sediment column exported from the sediment dynamics sub model in addition to changes in water depth using local rates of relative sea level rise rslr and erosion as external forcing functions relative sea level rise is the difference between eustatic sea level rise eslr and local vertical land movement the total height of the sediment column incorporates both accretion and shallow subsidence shallow subsidence here includes the primary compaction decomposition and dewatering characteristic of upper sediments and does not include the secondary compaction geosynclinic downwarping or tectonic activity incorporated into deep subsidence rybczyk and callaway 2009 we modified this sub model from kairis and rybczyk 2010 replacing eslr and deep subsidence with rslr and adding a seasonal erosion forcing function to describe surface elevation relative to mllw h r as h r h t r n i r where h t is total height of the sediment column r is cumulative relative sea level rise n is cumulative erosion and i r is initial elevation relative to mllw we added the erosion term based on field observations of both lost marker horizons and scour at several surface elevation table set sites during the winter erosion was included by removing a constant height from relative elevation for 26 weeks during the winter to allow the system to accrete during the growing season as observed in the field erosion was set to zero at elevations below mllw 2 2 initialization calibration and validation we built the sediment column by running the model for 400 simulated years with a timestep of 1 week the resulting stocks of mineral matter labile organic matter and refractory organic matter in each sediment cohort were then used as starting values for calibration runs we used a 100 year simulation run for model calibration sediment trapping and settling coefficients were adjusted first until the simulated height of the year old surface cohort best approximated field based accretion rates the sediment dynamics sub model was then calibrated by comparing simulated bulk density organic matter and pore space profiles to the mean measured profiles for these same parameters using values from kairis and rybczyk 2010 as starting points decomposition compaction and root distribution constants were adjusted until the simulated profiles matched mean measured profiles within one standard deviation when possible we tested the model by running it for 12 simulated years and compared the simulated rate of relative elevation change to the observed rate from a network of 20 sets measured in 2002 2014 2 3 slr simulations we ran the model for 100 simulated years starting in model year 2002 using six rslr scenarios ranging from the current rate 0 113 cm yr 1 to the highest ipcc rate 0 753 cm yr 1 table 2 ipcc rates of global mean eslr were converted to rslr by subtracting the regional vertical land movement rate of 0 10 cm yr 1 nrc 2012 we then ran experimental simulations to determine the minimum ssc required to maintain relative elevation equilibrium over a 100 year timeframe we performed these experimental simulations separately for the seven initial relative elevations corresponding to the accretion monitoring sites and for each rslr scenario 2 4 field data we used site specific data obtained as part of both this research and other studies for model initialization calibration and validation table 3 measurements of ssc tidal range plant productivity above and belowground biomass and stem density as a function of relative elevation were used to initialize the mem and rem primary productivity sub models wire mesh screens were used as a marker horizon to estimate short term one year accretion rates to calibrate the mem sub model sediment characteristics from cores bulk density organic content and porosity and decomposition studies were used to calibrate the rem sediment dynamics sub model detailed methods and results for the field studies are presented in poppe 2016 for model validation we used a 12 year elevation change dataset from a network of 20 established surface elevation tables sets throughout padilla bay which are devices used to monitor long term surface elevation change relative to a shallow subsurface datum boumans and day 1993 sediment accretion rates and cores were collected from seven sites along an established biomonitoring transect that runs perpendicular to shore to capture the entire intertidal elevation range in the northern portion of padilla bay wa these seven sites along the transect encompassed an elevation range from 80 8 cm mllw to 66 5 cm mllw table 4 with unvegetated mudflat at the highest site to z marina at the lowest site and a mix of z marina and z japonica in between eelgrass biomass and stem density were monitored monthly by the padilla bay national estuarine research reserve pbnerr along the same transect elevation ssc and tidal range data were also obtained from pbnerr 3 results 3 1 validation the validation simulation resulted in a mean elevation change rate of 0 33 0 37 cm yr 1 model performance was evaluated with a resulting efficiency ef of 2 ef is defined by loague and greene 1991 and based on observed values simulated values and the mean of observed values across a range of sites ef was used here because it has also been used by previous versions of the rem rybczyk et al 1998 the ef has an upper limit of 1 and a lower limit of negative infinity an ef value of 1 indicates a perfect match between simulated and observed values 3 2 slr simulations all six rslr scenario projections showed a substantial loss in relative elevation over at least half the transect s elevation gradient while three scenarios predicted relative elevation loss along the entire gradient fig 5 the higher elevation sites particularly the unvegetated mudflat site were predicted to lose the most elevation resulting in an increased cover of z marina and reduced cover of z japonica throughout the bay over a 100 year timeframe for example under the most conservative current rslr scenario the highest site was predicted to lose 38 6 cm in relative elevation while the lowest site would gain 10 8 cm under the most pessimistic ipcc high rslr scenario the highest site would lose 88 6 cm and the lowest site would lose 63 5 cm simulations using the two most conservative rslr scenarios ipcc low and mote revealed some elevation gain at the lower elevations with the threshold between gain and loss at approximately 0 cm mllw all except the two most pessimistic rslr scenarios resulted in a contraction of the transect s elevation gradient around the mllw tide level which is an artifact of the model s elevation threshold for erosion 3 3 experimental ssc simulations the ssc simulations revealed that the current ssc in padilla bay of 3 93 mg l 1 is insufficient for at least some transect sites to remain stable with respect to sea level over a 100 year timeframe under all rslr scenarios and insufficient for all transect sites under the three highest rslr scenarios fig 6 the three lower elevation sites along the transect which experience less erosion are projected to be stable under more conservative scenarios given current ssc conditions the site with the highest relative elevation required substantially more sediment than the other sites up to 300 mg l 1 because this site was located above the limit of eelgrass growth with the exception of this highest site the majority of the eelgrass meadow may remain stable if provided with a suspended sediment concentration of approximately 15 mg l 1 4 discussion 4 1 slr simulations given that recent global mean eslr increases have followed the upper end of previous predictions rahmstorf 2007 the more pessimistic rslr scenarios may in fact be the most likely the elevation loss predicted by the highest rslr scenarios indicates the inability of any ecogeomorphic feedbacks to keep pace with those rates of rslr given current ssc conditions this prediction is not unexpected given the bay s current trend of elevation loss observed at the sets which have shown an average of 0 26 cm yr 1 surface elevation loss over a 12 year period amounting to a 0 37 cm yr 1 loss relative to sea level poppe 2016 under the highest rslr scenarios the z japonica and mudflats are likely to be replaced with z marina by year 2102 and the bay s sediment surface will be entirely at or below the mllw tide level 4 2 experimental ssc simulations the predicted equilibrium ssc of 15 mg l 1 is nearly four times higher than the current ssc but is not outside the realm of possibility for context padilla bay s ssc value is approximately 20 of the low suspended sediment scenario used by morris et al 2002 for the original mem and approximately 5 of their high suspended sediment scenario padilla bay s ssc is much lower than a typical estuary in part because the bay lacks a direct connection to a major river but also because most of its historic indirect river connections have been removed the restoration of some of these skagit river distributaries may be enough to make the bay s eelgrass meadows sustainable at least within a 100 year timeframe however suspended sediment brings with it a risk of blocking incident light and reducing eelgrass photosynthetic capacity ochieng et al 2010 which would be reflected in the model as reduced net primary productivity further research would first be necessary to determine the limit of eelgrass tolerance for ssc here to ensure that any increase in sediment would still permit the eelgrass to meet its light requirements a few studies from other eelgrass meadows have recommended ssc management targets of 15 mg l 1 or lower to maintain adequate incident light batiuk et al 2000 kenworthy et al 2014 moore et al 1996 and although each meadow s ssc tolerance will differ due to other light attenuating factors such as phytoplankton and epiphytes there is a risk that 15 mg l 1 may not be tolerated in padilla bay if conditions here are similar to the abovementioned studies if no increased sediment supply is provided padilla bay s eelgrass habitat could be retained longer with dike setbacks that allow for upland transgression though this would only be a temporary solution 4 3 future model improvements future model improvements could include modifying plant characteristics to vary seasonally and allowing ssc to vary both seasonally and spatially temperature may also be added as a factor affecting eelgrass growth which the model does not currently consider finally a light attenuation component could also be added to define the upper limit of the eelgrass tolerance for ssc this ssc limit would allow for the identification of the ssc value that optimizes both long term resilience to sea level rise and short term plant productivity particularly if the suspended sediment load were to be altered to improve ecosystem sustainability 5 conclusions we created a hybrid surface elevation model by combining two existing models the marsh equilibrium model mem and relative elevation model rem and modifying it to represent site specific field measurements of plant characteristics and sediment dynamics across an elevation gradient in an intertidal eelgrass meadow the model has been initialized and calibrated to reflect the empirical relationship between stem density and sediment accretion but also maintains plant productivity as a contributor to accreted material suspended sediment concentration ssc and erosion parameters have been added for model initialization the hybrid model also includes both eelgrass species that occur in padilla bay which appear to vary dramatically in their biomass density relationships the inclusion of z japonica may be very important given its relatively high stem densities and the significant effect of stem density on sediment accretion rates as indicated by this study several studies have determined stem density to be an important modulator of sediment accretion rates in coastal wetlands yet the hybrid model as far as we know is the first model of its kind to incorporate density as a controlling factor although the hybrid model was initialized calibrated and validated for padilla bay s eelgrass meadows it was developed with the intention to maximize its applicability to other types of coastal wetlands the model was designed to assess the long term sustainability of any intertidal wetland under a variety of suspended sediment and slr scenarios long term model projections predicted a substantial relative elevation loss particularly at higher elevations for the more conservative slr scenarios projections revealed a reduction in the elevation gradient leveling off near the mllw tide level however simulations using the more extreme and perhaps more likely slr scenarios resulted in a consistent relative elevation loss across the entire elevation gradient given current ssc conditions these more extreme scenarios were predicted to require an ssc up to 15 mg l 1 to remain stable with respect to sea level although this ssc value is nearly four times the current annual mean ssc value of 3 93 mg l 1 in padilla bay it is still lower than typical values seen elsewhere the required ssc conditions may be attainable with the restoration of just a small number of skagit river distributaries however it would first need to be determined whether padilla bay s eelgrass could tolerate this amount of suspended sediment while still meeting its light requirements without the provision of an increased sediment supply padilla bay s eelgrass habitat could be retained longer with dike setbacks that allow for upland transgression though this would only be a temporary solution credit authorship contribution statement katrina l poppe investigation methodology formal analysis validation writing
