5670,resource access road crossings are expected to alter peatland hydrological properties by obstructing surface and sub surface water flows we conducted a multi year study at two boreal peatlands a forested bog and a shrubby rich fen near peace river alberta to study the impacts of resource access roads on the hydrology of adjacent peatland field measurements bi weekly depth to water table and hydraulic head one time hydraulic conductivity during the growing seasons may august of 2016 and 2017 were taken from sampling plots representing 1 sides of the road upstream and downstream 2 distance from the road obstruction and 3 distance from culverts compared to the growing season average precipitation for the region of 1 8 mm d 1 the study period had very wet conditions in 2016 3 7 mm d 1 and dry conditions in 2017 1 1 mm d 1 in contrast to our assumptions resource access road disturbed the surface and sub surface water flow at the bog but the effect was minimal at the fen as the road orientation was nearly parallel to the flow direction at the latter at the bog the shallowest depth to water table position was observed at upstream areas closer to the road when culverts were located 20 m distance from transects in contrast when culverts were present 2 m from the transects variation in hydrological conditions between upstream and downstream areas were greatly reduced our work shows road effects on peatland hydrology could be minimized by aligning roads parallel to the water flow direction when possible if water flow is perpendicular to the road adequate spacing and installation of culverts could help to reduce flow obstruction keywords hydrological variation access road boreal peatland hydraulic head water table linear disturbance data availability data used in

marshall et al 1999 the western boreal plains wbp of canada are comprised of 21 365 000 km2 peatland cover types include poor to extremely rich fens saline fens ombrotrophic bogs and minerotrophic swamps chee and vitt 1989 vitt et al 2000 wells et al 2017 peatlands receive water by either precipitation p snowfall and rainfall or by runoff from surrounding areas a portion of which is lost by evapotranspiration et and runoff the remaining water stays either in living organisms or in soil water storage groundwater waddington et al 2015 water sources and hydrological conditions e g water

waddington et al 2015 horizontal groundwater movement in peatlands is controlled by the extent of the saturated soil zone hydraulic head variation hydraulic conductivity and terrain slope ivanov 1981 the groundwater flow patterns hydraulic gradient could either be from the surface of the peat towards deep layers of the peat recharge or the reverse discharge devito and hill 1997 however drought conditions associated with water level drawdown can reverse the flow patterns of peatlands from recharge to discharge areas devito and hill 1997 when peat formation occurs above low permeability mineral soil the vertical flow of groundwater becomes almost negligible under these conditions horizontal flow becomes dominant in the upper layers of the peatland reeve et al 2000 on the other hand moderate rich fens usually have coarse grained substrates that help improve groundwater connectivity and sub surface water table maintenance reeve et al 2000 these systems form on groundwater discharge areas winter et al 2003 and receive solutes and nutrients from surrounding areas reeve et al 2000 in general fens are more resistant to drought because the groundwater discharge from adjacent areas can partially offset water losses siegel and glaser 1987 however this depends on hydrogeologic setting elmes and price 2019 also the spatial connection and strength of groundwater connectivity impacts hydraulic head distribution which in turn influences flow direction and discharge rate t√≥th 1999 winter et al 2001 2003 in the absence of p peatlands that are mainly influenced by local flow systems as opposed regional groundwater flow are more susceptible to vertical flow reversals devito et al 1997 fraser et al 2001 and become recharge zones during periods of water deficiency or water stress alternatively peatlands receiving discharge from the regional flow systems are less influenced by seasonal and annual hydrometeorological variations smerdon et al 2005 across the boreal region and particularly in the wbp peatlands are facing disturbance by the construction of various anthropogenic linear disturbances including seismic lines pipelines winter roads power lines and resource access roads lee and boutin 2005 lovitt et al 2018 plach et al 2017 saraswati et al 2019 strack et al 2018 the present study focuses in particular on resource access roads which are constructed to explore and extract natural resources e g oil gas and forestry lee and boutin 2005 in addition to removing vegetation and the laydown of mineral soil on top of a geotextile layer over peat the compressing of the peat beneath the road itself leads to resource access roads fragmenting the hydrology of peatlands by obstructing surface and sub surface water flows gillies 2011 partington et al 2016 plach et al 2017 patterson and cooper 2007 strack et al 2018 this normally creates flooded conditions in the upstream areas and dry conditions on the downstream side willier 2017 subsidence of the road edges is also possible gillies 2011 few studies have documented potential hydrological impacts of road crossings in canada s peatlands partington et al 2016 although we did not find any comprehensive studies of hydrological impacts of resource access roads from non peatland ecosystems in canada a few studies are available where hydrological impacts of forestry roads have been studied in the u s a e g dutton et al 2005 tague and band 2001 wemple and jones 2003 wemple et al 1996 and in greece soulis et al 2015 however to our knowledge no comprehensive multi year study is available that has quantified these changes in depth to water table dtw and hydraulic gradients in different peatlands linked to or caused by all season resource access roads furthermore it remains unclear whether culverts structures made to connect water flow are mitigating the hydrological impacts of the road in adjacent peatland therefore the objective of this research was to determine the effect of resource access roads on the dtw position and sub surface water flow in boreal forested peatlands by instrumenting transects perpendicular to access roads crossing both a forested bog and shrubby fen we hypothesized that 1 in general there would be higher dtw position in upstream areas and lower dtw in downstream areas these dtw position differences would be greatest closest to the road 2 since fens often have greater near surface water flow we expected that changes to hydraulic gradient would be greater at the fen than bog but these changes would depend on local conditions e g topography underlying substrate 3 finally when culverts are in place some connection will be re established and the predicted hydrologic alterations will be reduced 2 methods 2 1 study sites this research was conducted in two study sites a shrubby rich fen 56 22 09 n and 116 46 12 w and a forested bog 56 21 44 n and 116 47 45 w located in the carmon creek watershed 40 km northeast of the town of peace river alberta canada fig 1 the dominant vegetation in the bog included picea mariana black spruce rhododendron groenlandicum labrador tea vaccinium vitis idaea small cranberry vaccinium oxycoccos bog cranberry rubus chamaemorus cloudberry sphagnum spp and lichens e g cladina stellaris cladina rangiferina and cladina mitis the dominant vegetation in the fen included tall shrubs e g salix spp willow alnus incana grey alder and betula papyrifera paper birch sedges e g carex utriculata beaked sedge carex aquatilis water sedge carex canescens silvery sedge and grasses e g calamagrostis canadensis the average peat depth recorded in the bog and fen was 130 and 110 cm respectively as observed during well piezometer installations mainly clay soil was present below the shallow peat layer in both our study sites the 30 year 1986 2015 normal for daily average air temperature and rainfall during the growing season may to august is 14 1 c and 1 8 mm d 1 respectively at the peace river airport station located at 40 km from study sites environment and climate change canada 2018 compared to 30 year normal climate data recorded growing season may to august daily average rainfall in 2016 growing season 3 7 mm d 1 was substantially wetter and 2017 growing season 1 1 mm d 1 was drier than average therefore our study period represents above and below average precipitation conditions in the area and thus provide a reasonable overview of inter annual variability in the region the potential et rate reported at the peace river airport station was 5 1 mm d 1 in 2016 and 5 8 mm d 1 in 2017 growing season alberta agriculture and forestry 2019 actual et measured in wbp peatlands ranges from 4 8 to 14 4 mm d 1 brown et al 2010 although resource access roads may also affect winter processes such as snow accumulation we chose to focus our measurement on the summer period as our goal was to improve understanding shifts in dtw as this is an important driver of ecosystem functions including plant community microbial activity and peat accumulation our initial measurements in may began when late lying snow was still present at the site suggesting that early season dtw were influenced to some extent by snowmelt but that the main melt period was not included in our study therefore we have likely underestimated the full extent of the road impact which would also include impeded drainage during the main snowmelt period resource access roads were constructed in 2013 and 2014 at the fen and bog respectively the average width of the resource access roads was 15 m 23 m including shoulders and the average height of the road layer was 2 m above the geotextile kevin malone personal communication construction of resource roads in wetlands in northern alberta requires the use of mineral fill material glacial till from nearby borrow pits the mineral aggregate usually consists of a mixture of rock gravel sand and clay a semi permeable geotextile is placed on top of the native material before the mineral fill is placed to prevent substrate mixing and to provide additional loading support the bulk density will vary depending on the exact mix of materials and technical parameters such as permeability and water storage capacity of the aggregate were unavailable culverts were installed at greater than 20 m intervals installed culverts were made up of galvanized steel with 250 mm diameter with estimated maximum water drain capacity of 0 1 m3 s 1 during a heavy rainfall event the upstream and downstream sides of the road were determined based on the average elevation differences across the sites as explained in saraswati et al 2019 while the access road in the fen site is used all year round the road in the bog was newly constructed in the winter of 2014 but was not used for regular traffic during the study years 2 2 field layout and setup to collect data required to examine the first hypothesis i e dtw variation across the road six transects perpendicular to the road 20 m long on each side of the road were established at both study sites in 2015 fig 1 at each transect six water wells constructed of polyvinyl chloride tubing with holes throughout and mesh screen 3 cm internal diameter and a minimum of 1 m long were installed at 2 6 and 20 m from the edge of the road on both sides road disturbed areas fig 1 in addition we installed triplicate wells at 50 m from the road on both sides reference areas and six additional wells between 150 and 300 m away from the road on both sides in both study sites transects located close to culverts 2 m away were considered low impact li while transects located far from culverts 20 m away were considered high impact hi we compared measurement between these transects to test the third hypothesis i e effectiveness of culverts in may june 2016 pressure transducers accuracy 0 05 temperature range 10 to 50 c levelogger solinst canada were installed in additional wells located at 1 15 and 25 m on both sides of the road representing both hi and li transects and one each at 50 m on both study sites for recording dtw position every 30 min we used nests of piezometers to measure hydraulic heads and saturated hydraulic conductivity ksat at depths of 50 100 and 125 cm in the bog and 50 75 and 100 cm in the fen these instruments were installed along a central hi transect transect 3 in both bog and fen and li transect transect 5 in bog and transect 4 in the fen at 2 6 and 20 m from the road on both sides fig 1 similar piezometer nests were installed at 50 m on both sides of the road in the bog and on one side of the road in the fen the water intake length of each piezometer was 20 cm i e the length of perforated areas of the pipe centred at the depth of interest data collected from those instruments were used to test the second hypothesis in 2017 additional wells 1 m long and 3 cm diameter were installed on parallel transects on both sides of the road to evaluate the effect of culverts on dtw positions along the road further testing the third hypothesis at both sites the parallel transects were laid at 1 m perpendicular distance from the edge of the road on both sides in the bog wells were spaced at 10 m intervals extending 70 m from a culvert along the road in the fen wells were spaced at 5 m intervals extending 25 m from a culvert the spacing of the wells was based on the existing gap between adjacent culverts at each site i e 140 m in bog and 50 m in fen 2 3 field measurements the groundwater table position in peatlands is represented either as the dtw position when the groundwater position is measured with reference to the surface or ground water level gwl when the height of the groundwater surface is measured with reference to sea level harris and bryant 2009 we measured dtw bi weekly from may to august september in 2016 and 2017 for all wells except the ones installed in 2017 wells parallel to the road where bi weekly measurements were taken in 2017 only using a hand held blow pipe we did not measure dtw position during winter period as the water in wells was frozen during winter months since most water wells were thawed in may the early measurements of dtw position during the study year are representative of end of the active spring snow melt period field controlled aquifer tests slug test surridge et al 2005 were conducted to determine the ksat of each piezometer in july 2017 with ksat calculated following the method of hvorslev 2051 ground elevation for the piezometer nests and wells was surveyed in 2016 with a trimble r8s real time kinematic global navigation satellite system rtk gnss gps a base station at a nearby known location x y and z was also installed to increase the accuracy of the gps the average horizontal x y and vertical z errors recorded during surveys were 0 87 cm and 1 47 cm respectively a meteorological met station was setup at 4 km away from the study sites the met station measured precipitation ecrn 100 meter usa temperature vp 3 meter usa solar radiation pyr meter usa and soil temperature 5 cm below the surface gs3 meter usa all variables were recorded by a datalogger em50 meter usa hourly for this study daily rainfall data summed to 24 h each day from may to august of both study years was used 2 4 data analysis 2 4 1 topographical variations to prepare topographic maps of the study sites fig 2 we classified ground and non ground airborne lidar data with a point density of 4 pts m 2 the lidar provided by shell canada was collected and pre processed by airborne imaging inc in may 2013 the ground points were converted to a digital elevation model dem in arcmap version 10 3 1 using a triangulation with linear interpolation technique akima 1975 finally contour lines with 0 5 m elevation contour interval were generated from the terrain model by using contour tool of arcmap 10 3 1 that converts raster elevation into contour lines at a specified interval 2 4 2 impact of roads on shallow groundwater flow the sub surface water flow analysis which was performed to test the second hypothesis included calculation of vertical and horizontal hydraulic gradients and horizontal hydraulic fluxes specific groundwater discharge qhor mm day 1 calculated using darcy s law hendriks 2010 for each hydraulic gradient and qhor analysis the bi weekly hydraulic head measurements h may august were used vertical hydraulic gradient of each nest was calculated by taking h differences between two piezometers representing peat layers 50 and 100 cm in both study sites calculations of qhor included the h differences between nests located along the same transect and side of the road e g h difference between nests at 2 m and 20 m on the upstream side of the hi transect for each nest h avg was calculated as the arithmetic means of h measured from all piezometers of that nest due to differences in dtw culvert distance and average surface elevation we calculated weighted harmonic mean ksat separately freeze and cherry 1979 for both upstream hi and li areas and downstream hi and li areas in both study areas the calculated ksat was then used to calculate qhor for that segment of the transect by multiplying it by the horizontal hydraulic gradient freeze and cherry 1979 to estimate the impact of the road on subsurface water flow the qhor of the entire transect was first calculated by determining the hydraulic gradient between upstream 20 m to downstream 20 m separately in both hi qhi and li qli areas fig 1 by using the respective ksat and hydraulic gradients we assume that this represents subsurface discharge through this section of peatland if no road was present assuming the h at 20 m is relatively unaffected by the road secondly the qhor of the upstream area between 20 and 2 m upstream of the road quhi or quli of the respective transects was calculated and subtracted from the qhi or qli to determine the impact of the road

emmeans package lenth 2016 3 results 3 1 site topography both study sites differed in terms of the topography surrounding the roads the bog site showed a gradual decrease in surface elevation from the upstream east to downstream west areas with the slope 0 5 more clearly perpendicular to the road on the northern end of the study site fig 2a in contrast the elevation difference between upstream south and downstream north areas in the fen was minimal fig 2b and slope in the upland on the east side of the fen was nearly parallel to the road 3 2 dtw variations mean dtw of bog 11 3 cm and fen 2 5 cm in 2016 were significantly shallower compared to dtw of bog 19 2 cm z 7 58 p 0 001 and fen 17 9 cm z 13 14 p 0 001 in 2017 the comparison between study sites showed that dtw in the fen was significantly shallower compared to bog in 2016 z 12 04 p 0 001 but not in 2017 z 0 91 p 0 364 using bi weekly dtw observations in the bog conditions within the detailed study area 20 m road disturbed areas from the road were compared to areas 50 reference areas or 150 m away from the road average dtw at 20 m 11 0 1 6 cm and 50 m 16 4 1 7 cm away from the road were significantly shallower than areas 150 m from the road in 2016 z 2 86 p 0 01 z 3 27 p 0 001 respectively in contrast average dtw at 20 2 6 1 5 cm and 50 m 2 6 0 7 cm from the road in 2016 were not significantly different compared to areas located at 150 m from the road z 0 09 p 0 925 in the fen also in 2017 average dtw at 20 m 18 5 0 9 cm from the road was significantly shallower than areas at 50 m away from the road 24 3 1 6 cm z 3 27 p 0 001 in the bog in the fen in 2017 no significant differences z 1 15 p 0 26 were observed between average dtw at 20 m 16 4 1 2 cm and 50 m 22 7 4 4 cm from the road however we did not measure dtw data of wells located at 150 m from the road in 2017 at sites within 20 m of the road disturbed areas in the bog the interaction of side of the road culvert position and distance from the road was significant in 2016 with interactions of side of road and culvert position also significant in both 2016 and 2017 for describing variation in dtw position table 1 fig 3 a in 2017 bog dtw was also significantly related to the interactions of culvert position and distance from the road f2 23 10 47 p 0 02 in general post hoc comparisons showed that at the bog the average dtw on the upstream areas independent of distance from the culvert were significantly shallower than the downstream areas in both 2016 and 2017 p 0 001 table 1 within upstream areas the 2 and 6 m plots were wetter than the 20 m plots in both hi and li transects fig 3a this supported the first hypothesis that dtw would vary across the road with greater differences close to the road the shallowest and deepest dtw were observed at the hi upstream 2 m and hi downstream 2 m plots respectively fig 3a post hoc comparisons also revealed that dtw at li downstream 2 m plots was significantly shallower compared to 6 and 20 m plots at li downstream areas and all plots of hi downstream areas consistent with our third hypothesis this suggested that culverts improved hydrologic connection across the road in contrast at the fen little impact of the road on dtw was observed in both years except that dtw was significantly shallower on the downstream side in 2017 f1 24 5 96 p 0 02 table 1 fig 3b the growing season rainfall pattern had a direct link with dtw as dtw was shallower in 2016 than 2017 corresponding with greater rainfall in 2016 fig 4 similar to the results obtained from the bi weekly dtw measurements the continuous levelogger data recorded along the select hi and li transects also indicated that dtw on the hi upstream areas were shallower close to the road dtw at 1 15 25 m from the road with the opposite trend observed on the downstream side dtw at 1 15 25 m from the road fig 4a to 4 h fig s1 in the bog along the li transects in the bog irrespective of side of the road the dtw position close to the road varied less than that measured at wells further from the road however dtw variations in the fen did not follow a distinct trend related to side of the road or distance from the road and fluctuated in parallel across measured wells fig 5 fig s2 in order to explore the effect of culverts third hypothesis on water table position variation adjacent to the road dtw was measured in a road parallel transect laid at 1 m perpendicular distance from the edge of the road on both sides since small differences in surface topography made interpreting dtw difficult the absolute elevation of the water table ground water level gwl was considered there was a significant interaction between side of the road and distance from the culvert on gwl position f 6 110 23 42 p 0 001 in the bog post hoc analysis showed a significantly shallower gwl 7 5 cm p 0 001 on the upstream areas of the road compared to the downstream areas gwl 27 1 cm with the difference declining closer to the culvert the effectiveness of the culvert for reducing gwl difference between upstream and downstream areas of the bog was greatly reduced 15 m from a culvert fig 6 in contrast a significant pattern of the gwl variation away from the culvert in the fen site was not clear data not shown 3 3 sub surface water flow the average ksat values across all depths and nests of the bog and fen were 2 18 1 24 and 1 85 0 47 cm h 1 respectively at the bog high ksat was measured at some 50 cm piezometers but variation at this depth was high table 2 therefore although there was a general pattern of decline of ksat with depth at the bog there was no significant effect of depth of piezometer f2 29 1 82 p 0 19 there was also no significant impact of side of the road f1 29 2 23 p 0 15 distance from culvert f1 29 0 50 p 0 61 or distance from road f2 29 0 63 p 0 35 in the bog however in the fen the ksat values varied with depth p 0 01 f2 24 19 7 but did not vary by side of the road culvert distance and distance from the road p 0 05 fen ksat values were significantly higher in the 50 cm piezometer and gradually decreased with depth table 2 throughout the study seasons of both 2016 and 2017 h corresponded with rainfall increasing following rainfall events observed in 2016 and gradually declining when rainfall was not frequent as observed in 2017 at the bog h followed a linear trend with a gradual decrease in magnitude from upstream areas towards the downstream areas far from the road in the bog similar trends were observed in the fen in 2016 and 2017 in general prominent vertical discharge groundwater moving to the surface was evident until the end of june in both study sites fig 4i to 4p 5i to 5p at the bog there was a greater upward flux on the upstream side and close to the road areas and even greater upward flux at the li transects in contrast after mid summer 210 day the year the vertical gradient was downward groundwater recharge from 50 cm to 100 cm depth with changes corresponding to rainfall events both in bog fig 4i to 4p and fen fig 5i to 5p with the exception of the bog hi transect t3 in 2016 which remained mostly unchanged throughout the season also in the fen in 2017 vertical discharge corresponded to little or no rainfall in the late season fig 5p differences in vertical hydraulic gradients relative to the road were further supported by evidence that horizontal flow was disturbed by the road with instances of flow reversals observed on both upstream and downstream areas of both bog and fen particularly during the dry period fig 6a and b this was consistent with our second hypothesis that the road would alter local hydraulic gradients the general slope of the water table across the sites particularly at the bog indicated that flow should occur from upstream to downstream areas however the qhor analyses showed that water was reversing back from the edges of the road on the upstream areas while on the downstream areas the water was reversing towards the edge of the road when culverts were not connecting upstream and downstream areas in the bog the reverse flow was also observed on the downstream side of the road at the li transect in both years shifts in hydraulic gradient greatly reduced subsurface discharge through this section of the bog impacts of the road on the subsurface water flow were observed on both sides of the bog in 2017 but the effects varied between hi and li transects the impact on the hi transect irhi 5 53 mm day 1 was nine times higher t 8 09 p 0 001 than the impact on the li transects irli 0 63 mm day 1 in contrast the impact of the road on the subsurface water flow was minimal in the fen in 2017 irhi 1 03 mm day 1 irli 0 31 mm day 1 t 0 96 p 0 17 4 discussion 4 1 the effect of access road crossings on peatland dtw the previous studies on the construction of roads across peatlands in canada suggest that road crossings result in disturbed hydrological properties including altered surface and sub surface water flow between the peatland on either side of the road gillies 2011 partington et al 2016 partington and clayton 2012 plach et al 2017 strack et al 2018 in our study sites the impacts of the road on the summer dtw and sub surface water flow were detected up to 20 m from the road in the bog in both study years but not in the fen mainly due to the flow direction in the fen being nearly parallel to the road however the lateral extent of this impact varies within and between study sites due to local conditions including culvert position and road alignment with respect to the flow direction interactive effects of side of the road and culvert position were observed in both 2016 and 2017 and culvert position and distance from the road in 2017 on dtw in the bog the observed average dtw positions on the upstream areas plots at 2 and 6 m from the road were significantly shallower than the 20 m plots in both hi and li downstream this implies that the presence of a road impeded surface and sub surface water flow and disconnected the upstream and downstream areas consequently flooded conditions on the upstream areas closer to the road and the drying of the downstream areas were evident in hi transects however in li transects of the bog the observed shallower dtw on the downstream areas closer to the road indicate the culverts helped in connecting surface and sub surface water flow still the water was not effectively distributed further from the culvert openings the elevation was lower surrounding the culvert openings due to peat removal while installing culverts and this made the channelled water moving through the culvert pool near the culvert opening this suggests that while culverts are partially effective in reducing hydrologic impacts they are too far spaced and or installed at improper elevation to maintain hydrologic connectivity at the bog studied here results at the bog were in line with plach et al 2017 who also observed impeded water flows between road fragmented parts of a peatland located 50 km south of fort mcmurray alberta canada with the significantly shallower dtw in the upstream areas compared to dtw in the downstream areas in contrast to the bog the impact of the road on the surface and sub surface water flow was not significant at the fen in both years and that could be because the road in the fen is aligned nearly parallel to the water flow direction fig 2b therefore orientation of the road relative to local topography was more important in our study than peatland type for determining the hydrological impact 4 2 the effect of access road crossings on hydraulic gradients in adjacent peatland in undisturbed peatlands hydraulic gradients generally follow local topography siegel and glaser 1987 in contrast to that we observed frequent flow reversals in both upstream and downstream areas of the bog under normal conditions the water should always flow towards the road edges in the upstream areas as the road edges are at lower elevation than areas upstream of them by natural orientation and also as a result of compaction however during high rainfall periods the damming effect of the road resulted in elevated h close to the road particularly at hi upstream areas because of the absence of culverts this damming effect also resulted in much drier conditions on the downstream areas nearest to the road causing low h thus those areas received water from further downstream areas in the absence of rainfall bog li downstream areas also experienced a flow reversal that was likely caused primarily by peat removal surrounding the culvert opening compared to the downstream areas away from the road this resulted in lower ground elevation on the road edges around the culverts up to 1 m the observed variation in the vertical recharge discharge among transects in both study sites could be linked with rainfall culvert position and peat thawing patterns throughout the growing seasons except in road adjacent 2 m areas in road adjacent areas the compression and subsidence of the peat beneath the road blocked the surface and sub surface water flow leading to dtw positions near or at the surface gillies 2011 patterson and cooper 2007 mainly the discharge observed until mid growing season can be associated with the frozen peat layers below 50 cm of the peat which obstruct downward water movement also enhanced radiative fluxes because of the vegetation clearance during road construction on the upstream areas resulted in early thawing of the upper peat layers which contributed more to surface than vertical flow quinton et al 2009 as deeper peat layers start thawing the water starts moving towards surface peat layers contributing to more discharge connon et al 2014 we saw prominent vertical discharge groundwater moving to the surface in the fen in 2017 which could instead be due to no rainfall in the late growing season of 2017 fig 5p and water deficiency led to groundwater discharge as fens get water from both p and groundwater flow vertical reversals due to water deficiency or dtw drawdown have also been found in peatlands isolated from regional groundwater flow systems devito et al 1997 however the groundwater recharge observed later in the growing season corresponded mainly to rainfall events and high hydraulic gradients both in bog and fen i e rainfall events resulted in groundwater recharge fraser et al 2001 also found a shift in groundwater flow patterns at mer bleue bog ontario canada mainly due to low p high et and differential peat depth h response we found that the upstream areas of the bog in 2016 had dtw close to the surface and were mostly vertical discharge zones irrespective of the rainfall amounts this is because peat layers in those areas were mostly water saturated leading to surface flow and no further recharge holden and burt 2003 the shift to predominantly recharge on the hi upstream side of the bog in the much drier 2017 indicates that et which results in water deficits and deeper dtw plays a role in the effect of the road on subsurface flow patterns our study focused on the local impacts of the road crossings on hydrological conditions in the peatland immediately adjacent to the road however resource access roads are generally part of a larger network of disturbances including additional roads geologic exploration features forestry cut blocks oil well pads and associated processing facilities e g pasher et al 2013 we detected significant changes in dtw only at the bog and then only within 20 50 m from the road indicating limited evidence of shifts in regional hydrology at our study sites yet the cumulative impact of the existing network of disturbances remains unclear webster et al 2015 and its impact on regional hydrology requires further study 4 3 effectiveness of culverts for mitigating road associated hydrologic changes although likely too widely spaced particularly in the bog our study showed that culverts can help to connect the surface and sub surface water flow between fragmented peatland areas when installed at the correct height the road was calculated to have greatly reduced daily flow 5 mm d 1 in the bog when culverts were not present however the water storage difference on the upstream areas was only 2 56 mm d 1 indicating approximately half of the blocked water was lost from the upstream areas greater et and flow reversals as observed in our study could have contributed to the enhanced loss of the water from this zone studies have shown that the et which may range from 4 8 mm d 1 to 14 4 mm d 1 in wbp peatlands brown et al 2010 significantly lowers the dtw in wbp peatlands in the late growing season price 2003 reeve et al 2006 increased et in the bog hi upstream areas can be associated with the greater solar radiation warmer conditions and windier conditions on the open flooded areas petrone et al 2007 waddington et al 2009 and colonisation by sedges resulting in higher transpiration losses waddington et al 2009 our study focused largely on shifts to summertime hydrological conditions as our goal was to quantify changes to dtw and corresponding linkages to subsurface water flow during the time of year when impact to plant communities and microbial activity were likely to be most severe however given the importance of snow cover and frozen soil conditions to hydrology in the region ireson et al 2015 wintertime and melt period processes are also likely to contribute to the impact of resource access roads on peatland hydrology we observed differences in ground ice thawing depending on position relative to the road with generally earlier thaw in flooded upstream areas close to the road at the bog data not shown snow accumulation and ablation likely also varies between road adjacent areas and undisturbed conditions due to shifts in vegetation communities related both to clearing during road construction and in response to changing dtw future research on all of these processes is needed to fully quantify the hydrological impact of resource access roads in the landscape the effectiveness of the culverts depends on micro topographical variations proper installation and adequate numbers of culverts orientation of the road water flow direction and wetland type e g bog fen swamps etc willier 2017 in general culverts in peatlands are installed at an interval of 100 to 250 m if ponding conditions are expected partington et al 2016 however this interval distance cannot always provide effective hydrological connection across the road as results here showed that culverts may connect water movements up to 15 m distance provided that the water flow direction is perpendicular to the access road decisions on culvert spacing or the need to add culverts are generally based on avoiding damage to the road and maintaining use but persistent changes to dtw in peatland can have profound impacts on the adjacent peatland function including plant community carbon cycling and greenhouse gas exchange miller et al 2015 saraswati et al 2019 saraswati and strack 2019 this suggests that mitigating shifts to dtw as much as possible should be the goal the specific spacing and size of culverts will ultimately depend on expected water flow perpendicular to the road which will be driven by local slope and hydraulic conductivity therefore in the fen culverts had little effect on water flow as the slope of the road was mostly parallel to the flow direction also though not observed in our study sites the effectiveness of culverts can be significantly reduced when the culverts are blocked by factors such as beavers bocking et al 2017 mineral soil deposition or the subsidence of the road edges gillies 2011 partington and clayton 2012 or uneven compression of the culverts partington et al 2016 further the compression of the peat and or additions of dust and fine particles due to the road can lower ksat on the surface of the peat resulting in further reductions in surface and sub surface flow 5 conclusions in this study we hypothesized that resource access road crossings would lead to depth to water table variation between fragmented parts of the adjacent peatland with the possibility of flow reversals but that the culverts would reduce the hydrological impacts we observed that the construction of resource access roads disturbed surface and sub surface water flow at the bog but the effect was minimal at the fen the observed hydrological variation in bog supported all the hypotheses examined in this study and the variations were primarily linked to the road aligned perpendicular to the water flow direction and the culvert position overall at the bog the shallowest and deepest depth to water table positions were measured in transects far from culverts at the high impact upstream 2 m and high impact downstream 2 m plots respectively in the bog the road greatly reduced daily flow 5 mm d 1 in high impact areas although culverts were shown to improve hydrologic connection across the road we also observed that culverts provide a point source of water to downstream areas in peatlands with chances of water not redistributing well therefore the first option is to avoid the construction of access roads across peatlands however if this is not possible using more permeable road designs permeable fills building on a corduroy base or brush mats and rock fills would be beneficial such options will improve hydrologic connections as well as enhance the bearing capacity of roads therefore there is a need for further hydrological studies on more permeable road designs across peatlands credit authorship contribution statement ss ms gjm bx mmr

5670,resource access road crossings are expected to alter peatland hydrological properties by obstructing surface and sub surface water flows we conducted a multi year study at two boreal peatlands a forested bog and a shrubby rich fen near peace river alberta to study the impacts of resource access roads on the hydrology of adjacent peatland field measurements bi weekly depth to water table and hydraulic head one time hydraulic conductivity during the growing seasons may august of 2016 and 2017 were taken from sampling plots representing 1 sides of the road upstream and downstream 2 distance from the road obstruction and 3 distance from culverts compared to the growing season average precipitation for the region of 1 8 mm d 1 the study period had very wet conditions in 2016 3 7 mm d 1 and dry conditions in 2017 1 1 mm d 1 in contrast to our assumptions resource access road disturbed the surface and sub surface water flow at the bog but the effect was minimal at the fen as the road orientation was nearly parallel to the flow direction at the latter at the bog the shallowest depth to water table position was observed at upstream areas closer to the road when culverts were located 20 m distance from transects in contrast when culverts were present 2 m from the transects variation in hydrological conditions between upstream and downstream areas were greatly reduced our work shows road effects on peatland hydrology could be minimized by aligning roads parallel to the water flow direction when possible if water flow is perpendicular to the road adequate spacing and installation of culverts could help to reduce flow obstruction keywords hydrological variation access road boreal peatland hydraulic head water table linear disturbance data availability data used in

marshall et al 1999 the western boreal plains wbp of canada are comprised of 21 365 000 km2 peatland cover types include poor to extremely rich fens saline fens ombrotrophic bogs and minerotrophic swamps chee and vitt 1989 vitt et al 2000 wells et al 2017 peatlands receive water by either precipitation p snowfall and rainfall or by runoff from surrounding areas a portion of which is lost by

waddington et al 2015 horizontal groundwater movement in peatlands is controlled by the extent of the saturated soil zone hydraulic head variation hydraulic conductivity and terrain slope ivanov 1981 the groundwater flow patterns hydraulic gradient could either be from the surface of the peat towards deep layers of the peat recharge or the reverse discharge devito and hill 1997 however drought conditions associated with water level drawdown can reverse the flow patterns of peatlands from recharge to discharge areas devito and hill 1997 when peat formation occurs above low permeability mineral soil the vertical flow of groundwater becomes almost negligible under these conditions horizontal flow becomes dominant in the upper layers of the peatland reeve et al 2000 on the other hand moderate rich fens usually have coarse grained substrates that help improve groundwater connectivity and sub surface water table maintenance reeve et al 2000 these systems form on groundwater discharge areas winter et al 2003 and receive solutes and nutrients from surrounding areas reeve et al 2000 in general fens are more resistant to drought because the groundwater discharge from adjacent areas can partially offset water losses siegel and glaser 1987 however this depends on hydrogeologic setting elmes and price 2019 also the spatial connection and strength of groundwater connectivity impacts hydraulic head distribution which in turn influences flow direction and discharge rate t√≥th 1999 winter et al 2001 2003 in the absence of p peatlands that are mainly influenced by local flow systems as opposed regional groundwater flow are more susceptible to vertical flow reversals devito et al 1997 fraser et al 2001 and become recharge zones during periods of water deficiency or water stress alternatively peatlands receiving discharge from the regional flow systems are less influenced by seasonal and annual hydrometeorological variations smerdon et al 2005 across the boreal region and particularly in the wbp peatlands are facing disturbance by the construction of various anthropogenic linear disturbances including seismic lines pipelines winter roads power lines and resource access roads lee and boutin 2005 lovitt et al 2018 plach et al 2017 saraswati et al 2019 strack et al 2018 the present study focuses in particular on resource access roads which are constructed to explore and extract natural resources e g oil gas and forestry lee and boutin 2005 in addition to removing vegetation and the laydown of mineral soil on top of a geotextile layer over peat the compressing of the peat beneath the road itself leads to resource access roads fragmenting the hydrology of peatlands by obstructing surface and sub surface water flows gillies 2011 partington et al 2016 plach et al 2017 patterson and cooper 2007 strack et al 2018 this normally creates flooded conditions in the upstream areas and dry conditions on the downstream side willier 2017 subsidence of the road edges is also possible gillies 2011 few studies have documented potential hydrological impacts of road crossings in canada s peatlands partington et al 2016 although we did not find any comprehensive studies of hydrological impacts of resource access roads from non peatland ecosystems in canada a few studies are available where hydrological impacts of forestry roads have been studied in the u s a e g dutton et al 2005 tague and band 2001 wemple and jones 2003 wemple et al 1996 and in greece soulis et al 2015 however to our knowledge no comprehensive multi year study is available that has quantified these changes in depth to water table dtw and hydraulic gradients in different peatlands linked to or caused by all season resource access roads furthermore it remains unclear whether culverts structures made to connect water flow are mitigating the hydrological impacts of the road in adjacent peatland therefore the objective of this research was to determine the effect of resource access roads on the dtw position and sub surface water flow in boreal forested peatlands by instrumenting transects perpendicular to access roads crossing both a forested bog and shrubby fen we hypothesized that 1 in general there would be higher dtw position in upstream areas and lower dtw in downstream areas these dtw position differences would be greatest closest to the road 2 since fens often have greater near surface water flow we expected that changes to hydraulic gradient would be greater at the fen than bog but these changes would depend on local conditions e g topography underlying substrate 3 finally when culverts are in place some connection will be re established and the predicted hydrologic alterations will be reduced 2 methods 2 1 study sites this research was conducted in two study sites a shrubby rich fen 56 22 09 n and 116 46 12 w and a forested bog 56 21 44 n and 116 47 45 w located in the carmon creek watershed 40 km northeast of the town of peace river alberta canada fig 1 the dominant vegetation in the bog included picea mariana black spruce rhododendron groenlandicum labrador tea vaccinium vitis idaea small cranberry vaccinium oxycoccos bog cranberry rubus chamaemorus cloudberry sphagnum spp and lichens e g cladina stellaris cladina rangiferina and cladina mitis the dominant vegetation in the fen included tall shrubs e g salix spp willow alnus incana grey alder and betula papyrifera paper birch sedges e g carex utriculata beaked sedge carex aquatilis water sedge carex canescens silvery sedge and grasses e g calamagrostis canadensis the average peat depth recorded in the bog and fen was 130 and 110 cm respectively as observed during well piezometer installations mainly clay soil was present below the shallow peat layer in both our study sites the 30 year 1986 2015 normal for daily average air temperature and rainfall during the growing season may to august is 14 1 c and 1 8 mm d 1 respectively at the peace river airport station located at 40 km from study sites environment and climate change canada 2018 compared to 30 year normal climate data recorded growing season may to august daily average rainfall in 2016 growing season 3 7 mm d 1 was substantially wetter and 2017 growing season 1 1 mm d 1 was drier than average therefore our study period represents above and below average precipitation conditions in the area and thus provide a reasonable overview of inter annual variability in the region the potential et rate reported at the peace river airport station was 5 1 mm d 1 in 2016 and 5 8 mm d 1 in 2017 growing season alberta agriculture and forestry 2019 actual et measured in wbp peatlands ranges from 4 8 to 14 4 mm d 1 brown et al 2010 although resource access roads may also affect winter processes such as snow accumulation we chose to focus our measurement on the summer period as our goal was to improve understanding shifts in dtw as this is an important driver of ecosystem functions including plant community microbial activity and peat accumulation our initial measurements in may began when late lying snow was still present at the site suggesting that early season dtw were influenced to some extent by snowmelt but that the main melt period was not included in our study therefore we have likely underestimated the full extent of the road impact which would also include impeded drainage during the main snowmelt period resource access roads were constructed in 2013 and 2014 at the fen and bog respectively the average width of the resource access roads was 15 m 23 m including shoulders and the average height of the road layer was 2 m above the geotextile kevin malone personal communication construction of resource roads in wetlands in northern alberta requires the use of mineral fill material glacial till from nearby borrow pits the mineral aggregate usually consists of a mixture of rock gravel sand and clay a semi permeable geotextile is placed on top of the native material before the mineral fill is placed to prevent substrate mixing and to provide additional loading support the bulk density will vary depending on the exact mix of materials and technical parameters such as permeability and water storage capacity of the aggregate were unavailable culverts were installed at greater than 20 m intervals installed culverts were made up of galvanized steel with 250 mm diameter with estimated maximum water drain capacity of 0 1 m3 s 1 during a heavy rainfall event the upstream and downstream sides of the road were determined based on the average elevation differences across the sites as explained in saraswati et al 2019 while the access road in the fen site is used all year round the road in the bog was newly constructed in the winter of 2014 but was not used for regular traffic during the study years 2 2 field layout and setup to collect data required to examine the first hypothesis i e dtw variation across the road six transects perpendicular to the road 20 m long on each side of the road were established at both study sites in 2015 fig 1 at each transect six water wells constructed of polyvinyl chloride tubing with holes throughout and mesh screen 3 cm internal diameter and a minimum of 1 m long were installed at 2 6 and 20 m from the edge of the road on both sides road disturbed areas fig 1 in addition we installed triplicate wells at 50 m from the road on both sides reference areas and six additional wells between 150 and 300 m away from the road on both sides in both study sites transects located close to culverts 2 m away were considered low impact li while transects located far from culverts 20 m away were considered high impact hi we compared measurement between these transects to test the third hypothesis i e effectiveness of culverts in may june 2016 pressure transducers accuracy 0 05 temperature range 10 to 50 c levelogger solinst canada were installed in additional wells located at 1 15 and 25 m on both sides of the road representing both hi and li transects and one each at 50 m on both study sites for recording dtw position every 30 min we used nests of piezometers to measure hydraulic heads and saturated hydraulic conductivity ksat at depths of 50 100 and 125 cm in the bog and 50 75 and 100 cm in the fen these instruments were installed along a central hi transect transect 3 in both bog and fen and li transect transect 5 in bog and transect 4 in the fen at 2 6 and 20 m from the road on both sides fig 1 similar piezometer nests were installed at 50 m on both sides of the road in the bog and on one side of the road in the fen the water intake length of each piezometer was 20 cm i e the length of perforated areas of the pipe centred at the depth of interest data collected from those instruments were used to test the second hypothesis in 2017 additional wells 1 m long and 3 cm diameter were installed on parallel transects on both sides of the road to evaluate the effect of culverts on dtw positions along the road further testing the third hypothesis at both sites the parallel transects were laid at 1 m perpendicular distance from the edge of the road on both sides in the bog wells were spaced at 10 m intervals extending 70 m from a culvert along the road in the fen wells were spaced at 5 m intervals extending 25 m from a culvert the spacing of the wells was based on the existing gap between adjacent culverts at each site i e 140 m in bog and 50 m in fen 2 3 field measurements the groundwater table position in peatlands is represented either as the dtw position when the groundwater position is measured with reference to the surface or ground water level gwl when the height of the groundwater surface is measured with reference to sea level harris and bryant 2009 we measured dtw bi weekly from may to august september in 2016 and 2017 for all wells except the ones installed in 2017 wells parallel to the road where bi weekly measurements were taken in 2017 only using a hand held blow pipe we did not measure dtw position during winter period as the water in wells was frozen during winter months since most water wells were thawed in may the early measurements of dtw position during the study year are representative of end of the active spring snow melt period field controlled aquifer tests slug test surridge et al 2005 were conducted to determine the ksat of each piezometer in july 2017 with ksat calculated following the method of hvorslev 2051 ground elevation for the piezometer nests and wells was surveyed in 2016 with a trimble r8s real time kinematic global navigation satellite system rtk gnss gps a base station at a nearby known location x y and z was also installed to increase the accuracy of the gps the average horizontal x y and vertical z errors recorded during surveys were 0 87 cm and 1 47 cm respectively a meteorological met station was setup at 4 km away from the study sites the met station measured precipitation ecrn 100 meter usa temperature vp 3 meter usa solar radiation pyr meter usa and soil temperature 5 cm below the surface gs3 meter usa all variables were recorded by a datalogger

maps of the study sites fig 2 we classified ground and non ground airborne lidar data with a point density of 4 pts m 2 the lidar provided by shell canada was collected and pre processed by airborne imaging inc in may 2013 the ground points were converted to a digital elevation model dem in arcmap version 10 3 1 using a triangulation with linear interpolation technique akima 1975 finally contour lines with 0 5 m elevation contour interval were generated from the terrain model by using contour tool of arcmap 10 3 1 that converts raster elevation into contour lines at a specified interval 2 4 2 impact of roads on shallow groundwater flow the sub surface water flow analysis which was performed to test the second hypothesis included calculation of vertical and horizontal hydraulic gradients and horizontal hydraulic fluxes specific groundwater discharge qhor mm day 1 calculated using darcy s law hendriks 2010 for each hydraulic gradient and qhor analysis the bi weekly hydraulic head measurements h may august were used vertical hydraulic gradient of each nest was calculated by taking h differences between two piezometers representing peat layers 50 and 100 cm in both study sites calculations of qhor included the h differences between nests located along the same transect and side of the road e g h difference between nests at 2 m and 20 m on the upstream side of the hi transect for each nest h avg was calculated as the arithmetic means of h measured from all piezometers of that nest due to differences in dtw culvert distance and average surface elevation we calculated weighted harmonic mean ksat separately freeze and cherry 1979 for both upstream hi and li areas and downstream hi and li areas in both study areas the calculated ksat was then used to calculate qhor for that segment of the transect by multiplying it by the horizontal hydraulic gradient freeze and cherry 1979 to estimate the impact of the road on subsurface water flow the qhor of the entire transect was first calculated by determining the hydraulic gradient between upstream 20 m to downstream 20 m separately in both hi qhi and li qli areas fig 1 by using the respective ksat and hydraulic gradients we assume that this represents subsurface discharge through this section of peatland if no road was present assuming the h at 20 m is relatively unaffected by the road secondly the qhor of the upstream area between 20 and 2 m upstream of the road quhi or quli of the respective transects was calculated and subtracted from the qhi or qli to determine the impact of the road

emmeans package lenth 2016 3 results 3 1 site topography both study sites differed in terms of the topography surrounding the roads the bog site showed a gradual decrease in surface elevation from the upstream east to downstream west areas with the slope 0 5 more clearly perpendicular to the road on the northern end of the study site fig 2a in contrast the elevation difference between upstream south and downstream north areas in the fen was minimal fig 2b and slope in the upland on the east side of the fen was nearly parallel to the road 3 2 dtw variations mean dtw of bog 11 3 cm and fen 2 5 cm in 2016 were significantly shallower compared to dtw of bog 19 2 cm z 7 58 p 0 001 and fen 17 9 cm z 13 14 p 0 001 in 2017 the comparison between study sites showed that dtw in the fen was significantly shallower compared to bog in 2016 z 12 04 p 0 001 but not in 2017 z 0 91 p 0 364 using bi weekly dtw observations in the bog conditions within the detailed study area 20 m road disturbed areas from the road were compared to areas 50 reference areas or 150 m away from the road average dtw at 20 m 11 0 1 6 cm and 50 m 16 4 1 7 cm away from the road were significantly shallower than areas 150 m from the road in 2016 z 2 86 p 0 01 z 3 27 p 0 001 respectively in contrast average dtw at 20 2 6 1 5 cm and 50 m 2 6 0 7 cm from the road in 2016 were not significantly different compared to areas located at 150 m from the road z 0 09 p 0 925 in the fen also in 2017 average dtw at 20 m 18 5 0 9 cm from the road was significantly shallower than areas at 50 m away from the road 24 3 1 6 cm z 3 27 p 0 001 in the bog in the fen in 2017 no significant differences z 1 15 p 0 26 were observed between average dtw at 20 m 16 4 1 2 cm and 50 m 22 7 4 4 cm from the road however we did not measure dtw data of wells located at 150 m from the road in 2017 at sites within 20 m of the road disturbed areas in the bog the interaction of side of the road culvert position and distance from the road was significant in 2016 with interactions of side of road and culvert position also significant in both 2016 and 2017 for describing variation in dtw position table 1 fig 3 a in 2017 bog dtw was also significantly related to the interactions of culvert position and distance from the road f2 23 10 47 p 0 02 in general post hoc comparisons showed that at the bog the average dtw on the upstream areas independent of distance from the culvert were significantly shallower than the downstream areas in both 2016 and 2017 p 0 001 table 1 within upstream areas the 2 and 6 m plots were wetter than the 20 m plots in both hi and li transects fig 3a this supported the first hypothesis that dtw would vary across the road with greater differences close to the road the shallowest and deepest dtw were observed at the hi upstream 2 m and hi downstream 2 m plots respectively fig 3a post hoc comparisons also revealed that dtw at li downstream 2 m plots was significantly shallower compared to 6 and 20 m plots at li downstream areas and all plots of hi downstream areas consistent with our third hypothesis this suggested that culverts improved hydrologic connection across the road in contrast at the fen little impact of the road on dtw was observed in both years except that dtw was significantly shallower on the downstream side in 2017 f1 24 5 96 p 0 02 table 1 fig 3b the growing season rainfall pattern had a direct link with dtw as dtw was shallower in 2016 than 2017 corresponding with greater rainfall in 2016 fig 4 similar to the results obtained from the bi weekly dtw measurements the continuous levelogger data recorded along the select hi and li transects also indicated that dtw on the hi upstream areas were shallower close to the road dtw at 1 15 25 m from the road with the opposite trend observed on the downstream side dtw at 1 15 25 m from the road fig 4a to 4 h fig s1 in the bog along the li transects in the bog irrespective of side of the road the dtw position close to the road varied less than that measured at wells further from the road however dtw variations in the fen did not follow a distinct trend related to side of the road or distance from the road and fluctuated in parallel across measured wells fig 5 fig s2 in order to explore the effect of culverts third hypothesis on water table position variation adjacent to the road dtw was measured in a road parallel transect laid at 1 m perpendicular distance from the edge of the road on both sides since small differences in surface topography made interpreting dtw difficult the absolute elevation of the water table ground water level gwl was considered there was a significant interaction between side of the road and distance from the culvert on gwl position f 6 110 23 42 p 0 001 in the bog post hoc analysis showed a significantly shallower gwl 7 5 cm p 0 001 on the upstream areas of the road compared to the downstream areas gwl 27 1 cm with the difference declining closer to the culvert the effectiveness of the culvert for reducing gwl difference between upstream and downstream areas of the bog was greatly reduced 15 m from a culvert fig 6 in contrast a significant pattern of the gwl variation away from the culvert in the fen site was not clear data not shown 3 3 sub surface water flow the average ksat values across all depths and nests of the bog and fen were 2 18 1 24 and 1 85 0 47 cm h 1 respectively at the bog high ksat was measured at some 50 cm piezometers but variation at this depth was high table 2 therefore although there was a general pattern of decline of ksat with depth at the bog there was no significant effect of depth of piezometer f2 29 1 82 p 0 19 there was also no significant impact of side of the road f1 29 2 23 p 0 15 distance from culvert f1 29 0 50 p 0 61 or distance from road f2 29 0 63 p 0 35 in the bog however in the fen the ksat values varied with depth p 0 01 f2 24 19 7 but did not vary by side of the road culvert distance and distance from the road p 0 05 fen ksat values were significantly higher in the 50 cm piezometer and gradually decreased with depth table 2 throughout the study seasons of both 2016 and 2017 h corresponded with rainfall increasing following rainfall events observed in 2016 and gradually declining when rainfall was not frequent as observed in 2017 at the bog h followed a linear trend with a gradual decrease in magnitude from upstream areas towards the downstream areas far from the road in the bog similar trends were observed in the fen in 2016 and 2017 in general prominent vertical discharge groundwater moving to the surface was evident until the end of june in both study sites fig 4i to 4p 5i to 5p at the bog there was a greater upward flux on the upstream side and close to the road areas and even greater upward flux at the li transects in contrast after mid summer 210 day the year the vertical gradient was downward groundwater recharge from 50 cm to 100 cm depth with changes corresponding to rainfall events both in bog fig 4i to 4p and fen fig 5i to 5p with the exception of the bog hi transect t3 in 2016 which remained mostly unchanged throughout the season also in the fen in 2017 vertical discharge corresponded to little or no rainfall in the late season fig 5p differences in vertical hydraulic gradients relative to the road were further supported by evidence that horizontal flow was disturbed by the road with instances of flow reversals observed on both upstream and downstream areas of both bog and fen particularly during the dry period fig 6a and b this was consistent with our second hypothesis that the road would alter local hydraulic gradients the general slope of the water table across the sites particularly at the bog indicated that flow should occur from upstream to downstream areas however the qhor analyses showed that water was reversing back from the edges of the road on the upstream areas while on the downstream areas the water was reversing towards the edge of the road when culverts were not connecting upstream and downstream areas in the bog the reverse flow was also observed on the downstream side of the road at the li transect in both years shifts in hydraulic gradient greatly reduced subsurface discharge through this section of the bog impacts of the road on the subsurface water flow were observed on both sides of the bog in 2017 but the effects varied between hi and li transects the impact on the hi transect irhi 5 53 mm day 1 was nine times higher t 8 09 p 0 001 than the impact on the li transects irli 0 63 mm day 1 in contrast the impact of the road on the subsurface water flow was minimal in the fen in 2017 irhi 1 03 mm day 1 irli 0 31 mm day 1 t 0 96 p 0 17 4 discussion 4 1 the effect of access road crossings on peatland dtw the previous studies on the construction of roads across peatlands in canada suggest that road crossings result in disturbed hydrological properties including altered surface and sub surface water flow between the peatland on either side of the road gillies 2011 partington et al 2016 partington and clayton 2012 plach et al 2017 strack et al 2018 in our study sites the impacts of the road on the summer dtw and sub surface water flow were detected up to 20 m from the road in the bog in both study years but not in the fen mainly due to the flow direction in the fen being nearly parallel to the road however the lateral extent of this impact varies within and between study sites due to local conditions including culvert position and road alignment with respect to the flow direction interactive effects of side of the road and culvert position were observed in both 2016 and 2017 and culvert position and distance from the road in 2017 on dtw in the bog the observed average dtw positions on the upstream areas plots at 2 and 6 m from the road were significantly shallower than the 20 m plots in both hi and li downstream this implies that the presence of a road impeded surface and sub surface water flow and disconnected the upstream and downstream areas consequently flooded conditions on the upstream areas closer to the road and the drying of the downstream areas were evident in hi transects however in li transects of the bog the observed shallower dtw on the downstream areas closer to the road indicate the culverts helped in connecting surface and sub surface water flow still the water was not effectively distributed further from the culvert openings the elevation was lower surrounding the culvert openings due to peat removal while installing culverts and this made the channelled water moving through the culvert pool near the culvert opening this suggests that while culverts are partially effective in reducing hydrologic impacts they are too far spaced and or installed at improper elevation to maintain hydrologic connectivity at the bog studied here results at the bog were in line with plach et al 2017 who also observed impeded water flows between road fragmented parts of a peatland located 50 km south of fort mcmurray alberta canada with the significantly shallower dtw in the upstream areas compared to dtw in the downstream areas in contrast to the bog the impact of the road on the surface and sub surface water flow was not significant at the fen in both years and that could be because the road in the fen is aligned nearly parallel to the water flow direction fig 2b therefore orientation of the road relative to local topography was more important in our study than peatland type for determining the hydrological impact 4 2 the effect of access road crossings on hydraulic gradients in adjacent peatland in undisturbed peatlands hydraulic gradients generally follow local topography siegel and glaser 1987 in contrast to that we observed frequent flow reversals in both upstream and downstream areas of the bog under normal conditions the water should always flow towards the road edges in the upstream areas as the road edges are at lower elevation than areas upstream of them by natural orientation and also as a result of compaction however during high rainfall periods the damming effect of the road resulted in elevated h close to the road particularly at hi upstream areas because of the absence of culverts this damming effect also resulted in much drier conditions on the downstream areas nearest to the road causing low h thus those areas received water from further downstream areas in the absence of rainfall bog li downstream areas also experienced a flow reversal that was likely caused primarily by peat removal surrounding the culvert opening compared to the downstream areas away from the road this resulted in lower ground elevation on the road edges around the culverts up to 1 m the observed variation in the vertical recharge discharge among transects in both study sites could be linked with rainfall culvert position and peat thawing patterns throughout the growing seasons except in road adjacent 2 m areas in road adjacent areas the compression and subsidence of the peat beneath the road blocked the surface and sub surface water flow leading to dtw positions near or at the surface gillies 2011 patterson and cooper 2007 mainly the discharge observed until mid growing season can be associated with the frozen peat layers below 50 cm of the peat which obstruct downward water movement also enhanced radiative fluxes because of the vegetation clearance during road construction on the upstream areas resulted in early thawing of the upper peat layers which contributed more to surface than vertical flow quinton et al 2009 as deeper peat layers start thawing the water starts moving towards surface peat layers contributing to more discharge connon et al 2014 we saw prominent vertical discharge groundwater moving to the surface in the fen in 2017 which could instead be due to no rainfall in the late growing season of 2017 fig 5p and water deficiency led to groundwater discharge as fens get water from both p and groundwater flow vertical reversals due to water deficiency or dtw drawdown have also been found in peatlands isolated from regional groundwater flow systems devito et al 1997 however the groundwater recharge observed later in the growing season corresponded mainly to rainfall events and high hydraulic gradients both in bog and fen i e rainfall events resulted in groundwater recharge fraser et al 2001 also found a shift in groundwater flow patterns at mer bleue bog ontario canada mainly due to low p high et and differential peat depth h response we found that the upstream areas of the bog in 2016 had dtw close to the surface and were mostly vertical discharge zones irrespective of the rainfall amounts this is because peat layers in those areas were mostly water saturated leading to surface flow and no further recharge holden and burt 2003 the shift to predominantly recharge on the hi upstream side of the bog in the much drier 2017 indicates that et which results in water deficits and deeper dtw plays a role in the effect of the road on subsurface flow patterns our study focused on the local impacts of the road crossings on hydrological conditions in the peatland immediately adjacent to the road however resource access roads are generally part of a larger network of disturbances including additional roads geologic exploration features forestry cut blocks oil well pads and associated processing facilities e g pasher et al 2013 we detected significant changes in dtw only at the bog and then only within 20 50 m from the road indicating limited evidence of shifts in regional hydrology at our study sites yet the cumulative impact of the existing network of disturbances remains unclear webster et al 2015 and its impact on regional hydrology requires further study 4 3 effectiveness of culverts for mitigating road associated hydrologic changes although likely too widely spaced particularly in the bog our study showed that culverts can help to connect the surface and sub surface water flow between fragmented peatland areas when installed at the correct height the road was calculated to have greatly reduced daily flow 5 mm d 1 in the bog when culverts were not present however the water storage difference on the upstream areas was only 2 56 mm d 1 indicating approximately half of the blocked water was lost from the upstream areas greater et and flow reversals as observed in our study could have contributed to the enhanced loss of the water from this zone studies have shown that the et which may range from 4 8 mm d 1 to 14 4 mm d 1 in wbp peatlands brown et al 2010 significantly lowers the dtw in wbp peatlands in the late growing season price 2003 reeve et al 2006 increased et in the bog hi upstream areas can be associated with the greater solar radiation warmer conditions and windier conditions on the open flooded areas petrone et al 2007 waddington et al 2009 and colonisation by sedges resulting in higher transpiration losses waddington et al 2009 our study focused largely on shifts to summertime hydrological conditions as our goal was to quantify changes to dtw and corresponding linkages to subsurface water flow during the time of year when impact to plant communities and microbial activity were likely to be most severe however given the importance of snow cover and frozen soil conditions to hydrology in the region ireson et al 2015 wintertime and melt period processes are also likely to contribute to the impact of resource access roads on peatland hydrology we observed differences in ground ice thawing depending on position relative to the road with generally earlier thaw in flooded upstream areas close to the road at the bog data not shown snow accumulation and ablation likely also varies between road adjacent areas and undisturbed conditions due to shifts in vegetation communities related both to clearing during road construction and in response to changing dtw future research on all of these processes is needed to fully quantify the hydrological impact of resource access roads in the landscape the effectiveness of the culverts depends on micro topographical variations proper installation and adequate numbers of culverts orientation of the road water flow direction and wetland type e g bog fen swamps etc willier 2017 in general culverts in peatlands are installed at an interval of 100 to 250 m if ponding conditions are expected partington et al 2016 however this interval distance cannot always provide effective hydrological connection across the road as results here showed that culverts may connect water movements up to 15 m distance provided that the water flow direction is perpendicular to the access road decisions on culvert spacing or the need to add culverts are generally based on avoiding damage to the road and maintaining use but persistent changes to dtw in peatland can have profound impacts on the adjacent peatland function including plant community carbon cycling and greenhouse gas exchange miller et al 2015 saraswati et al 2019 saraswati and strack 2019 this suggests that mitigating shifts to dtw as much as possible should be the goal the specific spacing and size of culverts will ultimately depend on expected water flow perpendicular to the road which will be driven by local slope and hydraulic conductivity therefore in the fen culverts had little effect on water flow as the slope of the road was mostly parallel to the flow direction also though not observed in our study sites the effectiveness of culverts can be significantly reduced when the culverts are blocked by factors such as beavers bocking et al 2017 mineral soil deposition or the subsidence of the road edges gillies 2011 partington and clayton 2012 or uneven compression of the culverts partington et al 2016 further the compression of the peat and or additions of dust and fine particles due to the road can lower ksat on the surface of the peat resulting in further reductions in surface and sub surface flow 5 conclusions in this study we hypothesized that resource access road crossings would lead to depth to water table variation between fragmented parts of the adjacent peatland with the possibility of flow reversals but that the culverts would reduce the hydrological impacts we observed that the construction of resource access roads disturbed surface and sub surface water flow at the bog but the effect was minimal at the fen the observed hydrological variation in bog supported all the hypotheses examined in this study and the variations were primarily linked to the road aligned perpendicular to the water flow direction and the culvert position overall at the bog the shallowest and deepest depth to water table positions were measured in transects far from culverts at the high impact upstream 2 m and high impact downstream 2 m plots respectively in the bog the road greatly reduced daily flow 5 mm d 1 in high impact areas although culverts were shown to improve hydrologic connection across the road we also observed that culverts provide a point source of water to downstream areas in peatlands with chances of water not redistributing well therefore the first option is to avoid the construction of access roads across peatlands however if this is not possible using more permeable road designs permeable fills building on a corduroy base or brush mats and rock fills would be beneficial such options will improve hydrologic connections as well as enhance the bearing capacity of roads therefore there is a need for further hydrological studies on more permeable road designs across peatlands credit authorship contribution statement ss ms gjm bx mmr

especially for identifying river cross section geometry the ground surveyed elevation datasets is the only alternative that imposes high costs for data compilation prakash et al 2014 federal emergency

scarcity and sparsity of high resolution topographic data and time of data processing the challenge is minimizing the river geometry dataset required to a reliable production for flood inundation mapping on large scale samela et al 2017 although there is a plethora of researches as reported previously focused on delineation flood inundation areas by hydrodynamic models 1 d or 2 d models surprisingly a few studies have been considered the effect of data resolution of river cross section on model efficiency in terms of topographical data hydraulic modelling requires a certain number of cross sections and data points on them to simulate acceptable results fewtrell et al 2011 nevertheless only a few guidelines are available to assist the modeller in determining the location or spacing between the cross sections e g castellarin et al 2009 samuels 1990 emphasized to include the following locations of river cross sections may produce better simulation by hydrodynamic models at both ends of the river reach at upstream downstream of every structure across the river i e bridge culvert and weir at all discharge and water level stations along the reach however having cross section data at finer spacing or at every river meander i e river bend and at upstream downstream of structures e g bridges will increase the cost of the topographical surveys despite this general outline there are still unanswered research questions on the effect of subjectivity of cross section location along the river through on ground surveying this study comes to bridge the gap identified in the literature related to the nexus between hydraulic modeling results e g area extents depths and flow velocities and resolution of river cross section data accuracy and efficiency are two aims in evaluating the performance of flood inundation models which are often in conflict with each other zhang et al 2014 a trade off is needed between the accuracy of the results computational efficiency of hydraulic model and costs associated with the on ground data surveying for mapping the flood extent in the data scarce environment moreover the hydrodynamic models were executed for the watersheds that have sufficient recorded peak flow data while little attention is made for the un gauged watersheds pronounced in developing countries located in asia africa or south america santiago collazo et al 2019 here the term of un gauged basin means runoff observation in sub daily scale to record the peak flow discharge are rare komi et al 2017 in such circumstances the attention was shifted towards the linkage of a hydrologic with a hydraulic model to generate flood inundation map hostache et al 2018 this linkage increases the flexibility of the hydraulic model to capture a broad range of storm events where the model is needed to execute in the basin yu and coulthard 2015 thus this study coupled a hydrologic and hydraulic model to deepen the knowledge on processes required for transforming design rainfall into flood inundation areas the processes considered in the developed approach including a modified soil conservation service method scs cn to estimate excess rainfall a geomorphologic

inundation mapping they were coupled in a one way framework and executed over a large distance of a river 40 km including dense spaced cross section topographic dataset for floods with return periods of 10 500 yr a brief description of three considered models is given in the next sections 2 1 giuh model the giuh theory developed by rodriguez iturbe and valdes 1979 assumes that the watershed can be

cn 254 2 3 hydraulic model the simplest representation of floodplain flow is to treat the flow as 1d along the centerline of the river and channel geometry as a property of each node on the river line and solve equations derived by ensuring mass and momentum conservation i e 1d saint venant equations between two cross sections brunner 2016 most numerical hydraulic models traditionally used in practical river engineering are 1d models which compared to higher dimensional models are simpler to use requiring minimal input data and computation the drawbacks associated with the 1d hydrodynamic models are inability to simulate lateral diffusion of the flood wave the discretisation of topography as cross sections rather than as a continuous surface the subjectivity of cross section location and orientation and incapability to simulate the timing and duration of flood extent teng et al 2017 however modeling the interaction of floodplain and channel flows in a two dimensional 2d representation provides greater realism and accuracy of results balica et al 2013 accurate execution of the hydraulic models depends on the substantial spatial details e g channel and floodplain cross sections optimum parameter values which are often not readily available aronica et al 2012 found that the 1d 2d hybrid model lisflood fp showed a lower sensitivity to the floodplain manning coefficient than towards the channel manning coefficient lamichhane and sharma 2018 reported that manning s roughness of the channel section was found to be more sensitive than that of the floodplain while horritt and bates 2002 came to a similar conclusion for this model they found a higher sensitivity to floodplain roughness values for the finite element model telemac 2d and the 1d model hec ras based on a global sensitivity analysis performed by pappenberger et al 2005 channel roughness manning s coefficient n is the most important parameter of hec ras 1d model in flood inundation estimation the public domain 1 d simulation model of hec geo ras version 10 2 developed by hydrologic engineering center hec of the us army corps of engineers hydrologic engineering center usace 2000 is used and performed in steady state condition to delineate the flood inundation areas around of the study river among the models listed in fig 1 the 1d hec ras has been the principal model used in us federal emergency management agency fema s national flood insurance program brown 2016 and national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa s advanced hydrologic prediction service mcenery et al 2005 in steady state condition hec geo ras computes water surface elevation wse and velocity at discrete cross sections by solving continuity energy and flow roughness manning equation with an iterative procedure called the standard step method brunner 1995 thus for a given upstream flow and downstream boundary condition the output from hec ras is area averaged wse and velocity at each cross section data requirements for hec geo ras include topographic information of a series of cross sections manning s n values across each cross section both in the channel bed and floodplain and flow data including peak flow rates flow change locations e g bridges culverts meanders and boundary conditions modeling using the hec geo ras includes three main steps fig 2 usace 2010 i hec geo ras pre processing ii hec ras modeling and iii hec geo ras post processing for pre processing of data 3d analyst tool was used to convert digitized contours into triangulated irregular network tin interpolation was done to convert vector data tin into raster data dem moreover dem of study area was used as main input in order to create ras layers like stream centerline bank lines bank stations flow path centerlines stream lines bank stations flow paths levees brides cross sections and ineffective flow areas were digitized in hec geo ras to convert to the channel geometry required by hec ras due to the sensitivity of water surface profiles to cross sections intervals haile 2005 cross sections were digitized at intervals less than 20 m and perpendicular to streamlines to provide an accurate estimation of the river channel finally all these geometric data were encoded with elevation values from the raster surface and a gis import file for hec ras was created ii hec ras modeling generally hec ras is the most common hydraulics program to model floodplain wurbs and james 2002 and it is accepted by many government agencies and private organizations to run hec ras model topographic information of cross sections flow rates and flow change locations flow condition sub critical super critical or mixed flow boundary conditions and manning s n values for each cross section are required peak flows for different design storms from giuh models were applied to the hydraulic model to generate the water surface elevation velocity and flow regime at each cross section and also flood extent for the study reach the last required data for hec ras is manning s n values for each cross section for both channel and floodplain which was determined according to land use data and reference tables e g chow et al 1988 iii hec geo ras post processing by running hec ras model based on geometrical data from hec geo ras and the maximum peak flow data generated by giuh water elevation and water velocity were calculated in each cross section and then exported again to hec geo ras to create flood inundation and velocity maps water elevation data for each scenario were converted to tin then the grid surface was created based on tin surface and was subtracted from the terrain velocity data were exported to geo ras in point format each point representing estimated velocity at each cross section slice these were also interpolated to a tin and then vertices converted to a grid form and overlaid onto their respective terrain surfaces for careful checking of validity 2 4 resolution of cross section geometric data the methodology of investigating cross section data resolution as the main objectives of this study involves changing the geometric description to reproduce new flood inundation maps by hec geo ras model is schematically represented in fig 3 geometric data description includes i geometric mesh resolution gmr denotes to space between two successive cross sections d cs and number of cross sections along the study reach n cs and ii geometric mesh node gmn denotes to the number of elevation data points here named node along each cross section n node and average distance between the nodes d node as shown in fig 3 to assess the effect of gmr in flood inundation by hec geo ras through the study reach 40 km 8 cross section configurations with resolution d cs of 20 5000 m ncs 2000 to 8 were used seven configurations of gmns along the cross sections with mesh size d node of 0 5 100 m n node 500 to 5 were considered to investigate the effect of this geometric description on hec geo ras model the inundation results simulated by the hec geo ras model with considering the original cross sectional configuration including n cs 2000 d cs 20 m n node 500 d node 0 5 m based on ground surveyed collected by the regional water authority of lorestan province in 2015 were taken as baseline in order to investigate the effects of topographic data resolution on generated inundation maps also named alternative the resolutions of surveyed data of river and floodplain n node 500 n cs 2000 are fine enough to identify abrupt topographical variability along and across the river all configurations of gmrs gmns were prepared manually by the exclusion of alternate cross sections nodes in arcgis to obtain a certain space between two sequential cross sections nodes the idea behind this task is to assess the subjectivity that arises from placing cross sections and the number of nodes in each cross section during data compilation and how this affects the produced flood inundation map through the hydraulic model generally the finer mesh resolutions are inefficient from a computational standpoint since the process of a numerical model to produce the results required for generating flood inundation map are time consuming totally 15 geometric files including 8 cross section configurations of gmr and 7 configurations of gmn were prepared and executed for 6 design floods 10 to 500 yr in the study reach thus 90 hec geo ras models were created and simulated for all these simulations the manning s roughness and flow change locations e g bridges meanders that had a significant effect on the model result were retained in all configurations and just upstream or downstream cross sections of these structures were excluded typically the manning coefficient for floodplains is higher than the main channel because of vegetation and rougher surface in all simulations arcgis extension version 10 1 was used for pre processing of input information creating geometry data required for the hydraulic model as tin layer and for post processing of model output creating inundation maps one dimensional hec geo ras version 4 1 1 ackerman 2005 in steady state flow condition uses manning s equation to generate streamflow stage rating curves along the studied reach using these rating curves input peak flow corresponding to a given return period was converted into a stage height finally the raster was used to create the inundation extents at these stage heights the boundary conditions of the hydraulic model were prescribed using data from the hydrometric gauge at doab veisian hydrometric station stage derived discharge quantifying the differences in inundation extents and depths between the different configurations and the reference baseline were performed by the following indicators 1 fit percentage indicator fi measures agreement between results of two configurations baseline and alternative in predicating flood extent areas lhomme et al 2008 8 fi b b c d 100 where b represents the number of pixels or area inundated in both models c is the number of pixels or area inundated in baseline but dry in alternative and d is the number of pixels or area inundated in alternative but dry in baseline a fit value closer to 100 represents a better agreement in flood extent prediction 2 bias percentage indicator bi represents the relative percentage error in estimating of the final extent of the flooded area for baseline and alternative configuration bernini and franchini 2013 9 bi b

of fi and bi were also adopted to evaluate the effect of cross section configurations both modifications of gmn and gmr on final inundation maps simulated by hec geo ras model through for the study reach 3 study area the developed hydro inundation model was tested for kashkan river basin with an area of about 3825 km 2 located in western iran within the zagros simply fold belt fig 4 the kashkan basin is characterized by hilly and mountainous relief with a minimum elevation of about 1067 m and its high elevation found in the northeast region 3500 m above sea level fig 4 numerous intermittent and ephemeral streams discharge to the kashkan river only during of intense rainfall periods and or heavy snowmelt shahriari nia et al 2015 the partitioning of the basin in parts sub basins allows a proper treatment of the topology and geometry of the basins introspect of the original idea behind the used models e g giuh which can be exploited as soon as data are available to identify a model s parameters at sub scales rigon et al 2016 the study basin was divided into six study areas five sub basins and one whole basin according to the location of existing hydrometric stations as the outlet of study areas automatic delineation of basin and sub basins boundaries fig 4 were conducted using a dem of 12 5 m obtained from the shuttle radar topography mission srtm provided by national aeronautics and space administration nasa http www dwtkns com the basic climatologic geomorphologic and geological characteristics of the study areas are summarized in table 1 the climate in the kashkan basin is predominantly cold mountain the mean annual precipitation ranges from 400 in the central regions to 900 mm y r in the northeast mountainous parts upstream of dare tang sub basin in the form of snow with winter being the wettest season in this area middle winter is the wettest period and july to september are the driest while the mean annual flow in the study basin are in the range of 2 38 m 3 s in dare tang sub basin to 33 04 m 3 s in doab veisian sub basin values of q in table 1 the specific discharge calculated as q a varies between 4 46 lit s k m 2 in doab veisian to

january a lag time of three months is observed between the time of maximum precipitation and peak flow because of precipitation in the high elevation areas is snow rather than rain the vegetation distributed above 1000 m is mainly oak forests or shrub lands while the vegetation distributed below 1000 m is mostly grassland rahmati et al 2017 land uses in the study area as shown in fig s2 are predominantly dry farming covers 41 forest covers 39 and pasture covers 20 urban development has been limited to the north and the northeast region of the basin fig 4 the surface area is geologically composed mainly of shale marl conglomerate limestone and quaternary alluvium at different ages consisting of clay silt sand and gravel mixed in varied proportions alavi 1994 fig s1 in the supporting information and table 1 kashkan river basin has experienced harsh flash floods with a peak flow 1000 m 3 s during 1971 2015 the latest sever flood that affected the entire basin is related to flood of march 2019 with a peak of 3000 m 3 s 300 yr return period recorded in doab veisian hydrometric station located at the basin outlet lorestan water regional authority 2018 this region was selected primarily because the kashkan basin is a high mountainous area that provides distinct physical topographic and geomorphic and climatic settings and experienced hazardous flash floods therefore providing good test beds for the study moreover the high resolution ground surveyed river cross sections for a length of 40 km a a reach in fig 4 is available to assess the effect of cross section data resolution on flood inundation through developed model the gis data for geometric description of study reach includes 2000 ground surveyed river cross sections n cs with 20 m average distance d cs the average width of these cross sections is 500 m including elevation data of bed and floodplain with an average spacing of 0 5 m along each cross section d node these data collected by the regional water authority of lorestan province in 2015 the floodplain over the study reach segment a a in fig 4 is semi rural with many fields being used for pasture or having been ploughed for dry farming there are several major roads crossing the study reach and a few hydraulic control structures on the main river including two bridges located in the 4 20 and 4 80 km from the basin outlet according to a previous study hosseini and mahjouri 2018 the appropriate values of Œª and cn for the studied sub basins are in the range of 0 21 dehno to 0 22 pole kashkan and 38 20 dehno to 60 60 dare tang respectively as also shown in table s1 in the si the peak flows of simulated hydrographs with t 10 500 yr by giuh were compared to the ones obtained by the frequency analysis fa through fitting the appropriate probability distribution to the annual peak flow series recorded at the corresponding gaging stations the simulated peak flows by giuh with a return period of 100 yr were used as the input of the hydraulic model as one of the scenario of flow condition generated from design storms in this study a user friendly fortran code was developed to accomplish the giuh computations this code can generate iuh and drh based on geomorphologic characteristics that the user enters in an excel file 4 results and discussion according to the flowchart of the methodology adopted in this

in brief description and hydraulic modeling of flood inundation by hec geo ras in detail 4 1 characteristics of design storms in the study areas the idf curve of study basin was obtained based on analysis of 128 storm events recorded in one minute interval by a rain gauge located in the center of basin outlet of kaka reza sub basin in fig 4 the derived idf curve for the study basin is shown in fig s3 in the supporting information durations of design storms for six study areas were obtained based on the average time of concentration t c of each area chow et al 1988 a preliminary estimation of t c for each study area was conducted using the empirical relationships of kirpich 1940 kerby hathaway kerby 1959 and scs lag time mccuen and okunola 2002 considering the duration of design storm equal to t c assures to produce maximum peak flow for a specific rainfall kumar 2015 knowing the design storm durations the characteristics of design storms with return periods of 2 500 yr were extracted from the idf curves for each study areas the values of design storm depths r d obtained for the study areas are shown in table 2 4 2 scs cn estimation of excess rainfall depths using the scs cn formula eq 7 the excess rainfall er d correspond to the depths of design storms r d values in table 2 in each study area were computed while the appropriate values of cn and Œª were considered table s1 the computed values of er d ranged 1 28 8 98 mm as shown in table 2 4 3 estimation of peak flow discharge by giuh model the er d values with t 2 to 500 yr computed by the scs cn method for the six study areas were considered as one of giuh model input to estimate the drh for estimation of the mean holding time of flow through different overland regions and channels eq 3 the intensity of design storms was obtained from the idf curve fig s3 manning s roughness coefficient was estimated from the land use map of study areas and the reference tables for manning s n values by chow et al 1988 the computed values of 1 t x o i and 1 t x i and the trend of mean holding time of study areas for the design storms of 2 500 yr are shown in table s1 and fig s4 the iuhs derived from the giuh model eq 1 for six study areas are shown in fig s5 using the eq 1 the ordinates of drh with t 2 to 500 yr for the study areas were computed accuracy of the giuh model in peak flow estimation with certain return period i e 2 500 yr was evaluated by those obtained from the frequency analysis of annual peak flow series recorded in each sub basin outlet by fitting the generalized extreme value gev distribution base flows have been estimated at a constant rate for each study areas and added to estimate direct runoff hydrograph the results of the giuh model to estimate peak flow rates of flood hydrographs and in the study areas were compared to those obtained from frequency analysis table 3 good agreement were found between the simulated peak flow rates and frequency analysis based on the percentage of errors pe p here the sources of error is the accumulative effect of multiple approaches incorporated to estimate peak flows i e idf curves scs cn method giuh model and frequency analysis dem resolution to delineate the basin boundaries and extracting the initial geomorphologic parameters of study areas may be another source of error komi et al 2017 two raster grids of srtm for the study areas in the resolutions of 10 m and 30 m were used in order to assess the sensitivity of the estimated iuhs by giuh model to the dem resolution as shown in table s2 dem resolutions 10 m and 30 m affect insignificantly the geomorphological properties number and length of streams and upstream area of the streams with order 1 and 2 using a coarser dem i e 30 m leads to an underestimation of geomorphological characteristics of streams orders 1 and 2 no significant difference was observed between the iuhs derived by the giuh model when dem with resolutions of 10 m and 30 m was used the peak flow values sum of drh peak flow and baseflow estimated by the giuh model were considered as one of the inputs of the hydraulic model as discussed in the next section 4 4 hydraulic modeling of flood inundation as described formerly to run hec geo ras 1d model topographical information of cross sections flow rates and flow change locations flow condition boundary conditions and manning s n values should be provided for each cross section including main river and floodplain of study reach a a in fig 4 most of the studies on the hydraulic modeling of flood inundation extend have implemented with steady flow condition cook and merwade 2009 thus in this study to find the inundated areas hydraulic model was run in steady state super critical flow condition and the upstream boundary conditions was a known discharge i e peak flow rate and free surface flow based on the field investigation of study reach and land use map of the floodplain average manning s n coefficient of channel and floodplain was considered 0 01 and 0 06 respectively from reference tables chow et al 1988 as mentioned before the hec geo ras model with 15 different cross section resolutions including 8 configurations with d cs 20 m to 5000 m n cs 2000 to 8 and 7 configurations with n node 5 to 500 d node 0 5 m to 100 m were built for simulating the flood inundation extent for the study reach the cross section configuration with d cs 20 m n cs 2 000 and n node 500 d node 0 5 m was considered as reference or baseline to assess other configurations to enable an even assessment apart from the cross section configurations the input forcing data to the hydraulic model i e input streamflow topographic resolution and the values of channel surface roughness were kept identical when they were compared across different configurations moreover the cross sections at the strategic locations around two bridges were reserved across all configurations flood inundation extent map simulated by the hec geo ras considering reference cross section configuration and peak flow rates of 10 500 yr are shown in fig 5 a f variations of water depth wd in river and floodplain is also shown in these figures the wd values ranged 0 79 m for t 10 yr to 7 83 m for t 500 yr the values of flood inundation area fia suggest expansion of inundation extents for the study reach in the range of 12 8 km 2 for t 10 yr to 33 1 km 2 for t 500 yr in flood prone regions agriculture areas of 6 0 25 5 km 2 and semi rural residential areas of 2 0 23 7 km 2 inundated along the study reach when flood 2 500 yr occurs in addition the hydraulic model performance e g fia was not sensitive to manning s n especially for low frequent floods 100 yr when the optimal n was changed to 30 this behavior is commonly seen e g komi et al 2017 during large flood events by increasing water depth inundation area tends to extent and is not affected by surface roughness 4 5 effect of cross section data resolution on flood inundation inter comparison of simulated inundation extent area flow velocity and water depth were carried out for all 15 cross section configurations with the reference model based on five criteria as follows i a fit percentage indicator fi and bias percentage indicator bi for inundation extent area ii cost of ground survey of cross section data points and average percentage of error ape for depth and velocity of flow in river centerline and iii flood inundation area fia fig 6 compares the fi and bi values for model simulated inundation with different cross section configurations extend for 100 yr flood event 1800 m 3 s since hec geo ras model for other flood events indicates similar behavior the corresponding values of fi and bi are not shown here the fi value decreases from 85 4 to 53 8 when cross section spacing d cs increases from 40 m to 5 000 m fig 6 a this indicates if cross section space doubled the efficiency of hydraulic model in flood inundation extent decreases 0 5 while the cost of surveying varies between 3200 usd and 400 000 usd based on the fiscal year of 2018 according to the bi values two different behaviors could be observed for resolution of cross section spacing an underestimation in fia for d cs 100 m negative values of bi and overestimation of flood extent area for d cs 100 m positive values of bi when it compared with the base value d cs 20 m the coarser resolution of elevation data points or nodes along each cross section i e decreasing of n node from 400 to 5 nodes would produce overestimation flood inundation extent positive values of bi in fig 6 b while the coarser resolution of data points in cross sections i e smaller value of n node resulted in lower agreement between the simulated inundation area with the base values fi decreases and the associated cost of data compilation through surveying reduced from 640 000 usd to 8000 usd between two topographic attributes of river cross section d cs and n node the resolution of cross section nodes n node is a dominant factor in the prediction of inundation extent areas interestingly the effects of coarser cross section spacing and cross section mesh node on fia are reversed fig 7 the first increases as 17 84 when d cs 40 to 5 000 m and the later decreases as 5 65 when n node 500 to 5 overall if d cs doubled the fia value will increase as 0 05 while halving n node will decrease fia as 0 35 compared to other researches saksena and merwade 2015 and lamichhane and sharma 2018 also reported that the fia simulated by 1d hec ras increased as the coarser resolution of datasets derived from srtm and lidar was used cook and merwade 2009 developed 1d hydraulic modelling for two selected river reaches in usa north carolina and texas and highlighted that the simulated flood inundation extent becomes larger as the number of cross section decreases in addition to flood extent area the variables of interest for most end users of hydraulic models are the hydraulic characteristics of flow especially water level and flow velocity at different places of river and floodplain hunter et al 2005 for this purpose the average percentage of errors in depth ape y and velocity ape v of flow in river centerline were also compared across different cross section configurations fig 8 shows the ape y and ape v values for different resolution of cross section spacing d cs 40 5000 m and flow rates t 10 500 yr for all flow rates the values of ape y reduce when the finer resolution of cross section space is used an interesting part is that a dramatic increase of ape y was observed when the distance between the cross sections increases from 1000 m 63 5 to 5000 m 455 6 in order of 7 fig 8 moreover the coarser resolution of cross section space produces overestimation of water depth in hydraulic simulations fig 8 if d cs doubled water depth and velocity would increase as 3 13 and 0 25 respectively this may be due to omitting the effect of flow change locations e g river meanders and bends on flow by interpolating the geometry between two successive cross sections that is enough coarse in other words increasing cross section spacing caused lack of topographical information available during the computation stage by ras to generate accurate water surface profiles castellarin et al 2009 for a given cross section space the more error in water depth was averagely related to high frequent floods e g t 10 yr which may because of roughness of river especially floodplain areas on smaller depths of flow generally an increase in cross section space resulted in water depth increasing therefore increased the inundation extent this finding is consistent with the cook and melwade 2009 that reported reducing the number of cross sections result in smaller inundation maps but the results tended to be contradictory with md ali et al 2015 they investigated the effect of cross section spacing of 1000 m 41 cross sections to 8000 m 6 cross sections in flood inundation of sungai johor basin in malaysia using 1d hec ras model their results indicated that the error of water depth does not change significantly as the spacing between the cross sections increased from 1000 m to 8000 m the effect of cross section spacing on the flow velocity in river centerline simulated by the hydraulic model in term of ape v was investigated and shown in fig 8 b the effect of cross section data resolution cross section spacing and the number of data points along cross sections on simulated flow velocity by the hydraulic model has not been reported previously like ape y the ape v value averagely increases 31 2 or 1 5 m s as cross sections more spaced up to 5000 m decreasing resolution of topographic data points n node 500 to 5 lead to underestimation of average flow velocity in river centerline 49 12 or 2 3 m s fig 9 a this arises from any changes in n node would affect the shape of the cross section longitudinal characteristics of the river e g slope and alter the flow change locations e g meanders and bends generated by the ras and all affected the flow velocity this may the reason why the variations of ape v due to cross section spacing does not follow a general rule as shown in fig 9 b for clarification the effect of n node along cross section on the geometry of river and floodplain generated shapes of a cross section located in distance of 4 30 km from the end of study reach by hec ras model for n node 5 to 5000 are shown in fig 10 this behavior inconsistent with the effect of cross section spacing as the higher error in water depth simulation was related to higher frequency flows the maximum error was 94 0 observed for flow with t 10 yr when n node 5 the hydraulic model with considering configuration n node 5 shows the poorest performance for all return periods with significant and systematic underestimation of depth velocity fia and flood extent for the entire river reach also the effect of cross section resolution i e d cs and n node on depth and velocity of flow does not follow a regular pattern for different flow rates the maximum effect of geometric mesh node i e n node on the water depth and velocity was obtained for 10 yr flow while the geometric mesh resolution i e d cs has the highest impacts on the water depth and velocity for flow condition of t 10 yr and 50 yr respectively the minimum effect of cross section resolution on water depth and velocity are not related to a certain flow rate the results also reveal the predominant effect of cross section data point n node on fia and flow hydraulic depth and velocity compared to the cross section spacing d cs 5 conclusion accurate floodplain extent maps in the basins with scarcity and sparsity of high resolution cross section topographic data are crucial tools for the managers and insurance actuaries to make appropriate decisions to plan rescue operation during flooding periods in this study a coupling of hydrologic scs cn and giuh and hydraulic 1d hec geo ras models were used to simulate flood inundation mapping for different flow rates 10 500 yr this study scrutinized and quantified the effects of cross section data resolution for 40 km reach along kashkan river including densely spaced ground survey cross sections in the simulation of flood inundation extent the following conclusions could be drawn from this study for given flow conditions the geometric node resolution i e the number of data points along cross section is predominant in describing the inundation extent and flow characteristics e g depth and velocity with 1d hydraulic model for example if cross section spacing d cs doubled the fia value will increase as 0 05 while halving n node will decrease fia as 0 35 a coarser resolution in both cross sections spacing and mesh nodes would decrease the efficiency of hydraulic model in flood inundation extent in terms of fi and bi even with the availability of high resolution topographic data from satellites e g lidar the level at which these data were captured in the geometric description of river e g the spacing of cross section or grid size could have a significant impact on the model prediction generally increasing cross section spacing d cs resulted in increasing of fia flow depth and velocity while decreasing cross section mesh nodes will result in decreasing of fia flow depth and velocity therefore it will be better to generate flood inundation maps based on a slightly higher cross section space and dense value of elevation dataset so that the affected areas flow depth and velocity overestimated hence slightly overpredicted result in inundation extent might be helpful while planning and making flood warning decisions and to minimize the adverse consequences of such hazards when the inundation extent estimated through the coarse resolution of elevation data and cross section space some factor of safety should be considered in addition reducing the details of topographic dataset to hydraulic model i e lower resolution of cross section speeds up simulation time reduce the computational cost and usually comes at the manageable degree of flood inundation accuracy coupling a hydrological model e g giuh with the 1d hydraulic model increases the flexibility of the hydraulic model to capture a broad range of storm events wherever the model is needed to execute in the basin however the quantitative results of this study are perhaps specific to this basin and to the models adopted the results of this study offer a deep perception of the interplay among the geometric description of river cross section through 1d hydraulic modeling in the final inundation mapping in topographic data sparse regions in this study a steady state condition of flow was adopted for hydraulic modeling to simulate final flood inundation state the unsteady flow simulation is essential for the flood routing time evolution of flood extent and timely evacuation of people from probable inundation area this study provides a baseline for improving hydraulic modeling results and mapping of flood inundation extents in areas where only coarser resolution cross section dataset are available by replicating the methodology presented here for the regions with different topographic and climate conditions relationships between cross section properties and flood inundation characteristics could

a ground survey of river cross section 2000 cross sections each including 500 data points the effect of cross section spacing 20 m to 5000 m and dataset resolution along cross section 5 500 points on 100 yr 1800 m 3 s flood inundation extent area fia average flow depth fd and velocity fv in river centerline were scrutinized results indicate that coarser cross section spacing 20 5000 m showed an overestimating tendency to simulate fia 5 75 fd 391 34 and fv 31 2 while increasing grid resolution 5 500 points on cross section tends to underestimate of fia 17 84 fd 84 13 and fv 49 12 the predominant effect of cross section spacing on fia fd and fv was found compared to the number of data points on a cross section results of this study could potentially be considered as a baseline for

hydrodynamic models and conceptual rapid inundation models as shown schematically in fig 1 a technical review on flood inundation models classification and their advantages and limitations are reviewed in depth by teng et al 2017 and afshari et al 2018 despite the advancements in the development of inundation models as listed in fig 1 study for the estimation of flood hazard mapping in developing countries is avoidable especially due to lack of high resolution topography data i e lidar jamali et al 2018 tanaka et al 2019 in such regions flood is becoming more disastrous due to high

surveying or remotely sensed of river geometry and cross section data point make them unaffordable el sayed 2018 accuracy of the hydraulic model to delineate flood inundation mainly depends on the accuracy of the geometric data of river cross section grid resolution of the served dem to define the floodplain and peak flow data as boundary conditions papaioannou et al 2016 these factors should be more critical in developing countries where financial sources for ground data compilation using surveying are limited pinos and timbe 2019 high resolution dem data i e lidar is very expensive in some countries e g iran or is not available rathjens et al 2016 in the u s lidar data are available only for less than 40 of the continental states snyder 2012 in absent of high resolution data especially for identifying river cross section geometry the ground surveyed elevation datasets is the only alternative that imposes high costs for data compilation prakash et al 2014 federal emergency management agency federal emergency management agency fema 2016 estimated that flood inundation mapping could cost from 3000 to 6000 km of river reach in the u s in the case of a limited budget scarcity and sparsity of high resolution topographic data and time of data processing the challenge is minimizing the river geometry dataset required to a reliable production for flood inundation mapping on large scale samela et al 2017 although there is a plethora of researches as reported previously focused on delineation flood inundation areas by hydrodynamic models 1 d or 2 d models surprisingly a few studies have been considered the effect of data resolution of river cross section on model efficiency in terms of topographical data hydraulic modelling requires a certain number of cross sections and data points on them to simulate acceptable results fewtrell et al 2011 nevertheless only a few guidelines are available to assist the modeller in determining the location or spacing between the cross sections e g castellarin et al 2009 samuels 1990 emphasized to include the following locations of river cross sections may produce better simulation by hydrodynamic models at both ends of the river reach at upstream downstream of every structure across the river i e bridge culvert and weir at all discharge and water level stations along the reach however having cross section data at finer spacing or at every river meander i e river bend and at upstream downstream of structures e g bridges will increase the cost of the topographical surveys despite this general outline there are still unanswered research questions on the effect of subjectivity of cross section location along the river through on ground surveying this study comes to bridge the gap identified in the literature related to the nexus between hydraulic modeling results e g area extents depths and flow velocities and resolution of river cross section data accuracy and efficiency are two aims in evaluating the performance of flood inundation models which are often in conflict with each other zhang et al 2014 a trade off is needed between the accuracy of the results computational efficiency of hydraulic model and costs associated with the on ground data surveying for mapping the flood extent in the data scarce environment moreover the hydrodynamic models were executed for the watersheds that have sufficient recorded peak flow data while little attention is made for the un gauged watersheds pronounced in developing countries located in asia africa or south america santiago collazo et al 2019 here the term of un gauged basin means runoff observation in sub daily scale to record the peak flow discharge are rare komi et al 2017 in such circumstances the attention was shifted towards the linkage of a hydrologic with a hydraulic model to generate flood inundation map hostache et al 2018 this linkage increases the flexibility of the hydraulic model to capture a broad range of storm events where the model is needed to execute in the basin yu and coulthard 2015 thus this study coupled a hydrologic and hydraulic model to deepen the knowledge on processes required for transforming design rainfall into flood inundation areas the processes considered in the developed approach including a modified soil conservation service method scs cn to estimate excess rainfall a geomorphologic

and solve equations derived by ensuring mass and momentum conservation i e 1d saint venant equations between two cross sections brunner 2016 most numerical hydraulic models traditionally used in practical river engineering are 1d models which compared to higher dimensional models are simpler to use requiring minimal input data and computation the drawbacks associated with the 1d hydrodynamic models are inability to simulate lateral diffusion of the flood wave the discretisation of topography as cross sections rather than as a continuous surface the subjectivity of cross section location and orientation and incapability to simulate the timing and duration of flood extent teng et al 2017 however modeling the interaction of floodplain and channel flows in a two dimensional 2d representation provides greater realism and accuracy of results balica et al 2013 accurate execution of the hydraulic models depends on the substantial spatial details e g channel and floodplain cross sections optimum parameter values which are often not readily available aronica et al 2012 found that the 1d 2d hybrid model lisflood fp showed a lower sensitivity to the floodplain manning coefficient than towards the channel manning coefficient lamichhane and sharma 2018 reported that manning s roughness of the channel section was found to be more sensitive than that of the floodplain while horritt and bates 2002 came to a similar conclusion for this model they found a higher sensitivity to floodplain roughness values for the finite element model telemac 2d and the 1d model hec ras based on a global sensitivity analysis performed by pappenberger et al 2005 channel roughness manning s coefficient n is the most important parameter of hec ras 1d model in flood inundation estimation the public domain 1 d simulation model of hec geo ras version 10 2 developed by hydrologic engineering center hec of the us army corps of engineers hydrologic engineering center usace 2000 is used and performed in steady state condition to delineate the flood inundation areas around of the study river among the models listed in fig 1 the 1d hec ras has been the principal model used in us federal emergency management agency fema s national flood insurance program brown 2016 and national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa s advanced hydrologic prediction service mcenery et al 2005 in steady state condition hec geo ras computes water surface elevation wse and velocity at discrete cross sections by solving continuity energy and flow roughness manning equation with an iterative procedure called the standard step method brunner 1995 thus for a given upstream flow and downstream boundary condition the output from hec ras is area averaged wse and velocity at each cross section data requirements for hec geo ras include topographic information of a series of cross sections manning s n values across each cross section both in the channel bed and floodplain and flow data including peak flow rates flow change locations e g bridges culverts meanders and boundary conditions modeling using the hec geo ras includes three main steps fig 2 usace 2010 i hec geo ras pre processing ii hec ras modeling and iii hec geo ras post processing for pre processing of data 3d analyst tool was used to convert digitized contours into triangulated irregular network tin interpolation was done to convert vector data tin into raster data dem moreover dem of study area was used as main input in order to create ras layers like stream centerline bank lines bank stations flow path centerlines stream lines bank stations flow paths levees brides cross sections and ineffective flow areas were digitized in hec geo ras to convert to the channel geometry required by hec ras due to the sensitivity of water surface profiles to cross sections intervals haile 2005 cross sections were digitized at intervals less than 20 m and perpendicular to streamlines to provide an accurate estimation of the river channel finally all these geometric data were encoded with elevation values from the raster surface and a gis import file for hec ras was created ii hec ras modeling generally hec ras is the most common hydraulics program to model floodplain wurbs and james 2002 and it is accepted by many government agencies and private organizations to run hec ras model topographic information of cross sections flow rates and flow change locations flow condition sub critical super critical or mixed flow boundary conditions and manning s n values for each cross section are required peak flows for different design storms from giuh models were applied to the hydraulic model to generate the water surface elevation velocity and flow regime at each cross section and also flood extent for the study reach the last required data for hec ras is manning s n values for each cross section for both channel and floodplain which was determined according to land use data and reference tables e g chow et al 1988 iii hec geo ras post processing by running hec ras model based on geometrical data from hec geo ras and the maximum peak flow data generated by giuh water elevation and water velocity were calculated in each cross section and then exported again to hec geo ras to create flood inundation and velocity maps water elevation data for each scenario were converted to tin then the grid surface was created based on tin surface and was subtracted from the terrain velocity data were exported to geo ras in point format each point representing estimated velocity at each cross section slice these were also interpolated to a tin and then vertices converted to a grid form and overlaid onto their respective terrain surfaces for careful checking of validity 2 4 resolution of cross section geometric data the methodology of investigating cross section data resolution as the main objectives of this study involves changing the geometric description to reproduce new flood inundation maps by hec geo ras model is schematically represented in fig 3 geometric data description includes i geometric mesh resolution gmr denotes to space between two successive cross sections d cs and number of cross sections along the study reach n cs and ii geometric mesh node gmn denotes to the number of elevation data points here named node along each cross section n node and average distance between the nodes d node as shown in fig 3 to assess the effect of gmr in flood inundation by hec geo ras through the study reach 40 km 8 cross section configurations with resolution d cs of 20 5000 m ncs 2000 to 8 were used seven configurations of gmns along the cross sections with mesh size d node of 0 5 100 m n node 500 to 5 were considered to investigate the effect of this geometric description on hec geo ras model the inundation results simulated by the hec geo ras model with considering the original cross sectional configuration including n cs 2000 d cs 20 m n node 500 d node 0 5 m based on ground surveyed collected by the regional water authority of lorestan province in 2015 were taken as baseline in order to investigate the effects of topographic data resolution on generated inundation maps also named alternative the resolutions of surveyed data of river and floodplain n node 500 n cs 2000 are fine enough to identify abrupt topographical variability along and across the river all configurations of gmrs gmns were prepared manually by the exclusion of alternate cross sections nodes in arcgis to obtain a certain space between two sequential cross sections nodes the idea behind this task is to assess the subjectivity that arises from placing cross sections and the number of nodes in each cross section during data compilation and how this affects the produced flood inundation map through the hydraulic model generally the finer mesh resolutions are inefficient from a computational standpoint since the process of a numerical model to produce the results required for generating flood inundation map are time consuming totally 15 geometric files including 8 cross section configurations of gmr and 7 configurations of gmn were prepared and executed for 6 design floods 10 to 500 yr in the study reach thus 90 hec geo ras models were created and simulated for all these simulations the manning s roughness and flow change locations e g bridges meanders that had a significant effect on the model result were retained in all configurations and just upstream or downstream cross sections of these structures were excluded typically the manning coefficient for floodplains is higher than the main channel because of vegetation and rougher surface in all simulations arcgis extension version 10 1 was used for pre processing of input information creating geometry data required for the hydraulic model as tin layer and for post processing of model output creating inundation maps one dimensional hec geo ras version 4 1 1 ackerman 2005 in steady state flow condition uses manning s equation to generate streamflow stage rating curves along the studied reach using these rating curves input peak flow corresponding to a given return period was converted into a stage height finally the raster was used to create the inundation extents at these stage heights the boundary conditions of the hydraulic model were prescribed using data from the hydrometric gauge at doab veisian hydrometric station stage derived discharge quantifying the differences in inundation extents and depths between the different configurations and the reference baseline were performed by the following indicators 1 fit percentage indicator fi measures agreement between results of two configurations baseline and alternative in predicating flood extent areas lhomme et al 2008 8 fi b b c d 100 where b represents the number of pixels or area inundated in both models c is the number of pixels or area inundated in baseline but dry in alternative and d is the number of pixels or area inundated in alternative but dry in baseline a fit value closer to 100 represents a better agreement in flood extent prediction 2 bias percentage indicator bi represents the relative percentage error in estimating of the final extent of the flooded area for baseline and alternative configuration bernini and franchini 2013 9 bi b c b d 1 100 positive value of bi indicates overestimation of the extent flooded area compared to the base value whereas negative values indicate underestimation ideal value of bi is zero the criteria of fi and bi were also adopted to evaluate the effect of cross section configurations both modifications of gmn and gmr on final inundation maps simulated by hec geo ras model through for the study reach 3 study area the developed hydro inundation model was tested for kashkan river basin with an area of about 3825 km 2 located in western iran within the zagros simply fold belt fig 4 the kashkan basin is characterized by hilly and mountainous relief with a minimum elevation of about 1067 m and its high elevation found in the northeast region 3500 m above sea level fig 4 numerous intermittent and ephemeral streams discharge to the kashkan river only during of intense rainfall periods and or heavy snowmelt shahriari nia et al 2015 the partitioning of the basin in parts sub basins allows a proper treatment of the topology and geometry of the basins introspect of the original idea behind the used models e g giuh which can be exploited as soon as data are available to identify a model s parameters at sub scales rigon et al 2016 the study basin was divided into six study areas five sub basins and one whole basin according to the location of existing hydrometric stations as the outlet of study areas automatic delineation of basin and sub basins boundaries fig 4 were conducted using a dem of 12 5 m obtained from the shuttle radar topography mission srtm provided by national aeronautics and space administration nasa http www dwtkns com the basic climatologic geomorphologic and geological characteristics of the study areas are summarized in table 1 the climate in the kashkan basin is predominantly cold mountain the mean annual precipitation ranges from 400 in the central regions to 900 mm y r in the northeast mountainous parts upstream of dare tang sub basin in the form of snow with winter being the wettest season in this area middle winter is the wettest period and july to september are the driest while the mean annual flow in the study basin are in the range of 2 38 m 3 s in dare tang sub basin to 33 04 m 3 s in doab veisian sub basin values of q in table 1 the specific discharge calculated as q a varies between 4 46 lit s k m 2 in doab veisian to 13 57 lit s k m 2 in the dare tang values of q s in table 1 peak and low stream flows in the study areas are experienced in march and september respectively while the maximum precipitation occurs in january a lag time of three months is observed between the time of maximum precipitation and peak flow because of precipitation in the high elevation areas is snow rather than rain the vegetation distributed above 1000 m is mainly oak forests or shrub lands while the vegetation distributed below 1000 m is mostly grassland rahmati et al 2017 land uses in the study area as shown in fig s2 are predominantly dry farming covers 41 forest covers 39 and pasture covers 20 urban development has been limited to the north and the northeast region of the basin fig 4 the surface area is geologically composed mainly of shale marl conglomerate limestone and quaternary alluvium at different ages consisting of clay silt sand and gravel mixed in varied proportions alavi 1994 fig s1 in the supporting information and table 1 kashkan river basin has experienced harsh flash floods with a peak flow 1000 m 3 s during 1971 2015 the latest sever flood that affected the entire basin is related to flood of march 2019 with a peak of 3000 m 3 s 300 yr return period recorded in doab veisian hydrometric station located at the basin outlet lorestan water regional authority 2018 this region was selected primarily because the kashkan basin is a high mountainous area that provides distinct physical topographic and geomorphic and climatic settings and experienced hazardous flash floods therefore providing good test beds for the study moreover the high resolution ground surveyed river cross sections for a length of 40 km a a reach in fig 4 is available to assess the effect of cross section data resolution on flood inundation through developed model the gis data for geometric description of study reach includes 2000 ground surveyed river cross sections n cs with 20 m average distance d cs the average width of these cross sections is 500 m including elevation data of bed and floodplain with an average spacing of 0 5 m along each cross section d node these data collected by the regional water authority of lorestan province in 2015 the floodplain over the study reach segment a a in fig 4 is semi rural with many fields being used for pasture or having been ploughed for dry farming there are several major roads crossing the study reach and a few hydraulic control structures on the main river including two bridges located in the 4 20 and 4 80 km from the basin outlet according to a previous study hosseini and mahjouri 2018 the appropriate values of Œª and cn for the studied sub basins are in the range of 0 21 dehno to 0 22 pole kashkan and 38 20 dehno to 60 60 dare tang respectively as also shown in table s1 in the si the peak flows of simulated hydrographs with t 10 500 yr by giuh were compared to the ones obtained by the frequency analysis fa through fitting the appropriate probability distribution to the annual peak flow series recorded at the corresponding gaging stations the simulated peak flows by giuh with a return period of 100 yr were used as the input of the hydraulic model as one of the scenario of flow condition generated from design storms in this study a user friendly fortran code was developed to accomplish the giuh computations this code can generate iuh and drh based on geomorphologic characteristics that the user enters in an excel file 4 results and discussion according to the flowchart of the methodology adopted in this

in brief description and hydraulic modeling of flood inundation by hec geo ras in detail 4 1 characteristics of design storms in the study areas the idf curve of study basin was obtained based on analysis of 128 storm events recorded in one minute interval by a rain gauge located in the center of basin outlet of kaka reza sub basin in fig 4 the derived idf curve for the study basin is shown in fig s3 in the supporting information durations of design storms for six study areas were obtained based on the average time of concentration t c of each area chow et al 1988 a preliminary estimation of t c for each study area was conducted using the empirical relationships of kirpich 1940 kerby hathaway kerby 1959 and scs lag time mccuen and okunola 2002 considering the duration of design storm equal to t c assures to produce maximum peak flow for a specific rainfall kumar 2015 knowing the design storm durations the characteristics of design storms with return periods of 2 500 yr were extracted from the idf curves for each study areas the values of design storm depths r d obtained for the study areas are shown in table 2 4 2 scs cn estimation of excess rainfall depths using the scs cn formula eq 7 the excess rainfall er d correspond to the depths of design storms r d values in table 2 in each study area were computed while the appropriate values of cn and Œª were considered

the six study areas were considered as one of giuh model input to estimate the drh for estimation of the mean holding time of flow through different overland regions and channels eq 3 the intensity of design storms was obtained from the idf curve fig s3 manning s roughness coefficient was estimated from the land use map of study areas and the reference tables for manning s n values by chow et al 1988 the computed values of 1 t x o i and 1 t x i and the trend of mean holding time of study areas for the design storms of 2 500 yr are shown in table s1 and fig s4 the iuhs derived from the giuh model eq 1 for six study areas are shown in fig s5 using the eq 1 the ordinates of drh with t 2 to 500 yr for the study areas were computed accuracy of the giuh model in peak flow estimation with certain return period i e 2 500 yr was evaluated by those obtained from the frequency analysis of annual peak flow series recorded in each sub basin outlet by fitting the generalized extreme value gev distribution base flows have been estimated at a constant rate for each study areas and added to estimate direct runoff hydrograph the results of the giuh model to estimate peak flow rates of flood hydrographs and in the study areas were compared to those obtained from frequency analysis table 3 good agreement were found between the simulated peak flow rates and frequency analysis based on the

dem resolution to delineate the basin boundaries and extracting the initial geomorphologic parameters of study areas may be another source of error komi et al 2017 two raster grids of srtm for the study areas in the resolutions of 10 m and 30 m were used in order to assess the sensitivity of the estimated iuhs by giuh model to the dem resolution as shown in table s2 dem resolutions 10 m and 30 m affect insignificantly the geomorphological properties number and length of streams and upstream area of the streams with order 1 and 2 using a coarser dem i e 30 m leads to an underestimation of geomorphological characteristics of streams orders 1 and 2 no significant difference was observed between the iuhs derived by the giuh model when dem with resolutions of 10 m and 30 m was used the peak flow values sum of drh peak flow and baseflow estimated by the giuh model were considered as one of the inputs of the hydraulic model as discussed in the next section 4 4 hydraulic modeling of flood inundation as described formerly to run hec geo ras 1d model topographical information of cross sections flow rates and flow change locations flow condition boundary conditions and manning s n values should be provided for each cross section including main river and floodplain of study reach a a in fig 4 most of the studies on the hydraulic modeling of flood inundation extend have implemented with steady flow condition cook and merwade 2009 thus in this study to find the inundated areas hydraulic model was run in steady state super critical flow condition and the upstream boundary conditions was a known discharge i e peak flow rate and free surface flow based on the field investigation of study reach and land use map of the floodplain average manning s n coefficient of channel and floodplain was considered 0 01 and 0 06 respectively from reference tables chow et al 1988 as mentioned before the hec geo ras model with 15 different cross section resolutions including 8 configurations with d cs 20 m to 5000 m n cs 2000 to 8 and 7 configurations with n node 5 to 500 d node 0 5 m to 100 m were built for simulating the flood inundation extent for the study reach the cross section configuration with d cs 20 m n cs 2 000 and n node 500 d node 0 5 m was considered as reference or baseline to assess other configurations to enable an even assessment apart from the cross section configurations the input forcing data to the hydraulic model i e input streamflow topographic resolution and the values of channel surface roughness were kept identical when they were compared across different configurations moreover the cross sections at the strategic locations around two bridges were reserved across all configurations flood inundation extent map simulated by the hec geo ras considering reference cross section configuration and peak flow rates of 10 500 yr are shown in fig 5 a f variations of water depth wd in river and floodplain is also shown in these figures the wd values ranged 0 79 m for t 10 yr to 7 83 m for t 500 yr the values of flood inundation area fia suggest expansion of inundation extents for the study reach in the range of 12 8 km 2 for t 10 yr to 33 1 km 2 for t 500 yr in flood prone regions agriculture areas of 6 0 25 5 km 2 and semi rural residential areas of 2 0 23 7 km 2 inundated along the study reach when flood 2 500 yr occurs in addition the hydraulic model performance e g fia was not sensitive to manning s n especially for low frequent floods 100 yr when the optimal n was changed to 30 this behavior is commonly seen e g komi et al 2017 during large flood events by increasing water depth inundation area tends to extent and is not affected by surface roughness 4 5 effect of cross section data resolution on flood inundation inter comparison of simulated inundation extent area flow velocity and water depth were carried out for all 15 cross section configurations with the reference model based on five criteria as follows i a fit percentage indicator fi and bias percentage indicator bi for inundation extent area ii cost of ground survey of cross section data points and average percentage of error ape for depth and velocity of flow in river centerline and iii flood inundation area fia fig 6 compares the fi and bi values for model simulated inundation with different cross section configurations extend for 100 yr flood event 1800 m 3 s since hec geo ras model for other flood events indicates similar behavior the corresponding values of fi and bi are not shown here the fi value decreases from 85 4 to 53 8 when cross section spacing d cs increases from 40 m to 5 000 m fig 6 a this indicates if cross section space doubled the efficiency of hydraulic model in flood inundation extent decreases 0 5 while the cost of surveying varies between 3200 usd and 400 000 usd based on the fiscal year of 2018 according to the bi values two different behaviors could be observed for resolution of cross section spacing an underestimation in fia for d cs 100 m negative values of bi and overestimation of flood extent area for d cs 100 m positive values of bi when it compared with the base value d cs 20 m the coarser resolution of elevation data points or nodes along each cross section i e decreasing of n node from 400 to 5 nodes would produce overestimation flood inundation extent positive values of bi in fig 6 b while the coarser resolution of data points in cross sections i e smaller value of n node resulted in lower agreement between the simulated inundation area with the base values fi decreases and the associated cost of data compilation through surveying reduced from 640 000 usd to 8000 usd between two topographic attributes of river cross section d cs and n node the resolution of cross section nodes n node is a dominant factor in the prediction of inundation extent areas interestingly the effects of coarser cross section spacing and cross section mesh node on fia are reversed fig 7 the first increases as 17 84 when d cs 40 to 5 000 m and the later decreases as 5 65 when n node 500 to 5 overall if d cs doubled the fia value will increase as 0 05 while halving n node will decrease fia as 0 35 compared to other researches saksena and merwade 2015 and lamichhane and sharma 2018 also reported that the fia simulated by 1d hec ras increased as the coarser resolution of datasets derived from srtm and lidar was used cook and merwade 2009 developed 1d hydraulic modelling for two selected river reaches in usa north carolina and texas and highlighted that the simulated flood inundation extent becomes larger as the number of cross section decreases in addition to flood extent area the variables of interest for most end users of hydraulic models are the hydraulic characteristics of flow especially water level and flow velocity at different places of river and floodplain hunter et al 2005 for this purpose the average percentage of errors in depth ape y and velocity ape v of flow in river centerline were also compared across different cross section configurations fig 8 shows the ape y and ape v values for different resolution of cross section spacing d cs 40 5000 m and flow rates t 10 500 yr for all flow rates the values of ape y reduce when the finer resolution of cross section space is used an interesting part is that a dramatic increase of ape y was observed when the distance between the cross sections increases from 1000 m 63 5 to 5000 m 455 6 in order of 7 fig 8 moreover the coarser resolution of cross section space produces overestimation of water depth in hydraulic simulations fig 8 if d cs doubled water depth and velocity would increase as 3 13 and 0 25 respectively this may be due to omitting the effect of flow change locations e g river meanders and bends on flow by interpolating the geometry between two successive cross sections that is enough coarse in other words increasing cross section spacing caused lack of topographical information available during the computation stage by ras to generate accurate water surface profiles castellarin et al 2009 for a given cross section space the more error in water depth was averagely related to high frequent floods e g t 10 yr which may because of roughness of river especially floodplain areas on smaller depths of flow generally an increase in cross section space resulted in water depth increasing therefore increased the inundation extent this finding is consistent with the cook and melwade 2009 that reported reducing the number of cross sections result in smaller inundation maps but the results tended to be contradictory with md ali et al 2015 they investigated the effect of cross section spacing of 1000 m 41 cross sections to 8000 m 6 cross sections in flood inundation of sungai johor basin in malaysia using 1d hec ras model their results indicated that the error of water depth does not change significantly as the spacing between the cross sections increased from 1000 m to 8000 m the effect of cross section spacing on the flow velocity in river centerline simulated by the hydraulic model in term of ape v was investigated and shown in fig 8 b the effect of cross section data resolution cross section spacing and the number of data points along cross sections on simulated flow velocity by the hydraulic model has not been reported previously like ape y the ape v value averagely increases 31 2 or 1 5 m s as cross sections more spaced up to 5000 m decreasing resolution of topographic data points n node 500 to 5 lead to underestimation of average flow velocity in river centerline 49 12 or 2 3 m s fig 9 a this arises from any changes in n node would affect the shape of the cross section longitudinal characteristics of the river e g slope and alter the flow change locations e g meanders and bends generated by the ras and all affected the flow velocity this may the reason why the variations of ape v due to cross section spacing does not follow a general rule as shown in fig 9 b for clarification the effect of n node along cross section on the geometry of river and floodplain generated shapes of a cross section located in distance of 4 30 km from the end of study reach by hec ras model for n node 5 to 5000 are shown in fig 10 this behavior inconsistent with the effect of cross section spacing as the higher error in water depth simulation was related to higher frequency flows the maximum error was 94 0 observed for flow with t 10 yr when n node 5 the hydraulic model with considering configuration n node 5 shows the poorest performance for all return periods with significant and systematic underestimation of depth velocity fia and flood extent for the entire river reach also the effect of cross section resolution i e d cs and n node on depth and velocity of flow does not follow a regular pattern for different flow rates the maximum effect of geometric mesh node i e n node on the water depth and velocity was obtained for 10 yr flow while the geometric mesh resolution i e d cs has the highest impacts on the water depth and velocity for flow condition of t 10 yr and 50 yr respectively the minimum effect of cross section resolution on water depth and velocity are not related to a certain flow rate the results also reveal the predominant effect of cross section data point n node on fia and flow hydraulic depth and velocity compared to the cross section spacing d cs 5 conclusion accurate floodplain extent maps in the basins with scarcity and sparsity of high resolution cross section topographic data are crucial tools for the managers and insurance actuaries to make appropriate decisions to plan rescue operation during flooding periods in this study a coupling of hydrologic scs cn and giuh and hydraulic 1d hec geo ras models were used to simulate flood inundation mapping for different flow rates 10 500 yr this study scrutinized and quantified the effects of cross section data resolution for 40 km reach along kashkan river including densely spaced ground survey cross sections in the simulation of flood inundation extent the following conclusions could be drawn from this study for given flow conditions the geometric node resolution i e the number of data points along cross section is predominant in describing the inundation extent and flow characteristics e g depth and velocity with 1d hydraulic model for example if cross section spacing d cs doubled the fia value will increase as 0 05 while halving n node will decrease fia as 0 35 a coarser resolution in both cross sections spacing and mesh nodes would decrease the efficiency of hydraulic model in flood inundation extent in terms of fi and bi even with the availability of high resolution topographic data from satellites e g lidar the level at which these data were captured in the geometric description of river e g the spacing of cross section or grid size could have a significant impact on the model prediction generally increasing cross section spacing d cs resulted in increasing of fia flow depth and velocity while decreasing cross section mesh nodes will result in decreasing of fia flow depth and velocity therefore it will be better to generate flood inundation maps based on a slightly higher cross section space and dense value of elevation dataset so that the affected areas flow depth and velocity overestimated hence slightly overpredicted result in inundation extent might be helpful while planning and making flood warning decisions and to minimize the adverse consequences of such hazards when the inundation extent estimated through the coarse resolution of elevation data and cross section space some factor of safety should be considered in addition reducing the details of topographic dataset to hydraulic model i e lower resolution of cross section speeds up simulation time reduce the computational cost and usually comes at the manageable degree of flood inundation accuracy coupling a hydrological model e g giuh with the 1d hydraulic model increases the flexibility of the hydraulic model to capture a broad range of storm events wherever the model is needed to execute in the basin however the quantitative results of this study are perhaps specific to this basin and to the models adopted the results of this study offer a deep perception of the interplay among the geometric description of river cross section through 1d hydraulic modeling in the final inundation mapping in topographic data sparse regions in this study a steady state condition of flow was adopted for hydraulic modeling to simulate final flood inundation state the unsteady flow simulation is essential for the flood routing time evolution of flood extent and timely evacuation of people from probable inundation area

5672,derived flood frequency models developed specifically for urban stormwater management purposes are referred to as analytical probabilistic stormwater models these models use closed form analytical equations to estimate flood frequencies under various land use conditions which facilitate quick analysis of different design alternatives in this paper in order to further improve the capability of the analytical probabilistic models additional analytical expressions relating a catchment s peak discharge rate to its physical characteristics and the local rainfall statistics are derived considering saturation excess in addition to infiltration excess runoff generation and various possible hydrograph shapes these analytical expressions along with the frequency distributions of the input rainfall event volume and duration are used to develop a new derived flood frequency model suitable for catchments where saturation excess runoff generation is possible an example application of the new model to a test catchment in hamilton ontario canada is illustrated to verify the accuracy of the new model assuming hypothetically that the same catchment is instead located at several other places in the united states the reliability of the analytical probabilistic models under different climatic conditions is verified as well keywords peak discharge frequency distribution urban stormwater management analytical probabilistic models saturation excess infiltration excess 1 introduction urban stormwater management facilities are vital for the mitigation of the impact of polluted runoff and reduction of runoff volumes and peak discharge rates both runoff volume and peak discharge frequencies are needed for the planning analysis and design of stormwater management facilities in practice these frequencies are usually estimated using the design storm and or continuous simulation approaches the design storm approach is based on a set of individual rainfall events and does not model the inter event conditions of the site of interest however it greatly eases the approach s applications in practice the continuous simulation approach uses long rainfall records directly which makes it more accurate however its application for individual design cases is too time consuming thus a theoretically more robust and computationally more efficient approach that can analytically estimate the runoff volume and peak discharge frequencies would be very useful although there is a promising analytical probabilistic approach referred to as the apa in this paper that has been under investigation for several decades it is still under applied in practice and requires more improvements in applying the apa for a location of interest the long term the longer the better as long as the climate there is viewed as stationary continuous rainfall record of that location is separated into individual rainfall events based on a selected minimum dry time between events known as the inter event time definition ietd each two consecutive rainfall periods are considered as separate rainfall events only if the dry time between them is greater than the ietd for small urban catchments the suitable ietd varies between 6 and 12 h guo and adams 1998a guo and baetz 2007 each rainfall event is characterized by its volume v duration t and the dry time referred to as the interevent time b that separates it from the antecedent rainfall event in order to use the apa for urban stormwater management a statistical analysis of the separated rainfall events is needed first to fit theoretical frequency distributions to rainfall event characteristics once this is done for a location of interest the statistics of the individual rainfall event characteristics are the only necessary rainfall input data required by the apa for stormwater management analysis the apa is based on the derived probability distribution theory which states that the probability distribution of a dependent variable e g the peak discharge of a runoff event can be determined analytically if the probability distributions of the independent variables e g rainfall event volume and duration are known and the functional relationship between the dependent and independent variables e g the rainfall runoff transformation relation is either monotonically increasing or decreasing benjamin and cornell 1970 the derived probability distribution theory was first applied in water resources research by eagleson 1972 to estimate the frequency of peak stream flows using the probability density functions pdfs of rainfall intensity and duration and the kinematic wave formula which represents the functional relationship between peak stream flow and rainfall characteristics then the same theory was applied in urban stormwater management analysis e g adams et al 1986 guo and adams 1998a b adams and papa 2000 guo 2001 chen and adams 2005 2007 bacchi et al 2008 balistrocchi et al 2009 hassini and guo 2017 and for natural watersheds e g balistrocchi et al 2013 de michele and salvadori 2002 bocchiola and rosso 2009 by many other researchers the set of analytical expressions that can be used to estimate the probability distributions of runoff event volume and peak discharge rate from small urban catchments derived mainly by guo and adams 1998a b are collectively referred to as the analytical probabilistic stormwater models apswm several other studies e g guo and adams 1999a b guo 2001 quader and guo 2006 guo and baetz 2007 guo et al 2012 hassini and guo 2017 were performed to expand improve or validate the apswm with each new expansion the apswm was applied under different conditions and was found to provide results comparable to those from either the design storm or continuous simulation approaches apswm is event based where individual rainfall and runoff events are considered as a whole each event has its own characteristics and these event characteristics are the subject of study for example when a rainfall event s volume exceeds the sum of all possible losses the rainfall event produces a runoff event characterized by runoff duration volume and peak discharge rate the runoff event s duration is equal to the causal rainfall event s duration assuming that the time needed to satisfy the initial losses is negligible for small urban catchments plus the time for a drop of rain fallen on the farthest point of the catchment timewise to reach the catchment s outlet known as the catchment s time of concentration the runoff event volume is estimated as its causal rainfall event volume minus all the losses the peak discharge rate of a runoff event is determined using closed form analytical equations according to the shape of the runoff hydrograph and runoff event volume the probability distributions of runoff event volume and peak discharge rate are then derived based on the derived probability distribution theory the probability distributions of rainfall event characteristics and the analytical relationships between input rainfall and output runoff event characteristics up until 2012 only infiltration excess runoff was considered in the apswm for estimating runoff event volumes assuming that the soil will always remain unsaturated for the whole runoff event duration guo and adams 1998a incorporated the horton s model in the apswm to estimate the maximum possible infiltration loss volume infiltration is expected to start with an initial rate then decreases exponentially over time reaching quickly to a constant rate for the rest of the event however soils may get completely saturated before the end of a rainfall event and infiltration may stop while it is still raining as a result a saturation excess runoff may occur during an event which may have an important effect on the rainfall runoff transformation process of some catchments guo et al 2012 added into apswm the saturation excess runoff volume calculations and derived analytical equations to estimate the frequency distributions of runoff event volumes guo et al 2012 found that the saturation parameter representing the completely saturated conditions does have an important effect on the frequency distributions of runoff event volumes for some pervious areas however this important saturation parameter is not yet included in apswm to estimate the frequency distributions of peak discharge rates in recent years the use of low impact development practices lids such as green roofs and bio retention facilities has significantly increased for the better management of urban stormwater lids together with the impervious areas they serve may be considered as pervious areas however because of their limited size they often provide limited maximum possible infiltration volume during a rainfall event thus incorporation of the saturation parameter in runoff calculations is required for many urban catchments especially those with lids this is not only necessary for runoff event volume but also for peak discharge rate i e flood frequencies from these urban catchments for estimating the runoff peak discharge rate of an individual event the hydrograph shape in addition to the runoff event volume and duration of the runoff event need to be known thus simplification about the individual hydrograph s shape is required in the past in order to facilitate the derivations of the peak discharge pdfs in the apswm individual hydrograph s shape was assumed to be triangular recently hassini and guo 2017 derived the peak discharge pdfs assuming three possible shapes of runoff event hydrographs reflecting the relative magnitudes of rainfall event duration and the catchment s time of concentration hassini and guo 2017 found that their models produced better results than the models incorporating the triangular hydrograph assumption the main purpose of this study is to derive new pdfs of peak discharge rate considering different hydrograph shapes trapezoids and triangles and saturation excess in addition to infiltration excess runoff generations although the derivations are complex the new analytical equations obtained are still computationally efficient once derived they can easily be implemented into a spreadsheet or programmed as a handy software derivation of additional equations is only necessary for further improvement or implementation of different rainfall losses or runoff routing calculation methods 2 runoff event volume apswm is an event based probabilistic model that treats each event as a whole and does not perform time step by time step calculations as in continuous simulation models for each rainfall event the runoff event volume is the rainfall event volume minus all rainfall losses generally an urban catchment consists of pervious and impervious parts each part is assumed to generate runoff only after its rainfall losses are satisfied then the runoff volume is estimated as the area weighted runoff coming from the impervious and pervious areas the impervious area is assumed to contribute first since its rainfall losses are usually less than those lost on pervious areas as a result for each rainfall event with volume v mm and duration t h the resulting total runoff volume is 1 v r 0 v s di h v s di s di v s il f c t v s d f c 1 h t v s il f c t where v r is the runoff event volume mm h is the impervious surface fraction of the catchment s il is the pervious area initial losses mm which can be estimated as s il s dp s iw where s dp is the pervious area depression storage mm and s iw is the initial soil wetting infiltration volume mm f c is the ultimate infiltration capacity of the soil mm h s di is the impervious area depression storage mm and s d is the area weighted depression storage of the impervious areas and initial losses of the pervious areas mm i e s d h s di 1 h s il in eq 1 the soil is assumed to remain unsaturated and absorbing water at a rate equal to f c during the entire rainfall duration the additional amount of infiltration that occurred at the beginning of the rainfall event when the soil is relative dry is s iw that is why it is referred to as the initial soil wetting infiltration volume detailed derivations and justifications for using eq 1 to estimate runoff event volumes are provided in guo and adams 1998a b however eq 1 is valid only with the assumption that the soil always remains unsaturated in reality the soil may become saturated before the end of a rainfall event infiltration may cease in the middle of a rainfall event and the remaining rainfall will all contribute to surface runoff therefore guo et al 2012 revised the runoff event volume expressions to account for the saturation excess runoff by adding another pervious area parameter the maximum infiltration volume possible per rainfall event s s mm for each rainfall event at the beginning the soil is assumed to be relatively dry and at the end the soil may remain unsaturated scenario 1 or become saturated scenario 2 let s m be the maximum possible amount of water that can infiltrate into the soil after the initial soil wetting infiltration is already satisfied i e s m s s s iw for each rainfall event after subtracting the rainfall losses and combining the resulting runoff volume from the pervious and impervious catchment areas guo et al 2012 determined the total runoff volume v r as follows for scenario 1 where t s m f c or v s il s m since the soil is not saturated no saturation excess runoff will occur and only infiltration excess runoff may occur the total runoff volume is the same as given by eq 1 for scenario 2 where t s m f c and v s il s m the soil is saturated before the end of the rainfall event and 2 v r v s d 1 h s m in this paper in order to make the derivations more straightforward the two scenarios are divided further into four mutually exclusive domains of v and t let t s h be the time required for the soil to reach saturation after the initial soil wetting infiltration is completed i e t s s m f c hereinafter t s is referred to as the saturation time which may be less or greater than the rainfall event duration t logically there are three sets of conditions of v and t that can lead to scenario 1 a t t s and v s il s m b t t s and v s il s m or c t t s and v s il s m however scenario 2 is only led by one condition i e d t t s and v s il s m then rainfall events can be classified into two categories based on their durations a rainfall events with durations less than the saturation time t t s no matter how much the rainfall event volume is the soil will remain unsaturated conditions a and b b t t s which includes condition c where the soil remains unsaturated due to insufficient rainfall volume and condition d where soil saturation is attained for each rainfall event the corresponding runoff volume is as given in eq 1 if t t s if t t s thus f c t s il s m s il the runoff event volume can be calculated as follows 3 v r 0 v s di h v s di s di v s il s m v s d 1 h s m v s il s m combining eqs 1 through 3 and listing separately the additional requirement for each applicable condition the runoff event volume that results from a rainfall event can be expressed in a combined general way as 4 v r 0 v s di h v s di s di v s il f c t a n d t t s v s d f c 1 h t v s il f c t a n d t t s h v s di s di v s il s m a n d t t s v s d 1 h s m v s il s m a n d t t s 3 peak discharge rate of a runoff event knowing the total volume eq 4 and the detailed shape of the hydrograph of a runoff event the corresponding peak discharge rate can be estimated an approximate hydrograph shape may be assumed in order to analytically determine the peak discharge rate for the hydrologic design of small flood detention reservoirs wycoff and singh 1976 approximated individual flood hydrographs as triangles in the past to analytically determine the peak discharge rate of a runoff event the same triangular shape was adopted by guo and adams 1998b and recently a more general trapezoidal shape was incorporated by hassini and guo 2017 for both shapes the base which represents the runoff event duration is equal to the sum of the input rainfall event duration t and the catchment time of concentration t c for small urban catchments where runoff starts almost immediately after the start of a rainfall event because of directly connected impervious areas the duration with rainfall excess is usually the same as the causing rainfall event duration that is why in the following analysis rainfall event duration is treated as the duration with rainfall excess and that is why the runoff event duration is equal to the sum of the input rainfall event duration and the catchment time of concentration the catchment s time of concentration is assumed to be constant and solely depends on the catchment s characteristics both assumptions i e triangular or trapezoidal hydrograph shapes and constant catchment s time of concentration are necessary for the derivation of the analytical expressions these two assumptions have been used in other studies and were found to be acceptable for practical purposes hassini and guo 2017 ponce 1989 the trapezoidal shape is more general since it actually does consider both trapezoidal and triangular hydrograph shapes according to the conditions of individual events first if t t c runoff rate increases approximately linearly and reaches a maximum peak discharge right at the end of the rainfall event this maximum lasts t c t long until the end when the whole catchment is contributing runoff to the outlet afterwards it decreases linearly to zero over a period equaling t second if t t c the hydrograph is approximately triangular where the runoff rate increases linearly over t c to reach an instant maximum then deceases linearly to zero over a period of time equaling t c as well third if t t c the runoff increases linearly until it reaches a maximum at t c when the whole catchment is contributing this maximum lasts until the end of the rainfall duration then the flow rate decreases linearly to zero over a period of time equaling t c all in all the hydrograph shape is assumed to be isosceles trapezoidal a triangle may be viewed as a special trapezoid with lower and upper bases equaling t t c and t t c respectively more details can be found in ponce 1989 and hassini and guo 2017 the area of the above described trapezoids represents the runoff event volume from an urban catchment i e v r therefore the resulting peak discharge rate q p can be determined based on the geometry of the hydrograph as 5 q p v r t c t t c v r t t t c the analytical expression of q p mm h as a function of the rainfall event volume v and duration t can be obtained by substituting the expression for runoff event volume v r eq 4 into eq 5 since v r depends on t s and q p depends on v r and t c the relative magnitudes of t s and t c which are both catchment characteristics needs to be known in order to express q p analytically if a catchment s time of concentration is less than or equal to its time of saturation i e t c t s this type of catchment is referred to as type i the analytical expression of q p for type i catchments is obtained by substituting eq 4 into eq 5 whereas the possible t value is divided further into the following three ranges t t c t c t t s and t t s the results are as follows 6 q p 0 v s di h v s di t c s di v s il f c t a n d t t c v s d f c 1 h t t c v s il f c t a n d t t c h v s di t s di v s il f c t a n d t c t t s

saturation i e t c t s this type of catchment is referred to as type ii the analytical expression of q p for type ii catchments is also obtained by substituting eq 4 into eq 5 whereas the possible t value is divided into the following three ranges t t s t s t t c and t t c note that these three ranges are different from the three ranges for type i catchments the substitution results are 7 q p 0 v

basis for the derivation of the analytical expressions of the peak discharge exceedance probabilities in this case the mathematical relationships between the input and output random variables are the peak discharge expressions shown in eqs 6 and 7 where q p is expressed as functions of the two input random variables rainfall event volume v and duration t many researchers e g eagleson 1972 1978 howard 1976 adams et al 1986 guo and adams 1998a adams and papa 2000 guo 2001 guo and baetz 2007 zhang and guo 2013a b and hassini and guo 2016 found that these two random variables follow exponential distributions at many different geographical locations especially in north america hassini and guo 2016 proposed a procedure for testing the exponentiality of rainfall event volume duration and interevent time in this paper v and t are assumed to have the following exponential distributions 8 f v Œ∂ e Œ∂ v 9 f t Œª e Œª t where Œ∂ and Œª are the exponential distribution parameters for rainfall event volume and duration respectively since the peak discharge rate depends on the two random variables v and t the exceedance probability of q p per rainfall event can be determined using the joint probability density function of v and t to ease the derivations random variables v and t are assumed to be statistically independent as it was done in many other studies e g eagleson 1972 guo and adams 1998a adams and papa 2000 and hassini and guo 2017 thus the joint probability density function of v and t is the product of their marginal probability density functions eqs 8 and 9 according to eqs 6 and 7 a zero peak discharge value i e q p 0 occurs when v s di for any values of t independent of the relative magnitude of t s and t c making use of the derived probability distribution theory and the independence assumption between v and t the probability per rainfall event with a null peak discharge rate is 10 p q p 0 0 s di 0 Œ∂ e Œ∂ v Œª e Œª t d t d v 1 e Œ∂ s di in the above integration the region of integration as required in using the derived probability distribution theory is the region on the v t plane covered by t 0 and 0 v s di for a given non zero peak discharge rate q p i e q p 0 and based on eqs 6 and 7 the exceedance probability p q p q p depends on the relative magnitude of the catchment s time of concentration t c and the catchment s soil time of saturation t s for either cases the peak discharge rate expressions i e eqs 6 and 7 are piece wise functions defined over seven subdomains of v and t as a result the exceedance probability expression is determined by integrating the joint probability density of v and t over the union of the sub regions delineated based on each of the subdomains described in eqs 6 and 7 for each type of catchments there are six mutually exclusive sub regions of integration as given by each applicable v and t subdomains i e those subdomains other than v s di this is because v s di can only result in a zero peak discharge while each of the other remaining six sets of v and t conditions may result in a q p being greater than the given non zero q p detailed delineation of the sub regions of integration and derivation of the exceedance probabilities are illustrated in appendix a in order to simplify the notation of the derivation results for zero q p eq 10 and non zero q p values eq a 1

rainfall event is summarized in table 1 5 annual exceedance probability and flood frequency distribution in flood control design annual exceedance probability or return period is often used instead of exceedance probability per rainfall event by definition return period t r in years is the inverse of the exceedance probability per year the exceedance probabilities p q p q p described in table 1 along with the expressions of g 1 q p through g 14 q p are exceedance probabilities per rainfall event which must be multiplied by the average number of events per year denoted as Œ∏ in order to obtain exceedance probabilities per year the return period of a given peak discharge rate q p can therefore be calculated as 11 t r 1 Œ∏ p q p q p the expressions shown in table 1 and eq 11 constitute a new derived flood frequency distribution model considering both infiltration and saturation excess runoff this new developed model is referred to as the apswmtis an acronym for analytical probabilistic storm water models using trapezoidal hydrographs and including both infiltration and saturation excess runoff generations 6 comparison with swmm design storm results 6 1 previous comparison studies and the purpose of this comparison apswmtis is the most comprehensive version of apswm that has been developed so far as it considers both runoff generation mechanisms and all possible runoff hydrograph shapes studies comparing apswm with design storm modeling or continuous simulation results were performed in previous studies to demonstrate the validity of similar simplifying assumptions incorporated in order to facilitate the development of the previous versions of apswm the performance of the previously developed apswm versions which do not consider both runoff generation mechanisms and all possible hydrograph shapes were verified under different catchment conditions some of these verification studies focused on peak discharge frequency estimations e g guo and adams 1998b chen and adams 2007 guo and markus 2011 and hassini and guo 2017 and some other verification studies focused on runoff volume frequency estimations e g guo and adams 1998a and guo et al 2012 since the derivation processes followed in this study for the analytical estimation of peak discharge frequency distributions are mathematically robust and the accuracy of the two runoff generation mechanisms and the simplified possible hydrograph shapes have been verified separately already in previous studies the same level of accuracy as observed in previous comparison verification studies is expected for apswmtis that is why in this study comparisons will be performed with more emphasis on the results from apswmtis under different climatic conditions and the ability of the apa in accurately reflecting climatic differences with the proper selection of duration and hyetograph for individual design storms the design storm approach can produce reasonably accurate results of peak discharge rates of different return periods balistrocchi et al 2013 guo 2001 since peak discharge rates are the focus of this study the design storm approach is used for comparison in order to confirm and verify further the accuracy of apswmtis swmm version 5 1 developed by the united states environmental protection agency is used in this study in practice so far swmm is perhaps the only hydrologic model that includes the saturation excess runoff generation process and is widely used in engineering practice the saturation excess runoff generation process was also just recently incorporated into the swmm model rossman 2010 catchment s parameters required by apswmtis are similar to those required by swmm rainfall data of seven stations located in the midwest region of the united states are used to verify the ability of the apa through the use of apswmtis in reflecting the climatic differences between different locations hassini and guo 2016 performed rainfall data analysis for these seven stations for each station continuous historical rainfall records 53 years were separated into independent individual events the pdfs of rainfall event characteristics were found to fit well exponential distributions refer to hassini and guo 2016 for more details about the selected stations their rainfall data analysis and fitting of rainfall event characteristics frequency distributions the rainfall input data required by apswm i e average rainfall event volume v duration t and annual average number of rainfall events Œ∏ of the selected stations are summarized in table 2 using the design storm approach the required rainfall input data are design storm duration volume and hyetograph for peak discharge frequency estimations the design storm duration of 24 h is usually selected and partial duration series pds rainfall volumes of different return periods are used table 3 the pds volumes of the selected stations are retrieved from the u s national weather service s website noaa s national weather service 2017 the same period of rainfall data used in apswm from 1949 to 2001 is used in pds analysis the design storm s hyetograph is determined using the methodology developed by the united states department of agriculture natural resources conservation service usda nrcs all the stations used in this study are in the area where type 2 storms apply a time step of 30 min is used for hyetograph generation design storm modeling results are compared with those from apswmtis to demonstrate further the accuracy of apswmtis 6 2 characteristics of the test catchment the test catchment is an actual catchment located in hamilton ontario canada it is a typical small urban catchment with residential neighborhoods some of the catchment s characteristics that need to be determined depend on the selected rainfall runoff transformation model horton infiltration equation is used to calculate infiltration losses the catchment s characteristics required by swmm are calibrated by miao 2016 and are summarized in table 4 most of the catchment s characteristics required by apswm are also available in table 4 the initial soil wetting infiltration volume s iw and the catchment s time of concentration t c are the only parameters missing however they can be estimated using data from table 4 the initial soil wetting infiltration volume s iw can be estimated using the formula proposed by guo and adams 1998a s iw f 0 f c k 1 exp k t the variability in the rainfall event duration t has a negligible effect on the s iw calculations thus t can be replaced by the average rainfall event duration in the above equation based on the available catchment s characteristics table 4 the kinematic wave equation is a good candidate for estimating the catchment s time of concentration however this equation is recommended for catchments with flow sheets less than 91 m in length which is not the case for the catchment under study the flow sheet is 1487 m in length as shown in table 4 there are other equations that can be used to estimate t c such as the kirpich the us federal aviation administration faa and kerby equations the faa equation is selected for this study because it is the most widely used equation due to its connection with the rational formula it is also recommended by the american society of civil engineers asce and it is suitable for urban catchments ken 2015 the faa equation is as follows t c 3 26 1 1 c l 0 5 100 s 1 3 where t c is in minutes l is the overland flow length m and s is the slope of the surface m m the rational coefficient c in the above equation depends on the climate soil characteristics and land cover where land cover is the most important factor for urban catchments c depends largely on the impervious fraction and can be estimated as c c i h c p 1 h where c i and c p are the rational runoff coefficients for impervious and pervious areas of the catchment respectively h is the impervious fraction of the catchment assuming that c i and c p are 0 85 and 0 35 respectively t c was estimated to be 69 34 min 1 16 h 6 3 comparison results this study is to provide an example on how the results of apswmtis may compare with those from swmm using a different flood frequency estimation approach i e the design storm approach therefore only the parameters that are used in apswmtis but not explicitly used in swmm will be calibrated and validated according to swmm results no calibration or validation is needed for parameters used in both apswmtis and swmm for these parameters the same parameter value is used in both apswmtis and swmm in actual applications of apswmtis input parameters representing the catchment characteristics may need to be calibrated according to observed rainfall and flow data the catchment s time of concentration t c is the only parameter that is not directly used by swmm and may have an important effect on flood frequencies thus t c is the only parameter that needs to be calibrated in this study in order to make sure that the apswmtis and swmm input data about the catchment do represent closely the same catchment rainfall data from st cloud airport mn are used to calibrate while rainfall data from des moines airport ia are used to validate apswmtis results against swmm results during the calibration and validation processes starting from the previously estimated t c value the t c used in apswmtis was gradually modified to match the apswmtis results to swmm results however some differences between the results from the two models are inevitable due to their different ways of flood frequency estimations the best calibrated value for t c was found to be 1 25 h and this value is used in subsequent comparison studies the peak discharge rates resulting from apswmtis and swmm using rainfall data of mn and ia stations for different return periods t c 1 25 h are compared in fig 1 as shown in fig 1 apswmtis and swmm results are fairly close for both stations therefore 1 25 h is used as the t c value when comparing apswmtis and swmm results for the rest of the stations table 5 summarizes the differences in results between the two models i e apswmtis and swmm for all the stations used in this study other than the stations used for calibration and validation mn and ia minimal differences are shown for the nd and sd stations followed by the stations of ks mo and then ne table 5 averaged across the six different return periods the percent difference between apswmtis and swmm results is the lowest 1 0 for sd and the highest 16 7 for ne averaged across all the stations and return periods the overall average difference between apswmtis and swmm results is 6 4 looking at individual return periods but averaging across different stations the difference between apswmtis and swmm results is the lowest of 0 5 for the 2 year return period and are quite similar about 5 10 for other return periods it is also observed that apswmtis results are generally slightly higher than those from swmm design storm modeling the best and worst comparisons i e comparisons for the sd and ne stations respectively are plotted in fig 2 since the same test catchment is used in this study the larger differences in apswmtis and swmm results at the mo and ne stations must mainly be due to the fact that the exponential distributions do not fit equally well the rainfall event characteristics at these two stations thus more in depth analysis for these two locations is necessary overall however the differences in results are almost always less than 20 this level of difference may also occur just between design storm modeling results if different design storms are used guo and zhuge 2008 hassini and guo 2017 for the same location depending on the purposes or contexts of study design storms used may be different in duration or hyetograph shape to judge which modeling approach is more accurate observed runoff data or continuous simulation results are required this is not the focus of this study as it was already investigated in other studies e g guo 2001 and hassini and guo 2017 the quality record time interval consistency and reliability of the original rainfall time series would all affect the accuracy of either the design storm modeling or the analytical probabilistic approaches for estimating flood frequencies this example does not investigate that but serves as a verification of the developed model and the apa in general as illustrated in table 2 the selected climatic stations have low to moderate variations in rainfall event characteristics these variations are reflected either in all the three rainfall event characteristics or only in one or two of the rainfall event characteristics for instance the differences in all the three rainfall event characteristics are moderate between ks and mo but very low between ks and ne whereas mn and ia have the same average rainfall event volume and small differences in the rainfall event duration and interevent time apswmtis results of mn and ia stations are shown in fig 1 and the results of the other stations are given in fig 3 both figs 1 and 3 show that the differences in rainfall event characteristics do result in corresponding differences in apswmtis results for all the return periods of interest this implies that apswmtis and the apa in general are capable of accurately capturing and representing the differences in rainfall characteristics that affect urban catchments flood frequencies 7 summary and conclusions this study brings the development of analytical probabilistic stormwater models for flood frequency estimation for small urban catchments to a new stage where saturation excess runoff infiltration excess runoff and various possible hydrograph shapes are all taken into consideration although quite lengthy the derived probability distributions of peak discharge rate are still in closed analytical form and are computationally efficient and easy to use if they are implemented into a spreadsheet or a small computer program results from the derived analytical expressions i e the apswmtis model are compared to those from the use of the design storm approach and swmm for modeling the catchment hydrologic processes swmm is specifically chosen for comparison because it is the only design storm model that allows the inclusion of the saturation excess runoff generation and it is also widely used in urban stormwater management no study has been performed previously to investigate the ability of the analytical probabilistic approach in representing accurately the differences in rainfall conditions between different climatic stations to fill this gap seven stations from the midwest region of the united states where used together with a real catchment in hamilton ontario canada the catchment parameters that are required by swmm were already calibrated by miao 2016 using observed rainfall and flow data the same or matching input data are used for both apswmtis and swmm comparable results were found with acceptable differences less than 20 this level of difference is usually expected due to differences in modeling approaches nevertheless to fully analyze the causes of these differences more comprehensive comparison studies are needed in the future the main purpose of this paper is the derivation and verification of apswmtis verification of the derived analytical probabilistic models under different catchment conditions is not performed in this study because it was completed in other related studies such as guo and adams 1998b and hassini and guo 2017 already the saturation parameter s s i e maximum possible infiltration volume is the only additional catchment characteristic its sensitivity analysis was not conducted in this study since the focus of this study is on the analytical derivation of the apswmtis guo et al 2012 examined the analytical probabilistic model s sensitivity of runoff event volume on the changing magnitude of s s similar studies can be performed in the future examining the analytical probabilistic model s sensitivity of peak discharge rate on the changing magnitude of s s using the newly derived apswmtis due to its incorporation of the parameter of maximum saturation apswmtis is expected to produce more accurate results especially when pervious areas are more predominant within the catchment of interest the use of low impact development practices lids such as green roofs and infiltration trenches as urban stormwater management measures increases the equivalent pervious areas of urban catchments lids together with the impervious areas that they serve can be modeled as pervious areas which allow a limited maximum amount of rainfall to be infiltrated with the incorporation of the additional parameter s s apswmtis can be used to effectively and directly model the effect of lids on small urban catchments flood frequencies credit authorship contribution statement sonia hassini conceptualization methodology software validation formal analysis

catchments with t c t s according to eq 6 for a given non zero q p value the v and t values that would result in a q p being greater than q p may come from either of the six subdomains of v and t values i e those subdomains of the q p function as defined in eq 6 other than the first one with v s di each of the six subdomains would therefore result in a sub region of integration for determining p q p q p those sub regions of integrations are determined as follows the first sub region of integration referred to as r i 1 is determined as the sub region of v and t given that s di v s il f c t and t t c whereas the resulting q p must be greater than q p based on eq 6 r i 1 is therefore defined by h v s di t c q p s di v s il f c t t t c yields q p t c h s di v s il f c t t t c let l 1 l 2 and l c be the lines defined by v f c t s il v q p t c h s di and t t c respectively all lines in this paper are plotted with v on the vertical axis and t on the horizontal axis then r i 1 is the area above l 2 but below l 1 and on the left side of the vertical line l c in a way similar to r i 1 the second sub region of integration referred to as r i 2 is determined as the sub region of v and t given that v s il f c t and t t c whereas the resulting q p must be greater than q p again based on eq 6 r i 2 is defined by v s d f c 1 h t t c q p v s il f c t t t c yields v q p t c s d 1 h f c t v s il f c t t t c let l 3 be the line defined by v f c 1 h t t c q p s d r i 2 is the area above l 1 and l 3 and also on the left side of l c similar to r i 1 and r i 2 the third sub region of integration r i 3 is defined by h v s di t q p s di v s il f c t t c t t s yields q p t h s di v s il f c t t c t t s let l 4 be the line defined by v q p h t s di r i 3 is the area above l 4 but below l 1 and also on the right side of l c and the left side of l s the fourth sub region of integration r i 4 is defined by v s d f c 1 h t t q p v s il f c t t c t t s yields v q p 1 h f c t s d v s il f c t t c t t s let l 5 be the line defined by v f c 1 h q p t s d r i 4 is the area above both l 1 and l 5 and also on the right side of l c and the left side of l s the fifth sub region of integration r i 5 is defined by h v s di t q p s di v s il s m t t s yields q p t h s di v s il s m t t s let l 6 be the line defined by v s il s m r i 5 is the area above l 4 but below l 6 and on the right side of l s the sixth sub region of integration r i 6 is defined by v s d 1 h s m t q p v s il s m t t s yields v q p t 1 h s m s d v s il s m t t s let l 7 be the line defined by v q p t 1 h s m s d r i 6 is the area above both l 6 and l 7 and also on the right side of l s the relative locations of the sub regions depend on the relative positions of the lines that define them according to the above definitions sub regions r i 1 and r i 2 are on the left side of the vertical line l c and delineated by the group of lines l 1 l 2 and l 3 referred to as the g1 group sub regions r i 3 and r i 4 are situated between the two vertical lines l c and l s and bounded by the group referred to as the g2 group of lines l 1 l 4 and l 5 sub regions r i 5 and r i 6 are located on the right side of l s and bounded by the group referred to as the g3 group of lines l 4 l 6 and l 7 then it makes sense in order to determine the relative locations of the sub regions to investigate the relative positions of the lines of each group separately the relative positions of lines depend on the relative magnitudes of their intercepts and slopes let i 1 i 2 and i 3 be the intercepts of lines l 1 l 2 and l 3 at the v axis respectively i 1 c i 2 c and i 3 c be the intercepts of lines l 1 l 2 and l 3 at l c respectively i 4 c and i 5 c be the intercepts of lines l 4 and l 5 at l c respectively i 1 s i 4 s and i 5 s be the intercepts of lines l 1 l 4 and l 5 at l s respectively and i 4 s i 6 s and i 7 s be the intercepts of lines l 4 l 6 and l 7 at l s respectively let s 1 s 2 s 3 s 4 s 5 s 6 and s 7 be the slopes of lines l 1 through l 7 respectively the required intercepts and slopes for the delineation of the different sub regions are summarized in table a1 in order to determine the relative magnitudes of these intercepts and slopes subtractions from each other are applied to the expressions of each couple of slopes and each couple of intercepts in each group of lines i e g1 g2 and g3 the signs of these subtractions based on the values of q p determine the relative magnitudes of the slopes or intercepts the relative magnitudes of slopes of the lines in g1 are s 1 s 3 s 2 for all q p in g2 are s 1 s 4 s 5 if q p hf c and s 5 s 4 s 1 if q p hf c and in g3 s 6 s 7 s 4 for all q p for the three groups of lines the relative magnitudes of intercepts depend on the catchment characteristics and q p values as summarized in table a2 the intercepts relative magnitude differ depending on whether s dd t c is less or greater than s dd t s f c as a result type i catchments need to be divided into two sub types catchment type ia where s dd t c s dd t s f c and catchment type ib where s dd t c s dd t s f c for each sub type of catchments there are four possible intervals of q p values where the relative magnitudes of intercepts of the three groups of lines may differ table a2 for catchments of type ia the four intervals are 0 q p hs dd t c hs dd t c q p h s dd t s h f c h s dd t s h f c q p h s dd t c h f c and q p h s dd t c h f c respectively however for the catchments of type ib the four intervals are 0 q p h s dd t s h f c h s dd t s h f c q p h s dd t c h s dd t c q p h s dd t c h f c and q p h s dd t c h f c respectively thus for each catchment types there are four possible configurations of the region of integration the four possible intervals of q p for type ia catchments are referred to as inta1 inta2 inta3 and inta4 and those for type ib catchments are referred to as intb1 intb2 intb3 and intb4 as illustrated in table a2 the relative magnitudes of intercepts of the different groups of lines i e g1 g2 and g3 when q p values are in intervals inta1 inta3 and inta4 for type ia catchments are the same as for type ib catchments when q p values are in intervals intb1 intb3 and intb4 respectively the relative magnitudes of intercepts in interval intb2 are different from those in inta2 table a 2 thus in total there are five different configurations of the region of integration for types ia and ib catchments a 2 derivation of the peak discharge exceedance probability for type i catchments plotting the region of integration which is the union of sub regions r i 1 through r i 6 facilitates the analytical derivation of the peak discharge exceedance probability p q p q p as mentioned earlier the configuration of the region of integration depends on the catchment type and the interval that the q p value of interest is located in in the following each configuration of the region of integration among the five possible configurations as discussed earlier is described together with the derivation of the corresponding exceedance probability the first region of integration configuration fig a 1 is applicable for catchments of types ia and ib with q p taking on values from intervals inta1 and intb1 respectively as they have the same relative magnitudes of intercepts and slopes table a 2 in addition to the determination of the relative magnitudes of the intercepts and slopes of lines in each group it is essential to figure out whether the lines of each group intersect given the conditions defining the two sub types of catchments and the range of values of q p for this configuration i e inta1 and intb1 the lines in g1 do not intersect neither would lines in g2 however the lines in g3 i e l 4 l 6 and l 7 intersect at a common point

relative magnitudes of intercepts of each group of lines within different possible intervals of q p values are summarized in table a 3 for g1 and g2 groups of lines the relative magnitudes of slopes are the same as described for type i catchments for group g4 let s 8 be the slope of line l 8 which is newly introduced for type ii catchments s 8 0 since l 8 is a horizontal line therefore s 4 s 6 s

5672,derived flood frequency models developed specifically for urban stormwater management purposes are referred to as analytical probabilistic stormwater models these models use closed form analytical equations to estimate flood frequencies under various land use conditions which facilitate quick analysis of different design alternatives in this paper in order to further improve the capability of the analytical probabilistic models additional analytical expressions relating a catchment s peak discharge rate to its physical characteristics and the local rainfall statistics are derived considering saturation excess in addition to infiltration excess runoff generation and various possible hydrograph shapes these analytical expressions along with the frequency distributions of the input rainfall event volume and duration are used to develop a new derived flood frequency model suitable for catchments where saturation excess runoff generation is possible an example application of the new model to a test catchment in hamilton ontario canada is illustrated to verify the accuracy of the new model assuming hypothetically that the same catchment is instead located at several other places in the united states the reliability of the analytical probabilistic models under different climatic conditions is verified as well keywords peak discharge frequency distribution urban stormwater management analytical probabilistic models saturation excess infiltration excess 1 introduction urban stormwater management facilities are vital for the mitigation of the impact of polluted runoff and reduction of runoff volumes and peak discharge rates both runoff volume and peak discharge frequencies are needed for the planning analysis and design of stormwater management facilities in practice these frequencies are usually estimated using the design storm and or continuous simulation approaches the design storm approach is based on a set of individual rainfall events and does not model the inter event conditions of the site of interest however it greatly eases the approach s applications in practice the continuous simulation approach uses long rainfall records directly which makes it more accurate however its application for individual design cases is too time consuming thus a theoretically more robust and computationally more efficient approach that can analytically estimate the runoff volume and peak discharge frequencies would be very useful although there is a promising analytical probabilistic approach referred to as the apa in this paper that has been under investigation for several decades it is still under applied in practice and requires more improvements in applying the apa for a location of interest the long term the longer the better as long as the climate there is viewed as stationary continuous rainfall record of that location is separated into individual rainfall events based on a selected minimum dry time between events known as the inter event time definition ietd each two consecutive rainfall periods are considered as separate rainfall events only if the dry time between them is greater than the ietd for small urban catchments the suitable ietd varies between 6 and 12 h guo and adams 1998a guo and baetz 2007 each rainfall event is characterized by its volume v duration t and the dry time referred to as the interevent time b that separates it from the antecedent rainfall event in order to use the apa for urban stormwater management a statistical analysis of the separated rainfall events is needed first to fit theoretical frequency distributions to rainfall event characteristics once this is done for a location of interest the statistics of the individual rainfall event characteristics are the only necessary rainfall input data required by the apa for stormwater management analysis the apa is based on the derived probability distribution theory which states that the probability distribution of a dependent variable e g the peak discharge of a runoff event can be determined analytically if the probability distributions of the independent variables e g rainfall event volume and duration are known and the functional relationship between the dependent and independent variables e g the rainfall runoff transformation relation is either monotonically increasing or decreasing benjamin and cornell 1970 the derived probability distribution theory was first applied in water resources research by eagleson 1972 to estimate the frequency of peak stream flows using the probability density functions pdfs of rainfall intensity and duration and the kinematic wave formula which represents the functional relationship between peak stream flow and rainfall characteristics then the same theory was applied in urban stormwater management analysis e g adams et al 1986 guo and adams 1998a b adams and papa 2000 guo 2001 chen and adams 2005 2007 bacchi et al 2008 balistrocchi et al 2009 hassini and guo 2017 and for natural watersheds e g balistrocchi et al 2013 de michele and salvadori 2002 bocchiola and rosso 2009 by many other researchers the set of analytical expressions that can be used to estimate the probability distributions of runoff event volume and peak discharge rate from small urban catchments derived mainly by guo and adams 1998a b are collectively referred to as the analytical probabilistic stormwater models apswm several other studies e g guo and adams 1999a b guo 2001 quader and guo 2006 guo and baetz 2007 guo et al 2012 hassini and guo 2017 were performed to expand improve or validate the apswm with each new expansion the apswm was applied under different conditions and was found to provide results comparable to those from either the design storm or continuous simulation approaches apswm is event based where individual rainfall and runoff events are considered as a whole each event has its own characteristics and these event characteristics are the subject of study for example when a rainfall event s volume exceeds the sum of all possible losses the rainfall event produces a runoff event characterized by runoff duration volume and peak discharge rate the runoff event s duration is equal to the causal rainfall event s duration assuming that the time needed to satisfy the initial losses is negligible for small urban catchments plus the time for a drop of rain fallen on the farthest point of the catchment timewise to reach the catchment s outlet known as the catchment s time of concentration the runoff event volume is estimated as its causal rainfall event volume minus all the losses the peak discharge rate of a runoff event is determined using closed form analytical equations according to the shape of the runoff hydrograph and runoff event volume the probability distributions of runoff event volume and peak discharge rate are then derived based on the derived probability distribution theory the probability distributions of rainfall event characteristics and the analytical relationships between input rainfall and output runoff event characteristics up until 2012 only infiltration excess runoff was considered in the apswm for estimating runoff event volumes assuming that the soil will always remain unsaturated for the whole runoff event duration guo and adams 1998a incorporated the horton s model in the apswm to estimate the maximum possible infiltration loss volume infiltration is expected to start with an initial rate then decreases exponentially over time reaching quickly to a constant rate for the rest of the event however soils may get completely saturated before the end of a rainfall event and infiltration may stop while it is still raining as a result a saturation excess runoff may occur during an event which may have an important effect on the rainfall runoff transformation process of some catchments guo et al 2012 added into apswm the saturation excess runoff volume calculations and derived analytical equations to estimate the frequency distributions of runoff event volumes guo et al 2012 found that the saturation parameter representing the completely saturated conditions does have an important effect on the frequency distributions of runoff event volumes for some pervious areas however this important saturation parameter is not yet included in apswm to estimate the frequency distributions of peak discharge rates in recent years the use of low impact development practices lids such as green roofs and bio retention facilities has significantly increased for the better management of urban stormwater lids together with the impervious areas they serve may be considered as pervious areas however because of their limited size they often provide limited maximum possible infiltration volume during a rainfall event thus incorporation of the saturation parameter in runoff calculations is required for many urban catchments especially those with lids this is not only necessary for runoff event volume but also for peak discharge rate i e flood frequencies from these urban catchments for estimating the runoff peak discharge rate of an individual event the hydrograph shape in addition to the runoff event volume and duration of the runoff event need to be known thus simplification about the individual hydrograph s shape is required in the past in order to facilitate the derivations of the peak discharge pdfs in the apswm individual hydrograph s shape was assumed to be triangular recently hassini and guo 2017 derived the peak discharge pdfs assuming three possible shapes of runoff event hydrographs reflecting the relative magnitudes of rainfall event duration and the catchment s time of concentration hassini and guo 2017 found that their models produced better results than the models incorporating the triangular hydrograph assumption the main purpose of this study is to derive new pdfs of peak discharge rate considering different hydrograph shapes trapezoids and triangles and saturation excess in addition to infiltration excess runoff generations although the derivations are complex the new analytical equations obtained are still computationally efficient once derived they can easily be implemented into a spreadsheet or programmed as a handy software derivation of additional equations is only necessary for further improvement or implementation of different rainfall losses or runoff routing calculation methods 2 runoff event volume apswm is an event based probabilistic model that treats each event as a whole and does not perform time step by time step calculations as in continuous simulation models for each rainfall event the runoff event volume is the rainfall event volume minus all rainfall losses generally an urban catchment consists of pervious and impervious parts each part is assumed to generate runoff only after its rainfall losses are satisfied then the runoff volume is estimated as the area weighted runoff coming from the impervious and pervious areas the impervious area is assumed to contribute first since its rainfall losses are usually less than those lost on pervious areas as a result for each rainfall event with volume v mm and duration t h the resulting total runoff volume is 1 v r 0 v s di h v s di s di v s il f c t v s d f c 1 h t v s il f c t where v r is the runoff event volume mm h is the impervious surface fraction of the catchment s il is the pervious area initial losses mm which can be estimated as s il s dp s iw where s dp is the pervious area depression storage mm and s iw is the initial soil wetting infiltration volume mm f c is the ultimate infiltration capacity of the soil mm h s di is the impervious area depression storage mm and s d is the area weighted depression storage of the impervious areas and initial losses of the pervious areas mm i e s d h s di 1 h s il in eq 1 the soil is assumed to remain unsaturated and absorbing water at a rate equal to f c during the entire rainfall duration the additional amount of infiltration that occurred at the beginning of the rainfall event when the soil is relative dry is s iw that is why it is referred to as the initial soil wetting infiltration volume detailed derivations and justifications for using eq 1 to estimate runoff event volumes are provided in guo and adams 1998a b however eq 1 is valid only with the assumption that the soil always remains unsaturated in reality the soil may become saturated before the end of a rainfall event infiltration may cease in the middle of a rainfall event and the remaining rainfall will all contribute to surface runoff therefore guo et al 2012 revised the runoff event volume expressions to account for the saturation excess runoff by adding another pervious area parameter the maximum infiltration volume possible per rainfall event s s mm for each rainfall event at the beginning the soil is assumed to be relatively dry and at the end the soil may remain unsaturated scenario 1 or become saturated scenario 2 let s m be the maximum possible amount of water that can infiltrate into the soil after the initial soil wetting infiltration is already satisfied i e s m s s s iw for each rainfall event after subtracting the rainfall losses and combining the resulting runoff volume from the pervious and impervious catchment areas guo et al 2012 determined the total runoff volume v r as follows for scenario 1 where t s m f c or v s il s m since the soil is not saturated no saturation excess runoff will occur and only infiltration excess runoff may occur the total runoff volume is the same as given by eq 1 for scenario 2 where t s m f c and v s il s m the soil is saturated before the end of the rainfall event and 2 v r v s d 1 h s m in this paper in order to make the derivations more straightforward the two scenarios are divided further into four mutually exclusive domains of v and t let t s h be the time required for the soil to reach saturation after the initial soil wetting infiltration is completed i e t s s m f c hereinafter t s is referred to as the saturation time which may be less or greater than the rainfall event duration t logically there are three sets of conditions of v and t that can lead to scenario 1 a t t s and v s il s m b t t s and v s il s m or c t t s and v s il s m however scenario 2 is only led by one condition i e d t t s and v s il s m then rainfall events can be classified into two categories based on their durations a rainfall events with durations less than the saturation time t t s no matter how much the rainfall event volume is the soil will remain unsaturated conditions a and b b t t s which includes condition c where the soil remains unsaturated due to insufficient rainfall volume and condition d where soil saturation is attained for each rainfall event the corresponding runoff volume is as given in eq 1 if t t s if t t s thus f c t s il s m s il the runoff event volume can be calculated as follows 3 v r 0 v s di h v s di s di v s il s m v s d 1 h s m v s il s m combining eqs 1 through 3 and listing separately the additional requirement for each applicable condition the runoff event volume that results from a rainfall event can be expressed in a combined general way as 4 v r 0 v s di h v s di s di v s il f c t a n d t t s v s d f c 1 h t v s il f c t a n d t t s h v s di s di v s il s m a n d t t s v s d 1 h s m v s il s m a n d t t s 3 peak discharge rate of a runoff event knowing the total volume eq 4 and the detailed shape of the hydrograph of a runoff event the corresponding peak discharge rate can be estimated an approximate hydrograph shape may be assumed in order to analytically determine the peak discharge rate for the hydrologic design of small flood detention reservoirs wycoff and singh 1976 approximated individual flood hydrographs as triangles in the past to analytically determine the peak discharge rate of a runoff event the same triangular shape was adopted by guo and adams 1998b and recently a more general trapezoidal shape was incorporated by hassini and guo 2017 for both shapes the base which represents the runoff event duration is equal to the sum of the input rainfall event duration t and the catchment time of concentration t c for small urban catchments where runoff starts almost immediately after the start of a rainfall event because of directly connected impervious areas the duration with rainfall excess is usually the same as the causing rainfall event duration that is why in the following analysis rainfall event duration is treated as the duration with rainfall excess and that is why the runoff event duration is equal to the sum of the input rainfall event duration and the catchment time of concentration the catchment s time of concentration is assumed to be constant and solely depends on the catchment s characteristics both assumptions i e triangular or trapezoidal hydrograph shapes and constant catchment s time of concentration are necessary for the derivation of the analytical expressions these two assumptions have been used in other studies and were found to be acceptable for practical purposes hassini and guo 2017 ponce 1989 the trapezoidal shape is more general since it actually does consider both trapezoidal and triangular hydrograph shapes according to the conditions of individual events first if t t c runoff rate increases approximately linearly and reaches a maximum peak discharge right at the end of the rainfall event this maximum lasts t c t long until the end when the whole catchment is contributing runoff to the outlet afterwards it decreases linearly to zero over a period equaling t second if t t c the hydrograph is approximately triangular where the runoff rate increases linearly over t c to reach an instant maximum then deceases linearly to zero over a period of time equaling t c as well third if t t c the runoff increases linearly until it reaches a maximum at t c when the whole catchment is contributing this maximum lasts until the end of the rainfall duration then the flow rate decreases linearly to zero over a period of time equaling t c all in all the hydrograph shape is assumed to be isosceles trapezoidal a triangle may be viewed as a special trapezoid with lower and upper bases equaling t t c and t t c respectively more details can be found in ponce 1989 and hassini and guo 2017 the area of the above described trapezoids represents the runoff event volume from an urban catchment i e v r therefore the resulting peak discharge rate q p can be determined based on the geometry of the hydrograph as 5 q p v r t c t t c v r t t t c the analytical expression of q p mm h as a function of the rainfall event volume v and duration t can be obtained by substituting the expression for runoff event volume v r eq 4 into eq 5 since v r depends on t s and q p depends on v r and t c the relative magnitudes of t s and t c which are both catchment characteristics needs to be known in order to express q p analytically if a catchment s time of concentration is less than or equal to its time of saturation i e t c t s this type of catchment is referred to as type i the analytical expression of q p for type i catchments is obtained by substituting eq 4 into eq 5 whereas the possible t value is divided further into the following three ranges t t c t c t t s and t t s the results are as follows 6 q p 0 v s di h v s di t c s di v s il f c t a n d t t c v s d f c 1 h t t c v s il f c t a n d t t c h v s di t s di v s il f c t a n d t c t t s

saturation i e t c t s this type of catchment is referred to as type ii the analytical expression of q p for type ii catchments is also obtained by substituting eq 4 into eq 5 whereas the possible t value is divided into the following three ranges t t s t s t t c and t t c note that these three ranges are different from the three ranges for type i catchments the substitution results are 7 q p 0 v

basis for the derivation of the analytical expressions of the peak discharge exceedance probabilities in this case the mathematical relationships between the input and output random variables are the peak discharge expressions shown in eqs 6 and 7 where q p is expressed as functions of the two input random variables rainfall event volume v and duration t many researchers e g eagleson 1972 1978 howard 1976 adams et al 1986 guo and adams 1998a adams and papa 2000 guo 2001 guo and baetz 2007 zhang and guo 2013a b and hassini and guo 2016 found that these two random variables follow exponential distributions at many different geographical locations especially in north america hassini and guo 2016 proposed a procedure for testing the exponentiality of rainfall event volume duration and interevent time in this paper v and t are assumed to have the following exponential distributions 8 f v Œ∂ e Œ∂ v 9 f t Œª e Œª t where Œ∂ and Œª are the exponential distribution parameters for rainfall event volume and duration respectively since the peak discharge rate depends on the two random variables v and t the exceedance probability of q p per rainfall event can be determined using the joint probability density function of v and t to ease the derivations random variables v and t are assumed to be statistically independent as it was done in many other studies e g eagleson 1972 guo and adams 1998a adams and papa 2000 and hassini and guo 2017 thus the joint probability density function of v and t is the product of their marginal probability density functions eqs 8 and 9 according to eqs 6 and 7 a zero peak discharge value i e q p 0 occurs when v s di for any values of t independent of the relative magnitude of t s and t c making use of the derived probability distribution theory and the independence assumption between v and t the probability per rainfall event with a null peak discharge rate is 10 p q p 0 0 s di 0 Œ∂ e Œ∂ v Œª e Œª t d t d v 1 e Œ∂ s di in the above integration the region of integration as required in using the derived probability distribution theory is the region on the v t plane covered by t 0 and 0 v s di for a given non zero peak discharge rate q p i e q p 0 and based on eqs 6 and 7 the exceedance probability p q p q p depends on the relative magnitude of the catchment s time of concentration t c and the catchment s soil time of saturation t s for either cases the peak discharge rate expressions i e eqs 6 and 7 are piece wise functions defined over seven subdomains of v and t as a result the exceedance probability expression is determined by integrating the joint probability density of v and t over the union of the sub regions delineated based on each of the subdomains described in eqs 6 and 7 for each type of catchments there are six mutually exclusive sub regions of integration as given by each applicable v and t subdomains i e those subdomains other than v s di this is because v s di can only result in a zero peak discharge while each of the other remaining six sets of v and t conditions may result in a q p being greater than the given non zero q p detailed delineation of the sub regions of integration and derivation of the exceedance probabilities are illustrated in appendix a in order to simplify the notation of the derivation results for zero q p eq 10 and non zero q p values eq a 1

rainfall event is summarized in table 1 5 annual exceedance probability and flood frequency distribution in flood control design annual exceedance probability or return period is often used instead of exceedance probability per rainfall event by definition return period t r in years is the inverse of the exceedance probability per year the exceedance probabilities p q p q p described in table 1 along with the expressions of g 1 q p through g 14 q p are exceedance probabilities per rainfall event which must be multiplied by the average number of events per year denoted as Œ∏ in order to obtain exceedance probabilities per year the return period of a given peak discharge rate q p can therefore be calculated as 11 t r 1 Œ∏ p q p q p the expressions shown in table 1 and eq 11 constitute a new derived flood frequency distribution model considering both infiltration and saturation excess runoff this new developed model is referred to as the apswmtis an acronym for analytical probabilistic storm water models using trapezoidal hydrographs and including both infiltration and saturation excess runoff generations 6 comparison with swmm design storm results 6 1 previous comparison studies and the purpose of this comparison apswmtis is the most comprehensive version of apswm that has been developed so far as it considers both runoff generation mechanisms and all possible runoff hydrograph shapes studies comparing apswm with design storm modeling or continuous simulation results were performed in previous studies to demonstrate the validity of similar simplifying assumptions incorporated in order to facilitate the development of the previous versions of apswm the performance of the previously developed apswm versions which do not consider both runoff generation mechanisms and all possible hydrograph shapes were verified under different catchment conditions some of these verification studies focused on peak discharge frequency estimations e g guo and adams 1998b chen and adams 2007 guo and markus 2011 and hassini and guo 2017 and some other verification studies focused on runoff volume frequency estimations e g guo and adams 1998a and guo et al 2012 since the derivation processes followed in this study for the analytical estimation of peak discharge frequency distributions are mathematically robust and the accuracy of the two runoff generation mechanisms and the simplified possible hydrograph shapes have been verified separately already in previous studies the same level of accuracy as observed in previous comparison verification studies is expected for apswmtis that is why in this study comparisons will be performed with more emphasis on the results from apswmtis under different climatic conditions and the ability of the apa in accurately reflecting climatic differences with the proper selection of duration and hyetograph for individual design storms the design storm approach can produce reasonably accurate results of peak discharge rates of different return periods balistrocchi et al 2013 guo 2001 since peak discharge rates are the focus of this study the design storm approach is used for comparison in order to confirm and verify further the accuracy of apswmtis swmm version 5 1 developed by the united states environmental protection agency is used in this study in practice so far swmm is perhaps the only hydrologic model that includes the saturation excess runoff generation process and is widely used in engineering practice the saturation excess runoff generation process was also just recently incorporated into the swmm model rossman 2010 catchment s parameters required by apswmtis are similar to those required by swmm rainfall data of seven stations located in the midwest region of the united states are used to verify the ability of the apa through the use of apswmtis in reflecting the climatic differences between different locations hassini and guo 2016 performed rainfall data analysis for these seven stations for each station continuous historical rainfall records 53 years were separated into independent individual events the pdfs of rainfall event

type 2 storms apply a time step of 30 min is used for hyetograph generation design storm modeling results are compared with those from apswmtis to demonstrate further the accuracy of apswmtis 6 2 characteristics of the test catchment the test catchment is an actual catchment located in hamilton ontario canada it is a typical small urban catchment with residential neighborhoods some of the catchment s characteristics that need to be determined depend on the selected rainfall runoff transformation model horton infiltration equation is used to calculate infiltration losses the catchment s characteristics required by swmm are calibrated by miao 2016 and are summarized in table 4 most of the catchment s characteristics required by apswm are also available in table 4 the initial soil wetting infiltration volume s iw and the catchment s time of concentration t c are the only parameters missing however they can be estimated using data from table 4 the initial soil wetting infiltration volume s iw can be estimated using the formula proposed by guo and adams 1998a s iw f 0 f c k 1 exp k t the variability in the rainfall event duration t has a negligible effect on the s iw calculations thus t can be replaced by the average rainfall event duration in the above equation based on the available catchment s characteristics table 4 the kinematic wave equation is a good candidate for estimating the catchment s time of concentration however this equation is recommended for catchments with flow sheets less than 91 m in length which is not the case for the catchment under study the flow sheet is 1487 m in length as shown in table 4 there are other equations that can be used to estimate t c such as the kirpich the us federal aviation administration faa and kerby equations the faa equation is selected for this study because it is the most widely used equation due to its connection with the rational formula it is also recommended by the american society of civil engineers asce and it is suitable for urban catchments ken 2015 the faa equation is as follows t c 3 26 1 1 c l 0 5 100 s 1 3 where t c is in minutes l is the overland flow length m and s is the slope of the surface m m the rational coefficient c in the above equation depends on the climate soil characteristics and land cover where land cover is the most important factor for urban catchments c depends largely on the impervious fraction and can be estimated as c c i h c p 1 h where c i and c p are the rational runoff coefficients for impervious and pervious areas of the catchment respectively h is the impervious fraction of the catchment assuming that c i and c p are 0 85 and 0 35 respectively t c was estimated to be 69 34 min 1 16 h 6 3 comparison results this study is to provide an example on how the results of apswmtis may compare with those from swmm using a different flood frequency estimation approach i e the design storm approach therefore only the parameters that are used in apswmtis but not explicitly used in swmm will be calibrated and validated according to swmm results no calibration or validation is needed for parameters used in both apswmtis and swmm for these parameters the same parameter value is used in both apswmtis and swmm in actual applications of apswmtis input parameters representing the catchment characteristics may need to be calibrated according to observed rainfall and flow data the catchment s time of concentration t c is the only parameter that is not directly used by swmm and may have an important effect on flood frequencies thus t c is the only parameter that needs to be calibrated in this study in order to make sure that the apswmtis and swmm input data about the catchment do represent closely the same catchment rainfall data from st cloud airport mn are used to calibrate while rainfall data from des moines airport ia are used to validate apswmtis results against swmm results during the calibration and validation processes starting from the previously estimated t c value the t c used in apswmtis was gradually modified to match the apswmtis results to swmm results however some differences between the results from the two models are inevitable due to their different ways of flood frequency estimations the best calibrated value for t c was found to be 1 25 h and this value is used in subsequent comparison studies the peak discharge rates resulting from apswmtis and swmm using rainfall data of mn and ia stations for different return periods t c 1 25 h are compared in fig 1 as shown in fig 1 apswmtis and swmm results are fairly close for both stations therefore 1 25 h is used as the t c value when comparing apswmtis and swmm results for the rest of the stations table 5 summarizes the differences in results between the two models i e apswmtis and swmm for all the stations used in this study other than the stations used for calibration and validation mn and ia minimal differences are shown for the nd and sd stations followed by the stations of ks mo and then ne table 5 averaged across the six different return periods the percent difference between apswmtis and swmm results is the lowest 1 0 for sd and the highest 16 7 for ne averaged across all the stations and return periods the overall average difference between apswmtis and swmm results is 6 4 looking at individual return periods but averaging across different stations the difference between apswmtis and swmm results is the lowest of 0 5 for the 2 year return period and are quite similar about 5 10 for other return periods it is also observed that apswmtis results are generally slightly higher than those from swmm design storm modeling the best and worst comparisons i e comparisons for the sd and ne stations respectively are plotted in fig 2 since the same test catchment is used in this study the larger differences in apswmtis and swmm results at the mo and ne stations must mainly be due to the fact that the exponential distributions do not fit equally well the rainfall event characteristics at these two stations thus more in depth analysis for these two locations is necessary overall however the differences in results are almost always less than 20 this level of difference may also occur just between design storm modeling results if different design storms are used guo and zhuge 2008 hassini and guo 2017 for the same location depending on the purposes or contexts of study design storms used may be different in duration or hyetograph shape to judge which modeling approach is more accurate observed runoff data or continuous simulation results are required this is not the focus of this study as it was already investigated in other studies e g guo 2001 and hassini and guo 2017 the quality record time interval consistency and reliability of the original rainfall time series would all affect the accuracy of either the design storm modeling or the analytical probabilistic approaches for estimating flood frequencies this example does not investigate that but serves as a verification of the developed model and the apa in general as illustrated in table 2 the selected climatic stations have low to moderate variations in rainfall event characteristics these variations are reflected either in all the three rainfall event characteristics or only in one or two of the rainfall event characteristics for instance the differences in all the three rainfall event characteristics are moderate between ks and mo but very low between ks and ne whereas mn and ia have the same average rainfall event volume and small differences in the rainfall event duration and interevent time apswmtis results of mn and ia stations are shown in fig 1 and the results of the other stations are given in fig 3 both figs 1 and 3 show that the differences in rainfall event characteristics do result in corresponding differences in apswmtis results for all the return periods of interest this implies that apswmtis and the apa in general are capable of accurately capturing and representing the differences in rainfall characteristics that affect urban catchments flood frequencies 7 summary and conclusions this study brings the development of analytical probabilistic stormwater models for flood frequency estimation for small urban catchments to a new stage where saturation excess runoff infiltration excess runoff and various possible hydrograph shapes are all taken into consideration although quite lengthy the derived probability distributions of peak discharge rate are still in closed analytical form and are computationally efficient and easy to use if they are implemented into a spreadsheet or a small computer program results from the derived analytical expressions i e the apswmtis model are compared to those from the use of the design storm approach and swmm for modeling the catchment hydrologic processes swmm is specifically chosen for comparison because it is the only design storm model that allows the inclusion of the saturation excess runoff generation and it is also widely used in urban stormwater management no study has been performed previously to investigate the ability of the analytical probabilistic approach in representing accurately the differences in rainfall conditions between different climatic stations to fill this gap seven stations from the midwest region of the united states where used together with a real catchment in hamilton ontario canada the catchment parameters that are required by swmm were already calibrated by miao 2016 using observed rainfall and flow data the same or matching input data are used for both apswmtis and swmm comparable results were found with acceptable differences less than 20 this level of difference is usually expected due to differences in modeling approaches nevertheless to fully analyze the causes of these differences more comprehensive comparison studies are needed in the future the main purpose of this paper is the derivation and verification of apswmtis verification of the derived analytical probabilistic models under different catchment conditions is not performed in this study because it was completed in other related studies such as guo and adams 1998b and hassini and guo 2017 already the saturation parameter s s i e maximum possible infiltration volume is the only additional catchment characteristic its sensitivity analysis was not conducted in this study since the focus of this study is on the analytical derivation of the apswmtis guo et al 2012 examined the analytical probabilistic model s sensitivity of runoff event volume on the changing magnitude of s s similar studies can be performed in the future examining the analytical probabilistic model s sensitivity of peak discharge rate on the changing magnitude of s s using the newly derived apswmtis due to its incorporation of the parameter of maximum saturation apswmtis is expected to produce more accurate results especially when pervious areas are more predominant within the catchment of interest the use of low impact development practices lids such as green roofs and infiltration trenches as urban stormwater management measures increases the equivalent pervious areas of urban catchments lids together with the impervious areas that they serve can be modeled as pervious areas which allow a limited maximum amount of rainfall to be infiltrated with the incorporation of the additional parameter s s apswmtis can be used to effectively and directly model the effect of lids on small urban catchments flood frequencies credit authorship contribution statement sonia hassini conceptualization methodology software validation formal analysis

catchments with t c t s according to eq 6 for a given non zero q p value the v and t values that would result in a q p being greater than q p may come from either of the six subdomains of v and t values i e those subdomains of the q p function as defined in eq 6 other than the first one with v s di each of the six subdomains would therefore result in a sub region of integration for determining p q p q p those sub regions of integrations are determined as follows the first sub region of integration referred to as r i 1 is determined as the sub region of v and t given that s di v s il f c t and t t c whereas the resulting q p must be greater than q p based on eq 6 r i 1 is therefore defined by h v s di t c q p s di v s il f c t t t c yields q p t c h s di v s il f c t t t c let l 1 l 2 and l c be the lines defined by v f c t s il v q p t c h s di and t t c respectively all lines in this paper are plotted with v on the vertical axis and t on the horizontal axis then r i 1 is the area above l 2 but below l 1 and on the left side of the vertical line l c in a way similar to r i 1 the second sub region of integration referred to as r i 2 is determined as the sub region of v and t given that v s il f c t and t t c whereas the resulting q p must be greater than q p again based on eq 6 r i 2 is defined by v s d f c 1 h t t c q p v s il f c t t t c yields v q p t c s d 1 h f c t v s il f c t t t c let l 3 be the line defined by v f c 1 h t t c q p s d r i 2 is the area above l 1 and l 3 and also on the left side of l c similar to r i 1 and r i 2 the third sub region of integration r i 3 is defined by h v s di t q p s di v s il f c t t c t t s yields q p t h s di v s il f c t t c t t s let l 4 be the line defined by v q p h t s di r i 3 is the area above l 4 but below l 1 and also on the right side of l c and the left side of l s the fourth sub region of integration r i 4 is defined by v s d f c 1 h t t q p v s il f c t t c t t s yields v q p 1 h f c t s d v s il f c t t c t t s let l 5 be the line defined by v f c 1 h q p t s d r i 4 is the area above both l 1 and l 5 and also on the right side of l c and the left side of l s the fifth sub region of integration r i 5 is defined by h v s di t q p s di v s il s m t t s yields q p t h s di v s il s m t t s let l 6 be the line defined by v s il s m r i 5 is the area above l 4 but below l 6 and on the right side of l s the sixth sub region of integration r i 6 is defined by v s d 1 h s m t q p v s il s m t t s yields v q p t 1 h s m s d v s il s m t t s let l 7 be the line defined by v q p t 1 h s m s d r i 6 is the area above both l 6 and l 7 and also on the right side of l s the relative locations of the sub regions depend on the relative positions of the lines that define them according to the above definitions sub regions r i 1 and r i 2 are on the left side of the vertical line l c and delineated by the group of lines l 1 l 2 and l 3 referred to as the g1 group sub regions r i 3 and r i 4 are situated between the two vertical lines l c and l s and bounded by the group referred to as the g2 group of lines l 1 l 4 and l 5 sub regions r i 5 and r i 6 are located on the right side of l s and bounded by the group referred to as the g3 group of lines l 4 l 6 and l 7 then it makes sense in order to determine the relative locations of the sub regions to investigate the relative positions of the lines of each group separately the relative positions of lines depend on the relative magnitudes of their intercepts and slopes let i 1 i 2 and i 3 be the intercepts of lines l 1 l 2 and l 3 at the v axis respectively i 1 c i 2 c and i 3 c be the intercepts of lines l 1 l 2 and l 3 at l c respectively i 4 c and i 5 c be the intercepts of lines l 4 and l 5 at l c respectively i 1 s i 4 s and i 5 s be the intercepts of lines l 1 l 4 and l 5 at l s respectively and i 4 s i 6 s and i 7 s be the intercepts of lines l 4 l 6 and l 7 at l s respectively let s 1 s 2 s 3 s 4 s 5 s 6 and s 7 be the slopes of lines l 1 through l 7 respectively the required intercepts and slopes for the delineation of the different sub regions are summarized in table a1 in order to determine the relative magnitudes of these intercepts and slopes subtractions from each other are applied to the expressions of each couple of slopes and each couple of intercepts in each group of lines i e g1 g2 and g3 the signs of these subtractions based on the values of q p determine the relative magnitudes of the slopes or intercepts the relative magnitudes of slopes of the lines in g1 are s 1 s 3 s 2 for all q p in g2 are s 1 s 4 s 5 if q p hf c and s 5 s 4 s 1 if q p hf c and in g3 s 6 s 7 s 4 for all q p for the three groups of lines the relative magnitudes of intercepts depend on the catchment characteristics and q p values as summarized in table a2 the intercepts relative magnitude differ depending on whether s dd t c is less or greater than s dd t s f c as a result type i catchments need to be divided into two sub types catchment type ia where s dd t c s dd t s f c and catchment type ib where s dd t c s dd t s f c for each sub type of catchments there are four possible intervals of q p values where the relative magnitudes of intercepts of the three groups of lines may differ table a2 for catchments of type ia the four intervals are 0 q p hs dd t c hs dd t c q p h s dd t s h f c h s dd t s h f c q p h s dd t c h f c and q p h s dd t c h f c respectively however for the catchments of type ib the four intervals are 0 q p h s dd t s h f c h s dd t s h f c q p h s dd t c h s dd t c q p h s dd t c h f c and q p h s dd t c h f c respectively thus for each catchment types there are four possible configurations of the region of integration the four possible intervals of q p for type ia catchments are referred to as inta1 inta2 inta3 and inta4 and those for type ib catchments are referred to as intb1 intb2 intb3 and intb4 as illustrated in table a2 the relative magnitudes of intercepts of the different groups of lines i e g1 g2 and g3 when q p values are in intervals inta1 inta3 and inta4 for type ia catchments are the same as for type ib catchments when q p values are in intervals intb1 intb3 and intb4 respectively the relative magnitudes of intercepts in interval intb2 are different from those in inta2 table a 2 thus in total there are five different configurations of the region of integration for types ia and ib catchments a 2 derivation of the peak discharge exceedance probability for type i catchments plotting the region of integration which is the union of sub regions r i 1 through r i 6 facilitates the analytical derivation of the peak discharge exceedance probability p q p q p as mentioned earlier the configuration of the region of integration depends on the catchment type and the interval that the q p value of interest is located in in the following each configuration of the region of integration among the five possible configurations as discussed earlier is described together with the derivation of the corresponding exceedance probability the first region of integration configuration fig a 1 is applicable for catchments of types ia and ib with q p taking on values from intervals inta1 and intb1 respectively as they have the same relative magnitudes of intercepts and slopes table a 2 in addition to the determination of the relative magnitudes of the intercepts and slopes of lines in each group it is essential to figure out whether the lines of each group intersect given the conditions defining the two sub types of catchments and the range of values of q p for this configuration i e inta1 and intb1 the lines in g1 do not intersect neither would lines in g2 however the lines in g3 i e l 4 l 6 and l 7 intersect at a common point

8 as shown in table a 3 there are four possible intervals of q p referred to as int1 int2 int3 and int4 values where the relative magnitudes of the intercepts of the g1 g4 and g3 three groups of lines

5673,it has been widely known that vegetation restoration plays a vital importance in controlling surface runoff and soil erosion the most of soil erosion were caused by erosive rainstorm events yet the response of surface runoff and soil erosion to erosive rainstorm events and vegetation types has not been fully understood in this study we monitored the vegetation rainfall runoff and soil erosion on ten runoff plots under field conditions from 2015 to 2019 and examined the impact of erosive rainstorm events on runoff and soil erosion among different vegetation types artemisia scoparia stipa bungeana lespedeza davurica asc sb ld stipa bungeana artemisia gmelinii sb agm bothriochloa ischaemum bi artemisia gmelinii stipa bungeana agm sb artemisia gmelinii stipa grandis agm sg sophora viciifolia sv artemisia gmelinii artemisia giraldii agm agi and bare land on abandoned land slopes the results showed that vegetation restoration could decrease 68 0 to 97 4 of runoff and 98 0 to 99 9 of soil erosion compared to the bare land and there were no significant difference of surface runoff and soil loss among different vegetation types under the 11 erosive rainstorm events the average soil loss of erosive rainstorm events among vegetation types could be 2 1 to 15 6 times as those of ordinary erosive rainfall events the erosive rainstorm events caused a significant variance of surface runoff and soil erosion because of variant antecedent soil moisture and rainfall intensity in practice the natural vegetation restoration should be recommended in semi arid environment and the erosive rainstorm events should be paid enough attention in causing intense soil erosion in the rainy reasons keywords soil erosion surface runoff vegetation restoration erosive rainstorm event abandoned slope 1 introduction soil erosion is regarded as a serious eco environmental problem which led to land degradation and natural ecosystem destruction dlamini et al 2011 lal 2001 it can mainly influenced by a combination of climatic changes and anthropogenic activities fu et al 2017 raclot et al 2018 vegetation restoration has been widely considered to conserve soil and water across the world buttle and farnsworth 2012 fattet et al 2011 garc√≠a ruiz 2010 molina et al 2012 puigdef√°bregas 2005 zhang et al 2015 vegetation type vegetation coverage and plant trait could impact the hydrological and erosive processes of restoration land substantially there are discrepancies among vegetation types of their effects in controlling the surface runoff and soil erosion some assessments across a wide range of vegetation types concluded that the forestland and shrubland yielded the lower soil erosion while the farmland and orchard showed the higher soil erosion cerdan et al 2010 garc√≠a ruiz et al 2015 guo et al 2015 xiong et al 2019 in semi arid environment grassland and woodland could also be considered to reduce more gully erosion compared to orchards wang et al 2016 however other researches showed that the shrubland could also reduce more runoff and soil erosion than forestland or grassland garc√≠a ruiz 2010 zhou et al 2016 zhou et al 2019 some scholars demonstrated that a mixed structure of forests and shrubs would be more beneficial for combating water and soil loss mohammad and adam 2010 burylo et al 2011 buttle and farnsworth 2012 the vegetation coverage was negatively correlated with sediment generation among vaious vegetation types wang et al 2016 zhou et al 2016 because that the canopy can dramatically intercept raindrops and absorb their kinetic energies bochet et al 2006 gei√üler et al 2012 ghimire et al 2012 liu 1998 wang et al 2012 besides the ground cover including the biological crust and litter layer can also exert considerable effects on decreasing the suface runoff and soil loss chen et al 2018 hosseini et al 2016 wang et al 2016 the biological soil crusts protected the soil against erosion by increasing the threshold friction velocity bowker et al 2008 and causing higher soil surface roughness rodr√≠guez caballero et al 2012 which would reduce the shear effect and the transport capacity of water flow helming et al 1998 gaur and mathur 2003 ultimately control the surface runoff and soil loss the litter layer could decrease the erosive force of raindrop and overland flow wang et al 2019 besides the plant litter could be incorporated into topsoil layer brown et al 1990 pannkuk and robichaud 2003 and the incorporated plant litter could effectively decrease the soil detachment capacity rill erodibility and critical shear stress sun et al 2016 most of soil erosion was induced by a small number of intense rainstorms with short duration and high rainfall intenstiy fu 1989 zheng et al 2008 jiao et al 1999 even one of these individual intense rainfall events could cause serious flood and severe soil erosion bookhagen 2010 bryndal et al 2017 martƒ± nez casasnovas et al 2002 wang et al 2016 wei et al 2009 there were abundant existing studies regarding the impact of rainfall characteristics or single rainfall event on the runoff and soil erosion of restoration vegetation cerda et al 2017 chen et al 2018 dos santos et al 2017 peng and wang 2012 wang et al 2016 wei et al 2007 wei et al 2009 xu et al 2013 whereas few efforts have been made to examine the response of water and soil loss among various vegetation communities to erosive rainstorm events additionally the long term monitoring of water and soil loss by field plots were scarce in previous researches cerdan et al 2010 the loess plateau of china is well known as the region suffering from severe soil erosion in the world douglas 1989 fu 1989 shi and shao 2000 tang et al 1993 nowadays the grain for green project has been conducted in the loess plateau for 20 years and massive sloping farmland has been converted into forest shrub and grassland jia et al 2008 tang 2004 wang et al 2016 the afforestation and vegetation restoration have improved the vegetation cover tremendously which consequently decreased the surface runoff and soil erosion remarkably sun et al 2006 zheng 2006 zhou et al 2016 in the loess plateau the rainstorm events caused most of runoff and soil erosion fu 1989 jiao et al 1999 zheng et al 2008 hence the runoff and soil erosion on present underlying conditions under rainstorm events should be examined to fully understand the impact mechanism of vegetation restoration on reducing the runoff and soil erosion the current study analyzed the data of vegetation runoff and soil loss under ten field runoff plots conducted on abandoned slope farmland in the loess plateau and quantified the surface runoff and soil erosion of vegetation communites with different abandoned ages 5 43 years and restoration types under erosive rainstorm events the specific objectives of the study were to 1 investigate the characteristics of erosive rainstorm events and vegetation on abandoned slope 2 compare the surface runoff and soil erosion among different vegetation types 3 examine the response of surface runoff and soil erosion to erosive rainstorm events among different vegetation types the results would provide reference for the selection of vegetation types and the evaluation of soil and water conservation benefits of ecological restoration in semi arid areas 2 material and methods 2 1 site description the study was conducted in fangta 36 48 e 109 15 e 10 5 km2 a small watershed located in the ansai county north shaanxi province china fig 1 the small watershed belongs to the hilly gullied region of the loess plateau the altitude ranges from 1040 to 1395 m the climate of this region is a temperate semi arid and the average annual precipitation is 505 mm which primarily occurs from july to september the soil type is mainly loessal soil with silt loam texture usda soil taxonomy the soil is prone to water erosion because of the loose soil particles and poor corrosion resistance ren et al 2016 shi and shao 2000 in fangta watershed most of sloping farmlands has been transformed into artificial vegetation and natural vegetation because of the grain for green project which has been carried out for 20 years nowadays the natural vegetation species in fangta watershed are mainly artemisia gmelinii stipa bungeana stipa grandis bothriochloa ischaemum periploca sepium sophora viciifolia etc the artifical vegetation species are robinia pseudoacacia hippophae rhamnoides and caragana intermedia etc tang et al 2019 2 2 data collection ten runoff plots were conducted in the fangta watershed in 2015 fig 1b the shape of runoff plot was approximately a rectangle with 2 5 m in width and 10 m in length combined with a triangle 0 625 m2 at the bottom for closing up the runoff plot hence the area of each runoff plot is 25 625 m2 the runoff plots were delimited by impervious pvc sheets 2 mm thickness inserted perpendicularly into the soils at the outlet of each runoff plot a pvc pipe and volumetric barrel were installed to collect the surface runoff and soil loss under each erosive event fig 1d e to compare the response of water and soil loss to different vegetation types we monitored nine main vegetation types and a bare land as the control table 1 the artemisia scoparia stipa bungeana lespedeza davurica asc sb ld stipa bungeana artemisia gmelinii sb agm bothriochloa ischaemum bi artemisia gmelinii stipa bungeana agm sb artemisia gmelinii stipa grandis agm sg sophora viciifolia sv and artemisia gmelinii artemisia giraldii agm agi were selected as the locally natural vegetation restoration types with abandoned years ranging from 5 to 44 years the caragana korshinskii ck and robinia pseudoacacia rp represented the artifical planted vegetation types with abandoned years of 20 to 34 respectively the bare land plot was weeded periodically to keep it as a bare land runoff and soil loss of each runoff plot were collected from 2015 to 2019 if there was runoff generated after a rainfall event firstly the volume of runoff in volumetric barrel was measured then we stirred and mixed the sediment and water homogeneously in the volumetric barrel and runoff samples were collected into bottles with a volume of 1850 ml if the volume of sample was less than 1850 ml we collected all the sample all volumetric barrels were emptied and cleaned out after the measurement and sampling for the next erosive event whereafter the runoff sample of each runoff plot was settled for 8 h and the sediment was separated subsequently the sediment was dried in oven over 24 h at 105 and weighed to obtain the sediment concentration lastly the soil loss amount of each plot was determined by the sediment concentration multiplies the total runoff volume in volumetric barrel rainfall process data were obtained by two self recording rain gauges machine type tpj 32 near the runoff plots with the measurement accuracy of 0 2 mm the rainfall amount duration average intensity and maximum intensities of 15 minute 30 minute and 45 minute were extracted from the rainfall process data if the rainfall interval exceeded 6 h the successive rainfall events were regarded as two rainfall events renard et al 1997 wischmeier and smith 1958 the vegetation litter and soil biotic crust coverage of each vegetation plot were also measured after every erosive event in august from 2015 to 2019 the vegetation coverage of rp refers to the total coverage of trees shrubs and herb species that of ck and sv types refer to the coverage of shrubs and herb species that of other communties refer to the the coverage of herb species the abundance height coverage of each species in each plot were recorded in three quadrats 1 m 1 m in august from 2015 to 2019 2 3 statistical analyses in current study we analyzed the runoff and soil erosion data based on event scale in five consecutive years 2015 2019 the surface runoff depth h and soil erosion modulus sm were respectively presented as follows 1 h r ap 10 3 where h r and ap means surface runoff depth mm the runoff volume m3 generated by a erosive event and area of runoff plot m2 respectively 2 sm sl ap where sm sl ap refers to soil erosion modulus t km 2 soil loss amount t generated by a erosive event and area of runoff plot km2 respectively species importance value iv was used as the index for expressing the importance of species qu et al 1983 iv was calculated as follows 3 iv rc r f r d 3 where iv is the species importance value for each species rc means the percentage of coverage for each species to the sampling quadrat rf refers to the percentage of frequencies of each species appearing in sampling quadrats to the total numbers of sample quadrats rd refers to the percentage of density for each species to the total density of all species in the sampling quadrat ultimately we averaged the iv values of each species in three quadrats to get the iv values of each species in every runoff plot the erosive rainstorm selection was based on erosive rainstorm criterion of rainfall amount within different rainfall duration on the loess plateau presented by wang and jiao 2018 namely if the rainfall amount of certain rainfall duration in a rainfall event was higher than the values in table 2 the rainfall event was recognized as erosive rainstorm event one way analysis of variance anova and tukey method test were used to evaluate the differences in runoff and soil erosion significant differences were set as 95 level 3 results 3 1 vegetation characteristics the main species with maximum importance value of nine vegetation types varied from year to year table 3 the main species of asc sb ld transformed from artemisia scoparia to stipa bungeana in 2016 and lespedeza davurica in 2018 regarding the sb agm the main species became artemisia gmelinii since 2017 while it was stipa bungeana in 2015 and 2016 with respect to other vegetation types the main species did not show dramatically change in the study period notablely artemisia gmelinii was the most common main species among these vegetation types in general the vegetation coverage rises with the abandoned age increases ck type showed the highest vegetation coverage 67 8 followed by agm agi type 65 5 and agm sg type 61 0 table 1 while asc sb ld community with the least abandoned age 5 9 years showed the smallest vegetation coverage 20 5 in terms of the biotic crust coverage the asc sb ld community showed the highest value 64 7 followed by agm sb community 56 5 besides the biotic crust coverage of rp community 1 0 was least among vegetation types with regard to litter coverage the rp community had the highest litter coverage 92 8 followed by ck community 58 9 meanwhile the litter coverage of asc sb ld community 9 4 was the smallest among all vegetation types table 1 3 2 rainfall and erosive rainstorm characteristics there is high variability in the rainfall amount in rainy seasons from may to october per year among different years the highest rainfall amount of rainy seasons was 466 2 mm in 2016 while the smallest rainfall amount was 181 8 mm in 2015 table 4 the total number of rainfall events in rainy seasons of study period from 2015 to 2019 was 145 in which there were 51 erosive events in a rainy season there were only 25 6 to 66 7 of the total rainfall events leading to soil loss eleven erosive rainstorm events were selected from rainfall events during 2015 to 2019 based on the erosive rainstorm criterion on the loess plateau table 2 erosive rainstorm events occurred five one four and two times in 2016 2017 2018 and 2019 respectively table 5 while there were no erosive rainstorm events in 2015 the rainfall amounts of erosive rainstorm events varied from 14 7 to 72 1 mm and the average value was 46 1 mm the duration of the 11 events ranged from 1 5 to 20 0 h with an average value of 10 3 h additionally the maximum intensities of 15 minute 30 minute and 45 minute was in the range of 14 0 to 90 4 mm h 1 12 0 to 62 2 mm h 1 and 10 7 to 37 3 mm h 1 respectively the erosive rainstorm event with maximum rainfall amount took place in 2019 07 24 raining for 15 h and 45 min and the amount occupied 16 8 of the total rainfall amount of rainy season in 2019 while the erosive rainstorm events with highest maximum intensities of 15 minute 30 minute and 45 minute occurred in 2018 06 30 the results indicated that not only heavy rainfall events with high rainfall amount and intensities but also some events with smaller amounts and shorter durations can be considered as erosive rainstorm events 3 3 runoff and soil erosion under erosive rainstorms the runoff depth and soil erosion modulus of bare land under erosive rainstorm events were much higher than those of vegetation types p 0 05 these vegetation types could reduce 68 0 to 97 4 of runoff depth and 98 0 to 99 9 of soil loss compared to bare land under erosive rainstorm events fig 2 among vegetation types sb agm and bi led to more runoff with mean depth of 2 19 and 1 83 mm under the 11 erosive rainstorm events fig 2 however the rp and ck exhibited little runoff depths which were not higher than 1 mm under all erosive rainstorm events regarding the soil loss among vegetation types sb agm caused most soil erosion with mean soil erosion modulus of 9 4 t km 2 under erosive rainstorm events while the ck and rp produced smaller soil erosion with average soil erosion modulus of 0 27 and 0 46 t km 2 respectively nevertheless there are no significant difference of runoff and soil loss among different vegetation types under erosive rainstorm events there are significant variation of surface runoff and soil erosion under vegetation types among different rainstorm events fig 3 the highest surface runoff of vegetation types mostly occurred in 2016 08 16 3 7 mm of as sb ld 8 1 mm of bi 4 1 mm of agm sb 5 2 mm of sv 2 3 mm of agm agi and 0 8 mm of ck and 2018 06 30 4 0 mm of agm sg and 0 6 mm of rp these two rainstorm events were both characterized by higher rainfall amount and maximum 30 minute intensity additionally there were significant differences in soil erosion of vegetation types among different rainstorm events fig 3 the highest soil erosion events mostly happened in 2016 06 22 83 1 t km 2 of sb agm 31 0 t km 2 of bi 8 3 t km 2 of agm sg and 10 9 t km 2 of agm agi and 2016 08 16 7 1 t km 2 of asc sb ld 23 4 t km 2 of sv and 2 0 t km 2 of rp the results showed that the soil erosion under rainstorm events enlarged as the maximum 30 minute intensity increased however the 2016 07 19 2019 07 24 and 2019 08 07 rainstorm events with higher rainfall amount and lower maximum 30 minute intensity led to lower soil erosion this indicated that the maximum 30 minute intensity instead of rainfall amount is the controlling factor of soil erosion 4 discussion 4 1 the effects of vegetation types on runoff and soil erosion it has been demonstrated worldwide that vegetation restoration can effectively reduce surface runoff and soil loss under erosive rainstorm events cerdan et al 2002 kang et al 2001 wang et al 2016 wei et al 2009 previous studies also proved that the vegetation types in later succession stages had relatively high community functional diversity which would generate smaller soil erosion zhu et al 2015 the soil physical properties gradually improved with more soil organic matter water stable aggregates and enhanced soil infiltration capacity as the abandoned ages increased which ultimately decreased runoff and erosion zhang et al 2015 chen et al 2017a chen et al 2017b besides the vegetation coverage constantly increased as abandoned ages advanced in current study table 4 and the vegetation coverage correlated negatively with surface runoff and soil erosion significantly zhou et al 2016 in this study the vegetation coverage and litter coverage of vegetation types with abandoned ages longer than 20 years plot 5 10 were higher than those of vegetation types with abandoned ages shorter than 20 years plot 2 4 the average vegetation coverage and litter coverage in study period were 37 7 and 17 4 of plot 2 4 and 59 2 and 41 8 of plot 5 10 respectively table 1 as a consequence the average runoff and soil loss of plot 2 4 were 1 9 and 3 2 times higher than those of plot 5 10 under 11 rainstorm events fig 2 notably the ck and rp community generated much smaller surface runoff and soil erosion than those of other vegetation types under erosive rainstorm events fig 2 the robinia pseudoacacia was the only arbor species in all vegetation types of current study and the canopy of arbor was considered to protect soil from erosion effectively by intercepting rainfall bochet et al 2006 liu 1998 zhao et al 2001 furthermore average coverage of litter layers for the robinia pseudoacacia was 92 8 from 2015 to 2019 which was higher than other vegetation types table 1 the litter layer under the vegetation types led to higher surface roughness and enhanced infiltration capacity boer and puigdef√°bregas 2005 woods and balfour 2010 moreover the soil non capillary porosity and soil particle fractal dimension of robinia pseudoacacia community have been directly improved consequently enhancing the soil infiltration capacity tang et al 2019 the high soil infiltration capacity decreased the flow velocity and runoff depth effectively bod√≠ et al 2012 cerd√† and doerr 2008 and accordingly led to little runoff and soil loss fig 2 besides the ck type had the average vegetation coverage of 67 8 which was the highest among all vegetation types moreover the litter coverage of ck type was 58 9 which was just lower than that of the rp among all types table 1 vegetation cover and litter layers which were close to ground can also protect surface soil against raindrop splash and control surface runoff and soil erosion effectively chen et al 2018 liu et al 2017 wang et al 2001 in current study the average runoff of ck and rp types under 11 erosive rainstorm events were 0 20 and 0 17 mm and the soil erosion of the two vegetation types were 0 26 and 0 45 t km 2 the surface runoff and soil erosion of ck and rp types were smaller compared with other vegetation types with a reduction of 86 7 and 87 6 in average runoff depth 92 7 and 87 5 in average soil erosion respectively 4 2 response of runoff and soil erosion to erosive rainstorm events the erosive rainstorm events could generate several times surface runoff and soil erosion higher than ordinary erosive events which should be paid attention to prevent tables 6 and 7 the max runoff event of bare land had the runoff depth of 12 4 mm which was 15 5 times higher than average runoff depth in ordinary events in addition the highest runoff depth among vegetation types was 8 1 mm of bi which was 77 1 times as average runoff depth of ordinary events in the vegetation type the runoff ratio of max event to average ordinary events under vegetation types were higher than the ratio of bare land because of the slight runoff depth under ordinary events of vegetation types the max soil loss event of bare land had the soil erosion modulus of 2883 t km 2 which equaled 101 2 times of average soil erosion modulus in ordinary events besides the highest soil erosion modulus among vegetation types was 83 1 t km 2 of sb agm which was 141 3 times as average soil erosion modulus of ordinary events in the type the results highlighted the devastating impact of erosive rainstorm events on surface runoff and soil erosion which generally agreed with those of previously published studies bull et al 2000 jiao et al 2017 li et al 2019 mueller and pfister 2011 wang et al 2016 the phenomenon may be on account of the synthetic function of high soil moisture and intense rainfall intensity in the loess plateau rainfall events mostly occurred between june to september on the loess plateau fu 1989 and the frequent rainfall events caused the high soil moisture content and maintained the soil saturation fang et al 2017 li et al 2019 ponce and hawkins 1996 the subsequent erosive rainstorm events with high rainfall intensity fig 3 therefore could generate runoff easily and consequently bring on more soil loss because of high pre soil moisture and rainfall intensity li et al 2019 additionally the rainfall amount and intensity exhibited high temporal variability in the rainy season table 5 thus the surface runoff and soil erosion under different rainstorm events were different significantly with each other fig 3 which is to blame for the changeable pre soil moisture and rainfall intensity for instance although the erosive rainstorm events happened in 2016 06 22 was only 27 8 mm it led to max soil loss in bare land and vegetation types of sb agm bi and agm agi that might be partly due to the erosive rainstorm event occurred in 2016 06 10 with rainfall amount of 46 6 mm and rainfall event happened in 2016 06 11 with rainfall amount of 12 7 mm which jointly contributed to the high antecedent soil moisture content in the 2016 06 22 erosive rainstorm event the soil erosion modulus of bare land sb agm and bi types were 101 2 141 3 and 75 9 times as soil erosion modulus of ordinary erosive events in these types respectively on the contrary the erosive rainstorm of 2019 07 24 was characterized by highest rainfall amount 72 1 mm and lower runoff and soil erosion that may be on account of the lower maximum 30 minute intensity and little antecedent rainfall of this erosive rainstorm event 4 3 implications planted shrubs and trees can significantly reduce water and soil loss cerda et al 2017 chen et al 2018 zhou et al 2016 in current study the artifical planted shrub ck and forest rp types had lower average runoff 0 20 and 0 17 mm and soil erosion 0 26 and 0 45 t km 2 compared to bare land with a reduction of 97 24 97 42 in surface runoff and 99 94 99 90 in soil erosion modulus under 11 erosive rainstorm events respectively however large scale artificial afforestation probably consumed soil water content rapidly and led to the deficits of soil moisture fu et al 2017 jia et al 2008 liu et al 2018 zhao et al 2019 the planted shrubs and trees may form dried soil layer which could consequently inhibit the growth and natural succession of vegetation chen et al 2018 fu et al 2017 wang et al 2011 shao et al 2016 ultimately hampering the sustainable development of vegetation restoration and decreasing the soil and water conservation benefits chen et al 2018 wang et al 2011 the unsustainability of many ecological restoration projects all over the world such as the great plains shelterbelt initiated by roosevelt in 1934 the great plan for the transformation of nature launched by stalin in 1940s the algerian green dam began in 1970s and the three north shelter forest program in china started since 1970s li and zhai 2002 have also proved the rule additionally naturally restored herbaceous vegetation can also effectively control the runoff and soil erosion on abandoned farmland slopes chen et al 2018 fattet et al 2011 wei et al 2007 and there were no significant differences of surface runoff and soil erosion between planted types and natural vegetation types fig 2 moreover the natural vegetation succession hardly not require economic and human input and consumed less soil moisture compared to those of exotic trees and shrubs chen et al 2018 fu et al 2017 yang et al 2017 hence the natural vegetation succession could be chosen primarily as a suitable strategy of ecological restoration projects on the semiarid hilly areas in practice the trees and shrubs could be planted in areas with abundant soil moisture such as shady slopes or lower part of slopes to fully prevent the runoff and erosion in the loess plateau the grain for green project adopted the natural restoration and artificial afforestation simultaneously and effectively reduced the runoff and sediment fu et al 2011 fu et al 2017 nevertheless more attention must be paid to the sustainable development of the grain for green project in the future 5 conclusion the vegetation coverage of different vegetation types would rise with the abandoned age increased and there was high variability in the rainfall characteristics of erosive rainstorm events the vegetation restoration on abandoned slopes could effectively decrease the surface runoff and soil erosion under the 11 erosive rainstorm events during 2015 to 2019 the vegetation types could reduce 68 0 to 97 4 of surface runoff depth and 98 0 to 99 9 of soil loss compared to bare land under erosive rainstorm events however the differences of surface runoff and soil erosion under erosive rainstorm events among vegetation types were not significant the erosive rainstorm events resulted in much more runoff and soil loss than those of ordinary events and there were significant variances of surface runoff and soil erosion among different erosive rainstorm events the relatively high soil erosion could happen in certain erosive rainstorm events because of the high rainfall intensity and antecedent soil moisture content in summary the erosive rainstorm events should be paid enough attention in probably triggering high runoff and soil erosion in the rainy reasons credit authorship contribution statement liang yue

5673,it has been widely known that vegetation restoration plays a vital importance in controlling surface runoff and soil erosion the most of soil erosion were caused by erosive rainstorm events yet the response of surface runoff and soil erosion to erosive rainstorm events and vegetation types has not been fully understood in this study we monitored the vegetation rainfall runoff and soil erosion on ten runoff plots under field conditions from 2015 to 2019 and examined the impact of erosive rainstorm events on runoff and soil erosion among different vegetation types artemisia scoparia stipa bungeana lespedeza davurica asc sb ld stipa bungeana artemisia gmelinii sb agm bothriochloa ischaemum bi artemisia gmelinii stipa bungeana agm sb artemisia gmelinii stipa grandis agm sg sophora viciifolia sv artemisia gmelinii artemisia giraldii agm agi and bare land on abandoned land slopes the results showed that vegetation restoration could decrease 68 0 to 97 4 of runoff and 98 0 to 99 9 of soil erosion compared to the bare land and there were no significant difference of surface runoff and soil loss among different vegetation types under the 11 erosive rainstorm events the average soil loss of erosive rainstorm events among vegetation types could be 2 1 to 15 6 times as those of ordinary erosive rainfall events the erosive rainstorm events caused a significant variance of surface runoff and soil erosion because of variant antecedent soil moisture and rainfall intensity in practice the natural vegetation restoration should be recommended in semi arid environment and the erosive rainstorm events should be paid enough attention in causing intense soil erosion in the rainy reasons keywords soil erosion surface runoff vegetation restoration erosive rainstorm event abandoned slope 1 introduction soil erosion is regarded as a serious eco environmental problem which led to land degradation and natural ecosystem destruction dlamini et al 2011 lal 2001 it can mainly influenced by a combination of climatic changes and anthropogenic activities fu et al 2017 raclot et al 2018 vegetation restoration has been widely considered to conserve soil and water across the world buttle and farnsworth 2012 fattet et al 2011 garc√≠a ruiz 2010 molina et al 2012 puigdef√°bregas 2005 zhang et al 2015 vegetation type vegetation coverage and plant trait could impact the hydrological and erosive processes of restoration land substantially there are discrepancies among vegetation types of their effects in controlling the surface runoff and soil erosion some assessments across a wide range of vegetation types concluded that the forestland and shrubland yielded the lower soil erosion while the farmland and orchard showed the higher soil erosion cerdan et al 2010 garc√≠a ruiz et al 2015 guo et al 2015 xiong et al 2019 in semi arid environment grassland and woodland could also be considered to reduce more gully erosion compared to orchards wang et al 2016 however other researches showed that the shrubland could also reduce more runoff and soil erosion than forestland or grassland garc√≠a ruiz 2010 zhou et al 2016 zhou et al 2019 some scholars demonstrated that a mixed structure of forests and shrubs would be more beneficial for combating water and soil loss mohammad and adam 2010 burylo et al 2011 buttle and farnsworth 2012 the vegetation coverage was negatively correlated with sediment generation among vaious vegetation types wang et al 2016 zhou et al 2016 because that the canopy can dramatically intercept raindrops and absorb their kinetic energies bochet et al 2006 gei√üler et al 2012 ghimire et al 2012 liu 1998 wang et al 2012 besides the ground cover including the biological crust and litter layer can also exert considerable effects on decreasing the suface runoff and soil loss chen et al 2018 hosseini et al 2016 wang et al 2016 the biological soil crusts protected the soil against erosion by increasing the threshold friction velocity bowker et al 2008 and causing higher soil surface roughness rodr√≠guez caballero et al 2012 which would reduce the shear effect and the transport capacity of water flow helming et al 1998 gaur and mathur 2003 ultimately control the surface runoff and soil loss the litter layer could decrease the erosive force of raindrop and overland flow wang et al 2019 besides the plant litter could be incorporated into topsoil layer brown et al 1990 pannkuk and robichaud 2003 and the incorporated plant litter could effectively decrease the soil detachment capacity rill erodibility and critical shear stress sun et al 2016 most of soil erosion was induced by a small number of intense rainstorms with short duration and high rainfall intenstiy fu 1989 zheng et al 2008 jiao et al 1999 even one of these individual intense rainfall events could cause serious flood and severe soil erosion bookhagen 2010 bryndal et al 2017 martƒ± nez casasnovas et al 2002 wang et al 2016 wei et al 2009 there were abundant existing studies regarding the impact of rainfall characteristics or single rainfall event on the runoff and soil erosion of restoration vegetation cerda et al 2017 chen et al 2018 dos santos et al 2017 peng and wang 2012 wang et al 2016 wei et al 2007 wei et al 2009 xu et al 2013 whereas few efforts have been made to examine the response of water and soil loss among various vegetation communities to erosive rainstorm events additionally the long term monitoring of water and soil loss by field plots were scarce in previous researches cerdan et al 2010 the loess plateau of china is well known as the region suffering from severe soil erosion in the world douglas 1989 fu 1989 shi and shao 2000 tang et al 1993 nowadays the grain for green project has been conducted in the loess plateau for 20 years and massive sloping farmland has been converted into forest shrub and grassland jia et al 2008 tang 2004 wang et al 2016 the afforestation and vegetation restoration have improved the vegetation cover tremendously which consequently decreased the surface runoff and soil erosion remarkably sun et al 2006 zheng 2006 zhou et al 2016 in the loess plateau the rainstorm events caused most of runoff and soil erosion fu 1989 jiao et al 1999 zheng et al 2008 hence the runoff and soil erosion on present underlying conditions under rainstorm events should be examined to fully understand the impact mechanism of vegetation restoration on reducing the runoff and soil erosion the current study analyzed the data of vegetation runoff and soil loss under ten field runoff plots conducted on abandoned slope farmland in the loess plateau and quantified the surface runoff and soil erosion of vegetation communites with different abandoned ages 5 43 years and restoration types under erosive rainstorm events the specific objectives of the study were to 1 investigate the characteristics of erosive rainstorm events and vegetation on abandoned slope 2 compare the surface runoff and soil erosion among different vegetation types 3 examine the response of surface runoff and soil erosion to erosive rainstorm events among different vegetation types the results would provide reference for the selection of vegetation types and the evaluation of soil and water conservation benefits of ecological restoration in semi arid areas 2 material and methods 2 1 site description the study was conducted in fangta 36 48 e 109 15 e 10 5 km2 a small watershed located in the ansai county north shaanxi province china fig 1 the small watershed belongs to the hilly gullied region of the loess plateau the altitude ranges from 1040 to 1395 m the climate of this region is a temperate semi arid and the average annual precipitation is 505 mm which primarily occurs from july to september the soil type is mainly loessal soil with silt loam texture usda soil taxonomy the soil is prone to water erosion because of the loose soil particles and poor corrosion resistance ren et al 2016 shi and shao 2000 in fangta watershed most of sloping farmlands has been transformed into artificial vegetation and natural vegetation because of the grain for green project which has been carried out for 20 years nowadays the natural vegetation species in fangta watershed are mainly artemisia gmelinii stipa bungeana stipa grandis bothriochloa ischaemum periploca sepium sophora viciifolia etc the artifical vegetation species are robinia pseudoacacia hippophae rhamnoides and caragana intermedia etc tang et al 2019 2 2 data collection ten runoff plots were conducted in the fangta watershed in 2015 fig 1b the shape of runoff plot was approximately a rectangle with 2 5 m in width and 10 m in length combined with a triangle 0 625 m2 at the bottom for closing up the runoff plot hence the area of each runoff plot is 25 625 m2 the runoff plots were delimited by impervious pvc sheets 2 mm thickness inserted perpendicularly into the soils at the outlet of each runoff plot a pvc pipe and volumetric barrel were installed to collect the surface runoff and soil loss under each erosive event fig 1d e to compare the response of water and soil loss to different vegetation types we monitored nine main vegetation types and a bare land as the control table 1 the artemisia scoparia stipa bungeana lespedeza davurica asc sb ld stipa bungeana artemisia gmelinii sb agm bothriochloa ischaemum bi artemisia gmelinii stipa bungeana agm sb artemisia gmelinii stipa grandis agm sg sophora viciifolia sv and artemisia gmelinii artemisia giraldii agm agi were selected as the locally natural vegetation restoration types with abandoned years ranging from 5 to 44 years the caragana korshinskii ck and robinia pseudoacacia rp represented the artifical planted vegetation types with abandoned years of 20 to 34 respectively the bare land plot was weeded periodically to keep it as a bare land runoff and soil loss of each runoff plot were collected from 2015 to 2019 if there was runoff generated after a rainfall event firstly the volume of runoff in volumetric barrel was measured then we stirred and mixed the sediment and water homogeneously in the volumetric barrel and runoff samples were collected into bottles with a volume of 1850 ml if the volume of sample was less than 1850 ml we collected all the sample all volumetric barrels were emptied and cleaned out after the measurement and sampling for the next erosive event whereafter the runoff sample of each runoff plot was settled for 8 h and the sediment was separated subsequently the sediment was dried in oven over 24 h at 105 and weighed to obtain the sediment concentration lastly the soil loss amount of each plot was determined by the sediment concentration multiplies the total runoff volume in volumetric barrel rainfall process data were obtained by two self recording rain gauges machine type tpj 32 near the runoff plots with the measurement accuracy of 0 2 mm the rainfall amount duration average intensity and maximum intensities of 15 minute 30 minute and 45 minute were extracted from the rainfall process data if the rainfall interval exceeded 6 h the successive rainfall events were regarded as two rainfall events renard et al 1997 wischmeier and smith 1958 the vegetation litter and soil biotic crust coverage of each vegetation plot were also measured after every erosive event in august from 2015 to 2019 the vegetation coverage of rp refers to the total coverage of trees shrubs and herb species that of ck and sv types refer to the coverage of shrubs and herb species that of other communties refer to the the coverage of herb species the abundance height coverage of each species in each plot were recorded in three quadrats 1 m 1 m in august from 2015 to 2019 2 3 statistical analyses in current study we analyzed the runoff and soil erosion data based on event scale in five consecutive years 2015 2019 the surface runoff depth h and soil erosion modulus sm were respectively presented as follows 1 h r ap 10 3 where h r and ap means surface runoff depth mm the runoff volume m3 generated by a erosive event and area of runoff plot m2 respectively 2 sm sl ap where sm sl ap refers to soil erosion modulus t km 2 soil loss amount t generated by a erosive event and area of runoff plot km2 respectively species importance value iv was used as the index for expressing the importance of species qu et al 1983 iv was calculated as follows 3 iv rc r f r d 3 where iv is the species importance value for each species rc means the percentage of coverage for each species to the sampling quadrat rf refers to the percentage of frequencies of each species appearing in sampling quadrats to the total numbers of sample quadrats rd refers to the percentage of density for each species to the total density of all species in the sampling quadrat ultimately we averaged the iv values of each species in three quadrats to get the iv values of each species in every runoff plot the erosive rainstorm selection was based on erosive rainstorm criterion of rainfall amount within different rainfall duration on the loess plateau presented by wang and jiao 2018 namely if the rainfall amount of certain rainfall duration in a rainfall event was higher than the values in table 2 the rainfall event was recognized as erosive rainstorm event one way analysis of variance anova and tukey method test were used to evaluate the differences in runoff and soil erosion significant differences were set as 95 level 3 results 3 1 vegetation characteristics the main species with maximum importance value of nine vegetation types varied from year to year table 3 the main species of asc sb ld transformed from artemisia scoparia to stipa bungeana in 2016 and lespedeza davurica in 2018 regarding the sb agm the main species became artemisia gmelinii since 2017 while it was stipa bungeana in 2015 and 2016 with respect to other vegetation types the main species did not show dramatically change in the study period notablely artemisia gmelinii was the most common main species among these vegetation types in general the vegetation coverage rises with the abandoned age increases ck type showed the highest vegetation coverage 67 8 followed by agm agi type 65 5 and agm sg type 61 0 table 1 while asc sb ld community with the least abandoned age 5 9 years showed the smallest vegetation coverage 20 5 in terms of the biotic crust coverage the asc sb ld community showed the highest value 64 7 followed by agm sb community 56 5 besides the biotic crust coverage of rp community 1 0 was least among vegetation types with regard to litter coverage the rp community had the highest litter coverage 92 8 followed by ck community 58 9 meanwhile the litter coverage of asc sb ld community 9 4 was the smallest among all vegetation types table 1 3 2 rainfall and erosive rainstorm characteristics there is high variability in the rainfall amount in rainy seasons from may to october per year among different years the highest rainfall amount of rainy seasons was 466 2 mm in 2016 while the smallest rainfall amount was 181 8 mm in 2015 table 4 the total number of rainfall events in rainy seasons of study period from 2015 to 2019 was 145 in which there were 51 erosive events in a rainy season there were only 25 6 to 66 7 of the total rainfall events leading to soil loss eleven erosive rainstorm events were selected from rainfall events during 2015 to 2019 based on the erosive rainstorm criterion on the loess plateau table 2 erosive rainstorm events occurred five one four and two times in 2016 2017 2018 and 2019 respectively table 5 while there were no erosive rainstorm events in 2015 the rainfall amounts of erosive rainstorm events varied from 14 7 to 72 1 mm and the average value was 46 1 mm the duration of the 11 events ranged from 1 5 to 20 0 h with an average value of 10 3 h additionally the maximum intensities of 15 minute 30 minute and 45 minute was in the range of 14 0 to 90 4 mm h 1 12 0 to 62 2 mm h 1 and 10 7 to 37 3 mm h 1 respectively the erosive rainstorm event with maximum rainfall amount took place in 2019 07 24 raining for 15 h and 45 min and the amount occupied 16 8 of the total rainfall amount of rainy season in 2019 while the erosive rainstorm events with highest maximum intensities of 15 minute 30 minute and 45 minute occurred in 2018 06 30 the results indicated that not only heavy rainfall events with high rainfall amount and intensities but also some events with smaller amounts and shorter durations can be considered as erosive rainstorm events 3 3 runoff and soil erosion under erosive rainstorms the runoff depth and soil erosion modulus of bare land under erosive rainstorm events were much higher than those of vegetation types p 0 05 these vegetation types could reduce 68 0 to 97 4 of runoff depth and 98 0 to 99 9 of soil loss compared to bare land under erosive rainstorm events fig 2 among vegetation types sb agm and bi led to more runoff with mean depth of 2 19 and 1 83 mm under the 11 erosive rainstorm events fig 2 however the rp and ck exhibited little runoff depths which were not higher than 1 mm under all erosive rainstorm events regarding the soil loss among vegetation types sb agm caused most soil erosion with mean soil erosion modulus of 9 4 t km 2 under erosive rainstorm events while the ck and rp produced smaller soil erosion with average soil erosion modulus of 0 27 and 0 46 t km 2 respectively nevertheless there are no significant difference of runoff and soil loss among different vegetation types under erosive rainstorm events there are significant variation of surface runoff and soil erosion under vegetation types among different rainstorm events fig 3 the highest surface runoff of vegetation types mostly occurred in 2016 08 16 3 7 mm of as sb ld 8 1 mm of bi 4 1 mm of agm sb 5 2 mm of sv 2 3 mm of agm agi and 0 8 mm of ck and 2018 06 30 4 0 mm of agm sg and 0 6 mm of rp these two rainstorm events were both characterized by higher rainfall amount and maximum 30 minute intensity additionally there were significant differences in soil erosion of vegetation types among different rainstorm events fig 3 the highest soil erosion events mostly happened in 2016 06 22 83 1 t km 2 of sb agm 31 0 t km 2 of bi 8 3 t km 2 of agm sg and 10 9 t km 2 of agm agi and 2016 08 16 7 1 t km 2 of asc sb ld 23 4 t km 2 of sv and 2 0 t km 2 of rp the results showed that the soil erosion under rainstorm events enlarged as the maximum 30 minute intensity increased however the 2016 07 19 2019 07 24 and 2019 08 07 rainstorm events with higher rainfall amount and lower maximum 30 minute intensity led to lower soil erosion this indicated that the maximum 30 minute intensity instead of rainfall amount is the controlling factor of soil erosion 4 discussion 4 1 the effects of vegetation types on runoff and soil erosion it has been demonstrated worldwide that vegetation restoration can effectively reduce surface runoff and soil loss under erosive rainstorm events cerdan et al 2002 kang et al 2001 wang et al 2016 wei et al 2009 previous studies also proved that the vegetation types in later succession stages had relatively high community functional diversity which would generate smaller soil erosion zhu et al 2015 the soil physical properties gradually improved with more soil organic matter water stable aggregates and enhanced soil infiltration capacity as the abandoned ages increased which ultimately decreased runoff and erosion zhang et al 2015 chen et al 2017a chen et al 2017b besides the vegetation coverage constantly increased as abandoned ages advanced in current study table 4 and the vegetation coverage correlated negatively with surface runoff and soil erosion significantly zhou et al 2016 in this study the vegetation coverage and litter coverage of vegetation types with abandoned ages longer than 20 years plot 5 10 were higher than those of vegetation types with abandoned ages shorter than 20 years plot 2 4 the average vegetation coverage and litter coverage in study period were 37 7 and 17 4 of plot 2 4 and 59 2 and 41 8 of plot 5 10 respectively table 1 as a consequence the average runoff and soil loss of plot 2 4 were 1 9 and 3 2 times higher than those of plot 5 10 under 11 rainstorm events fig 2 notably the ck and rp community generated much smaller surface runoff and soil erosion than those of other vegetation types under erosive rainstorm events fig 2 the robinia pseudoacacia was the only arbor species in all vegetation types of current study and the canopy of arbor was considered to protect soil from erosion effectively by intercepting rainfall bochet et al 2006 liu 1998 zhao et al 2001 furthermore average coverage of litter layers for the robinia pseudoacacia was 92 8 from 2015 to 2019 which was higher than other vegetation types table 1 the litter layer under the vegetation types led to higher surface roughness and enhanced infiltration capacity boer and puigdef√°bregas 2005 woods and balfour 2010 moreover the soil non capillary porosity and soil particle fractal dimension of robinia pseudoacacia community have been directly improved consequently enhancing the soil infiltration capacity tang et al 2019 the high soil infiltration capacity decreased the flow velocity and runoff depth effectively bod√≠ et al 2012 cerd√† and doerr 2008 and accordingly led to little runoff and soil loss fig 2 besides the ck type had the average vegetation coverage of 67 8 which was the highest among all vegetation types moreover the litter coverage of ck type was 58 9 which was just lower than that of the rp among all types table 1 vegetation cover and litter layers which were close to ground can also protect surface soil against raindrop splash and control surface runoff and soil erosion effectively chen et al 2018 liu et al 2017 wang et al 2001 in current study the average runoff of ck and rp types under 11 erosive rainstorm events were 0 20 and 0 17 mm and the soil erosion of the two vegetation types were 0 26 and 0 45 t km 2 the surface runoff and soil erosion of ck and rp types were smaller compared with other vegetation types with a reduction of 86 7 and 87 6 in average runoff depth 92 7 and 87 5 in average soil erosion respectively 4 2 response of runoff and soil erosion to erosive rainstorm events the erosive rainstorm events could generate several times surface runoff and soil erosion higher than ordinary erosive events which should be paid attention to prevent tables 6 and 7 the max runoff event of bare land had the runoff depth of 12 4 mm which was 15 5 times higher than average runoff depth in ordinary events in addition the highest runoff depth among vegetation types was 8 1 mm of bi which was 77 1 times as average runoff depth of ordinary events in the vegetation type the runoff ratio of max event to average ordinary events under vegetation types were higher than the ratio of bare land because of the slight runoff depth under ordinary events of vegetation types the max soil loss event of bare land had the soil erosion modulus of 2883 t km 2 which equaled 101 2 times of average soil erosion modulus in ordinary events besides the highest soil erosion modulus among vegetation types was 83 1 t km 2 of sb agm which was 141 3 times as average soil erosion modulus of ordinary events in the type the results highlighted the devastating impact of erosive rainstorm events on surface runoff and soil erosion which generally agreed with those of previously published studies bull et al 2000 jiao et al 2017 li et al 2019 mueller and pfister 2011 wang et al 2016 the phenomenon may be on account of the synthetic function of high soil moisture and intense rainfall intensity in the loess plateau rainfall events mostly occurred between june to september on the loess plateau fu 1989 and the frequent rainfall events caused the high soil moisture content and maintained the soil saturation fang et al 2017 li et al 2019 ponce and hawkins 1996 the subsequent erosive rainstorm events with high rainfall intensity fig 3 therefore could generate runoff easily and consequently bring on more soil loss because of high pre soil moisture and rainfall intensity li et al 2019 additionally the rainfall amount and intensity exhibited high temporal variability in the rainy season table 5 thus the surface runoff and soil erosion under different rainstorm events were different significantly with each other fig 3 which is to blame for the changeable pre soil moisture and rainfall intensity for instance although the erosive rainstorm events happened in 2016 06 22 was only 27 8 mm it led to max soil loss in bare land and vegetation types of sb agm bi and agm agi that might be partly due to the erosive rainstorm event occurred in 2016 06 10 with rainfall amount of 46 6 mm and rainfall event happened in 2016 06 11 with rainfall amount of 12 7 mm which jointly contributed to the high antecedent soil moisture content in the 2016 06 22 erosive rainstorm event the soil erosion modulus of bare land sb agm and bi types were 101 2 141 3 and 75 9 times as soil erosion modulus of ordinary erosive events in these types respectively on the contrary the erosive rainstorm of 2019 07 24 was characterized by highest rainfall amount 72 1 mm and lower runoff and soil erosion that may be on account of the lower maximum 30 minute intensity and little antecedent rainfall of this erosive rainstorm event 4 3 implications planted shrubs and trees can significantly reduce water and soil loss cerda et al 2017 chen et al 2018 zhou et al 2016 in current study the artifical planted shrub ck and forest rp types had lower average runoff 0 20 and 0 17 mm and soil erosion 0 26 and 0 45 t km 2 compared to bare land with a reduction of 97 24 97 42 in surface runoff and 99 94 99 90 in soil erosion modulus under 11 erosive rainstorm events respectively however large scale artificial afforestation probably consumed soil water content rapidly and led to the deficits of soil moisture fu et al 2017 jia et al 2008 liu et al 2018 zhao et al 2019 the planted shrubs and trees may form dried soil layer which could consequently inhibit the growth and natural succession of vegetation chen et al 2018 fu et al 2017 wang et al 2011 shao et al 2016 ultimately hampering the sustainable development of vegetation restoration and decreasing the soil and water conservation benefits chen et al 2018 wang et al 2011 the unsustainability of many ecological restoration projects all over the world such as the great plains shelterbelt initiated by roosevelt in 1934 the great plan for the transformation of nature launched by stalin in 1940s the algerian green dam began in 1970s and the three north shelter forest program in china started since 1970s li and zhai 2002 have also proved the rule additionally naturally restored herbaceous vegetation can also effectively control the runoff and soil erosion on abandoned farmland slopes chen et al 2018 fattet et al 2011 wei et al 2007 and there were no significant differences of surface runoff and soil erosion between planted types and natural vegetation types fig 2 moreover the natural vegetation succession hardly not require economic and human input and consumed less soil moisture compared to those of exotic trees and shrubs chen et al 2018 fu et al 2017 yang et al 2017 hence the natural vegetation succession could be chosen primarily as a suitable strategy of ecological restoration projects on the semiarid hilly areas in practice the trees and shrubs could be planted in areas with abundant soil moisture such as shady slopes or lower part of slopes to fully prevent the runoff and erosion in the loess plateau the grain for green project adopted the natural restoration and artificial afforestation simultaneously and effectively reduced the runoff and sediment fu et al 2011 fu et al 2017 nevertheless more attention must be paid to the sustainable development of the grain for green project in the future 5 conclusion the vegetation coverage of different vegetation types would rise with the abandoned age increased and there was high variability in the rainfall characteristics of erosive rainstorm events the vegetation restoration on abandoned slopes could effectively decrease the surface runoff and soil erosion under the 11 erosive rainstorm events during 2015 to 2019 the vegetation types could reduce 68 0 to 97 4 of surface runoff depth and 98 0 to 99 9 of soil loss compared to bare land under erosive rainstorm events however the differences of surface runoff and soil erosion under erosive rainstorm events among vegetation types were not significant the erosive rainstorm events resulted in much more runoff and soil loss than those of ordinary events and there were significant variances of surface runoff and soil erosion among different erosive rainstorm events the relatively high soil erosion could happen in certain erosive rainstorm events because of the high rainfall intensity and antecedent soil moisture content in summary the erosive rainstorm events should be paid enough attention in probably triggering high runoff and soil erosion in the rainy reasons credit authorship contribution statement liang yue

5674,projecting the likely change of potential evapotranspiration etp under future climate scenarios is crucial for quantifying the impacts of climate change on the hydrologic cycle and aridity conditions however there are different sources of uncertainty in projecting future etp that may arise from global climate models gcms emission scenarios and multiple etp models used in this study we developed three random forest based rf based etp models with solar radiation and air temperature at eight climatic stations in southeastern australia with penman model as the benchmark their performance was firstly compared with four empirical models jensen haise makkink abtew and hargreaves which requires the same meteorological inputs in general the rf based etp models showed better performance in etp estimates across all stations with coefficients of determination r2 ranging from 0 68 to 0 92 root mean square errors rmse ranging from 0 58 mm day 1 to 1 46 mm day 1 and relative mean bias errors rmbe ranging from 16 10 to 9 73 the rf based and empirical models were then used to project future etp for the eight stations based on statistically downscaled daily climatic data from 34 gcms under two different representative concentration pathways rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 all models indicated that etp was likely to increase at the eight stations the ensemble increases of mean etp across eight stations ranged from 33 mm year 1 2 1 2040s to 129 mm year 1 9 2 2090s and from 43 mm year 1 2 8 2040s to 248 mm year 1 17 6 2090s under rcp4 5 and under rcp8 5 respectively in addition we also quantified uncertainties in etp projections originating from etp models gcms rcps and their combined effects using the analysis of variance anova method results showed that rcp related uncertainty contributed the most to projected etp uncertainty around 40 for most stations while gcm related and etp model related uncertainties accounted for roughly equal amounts of projected etp uncertainty 10 30 this study demonstrated the better performance of rf based etp models it is advisable to use multiple etp models driven by various gcms under different rcps to produce reliable projections of future etp keywords potential evapotranspiration empirical etp models random forest uncertainty climate change southeastern australia 1 introduction the hydrological cycle has intensified in the last century and the rate of intensification for the coming century is accelerating due to climate change durack et al 2012 pan et al 2015 this may lead to a global shift in aridity or make dry regions become drier while wet regions become wetter chen et al 2017 thus it is important to investigate the influence of climate change on the water cycle as one of the most important components of hydrological and climatological processes evapotranspiration et accounts for around 70 of precipitation falling on land and consumes more than 50 of the solar energy absorbed by the earth guo et al 2017 pan et al 2015 vicente serrano et al 2014 thus et is a very useful indicator to analyse the changing behaviour of the hydrologic regime wang et al 2017b however et is not easy to measure for instance although lysimeters are frequently used to directly measure et they are sparsely distributed around the world because they are expensive and laborious to manage azhar and perera 2011 therefore et is generally estimated by various empirical models that estimate either potential evapotranspiration etp or reference evapotranspiration et0 almorox et al 2015 etp represents the maximum possible evapotranspiration rate from a well watered vegetative surface donohue et al 2010 mcmahon et al 2016 and is regarded as the optimum measurement of evaporative demand from actual land surfaces under specified metrological conditions zheng et al 2017 in fact etp rather than actual et has been widely used as an important input to various hydrological models thompson et al 2013 and aridity indexes sheffield et al 2012 in general et models can be classified into four categories according to their input requirements i e temperature based models hargreaves et al 1985 radiation based models jensen and haise 1963 makkink 1957 mass transfer based models mahringer 1970 and combination models penman 1948 among them the penman model and the fao56 penman monteith pm fao56 model are two variants of the penman monteith type models they are both physically based models milly and dunne 2016 yang et al 2019 that can accurately estimate et across various climate conditions donohue et al 2010 milly and dunne 2016 therefore they are widely used as benchmarks to assess the performance of other etp et0 models in contrast to the penman model pm fao56 considers the surface conductance of a reference crop and provides estimates of et0 while the penman model provides estimates of etp both of these models require the complete set of climatic data which may limit their use in some regions in the particular case of future et projection downscaled climatic data such as wind speed and relative humidity may not be reliable randall et al 2007 thus limiting the use of penman monteith type models compared with the penman model simplified empirical etp models require fewer climate inputs to offer acceptable estimates almorox et al 2015 these empirical etp models e g temperature based models may be preferable for future etp projection because gcm simulated temperature is considered to have higher confidence than other climatic variables csiro and bom 2015 randall et al 2007 for instance kay and davies 2008 used both the penman monteith model and a temperature based model to estimate etp of britain with climate data from five gcms and eight regional climate models they demonstrated that etp estimated by the temperature based model with temperature from a climate model matched morecs etp a gridded dataset of estimated etp based on observed climatic data with the penman monteith model better than etp estimated by the penman monteith model with climate model data similarly ravazzani et al 2014 adopted a temperature based model and an energy balance based etp model which requires a complete set of climate data to quantify the influence of climate change on water resources in northern italy they found that a simple temperature based etp model is sufficiently accurate for analysing the climate change effects on hydrological regimes in addition to empirical etp models newly emerging machine learning techniques have recently been used to estimate etp feng et al 2018 kisi 2015 ki≈üi 2013 kisi and alizamir 2018 mehdizadeh 2018 tabari et al 2012 wang et al 2017a the major advantage of machine learning techniques is that they are capable of tackling non linear relationships between the dependent and independent variables without requiring knowledge of the internal variables fan et al 2018 mehdizadeh 2018 performance comparisons between machine learning techniques and conventional empirical models for estimating et have been widely reported for instance tabari et al 2012 evaluated the performance of support vector machines svm adaptive neuro fuzzy inference systems anfis multiple linear regression multiple non linear regression four temperature based et0 models and eight radiation based et0 models for estimating et0 compared with the pm fao56 model in a semi arid highland environment in iran they found that svm and anfis performed better than the regression based models and the corresponding conventional et0 models i e models requiring the same climatic inputs in the poyang lake watershed lu et al 2018 adopted three tree based machine learning methods including m5tree random forest rf and gradient boosting decision tree gbdt and four empirical models to estimate pan evaporation from 2001 to 2015 they found machine learning models especially gbdt and rf showed great potential for estimating daily pan evaporation regardless of the input combination in spain shiri et al 2012 assessed the performance of gene expression programming gep anfis hargreaves and priestley taylor for calculating daily et0 compared with the pm fao56 model and found that both gep and anfis performed better than the two conventional models in summary machine learning models generally outperformed conventional empirical models i e for models requiring the same climatic inputs in accurately estimating et however their use in projecting future etp is still rare another widely discussed problem in the estimation of future etp is related to the uncertainty generated by various etp models gcms and emission scenarios bae et al 2011 wilby and harris 2006 xu et al 2014 for instance wang et al 2015 found that the directly downscaled etp values from hadcm3 and etp estimated by pm fao56 and hargreaves models would all increase under future climate scenarios in the hanjiang river basin however the magnitudes of the etp increases varied greatly among these etp models up to 70 mm year 1 other researchers arnell and gosling 2013 kay and davies 2008 also reported that the projected etp under future climate scenarios could be significantly different due to the differences in gcms and etp models indicating the large uncertainty in future etp projections thus it is necessary to quantify the uncertainty originating from various sources in order to evaluate the reliability of etp projections thompson et al 2014 concluded that gcm related uncertainty was about 3 5 times larger than etp model related uncertainty for the projection of river flow in the mekong river basin for the projection of future global etp with various etp models and gcms kingston et al 2009 claimed that etp model related uncertainty was equal to or in some circumstance greater than gcm related uncertainty however to our knowledge few studies have systematically quantified the uncertainties originating from conventional etp models as well as machine learning based models gcms emission scenarios and their combined effects australia is a water scarce and drought vulnerable country howden et al 2014 verdon kidd and kiem 2009 the warming climate may exacerbate the water scarce situation in this region therefore studying the likely change of etp in australia is necessary for the development of proposals and policies for adapting water management to climate change in this study we first proposed a machine learning method to estimate etp in southeastern australia and used multiple etp models driven by statistically downscaled climate data from a large number of gcms to quantify the impacts of climate change on etp the objectives of this study were to 1 assess the performance of machine learning based etp models for estimating daily etp 2 explore the likely change of future etp in the study area based on various etp models and 3 quantify the contributions of different sources of uncertainty including gcms etp models emission scenarios and their combined effects to the uncertainty in future etp projections this research will provide a good reference for researchers to better understand the performance of machine learning based etp models in projecting future etp additionally knowledge of the uncertainty in future etp projections would also help researchers to understand the potential bias in projecting the hydrological cycle and water availability under future climate scenarios 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area new south wales nsw is located in southeast australia fig 1 it accounts for 10 4 of the australian land area 8 1 105 km2 and has a population of more than eight million making nsw the most populous state in australia the production of agricultural crops in nsw is important to the agricultural industry in australia for instance wheat grown in nsw accounts for 28 of the total wheat planted area in australia feng et al 2019b however topography and climatic characteristics in nsw vary greatly from east to west making it vulnerable to climate change in general nsw can be divided into four distinct geographical sections based on their natural features namely the east coast the mountains the central plains and the western plains climatically the east coast and the mountains are characterized by humid or sub humid climates while the central and western plains experience semi arid or arid climates average annual rainfall gradually increases from 50 mm year 1 in the westernmost region to 1500 mm year 1 on the east coast similarly average annual temperature gradually increases from around 10 c in the southeast to greater than 20 c in the northwest climate in nsw is expected to change under the influence of future global warming for instance temperature in nsw is projected to rise by 2 1 c by 2070 while annual rainfall is likely to decrease csiro and bom 2015 vaze et al 2008 furthermore extreme weather events such as heatwaves and droughts may occur more frequently feng et al 2019a which might exacerbate water scarcity in nsw and result in new water management challenges thus it is necessary to project etp changes under future climate scenarios to predict the effects of climate change on water resource management and drought prediction eight stations in nsw fig 1 were selected for examination in this study because they have complete sets of climate data that are required for the penman model to estimate daily etp geographic information etp related climate variables annual rainfall and aridity index of these stations are shown in table 1 2 2 climate data and downscaling method applied historical daily climate data during the research period including maximum temperature tmax minimum temperature tmin maximum and minimum relative humidity rhmax and rhmin respectively rainfall and solar radiation rs were obtained from the scientific information for land owners silo patched point dataset https www longpaddock qld gov au silo datadrill index php in addition wind speed data were obtained from the bureau of meteorology bom http www bom gov au the percentage of missing daily wind speed data was less than 5 for each station to estimate the missing wind speed values we first used years with consecutive daily wind speed to calculate the long term average wind speed for each day of the year then we used the average wind speed for the i th i ranges from 1 to 365 day of the year as the proxy wind speed for that day of the year with a missing value to project etp under future climate scenarios we downscaled 34 gcms table 2 from the coupled model intercomparison project phase 5 cmip5 dataset to extract daily tmax tmin rainfall and rs from 1900 to 2100 based on the statistical downscaling method developed by liu and zuo 2012 statistical downscaling is an effective method to downscale the raw monthly climatic data from gcms at coarse spatial resolutions to a finer spatial and temporal scale firstly the monthly climatic data from gcms were downscaled to specific sites using the inverse distance weighted interpolation method then bias correction was applied to the monthly values of climatic factors for each site thirdly we used a stochastic weather generator to produce daily climatic factors for each site the detailed information about this method has been described by liu and zuo 2012 this study used the downscaled data to project future etp with the chosen empirical and machine learning based etp models under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 climate scenarios for data downscaled from 34 gcms we defined the period from 1990 to 2014 as the baseline period the near future projected period was defined as 2026 to 2050 2040s the medium projected period was from 2051 to 2075 2065s and the far future period was 2076 2100 2090s 2 3 the penman model as mentioned in the introduction the penman model is widely used as a benchmark to assess the performance of other etp models in this study we also assessed the performance of other models against the penman model the mathematical expression of the penman model is shown in eq 1 1 e t p p e n m a n 0 408 Œ¥ Œ¥ Œ≥ r n g Œ≥ Œ¥ Œ≥ 6 43 1 0

almorox et al 2015 most gcms have reliable prediction of air temperature therefore we also adopted commonly used temperature based and radiation based models to compare their performance with random forest based etp models and to project future etp the temperature based model used in this study was the well known hargreaves hs model and the three radiation based models were jensen haise jh makkink mak and abtew ab their mathematical expressions were as follows 6 e t p h s 0 0023 0 408 r a t max t min 0 5 t 17 8 7 e t p j h 0 0102 t 3 r s 8 e t p m a k 0 7 Œ¥ Œ¥ Œ≥ r s Œª 9 e t p a b 0

methods developed by breiman 2001 compared with most well established machine learning methods e g artificial neural networks and svm rf only needs two parameters the number of decision trees ntree and the number of variables mtry moreover rf has a strong predictive power to deal with non linear and hierarchical relationships between the predictors and the response in fact rf has been widely used for classification and regression tasks fan et al 2018 heung et al 2014 wang et al 2018b thus we adopted rf as a representative machine learning technique to estimate etp in this study briefly around 2 3 of the original data were randomly chosen as the bootstrapped dataset to generate numerous decision trees ntree with a random subset of the total variables mtry each step thus a variety of decision trees were generated that formed the forest the remaining original data around 1 3 which were not chosen to build the bootstrapped dataset known as the out of bag dataset were used for validation based on the forest the projector used predicted data and ran those data through all of the decision trees the final prediction was the average of the results of all trees more information about rf can be found in breiman 2001 and a schematic diagram of rf is shown in fig s1 this study adopted the randomforest package in r liaw and wiener 2002 https cran r project org web packages randomforest index html to develop rf based etp models with observed historical climatic data the daily climatic data from 1950 or the starting year of the station shown in table 1 to 2000 were used to train rf based etp models while the data from 2001 to 2014 were used to test these rf based etp models three rf based etp models table 3 were developed namely rf1 based on tmax tmin and rs to compare with jh and mak rf2 based on tmax tmin and extra terrestrial solar radiation ra to compare with hs and rf3 based on tmax and rs to compare with ab we set ntree as 500 to ensure that every input row would be predicted a few times the default value of mtry is generally around 1 3 of the number of input variables p guio blanco et al 2018 because of the small number of input variables in the current study we used mtry values which were somewhat larger than 0 33p the number of predictors in our study was 3 for rf1 and rf2 and 2 for rf3 thus we set mtry as 2 for rf1 and rf2 and 1 for rf3 2 6 model evaluation performance with regards to estimates of etp rates of rf based rf1 rf2 and rf3 and empirical jh mak hs and ab etp models was evaluated against the penman model with the commonly used statistical parameters coefficient of determination r2 root mean square error rmse mm day 1 and relative mean bias error rmbe these parameters were calculated via the following equations

calculated by penman model and other etp models aforementioned respectively a high performing model will have r2 close to 1 rmse close to 0 mm day 1 and rmbe close to 0 2 7 future etp projection both the validated rf based rf1 rf2 and rf3 and the four empirical jh mak hs and ab etp models were used to project future etp with downscaled daily climatic data from 34 gcms under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 climate scenarios daily etp values were then summed to obtain annual etp for each gcm at the eight stations the etp change for a certain future period was the difference between the mean annual etp for that period and the mean annual etp for the baseline period 2 8 contribution analysis of uncertainty in future etp projections the analysis of variance anova technique has been widely used to quantify the contribution of different sources in uncertainty analysis aryal et al 2019 su et al 2017 tao et al 2018 wang et al 2018a this technique is able to partition the total observed variances into different sources thus identifying the contribution of different sources to the total variance compared with other commonly used methods e g recursive models parameter identification and bayesian approaches in uncertainty analysis ashraf vaghefi et al 2019 freni et al 2009 the anova method requires fewer assumptions and considers the interactive contributions of different sources of the uncertainty to the total variance ashraf vaghefi et al 2019 yip et al 2011 thus we used a three way three factors anova to quantify the relative contribution of gcms rcps and etp models to the uncertainty in etp projections a three way anova can be split into seven fractions that include the three main effects and the four interaction effects the total sum of squares sst was calculated as 13 sst s s gcms s s rcps s s e t p m o d e l s main e f f e c t s s s gcms r c p s s s gcms e t p m o d e l s s s rcps e t p m o d e l s s s gcms r c p s e t p m o d e l s interaction e f f e c t s 3 results 3 1 performance of etp models during the historical period historical etp estimation 2001 2014 fig 2 indicated that rf based etp models generally outperformed the corresponding empirical etp models i e empirical etp models which required the same inputs specifically rf based etp models generally produced greater r2 smaller rmse and smaller absolute rmbe than the corresponding empirical etp models did at nearly all eight stations for example consider the results for the rf1 jh and mak models their r2 values all ranged from 0 80 to 0 90 however the rmse of rf1 ranged from 0 58 mm day 1 to 1 31 mm day 1 generally lower than that of jh from 0 76 mm day 1 to 1 42 mm day 1 and mak from 0 99 mm day 1 to 2 28 mm day 1 moreover etp values calculated by rf based models generally followed the penman model while other empirical models e g mak and hs tended to underestimate etp compare blue regression lines with red 1 1 lines in fig 2 even at stations where nearly all rf based and empirical models underestimated etp such as at cobar and sydney rf based models still performed better showing better consistency with the penman model the better performance of rf based models may be explained by their ability to deal with non linear processes between response variable and predictors in addition rf1 and rf3 showed similar performance at the eight stations indicating that tmin might not be a key factor influencing the accuracy of rf based etp models again these two models performed better than rf2 which might denote that rs instead of ra was a more important factor for estimating etp with rf based etp models 3 2 the change of climatic factors under future climate scenarios consistent increases were observed in tmax fig 3 a and tmin fig 3b irrespective of rcp scenarios and stations specifically the increases of mean tmax ranged from 0 61 c by the 2040s to 2 33 c by the 2090s under rcp4 5 while the range for mean tmin was 0 88 c 2040s to 2 02 c 2090s under rcp8 5 larger increases were found in both tmax and tmin than under rcp4 5 for a certain future period for instance the range of increases of mean tmax and mean tmin under rcp8 5 were 0 79 c 2040s to 4 58 c 2090s and 1 10 c 2040s to 4 39 c 2090s respectively moreover as time increased into the future period the increase in tmax and tmin became larger similar increasing trends were also found in rs independent of stations mean rs fig 3d was projected to increase by 0 08 0 32 mj m 2 day 1 under rcp4 5 and 0 01 0 29 mj m 2 day 1 under rcp8 5 in contrast to the uniform increase in tmax and tmin was the obvious difference found among stations in the direction and magnitude of change of Œ¥t over time fig 3c for instance mean Œ¥t at murrurundi increased by 0 14 0 31 c under rcp4 5 and by 0 12 0 18 c under rcp8 5 whereas it decreased by 0 36 0 61 c under rcp4 5 and by 0 45 1 52 c under rcp8 5 at coffs harbour Œ¥t is related to the degree of cloud cover allen et al 1998 and is a good indicator of solar radiation and relative humidity allen et al 1998 kingston et al 2009 in particular Œ¥t is an important input for the hs model the variance change of Œ¥t may influence the change of etp estimated by the hs model there was no uniform direction in the change of rainfall over time fig 3e the ranges of mean rainfall change were 34 mm year 1 to 9 mm year 1 under rcp4 5 and from 14 mm year 1 to 26 mm year 1 under rcp8 5 3 3 etp and its change under future climate scenarios as expected etp estimated by all models showed obvious increases under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios at all stations except coffs harbour where the hs calculated etp showed a slight change fig 4 fig 5 however both the future etp fig s3 fig s4 provided in supplementary material and the increasing magnitude showed large differences among etp models for each station regardless of rcp scenarios in general rf based models projected higher future etp and larger increases than empirical etp models did for all stations for instance rf1 generally projected the largest increase of mean etp among models for a given future period ranging from 49 mm year 1 3 2 2040s to 164 mm year 1 11 7 2090s under the rcp4 5 scenario and from 64 mm year 1 4 1 2040s to 346 mm year 1 24 1 2090s under the rcp8 5 scenario in contrast mean etp projected by mak generally showed the smallest increase ranging from 27 mm year 1 1 3 2040s to 69 mm year 1 4 9 2090s under rcp4 5 and from 28 mm year 1 1 4 2040s to 113 mm year 1 8 0 2090s under rcp8 5 influenced by the change differences of tmax tmin and rs fig 3a 3b and 3d respectively etp projected by any given model also showed larger increases under the rcp8 5 scenario than under the rcp4 5 scenario for any given future period again etp increases became larger as time into the future period increased the ensemble increases of mean etp across eight stations ranged from 33 mm year 1 2 1 2040s to 129 mm year 1 9 2 2090s under rcp4 5 and from 43 mm year 1 2 8 2040s to 248 mm year 1 17 6 2090s under rcp8 5 3 4 contribution of climatic factors to etp change in order to determine the relationships between the change of etp and changes of meteorological factors multiple linear regression was performed for each station using changes of tmax tmin rs and rainfall as independent variables and changes of etp as the dependent variable our analysis showed that changes in tmax tmin rs and rainfall generally accounted for more than 92 0 of the etp change and the change of rainfall had only a slight influence in etp for most stations table 4 we also found that relationships between the change of tmax tmin and rs and the change of etp could be grouped based on the input requirements of etp models in general compared with tmax and tmin a unit increase of rs led to a larger increase of etp projected by rf1 jh and mak in contrarst the largest etp increases ranging from 64 0 mm year 1 to 116 7 mm year 1 projected by rf2 and hs were caused by a unit increase of tmax while changes in tmin and rs were negatively related to etp changes lastly for rf3 and ab one unit increase in rs and tmax could contribute roughly equally to the change in etp 3 5 contribution of different sources to the uncertainty of etp projections both ranges of future etp and etp differences among models and rcp scenarios indicated the existing uncertainty in future etp projections thus we used anova to quantify the relative contributions of gcms etp models and rcp scenarios to the uncertainty of etp projections fig 6 the rcps accounted for around 40 0 of the uncertainty of etp projections at all stations except the humid stations sydney coffs harbour indicating the dominant role of rcps in the uncertainty of etp projections following rcps the contribution of gcms to uncertainty ranged from 16 7 to 28 8 among the eight stations the etp models contributed less than 16 0 to uncertainty at most stations however at sydney and coffs harbour the contribution of etp models to uncertainty was roughly equal to or even higher than that observed for rcps 4 discussion our study found that rf based models produced etp values that were much closer to penman calculated etp during the historical period indicating that rf based etp models generally outperformed empirical etp models fig 2 fig s2 for the empirical etp models jh calculated etp was close to rf calculated etp during both the historical and future periods whereas the rest of the empirical etp models produced relatively lower etp fig 2 figs s2 s4 though the use of rf based models for projecting future etp is rare their good performance in estimating historical evapotranspiration has been reported by other researchers fan et al 2018 feng et al 2017 for instance feng et al 2017 compared the performance of rf based and generalized regression neural networks grnn based models in estimating daily et0 against the pm fao56 model based on two different input combinations they found that the rf based models with r2 ranging from 0 89 to 0 98 generally outperformed the grnn based models although there is no strong evidence to guarantee which model is more reliable for predicting future etp kay and davies 2008 the use of rf based etp models is still advisable due to the following reasons firstly these models have more flexibility for adding climatic inputs to improve their accuracy fan et al 2018 thus when reliable climatic parameters are available it is more feasible and efficient to train rf based models than to calibrate empirical etp models secondly the testing and training of rf based etp models are more easily accomplished and it is possible to efficiently do cross station validation in contrast one of the most commonly used methods to improve performance of simplified empirical models is to re calibrate the empirical coefficients based on a linear relationship against observed et or penman monteith type models droogers and allen 2002 tabari and talaee 2011 however these coefficients are generally location specific and may result in less accurate performance in another region even if empirical coefficients are calibrated for a certain station the updated coefficients may vary with time due to climatic changes and variations nouri and homaee 2018 etp projected by all models showed an overall increase under future climate scenarios and the increase was the largest at the end of the 21st century under the rcp8 5 scenario fig 4 fig 5 the increases in tmax tmin and rs all contributed to the upward trend of etp pan et al 2015 scheff and frierson 2014 as shown in table 4 although etp increases under future climate scenarios have been widely reported dong et al 2020 gharbia et al 2018 pan et al 2015 scheff and frierson 2014 tao et al 2015 wang et al 2017b wang et al 2015 large variances and uncertainties were observed in the magnitudes of the increases at the global scale scheff and frierson 2014 adopted the pm fao56 model with climatic data from 13 gcms to project the future etp they found etp generally increased 10 0 to 45 0 by the end of the 21st century also at the global scale pan et al 2015 adopted the dynamic land ecosystem model to project future global terrestrial evapotranspiration under the a2 and b1 emission scenarios they found that compared with the 2000s terrestrial evapotranspiration by the 2090s would increase 14 0 under the a2 scenario and 4 5 under the b1 scenario in the shannon river catchment ireland gharbia et al 2018 adopted the hamon model with climatic data from multi gcms to project future etp and found that etp could increase up to 13 5 by the 2080s compared with etp in 1961 2014 in australia johnson and sharma 2010 used outputs from five gcms to drive the penpan model and projected open body water evaporation in the future they claimed that the average increase in open body water evaporation in 2070 would be approximately 7 under the a2 scenario and 5 under the b1 scenario in our study the rf based etp models generally produced a roughly comparable increase in etp to that of the above mentioned studies ranging from 2 1 to 11 7 under rcp4 5 and from 4 8 to 24 1 under rcp8 5 by the end of 21st century as csiro and bom 2015 indicated there was high confidence in the increase of etp during this time period but only medium confidence was found for the magnitude of the increase the large uncertainty in future etp projections may be due to differences in gcms teng et al 2012 etp models kingston et al 2009 and rcps wilby and harris 2006 our study found that the dominant reason leading to uncertainty in etp projection was attributable to the differences in the rcp scenarios accounting for around 40 of the uncertainty fig 6 this result is likely due to the fact that predicted changes of the major inputs e g tmax tmin and rs for etp models were clearly different under the different rcps fig 3 it is well known that the gcms we used in this study project raw monthly climatic data such as air temperature and solar radiation that include uncertainties and biases that are attributable to differences between gcms and climate variables however we applied an improved statistical downscaling method liu and zuo 2012 that effectively corrected biases in the gcm projected climate variables and matched observed climate whilepreserving the inter annual and intra seasonal variabilities of gcm projections liu et al 2017 this approach effectively minimised the additional uncertainty from the downscaling method while the projected climate change signals were maintained for our analysis of gcm uncertainties in addition we also found that the predictions of both climatic factors fig 3 and etp fig 5 fig 6 figure s3 figure s4 showed wider ranges under rcp8 5 than under rcp4 5 especially for the 2090s this might indicate that gcms behaved more differently from each other under rcp8 5 in the future shen et al 2018 which might also contribute to the dominant role of rcps in uncertainty of etp projection following rcps gcm related and etp model related uncertainty contributed roughly equally to etp uncertainty ranging from 10 to 30 fig 6 similar to our results kingston et al 2009 projected global etp with six alternative etp models driven by data from five gcms they found that etp model related uncertainty was of a similar magnitude or in some cases greater than gcm related uncertainty since etp is an important input to hydrological models the uncertainty in etp projection may also influence hydrological projections thompson et al 2014 thus reducing the confidence in predictions of water availability in the future to deal with the uncertainty in future etp projections we recommend using multiple gcms to drive various etp models under different rcp scenarios so that a relatively reliable projection is produced quantifying the future increase in etp can provide insights into future water availability and agricultural production in nsw for instance increased etp indicates that atmospheric evaporative demand will be higher under future climate scenarios however both our study fig 3e and other studies chiew et al 2009 vaze and teng 2011 suggested that annual rainfall in nsw will not show significant increases in the future with the combined influence of increasing etp and normal or even decreased rainfall there is a high possibility that runoff in nsw would decrease and this region would be drier teng et al 2012 as nicholls 2004 put it rising temperatures and increasing etp even without decreasing rainfall would increase the severity of droughts in australia similarly feng et al 2019a projected changes of drought across the wheat belt of nsw with climatic data from 28 gcms under rcp8 5 they found that decreasing rainfall combined with increasing temperature may lead to an expansion from west to east of the winter spring drought prone areas furthermore we found that the increase in etp at the traditionally arid stations e g tibooburra and wilcannia fig 4 was larger than at the humid stations e g sydney coffs harbour fig 5 which might indicate that the traditionally dry areas might become drier at a faster rate than the humid areas one limitation of this study is that we did not consider the influence of increasing atmospheric co2 on stomatal conductance a higher co2 concentration will result in greater surface resistance rs this may offset the magnitude of the etp increases caused by the warming climate in a recent study yang et al 2019 developed an equation to describe the relationship between rs and atmospheric co2 concentration based on the equation they revised the pm fao56 model to consider the influence of increasing atmospheric co2 their research offered a new perspective to assess the comprehensive impact of climate change on etp and should be considered in future studies 5 conclusions this study developed rf based etp models and assessed their performance against four empirical etp models jh mak hs and ab with the penman calculated etp as a benchmark the rf based models and the four empirical etp models were used to project etp at eight stations across nsw using climatic data from 34 gcms under the rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios study results indicated that rf based models generally outperformed the empirical etp models in estimating historical daily penman etp all of these models projected that etp would increase over time however the increased etp estimates produced by the rf based models better matched results obtained in other studies the ensemble increases of mean etp across eight stations ranged from 33 mm year 1 2 1 2040s to 129 mm year 1 9 2 2090s under rcp4 5 and from 43 mm year 1 2 8 2040s to 248 mm year 1 17 6 2090s under rcp8 5 results of this study suggested that rf based etp models should be used for future etp projections results also indicated that there is a higher possibility of water scarcity in nsw in the future and adaptation measures will be necessary to deal with the effects of potential drought on agricultural production furthermore differences in rcps accounted for around 40 of the uncertainty in future etp projections due to the great disparity in the expected temperature increases among the different emission scenarios the large uncertainty in the projected increases of etp highlights the necessity of adopting multiple model ensemble to project future etp under different rcps so that more reliable projections can be produced for future work other machine learning methods should be tested to project future etp future studies should also consider the influence of increasing atmospheric co2 on etp projections and additional downscaling methods could be used to quantify their contribution to the uncertainty in etp

5674,projecting the likely change of potential evapotranspiration etp under future climate scenarios is crucial for quantifying the impacts of climate change on the hydrologic cycle and aridity conditions however there are different sources of uncertainty in projecting future etp that may arise from global climate models gcms emission scenarios and multiple etp models used in this study we developed three random forest based rf based etp models with solar radiation and air temperature at eight climatic stations in southeastern australia with penman model as the benchmark their performance was firstly compared with four empirical models jensen haise makkink abtew and hargreaves which requires the same meteorological inputs in general the rf based etp models showed better performance in etp estimates across all stations with coefficients of determination r2 ranging from 0 68 to 0 92 root mean square errors rmse ranging from 0 58 mm day 1 to 1 46 mm day 1 and relative mean bias errors rmbe ranging from 16 10 to 9 73 the rf based and empirical models were then used to project future etp for the eight stations based on statistically downscaled daily climatic data from 34 gcms under two different representative concentration pathways rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 all models indicated that etp was likely to increase at the eight stations the ensemble increases of mean etp across eight stations ranged from 33 mm year 1 2 1 2040s to 129 mm year 1 9 2 2090s and from 43 mm year 1 2 8 2040s to 248 mm year 1 17 6 2090s under rcp4 5 and under rcp8 5 respectively in addition we also quantified uncertainties in etp projections originating from etp models gcms rcps and their combined effects using the analysis of variance anova method results showed that rcp related uncertainty contributed the most to projected etp uncertainty around 40 for most stations while gcm related and etp model related uncertainties accounted for roughly equal amounts of projected etp uncertainty 10 30 this study demonstrated the better performance of rf based etp models it is advisable to use multiple etp models driven by various gcms under different rcps to produce reliable projections of future etp keywords potential evapotranspiration empirical etp models random forest uncertainty climate change southeastern australia 1 introduction the hydrological cycle has intensified in the last century and the rate of intensification for the coming century is accelerating due to climate change durack et al 2012 pan et al 2015 this may lead to a global shift in aridity or make dry regions become drier while wet regions become wetter chen et al 2017 thus it is important to investigate the influence of climate change on the water cycle as one of the most important components of hydrological and climatological processes evapotranspiration et accounts for around 70 of precipitation falling on land and consumes more than 50 of the solar energy absorbed by the earth guo et al 2017 pan et al 2015 vicente serrano et al 2014 thus et is a very useful indicator to analyse the changing behaviour of the hydrologic regime wang et al 2017b however et is not easy to measure for instance although lysimeters are frequently used to directly measure et they are sparsely distributed around the world because they are expensive and laborious to manage azhar and perera 2011 therefore et is generally estimated by various empirical models that estimate either potential evapotranspiration etp or reference evapotranspiration et0 almorox et al 2015 etp represents the maximum possible evapotranspiration rate from a well watered vegetative surface donohue et al 2010 mcmahon et al 2016 and is regarded as the optimum measurement of evaporative demand from actual land surfaces under specified metrological conditions zheng et al 2017 in fact etp rather than actual et has been widely used as an important input to various hydrological models thompson et al 2013 and aridity indexes sheffield et al 2012 in general et models can be classified into four categories according to their input requirements i e temperature based models hargreaves et al 1985 radiation based models jensen and haise 1963 makkink 1957 mass transfer based models mahringer 1970 and combination models penman 1948 among them the penman model and the fao56 penman monteith pm fao56 model are two variants of the penman monteith type models they are both physically based models milly and dunne 2016 yang et al 2019 that can accurately estimate et across various climate conditions donohue et al 2010 milly and dunne 2016 therefore they are widely used as benchmarks to assess the performance of other etp et0 models in contrast to the penman model pm fao56 considers the surface conductance of a reference crop and provides estimates of et0 while the penman model provides estimates of etp both of these models require the complete set of climatic data which may limit their use in some regions in the particular case of future et projection downscaled climatic data such as wind speed and relative humidity may not be reliable randall et al 2007 thus limiting the use of penman monteith type models compared with the penman model simplified empirical etp models require fewer climate inputs to offer acceptable estimates almorox et al 2015 these empirical etp models e g temperature based models may be preferable for future etp projection because gcm simulated temperature is considered to have higher confidence than other climatic variables csiro and bom 2015 randall et al 2007 for instance kay and davies 2008 used both the penman monteith model and a temperature based model to estimate etp of britain with climate data from five gcms and eight regional climate models they demonstrated that etp estimated by the temperature based model with temperature from a climate model matched morecs etp a gridded dataset of estimated etp based on observed climatic data with the penman monteith model better than etp estimated by the penman monteith model with climate model data similarly ravazzani et al 2014 adopted a temperature based model and an energy balance based etp model which requires a complete set of climate data to quantify the influence of climate change on water resources in northern italy they found that a simple temperature based etp model is sufficiently accurate for analysing the climate change effects on hydrological regimes in addition to empirical etp models newly emerging machine learning techniques have recently been used to estimate etp feng et al 2018 kisi 2015 ki≈üi 2013 kisi and alizamir 2018 mehdizadeh 2018 tabari et al 2012 wang et al 2017a the major advantage of machine learning techniques is that they are capable of tackling non linear relationships between the dependent and independent variables without requiring knowledge of the internal variables fan et al 2018 mehdizadeh 2018 performance comparisons between machine learning techniques and conventional empirical models for estimating et have been widely reported for instance tabari et al 2012 evaluated the performance of support vector machines svm adaptive neuro fuzzy inference systems anfis multiple linear regression multiple non linear regression four temperature based et0 models and eight radiation based et0 models for estimating et0 compared with the pm fao56 model in a semi arid highland environment in iran they found that svm and anfis performed better than the regression based models and the corresponding conventional et0 models i e models requiring the same climatic inputs in the poyang lake watershed lu et al 2018 adopted three tree based machine learning methods including m5tree random forest rf and gradient boosting decision tree gbdt and four empirical models to estimate pan evaporation from 2001 to 2015 they found machine learning models especially gbdt and rf showed great potential for estimating daily pan evaporation regardless of the input combination in spain shiri et al 2012 assessed the performance of gene expression programming gep anfis hargreaves and priestley taylor for calculating daily et0 compared with the pm fao56 model and found that both gep and anfis performed better than the two conventional models in summary machine learning models generally outperformed conventional empirical models i e for models requiring the same climatic inputs in accurately estimating et however their use in projecting future etp is still rare another widely discussed problem in the estimation of future etp is related to the uncertainty generated by various etp models gcms and emission scenarios bae et al 2011 wilby and harris 2006 xu et al 2014 for instance wang et al 2015 found that the directly downscaled etp values from hadcm3 and etp estimated by pm fao56 and hargreaves models would all increase under future climate scenarios in the hanjiang river basin however the magnitudes of the etp increases varied greatly among these etp models up to 70 mm year 1 other researchers arnell and gosling 2013 kay and davies 2008 also reported that the projected etp under future climate scenarios could be significantly different due to the differences in gcms and etp models indicating the large uncertainty in future etp projections thus it is necessary to quantify the uncertainty originating from various sources in order to evaluate the reliability of etp projections thompson et al 2014 concluded that gcm related uncertainty was about 3 5 times larger than etp model related uncertainty for the projection of river flow in the mekong river basin for the projection of future global etp with various etp models and gcms kingston et al 2009 claimed that etp model related uncertainty was equal to or in some circumstance greater than gcm related uncertainty however to our knowledge few studies have systematically quantified the uncertainties originating from conventional etp models as well as machine learning based models gcms emission scenarios and their combined effects australia is a water scarce and drought vulnerable country howden et al 2014 verdon kidd and kiem 2009 the warming climate may exacerbate the water scarce situation in this region therefore studying the likely change of etp in australia is necessary for the development of proposals and policies for adapting water management to climate change in this study we first proposed a machine learning method to estimate etp in southeastern australia and used multiple etp models driven by statistically downscaled climate data from a large number of gcms to quantify the impacts of climate change on etp the objectives of this study were to 1 assess the performance of machine learning based etp models for estimating daily etp 2 explore the likely change of future etp in the study area based on various etp models and 3 quantify the contributions of different sources of uncertainty including gcms etp models emission scenarios and their combined effects to the uncertainty in future etp projections this research will provide a good reference for researchers to better understand the performance of machine learning based etp models in projecting future etp additionally knowledge of the uncertainty in future etp projections would also help researchers to understand the potential bias in projecting the hydrological cycle and water availability under future climate scenarios 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area new south wales nsw is located in southeast australia fig 1 it accounts for 10 4 of the australian land area 8 1 105 km2 and has a population of more than eight million making nsw the most populous state in australia the production of agricultural crops in nsw is important to the agricultural industry in australia for instance wheat grown in nsw accounts for 28 of the total wheat planted area in australia feng et al 2019b however topography and climatic characteristics in nsw vary greatly from east to west making it vulnerable to climate change in general nsw can be divided into four distinct geographical sections based on their natural features namely the east coast the mountains the central plains and the western plains climatically the east coast and the mountains are characterized by humid or sub humid climates while the central and western plains experience semi arid or arid climates average annual rainfall gradually increases from 50 mm year 1 in the westernmost region to 1500 mm year 1 on the east coast similarly average annual temperature gradually increases from around 10 c in the southeast to greater than 20 c in the northwest climate in nsw is expected to change under the influence of future global warming for instance temperature in nsw is projected to rise by 2 1 c by 2070 while annual rainfall is likely to decrease csiro and bom 2015 vaze et al 2008 furthermore extreme weather events such as heatwaves and droughts may occur more frequently feng et al 2019a which might exacerbate water scarcity in nsw and result in new water management challenges thus it is necessary to project etp changes under future climate scenarios to predict the effects of climate change on water resource management and drought prediction eight stations in nsw fig 1 were selected for examination in this study because they have complete sets of climate data that are required for the penman model to estimate daily etp geographic information etp related climate variables annual rainfall and aridity index of these stations are shown in table 1 2 2 climate data and downscaling method applied historical daily climate data during the research period including maximum temperature tmax minimum temperature tmin maximum and minimum relative humidity rhmax and rhmin respectively rainfall and solar radiation rs were obtained from the scientific information for land owners silo patched point dataset https www longpaddock qld gov au silo datadrill index php in addition wind speed data were obtained from the bureau of meteorology bom http www bom gov au the percentage of missing daily wind speed data was less than 5 for each station to estimate the missing wind speed values we first used years with consecutive daily wind speed to calculate the long term average wind speed for each day of the year then we used the average wind speed for the i th i ranges from 1 to 365 day of the year as the proxy wind speed for that day of the year with a missing value to project etp under future climate scenarios we downscaled 34 gcms table 2 from the coupled model intercomparison project phase 5 cmip5 dataset to extract daily tmax tmin rainfall and rs from 1900 to 2100 based on the statistical downscaling method developed by liu and zuo 2012 statistical downscaling is an effective method to downscale the raw monthly climatic data from gcms at coarse spatial resolutions to a finer spatial and temporal scale firstly the monthly climatic data from gcms were downscaled to specific sites using the inverse distance weighted interpolation method then bias correction was applied to the monthly values of climatic factors for each site thirdly we used a stochastic weather generator to produce daily climatic factors for each site the detailed information about this method has been described by liu and zuo 2012 this study used the downscaled data to project future etp with the chosen empirical and machine learning based etp models under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 climate scenarios for data downscaled from 34 gcms we defined the period from 1990 to 2014 as the baseline period the near future projected period was defined as 2026 to 2050 2040s the medium projected period was from 2051 to 2075 2065s and the far future period was 2076 2100 2090s 2 3 the penman model as mentioned in the introduction the penman model is widely used as a benchmark to assess the performance of other etp models in this study we also assessed the performance of other models against the penman model the mathematical expression of the penman model is shown in eq 1 1 e t p p e n m a n 0 408 Œ¥ Œ¥ Œ≥ r n g Œ≥ Œ¥ Œ≥ 6 43 1 0

almorox et al 2015 most gcms have reliable prediction of air temperature therefore we also adopted commonly used temperature based and radiation based models to compare their performance with random forest based etp models and to project future etp the temperature based model used in this study was the well known hargreaves hs model and the three radiation based models were jensen haise jh makkink mak and abtew ab their mathematical expressions were as follows 6 e t p h s 0 0023 0 408 r a t max t min 0 5 t 17 8 7 e t p j h 0 0102 t 3 r s 8 e t p m a k 0 7 Œ¥ Œ¥ Œ≥ r s Œª 9 e t p a b 0

methods developed by breiman 2001 compared with most well established machine learning methods e g artificial neural networks and svm rf only needs two parameters the number of decision trees ntree and the number of variables mtry moreover rf has a strong predictive power to deal with non linear and hierarchical relationships between the predictors and the response in fact rf has been widely used for classification and regression tasks fan et al 2018 heung et al 2014 wang et al 2018b thus we adopted rf as a representative machine learning technique to estimate etp in this study briefly around 2 3 of the original data were randomly chosen as the bootstrapped dataset to generate numerous decision trees ntree with a random subset of the total variables mtry each step thus a variety of decision trees were generated that formed the forest the remaining original data around 1 3 which were not chosen to build the bootstrapped dataset known as the out of bag dataset were used for validation based on the forest the projector used predicted data and ran those data through all of the decision trees the final prediction was the average of the results of all trees more information about rf can be found in breiman 2001 and a schematic diagram of rf is shown in fig s1 this study adopted the randomforest package in r liaw and wiener 2002 https cran r project org web packages randomforest index html to develop rf based etp models with observed historical climatic data the daily climatic data from 1950 or the starting year of the station shown in table 1 to 2000 were used to train rf based etp models while the data from 2001 to 2014 were used to test these rf based etp models three rf based etp models table 3 were developed namely rf1 based on tmax tmin and rs to compare with jh and mak rf2 based on tmax tmin and extra terrestrial solar radiation ra to compare with hs and rf3 based on tmax and rs to compare with ab we set ntree as 500 to ensure that every input row would be predicted a few times the default value of mtry is generally around 1 3 of the number of input variables p guio blanco et al 2018 because of the small number of input variables in the current study we used mtry values which were somewhat larger than 0 33p the number of predictors in our study was 3 for rf1 and rf2 and 2 for rf3 thus we set mtry as 2 for rf1 and rf2 and 1 for rf3 2 6 model evaluation performance with regards to estimates of etp rates of rf based rf1 rf2 and rf3 and empirical jh mak hs and ab etp models was evaluated against the penman model with the commonly used statistical parameters coefficient of determination r2 root mean square error rmse mm day 1 and relative mean bias error rmbe these parameters were calculated via the following equations

the validated rf based rf1 rf2 and rf3 and the four empirical jh mak hs and ab etp models were used to project future etp with downscaled daily climatic data from 34 gcms under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 climate scenarios daily etp values were then summed to obtain annual etp for each gcm at the eight stations the etp change for a certain future period was the difference between the mean annual etp for that period and the mean annual etp for the baseline period 2 8 contribution analysis of uncertainty in future etp projections the analysis of variance anova technique has been widely used to quantify the contribution of different sources in uncertainty analysis aryal et al 2019 su et al 2017 tao et al 2018 wang et al 2018a this technique is able to partition the total observed variances into different sources thus identifying the contribution of different sources to the total variance compared with other commonly used methods e g recursive models parameter identification and bayesian approaches in uncertainty analysis ashraf vaghefi et al 2019 freni et al 2009 the anova method requires fewer assumptions and considers the interactive contributions of different sources of the uncertainty to the total variance ashraf vaghefi et al 2019 yip et al 2011 thus we used a three way three factors anova to quantify the relative contribution of gcms rcps and etp models to the uncertainty in etp projections a three way anova can be split into seven fractions that include the three main effects and the four interaction effects the total sum of squares sst was calculated as

results 3 1 performance of etp models during the historical period historical etp estimation 2001 2014 fig 2 indicated that rf based etp models generally outperformed the corresponding empirical etp models i e empirical etp models which required the same inputs specifically rf based etp models generally produced greater r2 smaller rmse and smaller absolute rmbe than the corresponding empirical etp models did at nearly all eight stations for example consider the results for the rf1 jh and mak models their r2 values all ranged from 0 80 to 0 90 however the rmse of rf1 ranged from 0 58 mm day 1 to 1 31 mm day 1 generally lower than that of jh from 0 76 mm day 1 to 1 42 mm day 1 and mak from 0 99 mm day 1 to 2 28 mm day 1 moreover etp values calculated by rf based models generally followed the penman model while other empirical models e g mak and hs tended to underestimate etp compare blue regression lines with red 1 1 lines in fig 2 even at stations where nearly all rf based and empirical models underestimated etp such as at cobar and sydney rf based models still performed better showing better consistency with the penman model the better performance of rf based models may be explained by their ability to deal with non linear processes between response variable and predictors in addition rf1 and rf3 showed similar performance at the eight stations indicating that tmin might not be a key factor influencing the accuracy of rf based etp models again these two models performed better than rf2 which might denote that rs instead of ra was a more important factor for estimating etp with rf based etp models 3 2 the change of climatic factors under future climate scenarios consistent increases were observed in tmax fig 3 a and tmin fig 3b irrespective of rcp scenarios and stations specifically the increases of mean tmax ranged from 0 61 c by the 2040s to 2 33 c by the 2090s under rcp4 5 while the range for mean tmin was 0 88 c 2040s to 2 02 c 2090s under rcp8 5 larger increases were found in both tmax and tmin than under rcp4 5 for a certain future period for instance the range of increases of mean tmax and mean tmin under rcp8 5 were 0 79 c 2040s to 4 58 c 2090s and 1 10 c 2040s to 4 39 c 2090s respectively moreover as time increased into the future period the increase in tmax and tmin became larger similar increasing trends were also found in rs independent of stations mean rs fig 3d was projected to increase by 0 08 0 32 mj m 2 day 1 under rcp4 5 and 0 01 0 29 mj m 2 day 1 under rcp8 5 in contrast to the uniform increase in tmax and tmin was the obvious difference found among stations in the direction and magnitude of change of Œ¥t over time fig 3c for instance mean Œ¥t at murrurundi increased by 0 14 0 31 c under rcp4 5 and by 0 12 0 18 c under rcp8 5 whereas it decreased by 0 36 0 61 c under rcp4 5 and by 0 45 1 52 c under rcp8 5 at coffs harbour Œ¥t is related to the degree of cloud cover allen et al 1998 and is a good indicator of solar radiation and relative humidity allen et al 1998 kingston et al 2009 in particular Œ¥t is an important input for the hs model the variance change of Œ¥t may influence the change of etp estimated by the hs model there was no uniform direction in the change of rainfall over time fig 3e the ranges of mean rainfall change were 34 mm year 1 to 9 mm year 1 under rcp4 5 and from 14 mm year 1 to 26 mm year 1 under rcp8 5 3 3 etp and its change under future climate scenarios as expected etp estimated by all models showed obvious increases under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios at all stations except coffs harbour where the hs calculated etp showed a slight change fig 4 fig 5 however both the future etp fig s3 fig s4 provided in supplementary material and the increasing magnitude showed large differences among etp models for each station regardless of rcp scenarios in general rf based models projected higher future etp and larger increases than empirical etp models did for all stations for instance rf1 generally projected the largest increase of mean etp among models for a given future period ranging from 49 mm year 1 3 2 2040s to 164 mm year 1 11 7 2090s under the rcp4 5 scenario and from 64 mm year 1 4 1 2040s to 346 mm year 1 24 1 2090s under the rcp8 5 scenario in contrast mean etp projected by mak generally showed the smallest increase ranging from 27 mm year 1 1 3 2040s to 69 mm year 1 4 9 2090s under rcp4 5 and from 28 mm year 1 1 4 2040s to 113 mm year 1 8 0 2090s under rcp8 5 influenced by the change differences of tmax tmin and rs fig 3a 3b and 3d respectively etp projected by any given model also showed larger increases under the rcp8 5 scenario than under the rcp4 5 scenario for any given future period again etp increases became larger as time into the future period increased the ensemble increases of mean etp across eight stations ranged from 33 mm year 1 2 1 2040s to 129 mm year 1 9 2 2090s under rcp4 5 and from 43 mm year 1 2 8 2040s to 248 mm year 1 17 6 2090s under rcp8 5 3 4 contribution of climatic factors to etp change in order to determine the relationships between the change of etp and changes of meteorological factors multiple linear regression was performed for each station using changes of tmax tmin rs and rainfall as independent variables and changes of etp as the dependent variable our analysis showed that changes in tmax tmin rs and rainfall generally accounted for more than 92 0 of the etp change and the change of rainfall had only a slight influence in etp for most stations table 4 we also found that relationships between the change of tmax tmin and rs and the change of etp could be grouped based on the input requirements of etp models in general compared with tmax and tmin a unit increase of rs led to a larger increase of etp projected by rf1 jh and mak in contrarst the largest etp increases ranging from 64 0 mm year 1 to 116 7 mm year 1 projected by rf2 and hs were caused by a unit increase of tmax while changes in tmin and rs were negatively related to etp changes lastly for rf3 and ab one unit increase in rs and tmax could contribute roughly equally to the change in etp 3 5 contribution of different sources to the uncertainty of etp projections both ranges of future etp and etp differences among models and rcp scenarios indicated the existing uncertainty in future etp projections thus we used anova to quantify the relative contributions of gcms etp models and rcp scenarios to the uncertainty of etp projections fig 6 the rcps accounted for around 40 0 of the uncertainty of etp projections at all stations except the humid stations sydney coffs harbour indicating the dominant role of rcps in the uncertainty of etp projections following rcps the contribution of gcms to uncertainty ranged from 16 7 to 28 8 among the eight stations the etp models contributed less than 16 0 to uncertainty at most stations however at sydney and coffs harbour the contribution of etp models to uncertainty was roughly equal to or even higher than that observed for rcps 4 discussion our study found that rf based models produced etp values that were much closer to penman calculated etp during the historical period indicating that rf based etp models generally outperformed empirical etp models fig 2 fig s2 for the empirical etp models jh calculated etp was close to rf calculated etp during both the historical and future periods whereas the rest of the empirical etp models produced relatively lower etp fig 2 figs s2 s4 though the use of rf based models for projecting future etp is rare their good performance in estimating historical evapotranspiration has been reported by other researchers fan et al 2018 feng et al 2017 for instance feng et al 2017 compared the performance of rf based and generalized regression neural networks grnn based models in estimating daily et0 against the pm fao56 model based on two different input combinations they found that the rf based models with r2 ranging from 0 89 to 0 98 generally outperformed the grnn based models although there is no strong evidence to guarantee which model is more reliable for predicting future etp kay and davies 2008 the use of rf based etp models is still advisable due to the following reasons firstly these models have more flexibility for adding climatic inputs to improve their accuracy fan et al 2018 thus when reliable climatic parameters are available it is more feasible and efficient to train rf based models than to calibrate empirical etp models secondly the testing and training of rf based etp models are more easily accomplished and it is possible to efficiently do cross station validation in contrast one of the most commonly used methods to improve performance of simplified empirical models is to re calibrate the empirical coefficients based on a linear relationship against observed et or penman monteith type models droogers and allen 2002 tabari and talaee 2011 however these coefficients are generally location specific and may result in less accurate performance in another region even if empirical coefficients are calibrated for a certain station the updated coefficients may vary with time due to climatic changes and variations nouri and homaee 2018 etp projected by all models showed an overall increase under future climate scenarios and the increase was the largest at the end of the 21st century under the rcp8 5 scenario fig 4 fig 5 the increases in tmax tmin and rs all contributed to the upward trend of etp pan et al 2015 scheff and frierson 2014 as shown in table 4 although etp increases under future climate scenarios have been widely reported dong et al 2020 gharbia et al 2018 pan et al 2015 scheff and frierson 2014 tao et al 2015 wang et al 2017b wang et al 2015 large variances and uncertainties were observed in the magnitudes of the increases at the global scale scheff and frierson 2014 adopted the pm fao56 model with climatic data from 13 gcms to project the future etp they found etp generally increased 10 0 to 45 0 by the end of the 21st century also at the global scale pan et al 2015 adopted the dynamic land ecosystem model to project future global terrestrial evapotranspiration under the a2 and b1 emission scenarios they found that compared with the 2000s terrestrial evapotranspiration by the 2090s would increase 14 0 under the a2 scenario and 4 5 under the b1 scenario in the shannon river catchment ireland gharbia et al 2018 adopted the hamon model with climatic data from multi gcms to project future etp and found that etp could increase up to 13 5 by the 2080s compared with etp in 1961 2014 in australia johnson and sharma 2010 used outputs from five gcms to drive the penpan model and projected open body water evaporation in the future they claimed that the average increase in open body water evaporation in 2070 would be approximately 7 under the a2 scenario and 5 under the b1 scenario in our study the rf based etp models generally produced a roughly comparable increase in etp to that of the above mentioned studies ranging from 2 1 to 11 7 under rcp4 5 and from 4 8 to 24 1 under rcp8 5 by the end of 21st century as csiro and bom 2015 indicated there was high confidence in the increase of etp during this time period but only medium confidence was found for the magnitude of the increase the large uncertainty in future etp projections may be due to differences in gcms teng et al 2012 etp models kingston et al 2009 and rcps wilby and harris 2006 our study found that the dominant reason leading to uncertainty in etp projection was attributable to the differences in the rcp scenarios accounting for around 40 of the uncertainty fig 6 this result is likely due to the fact that predicted changes of the major inputs e g tmax tmin and rs for etp models were clearly different under the different rcps fig 3 it is well known that the gcms we used in this study project raw monthly climatic data such as air temperature and solar radiation that include uncertainties and biases that are attributable to differences between gcms and climate variables however we applied an improved statistical downscaling method liu and zuo 2012 that effectively corrected biases in the gcm projected climate variables and matched observed climate whilepreserving the inter annual and intra seasonal variabilities of gcm projections liu et al 2017 this approach effectively minimised the additional uncertainty from the downscaling method while the projected climate change signals were maintained for our analysis of gcm uncertainties in addition we also found that the predictions of both climatic factors fig 3 and etp fig 5 fig 6 figure s3 figure s4 showed wider ranges under rcp8 5 than under rcp4 5 especially for the 2090s this might indicate that gcms behaved more differently from each other under rcp8 5 in the future shen et al 2018 which might also contribute to the dominant role of rcps in uncertainty of etp projection following rcps gcm related and etp model related uncertainty contributed roughly equally to etp uncertainty ranging from 10 to 30 fig 6 similar to our results kingston et al 2009 projected global etp with six alternative etp models driven by data from five gcms they found that etp model related uncertainty was of a similar magnitude or in some cases greater than gcm related uncertainty since etp is an important input to hydrological models the uncertainty in etp projection may also influence hydrological projections thompson et al 2014 thus reducing the confidence in predictions of water availability in the future to deal with the uncertainty in future etp projections we recommend using multiple gcms to drive various etp models under different rcp scenarios so that a relatively reliable projection is produced quantifying the future increase in etp can provide insights into future water availability and agricultural production in nsw for instance increased etp indicates that atmospheric evaporative demand will be higher under future climate scenarios however both our study fig 3e and other studies chiew et al 2009 vaze and teng 2011 suggested that annual rainfall in nsw will not show significant increases in the future with the combined influence of increasing etp and normal or even decreased rainfall there is a high possibility that runoff in nsw would decrease and this region would be drier teng et al 2012 as nicholls 2004 put it rising temperatures and increasing etp even without decreasing rainfall would increase the severity of droughts in australia similarly feng et al 2019a projected changes of drought across the wheat belt of nsw with climatic data from 28 gcms under rcp8 5 they found that decreasing rainfall combined with increasing temperature may lead to an expansion from west to east of the winter spring drought prone areas furthermore we found that the increase in etp at the traditionally arid stations e g tibooburra and wilcannia fig 4 was larger than at the humid stations e g sydney coffs harbour fig 5 which might indicate that the traditionally dry areas might become drier at a faster rate than the humid areas one limitation of this study is that we did not consider the influence of increasing atmospheric co2 on stomatal conductance a higher co2 concentration will result in greater surface resistance rs this may offset the magnitude of the etp increases caused by the warming climate in a recent study yang et al 2019 developed an equation to describe the relationship between rs and atmospheric co2 concentration based on the equation they revised the pm fao56 model to consider the influence of increasing atmospheric co2 their research offered a new perspective to assess the comprehensive impact of climate change on etp and should be considered in future studies 5 conclusions this study developed rf based etp models and assessed their performance against four empirical etp models jh mak hs and ab with the penman calculated etp as a benchmark the rf based models and the four empirical etp models were used to project etp at eight stations across nsw using climatic data from 34 gcms under the rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios study results indicated that rf based models generally outperformed the empirical etp models in estimating historical daily penman etp all of these models projected that etp would increase over time however the increased etp estimates produced by the rf based models better matched results obtained in other studies the ensemble increases of mean etp across eight stations ranged from 33 mm year 1 2 1 2040s to 129 mm year 1 9 2 2090s under rcp4 5 and from 43 mm year 1 2 8 2040s to 248 mm year 1 17 6 2090s under rcp8 5 results of this study suggested that rf based etp models should be used for future etp projections results also indicated that there is a higher possibility of water scarcity in nsw in the future and adaptation measures will be necessary to deal with the effects of potential drought on agricultural production furthermore differences in rcps accounted for around 40 of the uncertainty in future etp projections due to the great disparity in the expected temperature increases among the different emission scenarios the large uncertainty in the projected increases of etp highlights the necessity of adopting multiple model ensemble to project future etp under different rcps so that more reliable projections can be produced for future work other machine learning methods should be tested to project future etp future studies should also consider the influence of increasing atmospheric co2 on etp projections and additional downscaling methods could be used to quantify their contribution to the uncertainty in etp
