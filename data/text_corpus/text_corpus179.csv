895,this paper describes a modeling approach proposed to simulate the impact of local scale spatially targeted n mitigation measures for the baltic sea basin spatially targeted n regulations aim at exploiting the considerable spatial differences in the natural n reduction taking place in groundwater and surface water while such measures can be simulated using local scale physically based catchment models use of such detailed models for the 1 8 million km2 baltic sea basin is not feasible due to constraints on input data and computing power large scale models that are able to simulate the baltic sea basin on the other hand do not have adequate spatial resolution to simulate some of the field scale measures our methodology combines knowledge and results from two local scale physically based mike she catchment models the large scale and more conceptual e hype model and auxiliary data in order to enable e hype to simulate how spatially targeted regulation of agricultural practices may affect n loads to the baltic sea we conclude that the use of e hype with this upscaling methodology enables the simulation of the impact on n loads of applying a spatially targeted regulation at the baltic sea basin scale to the correct order of magnitude the e hype model together with the upscaling methodology therefore provides a sound basis for large scale policy analysis however we do not expect it to be sufficiently accurate to be useful for the detailed design of local scale measures graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords nitrate reduction groundwater modeling spatially targeted regulation upscaling 1 introduction large nutrient loads have resulted in severe environmental problems in the baltic sea during the past decades gustafsson et al 2012 diffuse losses of nutrients contribute about two thirds of the total nitrogen n and phosphorus p loads delivered to the sea with the majority of these originating from agricultural sources helcom 2011 in order to address the eutrophication problem the baltic sea action plan bsap was adopted in 2007 setting country specific abatement targets for n and p loads to achieve a good status in the baltic sea backer et al 2010 many abatement actions have already been implemented in the baltic sea countries but the targets are still not met and more actions are required backer et al 2010 this paper addresses simulation of the impacts of a novel regulation methodology in decreasing the total n loads to the sea the loss of n from agriculture occurs mainly as leaching of excess nitrate from the root zone along the flow path from the root zone via groundwater and surface water to the catchment outlet nitrate can be naturally transformed and thereby removed by redox processes nitrate reduction is a microbial process occurring under anoxic conditions in the presence of an electron donor organic matter pyrite and fe ii and occurs both in soils groundwater and surface waters appelo and postma 2005 this removal of nitrogen by redox reactions is in this study referred to as n reduction and we mainly focus on the n reduction occurring below the root zone i e in groundwater and surface waters due to geological heterogeneity n reduction varies significantly not only at the baltic sea basin scale wulff et al 2014 højberg et al 2017 but also at the local scale within small catchments hansen et al 2014b present agricultural regulations to decrease the n loss from the root zone specify the same abatement requirements for all areas without considering local variations in n reductions in the groundwater or surface water this is obviously not very cost effective jacobsen and hansen 2016 and it has led to the idea of implementing a spatially targeted regulation focussing on decreasing n loss from areas with low natural n reduction instead of a uniform regulation where all areas have to decrease by the same amount regardless of the natural reduction capacity in the area hansen et al 2017 a spatially targeted regulation can consist of a number of different regulatory measures implemented at or in connection to areas with a low natural n reduction these regulatory measures can either be implemented at the source by decreasing n leaching from the root zone on areas with low n reduction e g by changing the crop or the management practice on the field or they can be implemented where water from areas with low n reduction is discharging into surface waters e g in the form of constructed wetlands that can remove some of the discharging nitrogen langergraber et al 2011 the effectiveness of regulatory measures for decreasing n loads can be assessed using hydrological and nutrient flux models vagstad et al 2009 to exploit the local field and farm scale variability in n reduction however requires simulations at scales resolving the field and farm scale variability this is extremely data demanding and requires detailed process descriptions within the hydrological models hansen et al 2014b karlsson et al 2016 modeling of nitrate processes at large scales such as the baltic sea basin has been carried out by arheimer et al 2012 and wulff et al 2014 to assess the impacts of international regulations that are applied uniformly across larger regions or even the entire basin these large scale models operate with computational units of several hundred km2 making it impossible to explicitly simulate the impacts of local scale spatially targeted measures because they cannot spatially resolve the measures and often have inadequate process descriptions in particular for describing the spatial variability in groundwater processes therefore there is a need to combine the knowledge and results achieved by local and large scale modeling in an upscaling procedure upscaling can be done in a variety of ways bloschl and sivapalan 1995 refsgaard et al 1999 vereecken et al 2007 the most common upscaling approach in distributed hydrological modeling is the effective parameter approach which assumes that process equations and system data originating from smaller scales are applicable at a larger scale and that effective parameters exist that can reproduce the mean behavior of the system observed at the larger scale this assumption is often justifiable refsgaard 1997 henriksen et al 2003 while it in some cases has to be rejected beven 1995 another approach used in distributed models is the distribution function approach where the statistical distributions but not the geo referenced locations of system data and parameters are represented in the model andersen et al 2001 herbst and diekkruger 2002 the use of hydrological response units in semi distributed models like hype arheimer et al 2012 stromqvist et al 2012 can be seen as a kind of statistical distribution function approach although the continuous properties here are replaced by categorical data such as soil type and land use a fundamentally different upscaling approach is the dynamic upscaling approach where model results from a model with a finer resolution of the computational units are utilized somehow in a large scale model with coarser resolution there are only a few examples of this upscaling approach bronstert et al 2007 hansen et al 2008 in the study by bronstert et al 2007 a hbv model was set up for the rhine basin for three meso scale catchments within the rhine basin small scale models were set up using the distributed physically based model wasim eth and simulated stream discharge from these models was used in the calibration of the large scale hbv model the effect of land use changes was simulated with the small scale models and these results were then used as input to the hbv model in order to simulate land use changes for the entire rhine basin to be able to assess the potential impacts of implementing a spatially targeted regulation of agricultural practices on the n loads to the baltic sea it will be necessary to use a large scale model for the entire baltic sea basin and to develop an upscaling methodology to account for the impacts that cannot be handled explicitly in existing large scale models the objectives of the present study were i to introduce a methodology to upscale knowledge from a local scale model to a large scale model simulating water and n flows for the entire baltic sea basin with a focus on n reduction in groundwater and ii to test it on predicting impacts of a spatially targeted regulation to decrease the n load to the sea for two study areas we use the dynamic upscaling approach in a manner similar to bronstert et al 2007 extending this approach from only considering river flow to also including n fluxes and n reduction in this paper we thus report the development and testing of the upscaling approach whereas the full application on the entire baltic sea basin will be reported in a second paper 2 methodology 2 1 local study areas two danish catchments were used to develop the upscaling methodology the 85 km2 norsminde catchment upstream part of the 101 km2 norsminde fjord catchment is located on the east coast of jutland and the 486 km2 odense catchment upstream of kratholm is located on the island of funen fig 1 both catchments discharge into fjords which are ecologically sensitive with respect to nitrogen and a significant decrease of the n loads to the fjords is required to obtain good ecological status danish nature agency 2016 the land use in both catchments is dominated by intensive agriculture a part of the agricultural area in the catchments is used for permanent grass the agricultural area in rotation from now on called arable land suitable for a spatially targeted regulation of agricultural practices makes up 62 of the catchment area in norsminde and 61 in odense the climate in the norsminde and odense catchments is temperate and humid the catchments are located in glacial landscapes from the weichsel glaciation where the upper geology is dominated by clayey till with smaller units of glacial melt water sand and post glacial freshwater peat fig 1a and d due to the predominance of clay till soils the two catchments are to a large extent tile drained in both catchments observations of daily discharge are available from stream monitoring stations fig 1a and d observations of total n concentrations are available at the downstream monitoring station in norsminde for the period 2000 2007 with 14 48 samples per year in odense observations of total n concentrations are available at the downstream station with 114 183 samples per year in the period 2000 2009 and 16 17 samples per year from 2010 and until present 2 2 models 2 2 1 local scale models mike she nles the local scale models used in this study were the mike she catchment model for simulating flow and transport and the agricultural field scale model nles for simulating n leaching from the root zone as a n leaching input for mike she the local scale models were based on existing model applications from different previous studies which is also why the models differ in e g model discretization the models are described in the following but more detailed information can be found in the original papers referred to below n leaching from root zone nles n leaching from the root zone in agricultural areas was calculated using the nles model kristensen et al 2003 2008 nles is an empirical input output model based on a number of explanatory variables that have been estimated through calibration against observed n leaching data nles calculates a yearly n leaching based on input data on the crop rotations inputs of fertilizer and manure n fixation percolation soil type and the content of organic matter and clay in the soil the nles calculations were done at a farm scale level as part of the danish national nitrogen model højberg et al 2015 input data to nles on crop rotations were available from the year 2000 onwards at field block cluster of fields or field level and input data on yearly fertilizer and manure use and catch crop area fast growing crops sown between main crops in order to lower n leaching were available on farm level from danish national agricultural databases data originates from the general agricultural register and the danish agrifish agency soil data used in nles were from a soil database containing standard values for all typical danish soils the estimated yearly n leaching from nles was disaggregated to daily values using results from the physically based root zone model daisy abrahamsen and hansen 2000 set up for typical crop rotations and soil types in the areas the n leaching results at field level were afterwards aggregated to a grid corresponding to the grid size of the hydrological model i e 100 m grid in norsminde and 200 m grid in odense for later implementation in the mike she models the average yearly n leaching from root zone for both catchments can be seen in fig 1b and e flow and transport mike she mike she is a distributed physically based hydrological model code including process descriptions for evapotranspiration snowmelt 2d overland flow 1d unsaturated flow 3d saturated flow macropore flow tile drainage and 1d river flow the computational units are georeferenced grid cells and all model parameters can vary for each grid cell transport can be simulated as particle tracking or advection dispersion havnø et al 1995 refsgaard and storm 1995 norsminde the mike she model for norsminde was based on a model application from he et al 2015 and hansen et al 2014b the model has a grid size of 100 m x 100 m with a vertical division of the saturated zone into 24 computational layers of varying thickness the climate input was obtained from the danish meteorological institute s dmi 10 km grid for daily precipitation and 20 km grid for reference evapotranspiration and air temperature he et al 2015 the flow model was set up as a transient model for the period 1995 2007 and was calibrated using the parameter estimator pest doherty 2005 against daily discharge data from the three monitoring stations fig 1a and 690 hydraulic head measurements in 108 wells for the period 2000 2003 he et al 2015 the n transport in mike she was simulated using particle tracking the estimated n leaching from nles was applied as a daily input to mike she for the period 2000 2007 where a n particle was released for each 2 kg of n added to a model grid cell the n particles were released on the water table and tracked until they reached a sink stream drain well or fjord ocean a spatially distributed redox interface transition from oxic to anoxic conditions was implemented in the model according to the method developed by hansen et al 2014a when an n particle crossed the redox interface it was assumed to be completely reduced hansen et al 2014b point source data were added to the simulated n load from groundwater to the stream outside the mike she framework the same was done with the n reduction in the stream system the amount of n reduction in the stream was calculated simplistically on a subcatchment level four subcatchments within norsminde and defined as a function of the stream length odense the mike she model for odense was based on the model application by karlsson et al 2015 the model has a grid size of 200 m x 200 m with the saturated zone divided into seven computational layers the climate input in the odense model was also obtained from the dmi climate grid karlsson et al 2015 the flow model was setup as a transient model running from 1990 2010 it was calibrated with the global optimization algorithm population simplex evolution method pse using the autocal tool in mike she the calibration was done for the period 2004 2007 using daily discharge data from the four monitoring stations fig 1d and hydraulic head data from 455 wells karlsson et al 2015 the n transport in the odense model was similar to the norsminde model simulated using particle tracking and a spatially distributed redox interface the n leaching input to mike she was changed from the original model setup to the nles estimated daily n leaching in the current odense model it was assumed that all n reduction within the catchment is occurring in groundwater and that n reduction in the stream system is negligible 2 2 2 large scale model e hype the e hype model donnelly et al 2016 is a large scale pan european application of the hype model code lindstrom et al 2010 the hype model is a semi distributed model mixing conceptual and physical descriptions for different hydrological and nutrient processes calculations are made on a daily time step in coupled subbasins the subbasins are divided into hydrological response units hrus a hru is a calculation unit with a unique land use and soil type the hrus can be divided in up to three soil layers that can have different thicknesses model parameters are either the same for the whole model domain or are related to soil type or land cover depending on the process they represent some of the processes included in hype are evapotranspiration snowmelt surface runoff surface erosion macro pore flow tile drainage groundwater outflow from each soil layer and routing of water through the river network rather than coupling with a n leaching model hype simulates the continuous transformation of nutrients n and p from the surface via the soil and in surface waters processes simulated include plant uptake turnover mineralisation nitrate reduction denitrification and erosion two applications of the hype model were used in the study to test the upscaling procedure both the norsminde and odense catchments were extracted from the existing pan european e hype v3 0 model hundecha et al 2016 which has since been extended to simulate water quality using the same methods used in a previous version of e hype with water quality donnelly et al 2013 the model inputs come from continental and global scale databases for example precipitation and temperature are from the 0 5 wfdei database weedon et al 2014 to give an idea of scale the norsminde catchment consists of one subbasin in the e hype model and the odense catchment consists of two subbasins 2 2 3 comparison of model concepts the concepts for simulating n processes in the root zone n reduction in groundwater and transport pathways are different between the two model frameworks mike she nles and hype in the local models nles accounts for n reduction in the root zone while mike she calculates n reduction in groundwater by introducing a redox interface somewhere in the saturated zone above which nitrate is conservative and below which nitrate is reduced instantly the hype model assumes that n reduction can take place in all three soil layers as a function of a decay rate parameter for n reduction denitrlu the pool of inorganic n the concentration of inorganic n soil moisture content and temperature furthermore when the upper layers become saturated inorganic n can also leach directly from the upper soil layers to streams fig 2 shows conceptual sketches of the fluxes of n loads from source to catchment outlet in the two models mike she has two n fluxes to the stream system via groundwater flow and via tile drain flow saturated flow in mike she is simulated in 3d and n can be transported to the stream system via both shallow and deep groundwater flow paths over the entire depth of the saturated zone the tile drains are located at 1 m depth at the bottom of the root zone and will be active when the water table is above the drain level n transport is not simulated via surface runoff when applying particle tracking in mike she because particle tracking is restricted to the saturated zone however since surface runoff is of little importance in the two catchments this will have negligible effect on the simulated n load to the stream the hype model includes three n fluxes out of the upper two layers covering the root zone 1 n leaching to the deeper layer three that constitutes the groundwater zone 2 a horizontal flux directly to the stream system and 3 tile drain flow to the stream system the last two n fluxes are only active when the water table rises into the root zone making the bottom of the root zone saturated from the groundwater zone there is one n flux via groundwater flow to the stream system hype also includes a possible n flux to the stream with surface runoff either due to saturation excess or infiltration excess since this flux is negligible in our two case studies it is not included in the following equations in order to compare n fluxes and n reduction in groundwater between the two model frameworks we have defined the following equations eqs 1 3 the n load from the root zone was defined as follows for the two models with mike she terms subscript m on the left hand side and hype terms subscript h on the right hand side and where notation is defined in fig 2 1 l m leach l h leach l h ul l h td the n load to the stream system was defined by 2 l m gw l m td l h gw l h ul l h td finally the fraction of the total n leaching from the root zone that is reduced in the groundwater gw was defined by 3 gw l m leach l m gw l m td l m leach l h leach l h ul l h td l h gw l h ul l h td l h leach l h ul l h td l h leach l h gw l h leach l h ul l h td 2 3 upscaling approach in order to enable the e hype model to simulate the impacts of spatially targeted regulation on the n load to the baltic sea we need a methodology to modify the current e hype model setup to account for this the modification needs to be based on information from local scale making it essential to apply an upscaling procedure the effective parameter approach and the distribution function approach are not directly applicable for our purpose because we want to be able to simulate the impact of spatial differences within one computational unit of the large scale model to do this with e hype requires that parameter values in e hype are changed to reflect the impact of the spatially targeted regulation therefore we have adopted the dynamic upscaling approach in a manner similar to bronstert et al 2007 where the basic idea is that e hype through our two case studies norsminde and odense is learning by simulation results from the local scale mike she models or in other words that we learn from mike she simulations how to parameterise e hype the upscaling is done in three steps 1 baseflow fraction 2 n leaching and n reduction in groundwater and 3 impact of spatially targeted regulation we propose that e hype needs to have a reasonably accurate description of the split between baseflow and near surface flow and between n reduction in groundwater and in surface water to enable it to accurately simulate the impact of a spatially targeted regulation to do this steps 1 and 2 are used to check consistency and if necessary recalibrate e hype in order to make this possible for the entire baltic sea basin the consistency check recalibration must be done against data sources that are available for the entire basin step 3 is then to use e hype to simulate the impact of a spatially targeted regulation using some upscaling relationships the upscaling methodology is illustrated in fig 3 and will be described in more details in the following sections 2 3 1 step 1 baseflow fraction the first step in the methodology is to check the consistency of the split between shallow and deep flow in the e hype model this is done by checking and if needed calibrating the baseflow fraction of the simulated discharge in e hype against the baseflow fraction of the observed hydrograph the baseflow fraction is estimated by applying the baseflow filter bflow arnold et al 1995 to observed and simulated hydrographs bflow uses three different passes where the hydrograph is separated in several steps we will use pass 3 giving the lowest baseflow fraction the baseflow fraction bf is calculated as the long term total baseflow divided by the total discharge the baseflow fraction is used as a soft criterion in the calibration so that the calibration is deemed acceptable if the mean value of baseflow from e hype is within 20 of the observed baseflow fraction 2 3 2 step 2 n leaching and n reduction in groundwater after the streamflow has been checked recalibrated the next step is to calibrate the n reduction in groundwater in e hype during the development of the upscaling methodology we found it necessary to also calibrate the n leaching in e hype together with the groundwater n reduction the parameters that are calibrated in this step are a time constant for nitrate reduction d 1 a parameter for decay of humus to n d 1 a parameter for mineralisation of n to inorganic n d 1 and a parameter controlling the crop uptake of n constraining the n leaching in e hype requires a best possible estimate of n leaching simulated values will be used as n leaching observations are not systematically available at the baltic sea basin scale we use a 10 km grid scale map produced by andersen et al 2016 fig 7 p 14 for denmark we use n leaching based on the nles model on a 500 m grid scale produced for use in the danish national n model højberg et al 2015 for constraining the groundwater n reduction in e hype we utilise a new map with estimates on the groundwater n reduction for the baltic sea basin produced by højberg et al 2017 2 3 3 step 3 impact of spatially targeted regulation the final step in the upscaling methodology is to apply upscaling relationships that adjust some of the e hype n reduction parameters to allow e hype to simulate the impact of spatially targeted regulation of agricultural practices the upscaling relationships to do this were developed in this study based on the mike she local scale models first the local scale models for norsminde and odense were applied to simulate and assess the impact of applying spatially targeted regulation at the 100 200 m scale we then developed relationships to transfer the results gained from the local scale impact modeling for norsminde and odense to the rest of the baltic sea basin to estimate the expected impact in each subbasin we assumed that the decay rate parameter for n reduction denitrlu in e hype can be modified to obtain the expected impact i e changes in the n reduction rate are used as a proxy for obtaining the changes resulting from applying a targeted regulation this was developed into generic relationships that use information readily available in e hype and hence are transferable to all subbasins in the baltic sea basin the upscaling relations will be presented in the results section section 3 2 2 4 impact scenario of spatially targeted regulation in order to assess the potential impact of applying a spatially targeted regulation an impact scenario was defined and run for norsminde and odense catchments using the local scale models it is the results from these impact scenarios that were upscaled to the e hype model in the impact scenarios the n leaching rates in the two catchments were redistributed so that the largest n leaching rate was relocated to the area with the largest n reduction and the smallest n leaching rate to the area with lowest n reduction in this way we simulate the effects of moving around the present land use and agricultural practice in the catchments without having to change it a further explanation of this scenario and a discussion of its limitations are provided in hansen et al 2017 3 results in this section we show first the results from the impact scenario for norsminde and odense using the local scale models section 3 1 based on these impact results the upscaling relationships used in step 3 of the upscaling approach were developed section 3 2 finally after developing the upscaling relationships the upscaling approach was tested on the two study areas norsminde and odense section 3 3 3 1 impact of a spatially targeted regulation in norsminde and odense the results of the impact scenarios run at local scale for norsminde and odense are seen in fig 4 in both catchments the spatially targeted regulation where high n leaching rates are redistributed to areas with high n reduction and vice versa results in a decrease of the total n load out of the catchments since the present n leaching is just spatially redistributed i e the total n input is unchanged for the catchments the decrease in catchment n load is caused by an increase in n reduction in the groundwater in norsminde the groundwater n reduction percentage gw is increased by 8 and in odense by 15 fig 4 3 2 developing upscaling relationships for application at the baltic sea basin scale large spatial variations in hydrogeological and landscape elements as well as farming structures and crop rotations within a catchment will lead to large heterogeneity in n reduction and hence to a large potential for achieving decreased n load by spatial targeting of measures thus catchments with a large spread in the gw locally within the catchment will have a larger potential gain than catchments with a small or no spread in gw jacobsen and hansen 2016 as data on the local scale ha spread in gw do not exist outside the norsminde and odense catchments we had to identify a proxy for use at the baltic sea basin our analyses showed that the potential gain for a catchment can also be related to the fraction of arable land within a catchment i e the actual area where spatially targeted regulation can be applied the justification for this is that the larger the fraction of the catchment where targeted regulation can be applied and where the n reduction in groundwater is optimized the larger will the gw for the entire catchment be since information about the fraction of arable land per subbasin is available in e hype this relationship can be utilized in the upscaling 3 2 1 assessing the impact based on arable land fraction to estimate a relationship between the impact of spatially targeting regulation and arable land we ran the impact scenario described in section 2 4 for both norsminde and odense using different maps for arable areas and thus varying areas available for a spatially targeted regulation these maps of arable land were based on the original map for the two catchments and a number of scenarios were then made by randomly adding or removing arable land to obtain fractions of arable land between 0 no areas in rotation spatially targeting cannot be done on any areas and 100 all areas in the catchment can be used for spatially targeting this analysis resulted in a relationship between impact and proportion arable land fig 5 for norsminde and odense catchments we then fitted the following 2nd order polynomial function to the data points in fig 5 r 2 0 94 4 δ gw 0 26 a 2 0 07 a where gw is the increase in groundwater n reduction percentage gw and a is the fraction of arable land within the catchment 3 2 2 changing the decay rate denitrlu3 in e hype in order to make e hype simulate the increase in groundwater n reduction gw when a spatially targeted regulation is applied the decay rate parameter for n reduction denitrlu must be increased in the official hype model code there is only one decay rate covering all three soil layers simulated this means that when the decay rate is changed it will affect both the n reduction in the root zone hence it will affect the n leaching and in the groundwater zone in order to simulate the impact of spatially targeted regulation this needs to be two separate processes and the hype model code was therefore modified and used to run the e hype model so that the decay rate for n reduction in the groundwater zone in layer 3 denitrlu3 can be changed independently of the root zone using eq 4 results in a different gw increase for all 7145 subbasins in the baltic sea basin to simulate these different increases in gw using e hype require a different increase in denitrlu3 for each of the subbasins as it is impractical to calibrate the increase in denitrlu3 for all of them we propose a method to estimate the increase in denitrlu3 needed in each individual e hype subbasin this was done by studying how changes in the denitrlu3 parameter in e hype affect the simulated change in gw for this analysis we chose 10 subbasins spread across the baltic sea basin norsminde and odense in denmark kocinka and a small catchment near gdansk in poland parnu in estonia pregolya in poland kaliningrad oblast russia and tullstorp and a small catchment south of linköping in sweden for linköping parnu and pregolya consisting of several subbasins in e hype the most downstream subbasin was chosen for odense we used all the 3 subbasins covering the odense fjord basin therefore the names odense 1 2 and 3 in the following for these 10 subbasins we analysed the change in gw due to different changes in the decay rate denitrlu3 in layer 3 fig 6 points while the relationship between change in denitrlu3 and change in groundwater n reduction was found to vary considerably between the different catchments each of the catchments followed a clear relationship nitrate reduction in hype is not only dependent on the decay rate denitrlu3 but also on soil moisture soil water temperature and nutrient levels within the soil lindstrom et al 2010 to estimate how these factors affect the change in n reduction with changes in denitrlu3 we first fitted individual logarithmic functions for each of the 10 catchments all with r 2 0 96 5 δ gw a ln δ denitrlu 3 b where gw is the increase in gw and denitrlu3 is change in decay rate denitrlu3 the next step was to relate the a and b coefficients to some subbasin variables to describe how a and b vary between the 10 catchments in this analysis four readily available catchment variables affecting nitrate reduction were included fraction of arable land soil moisture in layer 3 soil water temperature in layer 3 and average n leaching to layer 3 a multiple linear regression analysis was performed separately for coefficients a and b four different regression models were set up to test the effect of including from four to one of the variables the four variable models were constructed first and then between each model the variable with the highest p value i e least statistical significance was excluded the four three and two variable regression models were found to give almost the same curve describing the relationship between denitrlu3 and gw for the 10 subbasins it was therefore chosen to use the two variable model which relates the parameters of the curve to average n leaching to layer 3 n leach and soil moisture in layer 3 soim 6 a 0 039 3 26 1 0 5 soim 0 0022 n leach 7 b 0 099 7 52 1 0 5 soim 0 0043 n leach when putting these equations for a and b back into the logarithmic function eq 5 we got the following expression to estimate the logarithmic model describing the relationship between denitrlu3 and gw for a subbasin 8 δ gw 0 039 3 26 1 0 5 soim 0 0022 n leach ln δ denitrlu 3 0 099 7 52 1 0 5 soim 0

rmse 3 1 4 5 when applying the upscaling it is the denitrlu3 we want to estimate based on the gw estimated using eq 4 we therefore have to re arrange eq 8 to the following upscaling relationship 9 δ

baseflow fraction for e hype are shown in table 1 for norsminde the local scale mike she model is seen to have a baseflow fraction very close to the observed hydrograph while the e hype model has a higher baseflow fraction for odense the baseflow fractions for both mike she and e hype are very close to the observed in all cases the agreements are within the 20 acceptance interval of the observed baseflow fraction and e hype was therefore not recalibrated for flow the simulated discharge at the most downstream station in norsminde is seen in fig 7 a for both the mike she model and e hype model 3 3 2 step 2 n leaching and n reduction in groundwater table 2 shows the mass balance for norsminde for the local scale mike she model the initial e hype and the recalibrated e hype model as well as the target values the target value for n leaching is 38 kg n ha yr and for groundwater n reduction 55 the n leaching and groundwater n reduction in the mike she nles model is seen to be very similar to the target values the initial e hype model overestimates both target values with a n leaching of 55 8 kg n ha yr and a groundwater n reduction percentage of 63 the e hype model was therefore recalibrated resulting in a n leaching of 31 3 kg n ha yr and a groundwater n reduction percentage of 52 for the recalibrated e hype model fig 7b shows the simulated n load at the downstream monitoring station in norsminde for the mike she model and the e hype model the mike she model simulates a n load rather close to the observed the initial e hype model greatly overestimates the n load but after the recalibration the e hype simulated n load is significantly improved for odense the simulated values as well as the target values for calibrating the n reduction in groundwater and the n leaching are seen in table 3 the n leaching in the mike she nles model is seen to be similar to the target value but for groundwater n reduction the mike she nles model is very different from the target value because the model assumes that all n reduction in the catchment occurs in groundwater the initial e hype model has a n leaching of 59 7 kg n ha yr and a groundwater n reduction percentage of 68 and thereby overestimates both target values the e hype model for odense was therefore recalibrated which resulted in a n leaching of 41 8 kg n ha yr and a groundwater reduction of 45 the simulated n load at the most downstream monitoring station is 17 1 kg n ha yr in the recalibrated e hype model this is close to the observed n load at the station of 16 7 kg n ha yr 3 3 3 step 3 simulating impacts of spatially targeted regulation with e hype the increase in groundwater reduction gw due to a spatially targeted regulation was first estimated for norsminde and odense using eq 4 and the arable land fraction in e hype table 4 the estimated gw for norsminde was 22 and for odense 23 then using eq 9 the required change in decay rate denitrlu3 to increase the groundwater n reduction was estimated to be an increase of 137 in norsminde and 167 in odense for odense the area weighted average of the catchment variables for the 2 subbasins odense 1 and 2 covering the downstream monitoring station were used for the estimation of gw and denitrlu3 the estimated denitrlu3 values were applied to the decay rate in model layer 3 for the two catchments to run the impact scenario the resulting mass balances for the impact scenario simulated by e hype for norsminde and odense are seen in the last columns of tables 2 and 3 for norsminde the groundwater n reduction increased from 52 to 63 which is an increase of 22 and for odense the groundwater n reduction increased from 45 to 59 which is an increase of 30 table 4 the e hype simulated impact of a spatially targeted regulation is plotted against the local scale model simulated impact in fig 5 the e hype simulated impact is seen to be larger than the local scale model simulated impact for both norsminde and odense the main reason for this is that the arable land fraction used to estimate the increase in groundwater n reduction is larger in the e hype model than in the local scale models this is a question of different input data between the local scale models and e hype for norsminde the e hype simulated impact plots nicely on the curve describing the relation between the arable land and the impact whereas for odense the e hype simulated impact plots above the curve the equation eq 9 to estimate denitrlu3 works well for norsminde but less well for odense which was also seen when developing the equation fig 6 4 discussion and conclusion 4 1 upscaling approach principles in this paper we have presented a methodology to upscale knowledge on the impact of a spatially targeted regulation of agricultural practices from two local scale physically based mike she catchment models to the large scale and more conceptual e hype model the future goal is to then use the large scale model to simulate changes for the entire baltic sea basin we used the local scale models to develop a relationship between the impact of spatially targeted regulation in a catchment and the fraction of arable land and subsequently derived a relationship between the change in the hype decay parameter denitrlu3 needed to simulate this impact and two catchment characteristics available in hype the upscaling approach presented in this paper is not a classical upscaling approach like the effective parameter approach or the distribution function approach that have been applied in numerous studies bloschl and sivapalan 1995 vereecken et al 2007 we classify our approach as dynamic upscaling except from the example by bronstert et al 2007 we are not aware of studies in literature that have used a similar approach the reason for the lack of similar examples may be that the approach is much more troublesome to use compared to the effective parameter approach and the distribution function approach because you need to identify how inferences can be made from the local scale model to the large scale model in our case the upscaling comprised i use of auxiliary large scale data to make consistency checks of the large scale model ii making minor modifications in the structure of the large scale model code and iii identification of a relationship for estimating changes in a parameter value in the large scale model to simulate something the large scale model otherwise cannot simulate our reason to select this approach was that the other existing upscaling methodologies are not applicable because they simply cannot spatially resolve the small scale regulatory measures and at the same time be operationally applied at large scale the general principles in the presented upscaling approach are applicable for other model codes and for upscaling of other processes than n reduction in groundwater the practical implementation of the upscaling approach is model and process dependent and all applications will therefore be unique the upscaling relationships presented in this study are therefore not transferable to other processes and model codes in order to make it possible to use the upscaling approach some degree of similarity between models is required in order to design a learning scheme the upscaling relationships must also be based on some proxy data readily available at the large scale 4 2 upscaling approach how good is it in our case we have tested the upscaling approach for norsminde and odense catchments and we overestimate the increase in groundwater n reduction for both catchments the main reason for this is that the fraction of arable land which is used to estimate the impact in e hype is higher than in the local scale models arable land fractions in the local scale models are based on data from the danish general agricultural register currently the fraction of arable land in e hype is derived from the corine database for the eu smallest mapping unit 25 ha assuming that the corine data give a reasonably correct estimate of the arable land for the entire baltic sea basin these local differences will generate errors at catchment scale norsminde and odense but are likely to cancel out at the baltic sea basin scale taking into account this difference in arable land fractions the increase in gw was estimated very well for norsminde but overestimated for odense hence we suggest that uncertainties of at least this magnitude should be taken into account when analysing the upscaled scenario results the key relation in the upscaling of the impact simulations is the estimation of increase in n reduction in groundwater gw as a function of the fraction of arable land fig 5 in reality gw is a function of the spread of n reduction in groundwater gw at the small scale within the catchment as this information is not available outside norsminde and odense catchments we have identified the fraction of arable land as a suitable proxy the reason this works is that the targeted regulation is confined to the arable land and the gw for a catchment increases the larger the fraction of the area within a catchment is used for targeted regulation we expect this relationship between arable land and impact of targeted regulation to be scale dependent norsminde catchment to the most downstream monitoring station has a size of 85 km2 and odense catchment a size of 486 km2 so we recommend not using eq 4 for catchments much above or below these catchment sizes the median subbasin resolution in baltic sea basin part of the e hype model is 215 km2 so it should be suitable using the equation with e hype some issues in relation to the construction of the impact scenario run in the local scale models may in practice constrain the impact from a spatially targeted regulation when constructing the scenarios it is not considered whether the redistribution of n leaching is possible in practice this issue is dealt with in detail by hansen et al 2017 based on which we can conclude that the estimated impacts of a spatially targeted regulation shown in the present study are maximum potential impacts 4 3 uncertainties and limitations there are some critical assumptions made in the upscaling methodology in the methodology it is implicitly assumed that the local scale models are more correct than the large scale model supported by the study by stisen et al 2011 we argue that local scale models that are able to incorporate a wider range of data in the model and not least using more data types for calibration will be more constrained and hence provide a more narrow prediction uncertainty interval for small scale applications than large scale models using less data and focusing on water and nutrient balances for rather large catchments nevertheless the results from the local scale models are associated with considerable uncertainties related to input data model structure and parameters refsgaard et al 2007 hansen et al 2014b this is illustrated by differences in the surface water n reduction in the local scale odense model and the national n model the first assumes negligible n reduction based on the study by hansen et al 2009 while the latter estimates a considerable n reduction based on empirical models for reduction in streams wetlands and lakes højberg et al 2015 another critical assumption in the upscaling methodology is that our two case studies odense and norsminde are representative for the entire baltic sea basin with respect to impacts of spatially targeted regulation of agricultural practices ideally more catchments representing different climates geologies agricultural growing regions and farm structures should be included in developing the upscaling relationships it would also have been a good idea to test the approach on an independent catchment however currently norsminde and odense catchment are the only study areas where local scale models have been set up with n reduction maps with sufficient spatial details to support spatially targeted regulation decision making so we have utilised all relevant existing information although the model codes used in this study differ in both process descriptions and spatial discretization since the upscaling approach is empirically based and uses empirical equations the upscaling approach is independent of these differences between the models due to the empirical nature of the upscaling approach it may however not be robust when extrapolating beyond the current conditions e g for predicting impacts of spatially targeted regulation in the context of changing climate or land use management similarly the uncertainty related to the degree of representativeness of the two study areas see above may affect the robustness adversely in addition to uncertainties related to these critical assumptions there are uncertainties related to the groundwater n reduction maps hansen et al 2014a b as well as to the hydrological models to fully analyse the quantitative uncertainty arising from the input data modeling and upscaling procedure shown here is a whole study in its own and outside the scope of the present paper to assess a lower limit to the uncertainty of the impact predictions from e hype we performed an analysis of the uncertainties related to the upscaling relationship in eq 9 used to estimate the required change in the hype parameter denitrlu3 eq 9 was derived using 10 different subbasins spread across the baltic sea basin but as already seen in fig 6 the two variable models for each of the 10 subbasins did not fit well for all subbasins there is therefore an uncertainty in the e hype simulated gw due to the uncertainty in the proxy denitrlu3 parameter estimation that is done using eq 9 fig 8 illustrates this uncertainty on gw simulated with e hype on the figure is plotted the differences between gw simulated using e hype and gw estimated using eq 9 when using the same denitrlu3 the differences illustrate the uncertainty on this relationship arising from the fact that the degree of explanation in eq 9 used to predict the proxy denitrlu3 parameter is less than 100 68 for coefficient a and 73 for b the figure shows that the uncertainties in estimated gw related to eq 9 are within the range of 8 4 which is considerable when compared to typical gw values in the order of 5 25 see fig 5 fig 8 however also shows that the average value of the differences is close to zero implying that when results from several catchments are aggregated some of the uncertainties will cancel out the implication of this is that the uncertainties can be quite large at local scale but much less at baltic sea basin scale 4 4 conclusion we conclude that the upscaling methodology presented in this paper provides a useful tool to simulate the overall impact of a spatially targeted regulation of agricultural practices on decreasing n loads to the baltic sea given all the recognised uncertainties we conclude that e hype using this upscaling methodology is likely to be able to simulate the correct trends and order of magnitudes at the baltic sea basin scale and as such provide a sound base for large scale policy analysis however we do not expect it to be sufficiently accurate to be useful for the detailed designing of local scale measures for future work to lower the uncertainties in estimating the impacts of a spatially targeted regulation of agricultural practices in decreasing total n loads to the baltic sea we call for more detailed studies of the local differences in n reduction to be conducted in more countries around the baltic sea basin and included in the derivation of the upscaling relationships presented in this study acknowledgments this work

895,this paper describes a modeling approach proposed to simulate the impact of local scale spatially targeted n mitigation measures for the baltic sea basin spatially targeted n regulations aim at exploiting the considerable spatial differences in the natural n reduction taking place in groundwater and surface water while such measures can be simulated using local scale physically based catchment models use of such detailed models for the 1 8 million km2 baltic sea basin is not feasible due to constraints on input data and computing power large scale models that are able to simulate the baltic sea basin on the other hand do not have adequate spatial resolution to simulate some of the field scale measures our methodology combines knowledge and results from two local scale physically based mike she catchment models the large scale and more conceptual e hype model and auxiliary data in order to enable e hype to simulate how spatially targeted regulation of agricultural practices may affect n loads to the baltic sea we conclude that the use of e hype with this upscaling methodology enables the simulation of the impact on n loads of applying a spatially targeted regulation at the baltic sea basin scale to the correct order of magnitude the e hype model together with the upscaling methodology therefore provides a sound basis for large scale policy analysis however we do not expect it to be sufficiently accurate to be useful for the detailed design of local scale measures graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords nitrate reduction groundwater modeling spatially targeted regulation upscaling 1 introduction large nutrient loads have resulted in severe environmental problems in the baltic sea during the past decades gustafsson et al 2012 diffuse losses of nutrients contribute about two thirds of the total nitrogen n and phosphorus p loads delivered to the sea with the majority of these originating from agricultural sources helcom 2011 in order to address the eutrophication problem the baltic sea action plan bsap was adopted in 2007 setting country specific abatement targets for n and p loads to achieve a good status in the baltic sea backer et al 2010 many abatement actions have already been implemented in the baltic sea countries but the targets are still not met and more actions are required backer et al 2010 this paper addresses simulation of the impacts of a novel regulation methodology in decreasing the total n loads to the sea the loss of n from agriculture occurs mainly as leaching of excess nitrate from the root zone along the flow path from the root zone via groundwater and surface water to the catchment outlet nitrate can be naturally transformed and thereby removed by redox processes nitrate reduction is a microbial process occurring under anoxic conditions in the presence of an electron donor organic matter pyrite and fe ii and occurs both in soils groundwater and surface waters appelo and postma 2005 this removal of nitrogen by redox reactions is in this study referred to as n reduction and we mainly focus on the n reduction occurring below the root zone i e in groundwater and surface waters due to geological heterogeneity n reduction varies significantly not only at the baltic sea basin scale wulff et al 2014 højberg et al 2017 but also at the local scale within small catchments hansen et al 2014b present agricultural regulations to decrease the n loss from the root zone specify the same abatement requirements for all areas without considering local variations in n reductions in the groundwater or surface water this is obviously not very cost effective jacobsen and hansen 2016 and it has led to the idea of implementing a spatially targeted regulation focussing on decreasing n loss from areas with low natural n reduction instead of a uniform regulation where all areas have to decrease by the same amount regardless of the natural reduction capacity in the area hansen et al 2017 a spatially targeted regulation can consist of a number of different regulatory measures implemented at or in connection to areas with a low natural n reduction these regulatory measures can either be implemented at the source by decreasing n leaching from the root zone on areas with low n reduction e g by changing the crop or the management practice on the field or they can be implemented where water from areas with low n reduction is discharging into surface waters e g in the form of constructed wetlands that can remove some of the discharging nitrogen langergraber et al 2011 the effectiveness of regulatory measures for decreasing n loads can be assessed using hydrological and nutrient flux models vagstad et al 2009 to exploit the local field and farm scale variability in n reduction however requires simulations at scales resolving the field and farm scale variability this is extremely data demanding and requires detailed process descriptions within the hydrological models hansen et al 2014b karlsson et al 2016 modeling of nitrate processes at large scales such as the baltic sea basin has been carried out by arheimer et al 2012 and wulff et al 2014 to assess the impacts of international regulations that are applied uniformly across larger regions or even the entire basin these large scale models operate with computational units of several hundred km2 making it impossible to explicitly simulate the impacts of local scale spatially targeted measures because they cannot spatially resolve the measures and often have inadequate process descriptions in particular for describing the spatial variability in groundwater processes therefore there is a need to combine the knowledge and results achieved by local and large scale modeling in an upscaling procedure upscaling can be done in a variety of ways bloschl and sivapalan 1995 refsgaard et al 1999 vereecken et al 2007 the most common upscaling approach in distributed hydrological modeling is the effective parameter approach which assumes that process equations and system data originating from smaller scales are applicable at a larger scale and that effective parameters exist that can reproduce the mean behavior of the system observed at the larger scale this assumption is often justifiable refsgaard 1997 henriksen et al 2003 while it in some cases has to be rejected beven 1995 another approach used in distributed models is the distribution function approach where the statistical distributions but not the geo referenced locations of system data and parameters are represented in the model andersen et al 2001 herbst and diekkruger 2002 the use of hydrological response units in semi distributed models like hype arheimer et al 2012 stromqvist et al 2012 can be seen as a kind of statistical distribution function approach although the continuous properties here are replaced by categorical data such as soil type and land use a fundamentally different upscaling approach is the dynamic upscaling approach where model results from a model with a finer resolution of the computational units are utilized somehow in a large scale model with coarser resolution there are only a few examples of this upscaling approach bronstert et al 2007 hansen et al 2008 in the study by bronstert et al 2007 a hbv model was set up for the rhine basin for three meso scale catchments within the rhine basin small scale models were set up using the distributed physically based model wasim eth and simulated stream discharge from these models was used in the calibration of the large scale hbv model the effect of land use changes was simulated with the small scale models and these results were then used as input to the hbv model in order to simulate land use changes for the entire rhine basin to be able to assess the potential impacts of implementing a spatially targeted regulation of agricultural practices on the n loads to the baltic sea it will be necessary to use a large scale model for the entire baltic sea basin and to develop an upscaling methodology to account for the impacts that cannot be handled explicitly in existing large scale models the objectives of the present study were i to introduce a methodology to upscale knowledge from a local scale model to a large scale model simulating water and n flows for the entire baltic sea basin with a focus on n reduction in groundwater and ii to test it on predicting impacts of a spatially targeted regulation to decrease the n load to the sea for two study areas we use the dynamic upscaling approach in a manner similar to bronstert et al 2007 extending this approach from only considering river flow to also including n fluxes and n reduction in this paper we thus report the development and testing of the upscaling approach whereas the full application on the entire baltic sea basin will be reported in a second paper 2 methodology 2 1 local study areas two danish catchments were used to develop the upscaling methodology the 85 km2 norsminde catchment upstream part of the 101 km2 norsminde fjord catchment is located on the east coast of jutland and the 486 km2 odense catchment upstream of kratholm is located on the island of funen fig 1 both catchments discharge into fjords which are ecologically sensitive with respect to nitrogen and a significant decrease of the n loads to the fjords is required to obtain good ecological status danish nature agency 2016 the land use in both catchments is dominated by intensive agriculture a part of the agricultural area in the catchments is used for permanent grass the agricultural area in rotation from now on called arable land suitable for a spatially targeted regulation of agricultural practices makes up 62 of the catchment area in norsminde and 61 in odense the climate in the norsminde and odense catchments is temperate and humid the catchments are located in glacial landscapes from the weichsel glaciation where the upper geology is dominated by clayey till with smaller units of glacial melt water sand and post glacial freshwater peat fig 1a and d due to the predominance of clay till soils the two catchments are to a large extent tile drained in both catchments observations of daily discharge are available from stream monitoring stations fig 1a and d observations of total n concentrations are available at the downstream monitoring station in norsminde for the period 2000 2007 with 14 48 samples per year in odense observations of total n concentrations are available at the downstream station with 114 183 samples per year in the period 2000 2009 and 16 17 samples per year from 2010 and until present 2 2 models 2 2 1 local scale models mike she nles the local scale models used in this study were the mike she catchment model for simulating flow and transport and the agricultural field scale model nles for simulating n leaching from the root zone as a n leaching input for mike she the local scale models were based on existing model applications from different previous studies which is also why the models differ in e g model discretization the models are described in the following but more detailed information can be found in the original papers referred to below n leaching from root zone nles n leaching from the root zone in agricultural areas was calculated using the nles model kristensen et al 2003 2008 nles is an empirical input output model based on a number of explanatory variables that have been estimated through calibration against observed n leaching data nles calculates a yearly n leaching based on input data on the crop rotations inputs of fertilizer and manure n fixation percolation soil type and the content of organic matter and clay in the soil the nles calculations were done at a farm scale level as part of the danish national nitrogen model højberg et al 2015 input data to nles on crop rotations were available from the year 2000 onwards at field block cluster of fields or field level and input data on yearly fertilizer and manure use and catch crop area fast growing crops sown between main crops in order to lower n leaching were available on farm level from danish national agricultural databases data originates from the general agricultural register and the danish agrifish agency soil data used in nles were from a soil database containing standard values for all typical danish soils the estimated yearly n leaching from nles was disaggregated to daily values using results from the physically based root zone model daisy abrahamsen and hansen 2000 set up for typical crop rotations and soil types in the areas the n leaching results at field level were afterwards aggregated to a grid corresponding to the grid size of the hydrological model i e 100 m grid in norsminde and 200 m grid in odense for later implementation in the mike she models the average yearly n leaching from root zone for both catchments can be seen in fig 1b and e flow and transport mike she mike she is a distributed physically based hydrological model code including process descriptions for evapotranspiration snowmelt 2d overland flow 1d unsaturated flow 3d saturated flow macropore flow tile drainage and 1d river flow the computational units are georeferenced grid cells and all model parameters can vary for each grid cell transport can be simulated as particle tracking or advection dispersion havnø et al 1995 refsgaard and storm 1995 norsminde the mike she model for norsminde was based on a model application from he et al 2015 and hansen et al 2014b the model has a grid size of 100 m x 100 m with a vertical division of the saturated zone into 24 computational layers of varying thickness the climate input was obtained from the danish meteorological institute s dmi 10 km grid for daily precipitation and 20 km grid for reference evapotranspiration and air temperature he et al 2015 the flow model was set up as a transient model for the period 1995 2007 and was calibrated using the parameter estimator pest doherty 2005 against daily discharge data from the three monitoring stations fig 1a and 690 hydraulic head measurements in 108 wells for the period 2000 2003 he et al 2015 the n transport in mike she was simulated using particle tracking the estimated n leaching from nles was applied as a daily input to mike she for the period 2000 2007 where a n particle was released for each 2 kg of n added to a model grid cell the n particles were released on the water table and tracked until they reached a sink stream drain well or fjord ocean a spatially distributed redox interface transition from oxic to anoxic conditions was implemented in the model according to the method developed by hansen et al 2014a when an n particle crossed the redox interface it was assumed to be completely reduced hansen et al 2014b point source data were added to the simulated n load from groundwater to the stream outside the mike she framework the same was done with the n reduction in the stream system the amount of n reduction in the stream was calculated simplistically on a subcatchment level four subcatchments within norsminde and defined as a function of the stream length odense the mike she model for odense was based on the model application by karlsson et al 2015 the model has a grid size of 200 m x 200 m with the saturated zone divided into seven computational layers the climate input in the odense model was also obtained from the dmi climate grid karlsson et al 2015 the flow model was setup as a transient model running from 1990 2010 it was calibrated with the global optimization algorithm population simplex evolution method pse using the autocal tool in mike she the calibration was done for the period 2004 2007 using daily discharge data from the four monitoring stations fig 1d and hydraulic head data from 455 wells karlsson et al 2015 the n transport in the odense model was similar to the norsminde model simulated using particle tracking and a spatially distributed redox interface the n leaching input to mike she was changed from the original model setup to the nles estimated daily n leaching in the current odense model it was assumed that all n reduction within the catchment is occurring in groundwater and that n reduction in the stream system is negligible 2 2 2 large scale model e hype the e hype model donnelly et al 2016 is a large scale pan european application of the hype model code lindstrom et al 2010 the hype model is a semi distributed model mixing conceptual and physical descriptions for different hydrological and nutrient processes calculations are made on a daily time step in coupled subbasins the subbasins are divided into hydrological response units hrus a hru is a calculation unit with a unique land use and soil type the hrus can be divided in up to three soil layers that can have different thicknesses model parameters are either the same for the whole model domain or are related to soil type or land cover depending on the process they represent some of the processes included in hype are evapotranspiration snowmelt surface runoff surface erosion macro pore flow tile drainage groundwater outflow from each soil layer and routing of water through the river network rather than coupling with a n leaching model hype simulates the continuous transformation of nutrients n and p from the surface via the soil and in surface waters processes simulated include plant uptake turnover mineralisation nitrate reduction denitrification and erosion two applications of the hype model were used in the study to test the upscaling procedure both the norsminde and odense catchments were extracted from the existing pan european e hype v3 0 model hundecha et al 2016 which has since been extended to simulate water quality using the same methods used in a previous version of e hype with water quality donnelly et al 2013 the model inputs come from continental and global scale databases for example precipitation and temperature are from the 0 5 wfdei database weedon et al 2014 to give an idea of scale the norsminde catchment consists of one subbasin in the e hype model and the odense catchment consists of two subbasins 2 2 3 comparison of model concepts the concepts for simulating n processes in the root zone n reduction in groundwater and transport pathways are different between the two model frameworks mike she nles and hype in the local models nles accounts for n reduction in the root zone while mike she calculates n reduction in groundwater by introducing a redox interface somewhere in the saturated zone above which nitrate is conservative and below which nitrate is reduced instantly the hype model assumes that n reduction can take place in all three soil layers as a function of a decay rate parameter for n reduction denitrlu the pool of inorganic n the concentration of inorganic n soil moisture content and temperature furthermore when the upper layers become saturated inorganic n can also leach directly from the upper soil layers to streams fig 2 shows conceptual sketches of the fluxes of n loads from source to catchment outlet in the two models mike she has two n fluxes to the stream system via groundwater flow and via tile drain flow saturated flow in mike she is simulated in 3d and n can be transported to the stream system via both shallow and deep groundwater flow paths over the entire depth of the saturated zone the tile drains are located at 1 m depth at the bottom of the root zone and will be active when the water table is above the drain level n transport is not simulated via surface runoff when applying particle tracking in mike she because particle tracking is restricted to the saturated zone however since surface runoff is of little importance in the two catchments this will have negligible effect on the simulated n load to the stream the hype model includes three n fluxes out of the upper two layers covering the root zone 1 n leaching to the deeper layer three that constitutes the groundwater zone 2 a horizontal flux directly to the stream system and 3 tile drain flow to the stream system the last two n fluxes are only active when the water table rises into the root zone making the bottom of the root zone saturated from the groundwater zone there is one n flux via groundwater flow to the stream system hype also includes a possible n flux to the stream with surface runoff either due to saturation excess or infiltration excess since this flux is negligible in our two case studies it is not included in the following equations in order to compare n fluxes and n reduction in groundwater between the two model frameworks we have defined the following equations eqs 1 3 the n load from the root zone was defined as follows for the two models with mike she terms subscript m on the left hand side and hype terms subscript h on the right hand side and where notation is defined in fig 2 1 l m leach l h leach l h ul l h td the n load to the stream system was defined by 2 l m gw l m td l h gw l h ul l h td finally the fraction of the total n leaching from the root zone that is reduced in the groundwater gw was defined by 3 gw l m leach l m gw l m td l m leach l h leach l h ul l h td l h gw l h ul l h td l h leach l h ul l h td l h leach l h gw l h leach l h ul l h td 2 3 upscaling approach in order to enable the e hype model to simulate the impacts of spatially targeted regulation on the n load to the baltic sea we need a methodology to modify the current e hype model setup to account for this the modification needs to be based on information from local scale making it essential to apply an upscaling procedure the effective parameter approach and the distribution function approach are not directly applicable for our purpose because we want to be able to simulate the impact of spatial differences within one computational unit of the large scale model to do this with e hype requires that parameter values in e hype are changed to reflect the impact of the spatially targeted regulation therefore we have adopted the dynamic upscaling approach in a manner similar to bronstert et al 2007 where the basic idea is that e hype through our two case studies norsminde and odense is learning by simulation results from the local scale mike she models or in other words that we learn from mike she simulations how to parameterise e hype the upscaling is done in three steps 1 baseflow fraction 2 n leaching and n reduction in groundwater and 3 impact of spatially targeted regulation we propose that e hype needs to have a reasonably accurate description of the split between baseflow and near surface flow and between n reduction in groundwater and in surface water to enable it to accurately simulate the impact of a spatially targeted regulation to do this steps 1 and 2 are used to check consistency and if necessary recalibrate e hype in order to make this possible for the entire baltic sea basin the consistency check recalibration must be done against data sources that are available for the entire basin step 3 is then to use e hype to simulate the impact of a spatially targeted regulation using some upscaling relationships the upscaling methodology is illustrated in fig 3 and will be described in more details in the following sections 2 3 1 step 1 baseflow fraction the first step in the methodology is to check the consistency of the split between shallow and deep flow in the e hype model this is done by checking and if needed calibrating the baseflow fraction of the simulated discharge in e hype against the baseflow fraction of the observed hydrograph the baseflow fraction is estimated by applying the baseflow filter bflow arnold et al 1995 to observed and simulated hydrographs bflow uses three different passes where the hydrograph is separated in several steps we will use pass 3 giving the lowest baseflow fraction the baseflow fraction bf is calculated as the long term total baseflow divided by the total discharge the baseflow fraction is used as a soft criterion in the calibration so that the calibration is deemed acceptable if the mean value of baseflow from e hype is within 20 of the observed baseflow fraction 2 3 2 step 2 n leaching and n reduction in groundwater after the streamflow has been checked recalibrated the next step is to calibrate the n reduction in groundwater in e hype during the development of the upscaling methodology we found it necessary to also calibrate the n leaching in e hype together with the groundwater n reduction the parameters that are calibrated in this step are a time constant for nitrate reduction d 1 a parameter for decay of humus to n d 1 a parameter for mineralisation of n to inorganic n d 1 and a parameter controlling the crop uptake of n constraining the n leaching in e hype requires a best possible estimate of n leaching simulated values will be used as n leaching observations are not systematically available at the baltic sea basin scale we use a 10 km grid scale map produced by andersen et al 2016 fig 7 p 14 for denmark we use n leaching based on the nles model on a 500 m grid scale produced for use in the danish national n model højberg et al 2015 for constraining the groundwater n reduction in e hype we utilise a new map with estimates on the groundwater n reduction for the baltic sea basin produced by højberg et al 2017 2 3 3 step 3 impact of spatially targeted regulation the final step in the upscaling methodology is to apply upscaling relationships that adjust some of the e hype n reduction parameters to allow e hype to simulate the impact of spatially targeted regulation of agricultural practices the upscaling relationships to do this were developed in this study based on the mike she local scale models first the local scale models for norsminde and odense were applied to simulate and assess the impact of applying spatially targeted regulation at the 100 200 m scale we then developed relationships to transfer the results gained from the local scale impact modeling for norsminde and odense to the rest of the baltic sea basin to estimate the expected impact in each subbasin we assumed that the decay rate parameter for n reduction denitrlu in e hype can be modified to obtain the expected impact i e changes in the n reduction rate are used as a proxy for obtaining the changes resulting from applying a targeted regulation this was developed into generic relationships that use information readily available in e hype and hence are transferable to all subbasins in the baltic sea basin the upscaling relations will be presented in the results section section 3 2 2 4 impact scenario of spatially targeted regulation in order to assess the potential impact of applying a spatially targeted regulation an impact scenario was defined and run for norsminde and odense catchments using the local scale models it is the results from these impact scenarios that were upscaled to the e hype model in the impact scenarios the n leaching rates in the two catchments were redistributed so that the largest n leaching rate was relocated to the area with the largest n reduction and the smallest n leaching rate to the area with lowest n reduction in this way we simulate the effects of moving around the present land use and agricultural practice in the catchments without having to change it a further explanation of this scenario and a discussion of its limitations are provided in hansen et al 2017 3 results in this section we show first the results from the impact scenario for norsminde and odense using the local scale models section 3 1 based on these impact results the upscaling relationships used in step 3 of the upscaling approach were developed section 3 2 finally after developing the upscaling relationships the upscaling approach was tested on the two study areas norsminde and odense section 3 3 3 1 impact of a spatially targeted regulation in norsminde and odense the results of the impact scenarios run at local scale for norsminde and odense are seen in fig 4 in both catchments the spatially targeted regulation where high n leaching rates are redistributed to areas with high n reduction and vice versa results in a decrease of the total n load out of the catchments since the present n leaching is just spatially redistributed i e the total n input is unchanged for the catchments the decrease in catchment n load is caused by an increase in n reduction in the groundwater in norsminde the groundwater n reduction percentage gw is increased by 8 and in odense by 15 fig 4 3 2 developing upscaling relationships for application at the baltic sea basin scale large spatial variations in hydrogeological and landscape elements as well as farming structures and crop rotations within a catchment will lead to large heterogeneity in n reduction and hence to a large potential for achieving decreased n load by spatial targeting of measures thus catchments with a large spread in the gw locally within the catchment will have a larger potential gain than catchments with a small or no spread in gw jacobsen and hansen 2016 as data on the local scale ha spread in gw do not exist outside the norsminde and odense catchments we had to identify a proxy for use at the baltic sea basin our analyses showed that the potential gain for a catchment can also be related to the fraction of arable land within a catchment i e the actual area where spatially targeted regulation can be applied the justification for this is that the larger the fraction of the catchment where targeted regulation can be applied and where the n reduction in groundwater is optimized the larger will the gw for the entire catchment be since information about the fraction of arable land per subbasin is available in e hype this relationship can be utilized in the upscaling 3 2 1 assessing the impact based on arable land fraction to estimate a relationship between the impact of spatially targeting regulation and arable land we ran the impact scenario described in section 2 4 for both norsminde and odense using different maps for arable areas and thus varying areas available for a spatially targeted regulation these maps of arable land were based on the original map for the two catchments and a number of scenarios were then made by randomly adding or removing arable land to obtain fractions of arable land between 0 no areas in rotation spatially targeting cannot be done on any areas and 100 all areas in the catchment can be used for spatially targeting this analysis resulted in a relationship between impact and proportion arable land fig 5 for norsminde and odense catchments we then fitted the following 2nd order polynomial function to the data points in fig 5 r 2 0 94 4 δ gw 0 26 a 2 0 07 a where gw is the increase in groundwater n reduction percentage gw and a is the fraction of arable land within the catchment 3 2 2 changing the decay rate denitrlu3 in e hype in order to make e hype simulate the increase in groundwater n reduction gw when a spatially targeted regulation is applied the decay rate parameter for n reduction denitrlu must be increased in the official hype model code there is only one decay rate covering all three soil layers simulated this means that when the decay rate is changed it will affect both the n reduction in the root zone hence it will affect the n leaching and in the groundwater zone in order to simulate the impact of spatially targeted regulation this needs to be two separate processes and the hype model code was therefore modified and used to run the e hype model so that the decay rate for n reduction in the groundwater zone in layer 3 denitrlu3 can be changed independently of the root zone using eq 4 results in a different gw increase for all 7145 subbasins in the baltic sea basin to simulate these different increases in gw using e hype require a different increase in denitrlu3 for each of the subbasins as it is impractical to calibrate the increase in denitrlu3 for all of them we propose a method to estimate the increase in denitrlu3 needed in each individual e hype subbasin this was done by studying how changes in the denitrlu3 parameter in e hype affect the simulated change in gw for this analysis we chose 10 subbasins spread across the baltic sea basin norsminde and odense in denmark kocinka and a small catchment near gdansk in poland parnu in estonia pregolya in poland kaliningrad oblast russia and tullstorp and a small catchment south of linköping in sweden for linköping parnu and pregolya consisting of several subbasins in e hype the most downstream subbasin was chosen for odense we used all the 3 subbasins covering the odense fjord basin therefore the names odense 1 2 and 3 in the following for these 10 subbasins we analysed the change in gw due to different changes in the decay rate denitrlu3 in layer 3 fig 6 points while the relationship between change in denitrlu3 and change in groundwater n reduction was found to vary considerably between the different catchments each of the catchments followed a clear relationship nitrate reduction in hype is not only dependent on the decay rate denitrlu3 but also on soil moisture soil water temperature and nutrient levels within the soil lindstrom et al 2010 to estimate how these factors affect the change in n reduction with changes in denitrlu3 we first fitted individual logarithmic functions for each of the 10 catchments all with r 2 0 96 5 δ gw a ln δ denitrlu 3 b where gw is the increase in gw and denitrlu3 is change in decay rate denitrlu3 the next step was to relate the a and b coefficients to some subbasin variables to describe how a and b vary between the 10 catchments in this analysis four readily available catchment variables affecting nitrate reduction were included fraction of arable land soil moisture in layer 3 soil water temperature in layer 3 and average n leaching to layer 3 a multiple linear regression analysis was performed separately for coefficients a and b four different regression models were set up to test the effect of including from four to one of the variables the four variable models were constructed first and then between each model the variable with the highest p value i e least statistical significance was excluded the four three and two variable regression models were found to give almost the same curve describing the relationship between denitrlu3 and gw for the 10 subbasins it was therefore chosen to use the two variable model which relates the parameters of the curve to average n leaching to layer 3 n leach and soil moisture in layer 3 soim 6 a 0 039 3 26 1 0 5 soim 0 0022 n leach 7 b 0 099 7 52 1 0 5 soim 0 0043 n leach when putting these equations for a and b back into the logarithmic function eq 5 we got the following expression to estimate the logarithmic model describing the relationship between denitrlu3 and gw for a subbasin 8 δ gw 0 039 3 26 1 0 5 soim 0 0022 n leach ln δ denitrlu 3 0 099 7 52 1 0 5 soim 0

for each model between 1 3 and 1 5 for kaliningrad linköping tullstrup and odense2 the models perform reasonably rmse 2 4 2 9 but for parnu odense3 and odense 1 the models do not perform very well rmse 3 1 4 5 when applying the upscaling it is the denitrlu3 we want to estimate based on the gw estimated using eq 4 we therefore have to re arrange eq 8 to the following upscaling relationship 9 δ denitrlu 3 exp δ gw 0 099 7 52 1 0 5 soim 0 0043 n leach 0 039 3 26 1 0 5 soim 0 0022 n leach 3 3 testing the upscaling approach in e hype 3 3 1 step 1 baseflow fraction the results from checking the baseflow fraction for e hype are shown in table 1 for norsminde the local scale mike she model is seen to have a baseflow fraction very close to the observed hydrograph while the e hype model has a higher baseflow fraction for odense the baseflow fractions for both mike she and e hype are very close to the observed in all cases the agreements are within the 20 acceptance interval of the observed baseflow fraction and e hype was therefore not recalibrated for flow the simulated discharge at the most downstream station in norsminde is seen in fig 7 a for both the mike she model and e hype model 3 3 2 step 2 n leaching and n reduction in groundwater table 2 shows the mass balance for norsminde for the local scale mike she model the initial e hype and the recalibrated e hype model as well as the target values the target value for n leaching is 38 kg n ha yr and for groundwater n reduction 55 the n leaching and groundwater n reduction in the mike she nles model is seen to be very similar to the target values the initial e hype model overestimates both target values with a n leaching of 55 8 kg n ha yr and a groundwater n reduction percentage of 63 the e hype model was therefore recalibrated resulting in a n leaching of 31 3 kg n ha yr and a groundwater n reduction percentage of 52 for the recalibrated e hype model fig 7b shows the simulated n load at the downstream monitoring station in norsminde for the mike she model and the e hype model the mike she model simulates a n load rather close to the observed the initial e hype model greatly overestimates the n load but after the recalibration the e hype simulated n load is significantly improved for odense the simulated values as well as the target values for calibrating the n reduction in groundwater and the n leaching are seen in table 3 the n leaching in the mike she nles model is seen to be similar to the target value but for groundwater n reduction the mike she nles model is very different from the target value because the model assumes that all n reduction in the catchment occurs in groundwater the initial e hype model has a n leaching of 59 7 kg n ha yr and a groundwater n reduction percentage of 68 and thereby overestimates both target values the e hype model for odense was therefore recalibrated which resulted in a n leaching of 41 8 kg n ha yr and a groundwater reduction of 45 the simulated n load at the most downstream monitoring station is 17 1 kg n ha yr in the recalibrated e hype model this is close to the observed n load at the station of 16 7 kg n ha yr 3 3 3 step 3 simulating impacts of spatially targeted regulation with e hype the increase in groundwater reduction gw due to a spatially targeted regulation was first estimated for norsminde and odense using eq 4 and the arable land fraction in e hype table 4 the estimated gw for norsminde was 22 and for odense 23 then using eq 9 the required change in decay rate denitrlu3 to increase the groundwater n reduction was estimated to be an increase of 137 in norsminde and 167 in odense for odense the area weighted average of the catchment variables for the 2 subbasins odense 1 and 2 covering the downstream monitoring station were used for the estimation of gw and denitrlu3 the estimated denitrlu3 values were applied to the decay rate in model layer 3 for the two catchments to run the impact scenario the resulting mass balances for the impact scenario simulated by e hype for norsminde and odense are seen in the last columns of tables 2 and 3 for norsminde the groundwater n reduction increased from 52 to 63 which is an increase of 22 and for odense the groundwater n reduction increased from 45 to 59 which is an increase of 30 table 4 the e hype simulated impact of a spatially targeted regulation is plotted against the local scale model simulated impact in fig 5 the e hype simulated impact is seen to be larger than the local scale model simulated impact for both norsminde and odense the main reason for this is that the arable land fraction used to estimate the increase in groundwater n reduction is larger in the e hype model than in the local scale models this is a question of different input data between the local scale models and e hype for norsminde the e hype simulated impact plots nicely on the curve describing the relation between the arable land and the impact whereas for odense the e hype simulated impact plots above the curve the equation eq 9 to estimate denitrlu3 works well for norsminde but less well for odense which was also seen when developing the equation fig 6 4 discussion and conclusion 4 1 upscaling approach principles in this paper we have presented a methodology to upscale knowledge on the impact of a spatially targeted regulation of agricultural practices from two local scale physically based mike she catchment models to the large scale and more conceptual e hype model the future goal is to then use the large scale model to simulate changes for the entire baltic sea basin we used the local scale models to develop a relationship between the impact of spatially targeted regulation in a catchment and the fraction of arable land and subsequently derived a relationship between the change in the hype decay parameter denitrlu3 needed to simulate this impact and two catchment characteristics available in hype the upscaling approach presented in this paper is not a classical upscaling approach like the effective parameter approach or the distribution function approach that have been applied in numerous studies bloschl and sivapalan 1995 vereecken et al 2007 we classify our approach as dynamic upscaling except from the example by bronstert et al 2007 we are not aware of studies in literature that have used a similar approach the reason for the lack of similar examples may be that the approach is much more troublesome to use compared to the effective parameter approach and the distribution function approach because you need to identify how inferences can be made from the local scale model to the large scale model in our case the upscaling comprised i use of auxiliary large scale data to make consistency checks of the large scale model ii making minor modifications in the structure of the large scale model code and iii identification of a relationship for estimating changes in a parameter value in the large scale model to simulate something the large scale model otherwise cannot simulate our reason to select this approach was that the other existing upscaling methodologies are not applicable because they simply cannot spatially resolve the small scale regulatory measures and at the same time be operationally applied at large scale the general principles in the presented upscaling approach are applicable for other model codes and for upscaling of other processes than n reduction in groundwater the practical implementation of the upscaling approach is model and process dependent and all applications will therefore be unique the upscaling relationships presented in this study are therefore not transferable to other processes and model codes in order to make it possible to use the upscaling approach some degree of similarity between models is required in order to design a learning scheme the upscaling relationships must also be based on some proxy data readily available at the large scale 4 2 upscaling approach how good is it in our case we have tested the upscaling approach for norsminde and odense catchments and we overestimate the increase in groundwater n reduction for both catchments the main reason for this is that the fraction of arable land which is used to estimate the impact in e hype is higher than in the local scale models arable land fractions in the local scale models are based on data from the danish general agricultural register currently the fraction of arable land in e hype is derived from the corine database for the eu smallest mapping unit 25 ha assuming that the corine data give a reasonably correct estimate of the arable land for the entire baltic sea basin these local differences will generate errors at catchment scale norsminde and odense but are likely to cancel out at the baltic sea basin scale taking into account this difference in arable land fractions the increase in gw was estimated very well for norsminde but overestimated for odense hence we suggest that uncertainties of at least this magnitude should be taken into account when analysing the upscaled scenario results the key relation in the upscaling of the impact simulations is the estimation of increase in n reduction in groundwater gw as a function of the fraction of arable land fig 5 in reality gw is a function of the spread of n reduction in groundwater gw at the small scale within the catchment as this information is not available outside norsminde and odense catchments we have identified the fraction of arable land as a suitable proxy the reason this works is that the targeted regulation is confined to the arable land and the gw for a catchment increases the larger the fraction of the area within a catchment is used for targeted regulation we expect this relationship between arable land and impact of targeted regulation to be scale dependent norsminde catchment to the most downstream monitoring station has a size of 85 km2 and odense catchment a size of 486 km2 so we recommend not using eq 4 for catchments much above or below these catchment sizes the median subbasin resolution in baltic sea basin part of the e hype model is 215 km2 so it should be suitable using the equation with e hype some issues in relation to the construction of the impact scenario run in the local scale models may in practice constrain the impact from a spatially targeted regulation when constructing the scenarios it is not considered whether the redistribution of n leaching is possible in practice this issue is dealt with in detail by hansen et al 2017 based on which we can conclude that the estimated impacts of a spatially targeted regulation shown in the present study are maximum potential impacts 4 3 uncertainties and limitations there are some critical assumptions made in the upscaling methodology in the methodology it is implicitly assumed that the local scale models are more correct than the large scale model supported by the study by stisen et al 2011 we argue that local scale models that are able to incorporate a wider range of data in the model and not least using more data types for calibration will be more constrained and hence provide a more narrow prediction uncertainty interval for small scale applications than large scale models using less data and focusing on water and nutrient balances for rather large catchments nevertheless the results from the local scale models are associated with considerable uncertainties related to input data model structure and parameters refsgaard et al 2007 hansen et al 2014b this is illustrated by differences in the surface water n reduction in the local scale odense model and the national n model the first assumes negligible n reduction based on the study by hansen et al 2009 while the latter estimates a considerable n reduction based on empirical models for reduction in streams wetlands and lakes højberg et al 2015 another critical assumption in the upscaling methodology is that our two case studies odense and norsminde are representative for the entire baltic sea basin with respect to impacts of spatially targeted regulation of agricultural practices ideally more catchments representing different climates geologies agricultural growing regions and farm structures should be included in developing the upscaling relationships it would also have been a good idea to test the approach on an independent catchment however currently norsminde and odense catchment are the only study areas where local scale models have been set up with n reduction maps with sufficient spatial details to support spatially targeted regulation decision making so we have utilised all relevant existing information although the model codes used in this study differ in both process descriptions and spatial discretization since the upscaling approach is empirically based and uses empirical equations the upscaling approach is independent of these differences between the models due to the empirical nature of the upscaling approach it may however not be robust when extrapolating beyond the current conditions e g for predicting impacts of spatially targeted regulation in the context of changing climate or land use management similarly the uncertainty related to the degree of representativeness of the two study areas see above may affect the robustness adversely in addition to uncertainties related to these critical assumptions there are uncertainties related to the groundwater n reduction maps hansen et al 2014a b as well as to the hydrological models to fully analyse the quantitative uncertainty arising from the input data modeling and upscaling procedure shown here is a whole study in its own and outside the scope of the present paper to assess a lower limit to the uncertainty of the impact predictions from e hype we performed an analysis of the uncertainties related to the upscaling relationship in eq 9 used to estimate the required change in the hype parameter denitrlu3 eq 9 was derived using 10 different subbasins spread across the baltic sea basin but as already seen in fig 6 the two variable models for each of the 10 subbasins did not fit well for all subbasins there is therefore an uncertainty in the e hype simulated gw due to the uncertainty in the proxy denitrlu3 parameter estimation that is done using eq 9 fig 8 illustrates this uncertainty on gw simulated with e hype on the figure is plotted the differences between gw simulated using e hype and gw estimated using eq 9 when using the same denitrlu3 the differences illustrate the uncertainty on this relationship arising from the fact that the degree of explanation in eq 9 used to predict the proxy denitrlu3 parameter is less than 100 68 for coefficient a and 73 for b the figure shows that the uncertainties in estimated gw related to eq 9 are within the range of 8 4 which is considerable when compared to typical gw values in the order of 5 25 see fig 5 fig 8 however also shows that the average value of the differences is close to zero implying that when results from several catchments are aggregated some of the uncertainties will cancel out the implication of this is that the uncertainties can be quite large at local scale but much less at baltic sea basin scale 4 4 conclusion we conclude that the upscaling methodology presented in this paper provides a useful tool to simulate the overall impact of a spatially targeted regulation of agricultural practices on decreasing n loads to the baltic sea given all the recognised uncertainties we conclude that e hype using this upscaling methodology is likely to be able to simulate the correct trends and order of magnitudes at the baltic sea basin scale and as such provide a sound base for large scale policy analysis however we do not expect it to be sufficiently accurate to be useful for the detailed designing of local scale measures for future work to lower the uncertainties in estimating the impacts of a spatially targeted regulation of agricultural practices in decreasing total n loads to the baltic sea we call for more detailed studies of the local differences in n reduction to be conducted in more countries around the baltic sea basin and included in the derivation of the upscaling relationships presented in this study acknowledgments this work

896,the non fickian particle dispersion model was developed in this study to model two dimensional pollutant mixing in open channel flows the proposed model represents shear dispersion using step by step arithmetic calculations which consist of horizontal transport and vertical mixing steps instead of using fick s law in the sequential calculations the model directly applied the effect of vertical variations of both longitudinal and transverse velocities whereas the fickian dispersion model incorporates the effect of shear flow in the dispersion coefficients furthermore in order to avoid the numerical diffusion errors induced by the grid tracking method of previously developed non fickian dispersion models this model adopted the particle tracking technique to trace each particle the simulation results in the straight channel show that the proposed model reproduced the anomalous mixing which shows a non linear increase of variance with time and large skewness coefficient in the initial period however in the taylor period the variance and skewness of the concentration curves approached the fickian mixing the simulation results in the meandering channel reveal that the proposed model adequately reproduced the skewed concentration time curves of the experimental results whereas the fickian dispersion model ctm 2d generated symmetrical curves further comparison between the simulation results and the tracer test results conducted in the hongcheon river shows that the proposed model properly demonstrated the two dimensional mixing without adopting fick s law keywords 2d pollutant mixing non fickian dispersion model step by step calculation particle tracking technique initial period variance and skewness of concentration curves 1 introduction in streams and rivers in the intermediate mixing region after the completion of vertical mixing pollutant mixing can be modeled by adopting the two dimensional 2d dispersion theory as shown in fig 1 this mixing process is called shear flow dispersion in which for 2d shear flow shown in fig 1b and c the pollutant column is stretched due to the different velocities over the depth in both the longitudinal s and transverse n directions the stretched pollutant column is then well mixed due to the turbulent diffusion in the vertical direction after time t finally the pollutant cloud is widely dispersed and the depth averaged concentration curves spread wider with time as shown in fig 1d among the various mixing mechanisms affecting the mixing of pollutant slugs that are introduced into the streams and rivers the dispersion of the pollutant cloud by the shear flow is regarded as the most important because the shear flow is the largest fluctuation that controls the motion of water parcels over the whole flow field of the river daily and harleman 1966 schwab and rehmann 2015 in order to model the aforementioned dispersion mechanism using a 2d approach a 2d advection dispersion equation has previously been used fischer et al 1979 rutherford 1994 this equation can be derived by averaging the three dimensional 3d diffusion equation for turbulent flows over the depth rutherford 1994 in the natural coordinate system as 1 h c t h u s c s h u n c n s h ɛ l c s n h ɛ t c n s 0 h u s c d z n 0 h u n c d z where z is the vertical direction h is the water depth ε l and ε t are the longitudinal and transverse turbulent diffusion coefficients respectively u s and u n are the depth averaged velocity components corresponding to the s and n directions respectively u s u s u s us and un are the time averaged velocity components which vary over depth c is the depth averaged concentration c c c and c is the time averaged concentration as aforementioned the effect of the shear flow on the 2d mixing is incorporated into the correlation term on the right hand side of eq 1 and this dispersive mass flux is due to the combined effect of shear transport and vertical diffusion as shown in fig 1 to model the mass flux term on the right hand side of eq 1 fischer 1978 obtained the analytical solution of c z by simply expanding the one dimensional 1d dispersion theory originally introduced by taylor 1954 to 2d mixing then found the relation as follows 2a 0 h u s c d z h d l c s 2b 0 h u n c d z h d t c n where dl and dt are the longitudinal and transverse dispersion coefficients respectively this result concurs with the fickian diffusion for molecular diffusion this model is therefore called the 2d fickian dispersion model because the mass transport due to the combined effect of shear advection and vertical diffusion follows fick s law further in eq 2 the combined effect of shear flow and turbulent diffusion is incorporated into the single dispersion coefficient which is calculated by the following equation fischer 1978 3a d l 1 h 0 h u s 0 z 1 ɛ v 0 z u s d z d z d z 3b d t 1 h 0 h u n 0 z 1 ɛ v 0 z u n d z d z d z where ε v is the vertical turbulent diffusion coefficient as aforementioned the dispersion coefficient in eq 3 is the bulk mixing coefficient which integrates the shear effects of the velocity variation over the entire flow depth and thus is usually much larger than the turbulent diffusion coefficients daily and harleman 1966 finally the 2d fickian dispersion model can be derived by substituting eq 2 into eq 1 as follows 4 h c t h u s c s h u n c n s h d l c s n h d t c n the fickian dispersion model eq 4 has previously been used to analyze the 2d pollutant mixing problems both in the eulerian piasecki and katopodes 1999 king et al 2005 lee and seo 2007 2010 seo et al 2008 2010 and lagrangian frames dimou and adams 1993 weitbrecht et al 2004 suh 2006 however two major limitations arise in using the fickian dispersion model firstly the 2d fickian dispersion model demands the input of both longitudinal and transverse dispersion coefficients which are the most important parameters of the model however it is difficult to estimate these coefficients using eq 3 because the formula requires the vertical profiles of the longitudinal and transverse velocities which are not easily measured in the laboratory and field experiments thus a number of tracer studies have previously been conducted to find the 2d dispersion coefficients the transverse dispersion coefficient dt was obtained from the field tests using the continuous injection of tracers yotsukura et al 1970 holley and abraham 1973 jackman and yotsukura 1977 sayre 1979 beltaos 1980 lau and krishinapan 1981 holley and nerat 1983 rutherford 1994 boxall and guymer 2003 zhang and zhu 2011 while both dl and dt were obtained from the 2d tracer tests with instantaneously introduced tracers seo et al 2006 2016 baek and seo 2010 however despite the many field and laboratory studies it is still difficult to determine the dispersion coefficients from the measured concentration data since these coefficients strongly depend on the various hydraulic and geometric parameters of the river secondly the 2d fickian dispersion model has an inherent limitation since the 2d fickian dispersion model was derived based on the taylor s 1d dispersion theory thus as this model applied the same assumption that the balance between shear advection in the horizontal direction and the turbulent diffusion in the vertical direction is successfully achieved this model can be applied only after the so called initial period after the injection given by chatwin 1970 as 5 t i 0 4 h 2 ɛ v where ti is the initial period thus as presented by chatwin 1970 up to this time the concentration curves are asymmetrical while after sufficient time the so called taylor period the curves approach the symmetric distribution which would be predictable by the fickian dispersion model therefore in the initial period an alternative method to the fickian dispersion model to calculate the pollutant mixing is required instead of using fick s law to overcome these two limitations of taylor s model non fickian dispersion models that avoid the use of fick s law have been suggested aris 1956 using the concentration moment method obtained the same results of the 1d fickian dispersion model without introducing the assumption by taylor 1954 thus aris s theory can be applied to both the initial and taylor periods even though model equations are expressed via the moment of the concentration distribution chatwin 1970 also derived an asymptotic series solution based on aris s theory to analyze the asymmetric concentration curves in the initial period which was suggested as eq 5 to compute the concentrations in both the initial and taylor reaches fischer 1968 presented a step by step calculation method which calculates the shear advection and transverse diffusion steps sequentially the pollutant mixing in the initial period was therefore able to be analyzed without using taylor s theory the 1d step by step calculation method divides the continuous solute mixing procedure into discontinuous calculation steps which consist of the longitudinal shear advection eq 6a and the lateral mixing eq 6b according to the physical interpretation of the 1d shear dispersion as shown in fig 2 6a c i j t 1 c i j t h v u u c i 1 j t c i j t h v u u c i j t c i 1 j t 6b c i j t δ t c i j t 1 k t i j 1 c i j 1 t 1 c i j t 1 k t i j 1 c i j 1 t 1 c i j t 1 where i is the index of longitudinal grid j is the jth stream tube hv is the heaviside step function which equals 1 if the argument is positive and zero otherwise u is the dimensionless convective velocity t 1 is the time after the longitudinal advection δt is the time step and kt is the transfer coefficient between adjacent stream tubes in this method the pollutant cloud is transported to the downstream computational grid in the shear advection step and the concentration is then diffused to the next grid in the lateral mixing step fischer 1968 applied this method to simulate the green duwamish river using eight stream tubes based on the computation results of two different sources a line source and a point source he maintained that the effect of source type on the longitudinal variance is small the step by step calculation method was revisited by seo and son 2006 to simulate 1d longitudinal pollutant mixing in straight open channel flows in which they used empirical equations for a lateral velocity profile jung and seo 2013 was the first to adopt the step by step method for simulating 2d pollutant mixing in open channels in which they applied theoretical equations for the vertical velocity profiles by rozovskii 1957 and odgaard 1986 the equations for the sequential calculation to represent the 2d dispersion processes read as follows 7a c s n 1 z c s u s z δ t n 1 z 7b c s n 1 1 l i 1 l c s n 1 z i 7c c s 1 n z c s 1 n u n z δ t z 7d c s 1 n 1 l i 1 l c s 1 n z i where s 1 and n 1 are specific positions in longitudinal and transverse directions respectively l is the number of horizontal planes over the water depth eqs 7a and 7c describe the horizontal translations of the pollutant cloud caused by the skewed vertical velocity profiles the vertically well mixed pollutant cloud is then calculated using eqs 7b and 7d jung and seo 2013 maintained that their 2d model could generate the skewed concentration curves in the initial period and the symmetrical curves in the taylor period the aforementioned non fickian dispersion models based on the step by step calculation of shear advection and turbulent diffusion can be classified as the lagrangian method because the water parcels containing the pollutant mass are transported to the next computational grid by the velocity of each grid thus in these models advection due to shear flow can be adequately described even though random fluctuation by turbulent motion was not included however tracking of the polluted grid rather than tracking the individual pollutant particle would induce large computation errors due to the grid resolution this so called numerical diffusion error was defined by fischer 1968 as a function of time step and grid size and he suggested that the grid size should be small to ensure the effect of numerical diffusion remained insignificant compared to the physical dispersion thus in order to avoid this numerical error a particle tracking method in which random properties of pollutant transport can be modeled more effectively needs to be developed in this study the 2d particle dispersion model was developed to model the 2d pollutant mixing in both the initial and taylor periods without adopting fick s law the proposed model describes the physical process of shear dispersion through sequential calculations of the horizontal transport and vertical mixing of pollutant particles as an alternative to tracking the polluted grid in which particles are transported by both deterministic velocity component and random fluctuations the simulation results of the proposed model were compared with the fickian dispersion model and experimental results in the straight and meandering channels during the initial and taylor periods furthermore the applicability of the proposed model was tested against the tracer results obtained in the hongcheon river south korea 2 model development in this study the non fickian dispersion model based on the step by step calculation procedure was developed using the lagrangian particle tracking method in the surface water modeling the particle tracking method has been used for the simulation of various environmental problems such as prediction of larva migration dilution of heated water and transport of miscible and immiscible pollutants kitanidis 1994 pedersen et al 2003 chang et al 2011 hyun et al 2012 the non fickian particle tracking model developed in this study is named the 2d particle dispersion model 2d pdm in which the 2d dispersion by shear flow was calculated via the step by step calculation of shear advection and turbulent diffusion even though in reality the pollutant mixing procedures occur simultaneously following a similar scheme as that of the previous non fickian models the 2d pdm calculates the dispersion through two successive computational steps fischer 1968 seo and son 2006 jung and seo 2013 1 the horizontal transport step and 2 the vertical mixing step by performing this two step calculation this model could adequately represent the shear flow dispersion in the 2d shear flow of which mechanism was depicted in fig 1 in this study as aforementioned in applying the step by step calculation method 2d pdm described the shear dispersion through the sequential calculations of horizontal transport and vertical diffusion by tracking pollutant particles in each step furthermore unlike previous step by step calculation models fischer 1968 seo and son 2006 jung and seo 2013 in the horizontal transport step of 2d pdm particles are transported by both the deterministic velocity component and random fluctuations based on the itō stochastic differential equation as given in eq 8 itō and nisio 1964 8 δ x a δ t b δ w where δx δs δn is the transported distance of pollutant particles corresponding to the longitudinal and transverse directions a is the drift coefficient vector b is the diffusion coefficient matrix and δ w r δ t is the wiener process where r is the random number based on the theory presented by itō and nisio 1964 in the first step of 2d pdm which is the horizontal transport step each particle is advected by the average velocity and turbulent fluctuation the new position of each kth particle in both the s and n directions can then be written as fig 3 a 9a s k z t s a s k z t u s s k z t δ t r 2 ɛ h δ t 9b n k z t s a n k z t u n n k z t δ t r 2 ɛ h δ t where tsa is the time after the shear advection z is the vertical position of a particle ε h is the horizontal diffusion coefficient and sk nk is the position of the kth particle after shear advection and turbulent fluctuation in eq 9 the first term of the right hand side indicates the old position at time t the second term indicates advection by the deterministic velocity and the third term indicates the transport by the random fluctuation in the calculation of the second term the particles at the different vertical positions would each be translated by different velocities of us and un in the 2d pdm us and un were represented by the theoretical and empirical equations of the longitudinal and transverse velocity profiles because it is not easy to use measured velocity profiles the random fluctuation by the turbulent diffusion in the third term of eq 9 was represented by the random number r which follows the gaussian distribution fischer et al 1979 in this study r was generated using the box muller transform box and muller 1958 the turbulent diffusion coefficient ε h according to experimental studies reported in fischer et al 1979 was defined as follows 10 ɛ h β h u where β is a constant which ranges from 0 15 to 3 0 depending on the hydraulic and geometric conditions of streams and u is the shear velocity which is given in eq 11 11 u g r h s f where rh is the hydraulic radius s f n m u r h 2 3 2 the energy slope and nm is the manning s roughness coefficient in this study the turbulent field was assumed to be isotropic so that longitudinal and transverse diffusion would be the same ε l ε t ε h because the effect of turbulent motion is relatively minor in shear dominated flows the second step is the vertical mixing step in which horizontally transported particles at a specific horizontal plane were vertically migrated to the other plane as shown in fig 3b the vertical mixing step is necessary to rearrange the particles on other horizontal layers for transport by different velocities from the previous computation step in this study vertical mixing was modeled using three different schemes 1 random mixing 2 full mixing and 3 partial mixing in the random mixing scheme as shown in fig 4 a the vertical position of particles was determined by the turbulent fluctuations as given in eq 12 12 x i k z t v d x i k z r 2 ɛ v δ t t s a where x i k s k n k and tvd is the time after vertical mixing step in this study ε v was assumed to have a parabolic distribution over the flow depth fischer et al 1979 as follows 13 ɛ v κ h u z h 1 z h where κ is the von karman constant the random number r for the random mixing method was also generated by the box muller transform box and muller 1958 in this study the full mixing scheme was applied if the computational time step is selected to be larger than time for complete mixing tvm in the vertical direction in this scheme the particles were evenly distributed on all of the horizontal planes to represent the depth averaged concentration as follows fig 4b 14 x i k z t v d x i k z h l t s a where l is the number of horizontal planes the time for complete vertical mixing tvm is defined in eq 15 fischer et al 1979 rutherford 1994 jung and seo 2013 15 t v m 0 1 h 2 ɛ v the partial mixing scheme was applied after the pollutant particles are mixed fully over the flow depth by the full mixing scheme and the time step is smaller than tvm in this scheme as shown in fig 4c only a fraction of pollutant particles α colored in black was evenly distributed on the horizontal plane using the full mixing scheme and the other fraction of particles 1 α which were depicted as a gray color were randomly distributed by the random mixing scheme as follows 16 x i k z t v d x i k z h l t s a for α n p s n t s a x i k z r 2 ɛ z δ t t s a for 1 α n p s n t s a where α δt tvm and np is the number of particles in a water column the detailed computation algorithm of 2d pdm is shown in fig 5 a number of particles were first introduced to the injection point and the particle positions were stored in memory to trace the individual particles the vertical velocity profiles in the s and n directions were generated using theoretical equations and depth averaged velocity field computed with the 2d grid based shallow water models such as hdm 2d song et al 2012 because it is not easy to use the measured data of 2d depth averaged velocity field in open channels and streams thus the host cell which contains pollutant particles was searched to interpolate the depth averaged velocity at the location of particles using the point in polygon pip algorithm alciatore and mirnada 1995 after the host cell search and velocity interpolation the new position of each particle was calculated using the vertical profiles of velocity and the random transport in each plane in the horizontal transport step as shown in fig 3a in the vertical mixing step as shown in fig 3b the migrated particles in the horizontal translation step were redistributed over the flow depth to complete the 2d mixing after finishing the vertical mixing step the particle positions were stored and these two step calculations were started again until the end time t was reached 3 model verifications 3 1 mixing in the initial and taylor periods in this study pollutant mixing in the straight open channel flow was analyzed using 2d pdm in both the initial and taylor periods in this study flow in the straight channel was assumed to be the plane shear flow in which the vertical profile of longitudinal velocity has a logarithmic profile and the effect of transverse shear flow is negligible rutherford 1994 in the numerical modeling pollutant mixing simulations were conducted in various flow conditions in which the cross sectional averaged velocity u 1 0 m s and h were varied from 0 12 to 0 42 m as listed in table 1 for the simulation using 2d pdm 15 000 particles with 1 kg total mass were instantaneously introduced at the center of the channel and the time step δt was set as 0 4 s to satisfy the need for the courant number to be unity in these simulation conditions both ti and tvm increase when the width to depth ratio w h decreases as aforementioned the vertical profile of the longitudinal velocity for the calculation of horizontal translation was generated using the logarithmic profile as given in eq 17 rozovskii 1957 17 u s z u s 1 1 m 1 ln z h where m κ c h g g is the gravitational acceleration and c h r h 1 6 n m is the chezy coefficient in the case of the vertical profile of transverse velocity the effect of the 2nd kind secondary current which occurred in the straight channel was assumed to be neglected in the calculation of deterministic translation because the transverse shear flow is relatively weak rutherford 1994 thus the translation in the transverse mixing was calculated by the random component the third term of the right hand side of eq 9b in which ε h 0 15hu was adopted as the horizontal turbulent diffusion coefficient the simulation results of 2d pdm were compared with the analytical solution of the fickian dispersion model as given in eq 18 fischer et al 1979 18 c s n t m h 4 π t d l d t exp s s 0 u s t 2 4 d l t n n 0 2 4 d t t exp i n n 0 i w 2 4 d t t where s 0 n 0 is the injection point in this equation the effect of particle reflection at the channel side walls was accounted for in the second term in eq 18 dl was inputted as 5 93hu which was derived by elder 1959 using the logarithmic velocity profile and has been used for the simulation of 2d mixing lee and seo 2007 seo et al 2008 for the transverse dispersion d t h u 0 15 was used following the same condition as the 2d pdm simulation fig 6 shows comparisons of the simulation results by 2d pdm and the analytical solution of the fickian dispersion model in the condition of case wh13 since the 2d pdm calculated the particle positions after each time step the results were converted to a concentration distribution using eq 19 19 c s n m p h δ a i 1 l n p s n z i where mp is the mass of an individual particle and δa is the area of the computational grid by using eq 19 particle distributions were converted to the concentration field as shown in fig 6a in the initial period the shape of the pollutant cloud by the 2d pdm shows large discrepancies with the fickian dispersion model which generated the symmetrical contaminant cloud as shown in fig 6b after 36 s the asymmetric pollutant cloud of 2d pdm was gradually changed to a symmetric shape similar to the fickian dispersion model for the quantitative comparison the concentration distance curves were plotted at the center of the channel shown in fig 7 in the initial period the concentration distance curves from 2d pdm show a negatively skewed distribution in which the rising limb was steeper than the falling limb also the peak concentration of the 2d pdm results appeared at the front of the centroid and the peak value of 2d pdm was larger than the analytical solution after the initial period the leading edge of the pollutant cloud of the 2d pdm results was stretched to the downstream direction and the concentration curves were reshaped into a symmetrical distribution in the 2d pdm modeling pollutant particles in the upper plane where they have a faster velocity than in the lower plane were transported more rapidly than the particles in the lower plane these velocity deviations thus caused a long tail in the concentration curves as aforementioned after the horizontal transport the pollutant particles situated in the fast and slow horizontal planes were mixed during the vertical mixing step these combined processes realized by 2d pdm led to the equilibrium state between the shear advection and vertical mixing after sufficient time thereafter the concentration curves were transformed to a symmetrical distribution thus after the initial period the concentration curves in 2d pdm showed a similar distribution to that of the analytical solution of the fickian model the skewness coefficient of the concentration distance curves ξ by the 2d pdm were calculated to analyze the difference in the concentration curves between the initial and taylor periods the skewness coefficients of cases wh09 and wh13 were plotted against the dimensionless time tε z h 2 in fig 8 this figure clearly show that in both cases the skewness coefficient was very high in the initial period and the value gradually decreased after tε z h 2 0 4 which is the taylor period according to chatwin 1970 even though the skewness persisted after tε z h 2 1 0 the skewness coefficients of the simulation results were compared with the theoretical formula proposed by nordin and troutman 1980 in which the analytical solution of the skewness coefficient was derived in the assumption of the absence of a storage zone and large value of longitudinal distance as 20 ξ 3 2 k u s where ξ is the skewness coefficient of the concentration distance curve and k is the longitudinal dispersion coefficient in 1d pollutant mixing in this study k was replaced by d l h u 5 93 for applying in 2d mixing the comparison results show that the time change of ξ in 2d pdm follows the theoretical formula of eq 20 3 2 calculation results of the dispersion coefficients from the simulated particle distribution of the pollutant cloud by 2d pdm the dispersion coefficients can be calculated by applying the moment method in which the dispersion coefficients are estimated using the time rate of variance of the particle distribution in the assumption of fickian dispersion the time rate of variance shows the linear increase which means the invariant coefficient with time in contrast the variance change of non fickian dispersion shows a nonlinear increase with time due to the imbalance between the shear advection and vertical diffusion rutherford 1994 therefore the dispersion coefficients would change with time according to the definition of the moment method in this study the time change of the dispersion coefficients calculated from the results of 2d pdm were compared with the dispersion coefficients inputted in the fickian dispersion model of eq 18 the spatial variance of the discrete particle distributions obtained by 2d pdm can be calculated using eq 21 rowinski et al 2005 21a σ l 2 k 1 n p s k s 2 n p 21b σ t 2 k 1 n p n k n 2 n p where σ l 2 and σ t 2 are the spatial variances in the longitudinal and transverse directions respectively and s n 1 n p k 1 n p s k n k is the centroid of particle distribution in this study dl and dt were calculated by applying the moment method as follows 22a d l 1 2 d σ l 2 d t 22b d t 1 2 d σ t 2 d t the calculation results of dl hu and dt hu were plotted against dimensionless time tε z h 2 in fig 9 the dl hu was increased immediately after the particle injection and rapidly decreased until tε z h 2 0 4 which is the end of the initial period when tε z h 2 1 0 dl hu asymptotically reached the value of 5 58 5 88 which was similar to the theoretical value of elder 1959 namely 5 93 in the case of the transverse direction dt hu started at 0 20 then asymptotically approached 0 15 which was the same value as the theoretical value when tε z h 2 0 4 these results show that the time varying dispersion coefficients in the initial period indicate that the non fickian mixing is dominant and in the taylor period the fickian mixing which shows the constant dispersion coefficients is attained gradually the proposed model adequately reproduced non fickian and fickian mixing in both the initial and taylor periods 4 model validations and applications 4 1 meandering channel the pollutant transport simulations using the 2d pdm were conducted in the meandering channel which was depicted in fig 10 the simulation results were then compared with the tracer test results by seo and park 2009 in which the salt solution was introduced instantaneously as the vertical line source the meandering channel has a rectangular cross section with a channel width of 1 m and the two channel bends were connected with the straight part with a length of 1 m the experimental and simulation conditions in the meandering channel are listed in table 2 table 2 shows that all of the test sections of the meandering channel were located within the initial reach which was maintained to about 28 9 m and 39 6 m following the hydraulic conditions of cases 306 and 406 respectively flow fields for simulation of 2d pdm in the meandering channel were simulated using the 2d depth averaged flow analysis model hdm 2d developed by song et al 2012 using the depth averaged flow fields by hdm 2d the vertical velocity profiles in both the longitudinal and transverse directions were reproduced using the proposed velocity formulas in fig 11 using the proposed formulas the generated vertical velocity profiles over the flow depth were compared with the measurements of s4 of the meandering channel in the case of us z two logarithmic profiles and a power law were plotted with the measurements as shown in fig 11a in this figure the logarithmic profiles were suggested by rozovskii 1957 and fischer et al 1979 and the power law formula was derived by odgaard 1986 as shown in fig 11a both the log profile and the power law show good agreements with the measurements in the longitudinal direction thus in this study the logarithmic profile in eq 17 proposed by rozovskii 1957 was adopted to generate the vertical profile of the longitudinal velocity because the log profile was previously validated through several experimental and theoretical studies jackson 1981 in the case of un z the vertical profiles of velocity were generated to represent a spiral motion the 1st kind secondary current in the curved channels which occurred by the centrifugal force and the pressure difference in the channel bends due to the complexities of the secondary current many researchers have attempted to develop velocity formulas that represent adequate secondary currents rozovskii 1957 derived un z by establishing an of equilibrium between the centrifugal forces the pressure forces and the turbulent shear stresses kikkawa et al 1976 also proposed un z using the equation of motion with the assumption of the main flow following the velocity defect law furthermore odgaard 1986 derived un z by assuming that the transverse velocity has a linear profile from the equality between the centrifugal force and the transverse pressure gradient in an empirical approach jung 2012 proposed un z using dimensional analysis that considers the no slip boundary condition in the channel bed the aforementioned vertical velocity formulas in the transverse direction were compared with the measurements in fig 11b as shown in this figure among the various velocity profiles the linear profile suggested by odgaard 1986 shows good agreement with the measurements despite the limited applicable conditions such as constant channel width isotropic turbulence and large aspect ratio thus in this study the linear profile odgaard 1986 was adopted to reproduce the vertical velocity profile of transverse velocity as follows 23a u n z u n 2 v s z h 1 2 23b v s u s 2 m 1 2 κ 2 m h r c where rc is the radius of curvature solute transport simulations were conducted by using 2d pdm with the conditions listed in table 2 and 30 000 particles were introduced at the injection point as shown in fig 10 the simulation results of 2d pdm were compared with the ctm 2d which is the fickian dispersion model and a component of the river analysis software rams lee and seo 2007 the ctm 2d adopted the streamline upwind petrov galerkin su pg finite element scheme and the algebraic equations were solved using the frontal solver the ctm 2d incorporates a dispersion tensor which provides the spatially varied dispersion coefficients using eq 3 in which the longitudinal and transverse vertical profiles of velocity were generated using eqs 17 and 23 respectively seo et al 2011 showed that ctm 2d adequately reproduced the spatial distributions of dispersion coefficients when compared with the experimental results obtained in this meandering channel fig 12 shows comparisons of the concentration time curves at n w 0 45 of s4 s5 s6 and s9 while c 0 is the initial concentration of the injected tracer which is 100 000 ppm from the results the experimental data show a positively skewed distribution due to the interaction between the primary and secondary currents on the channel bends following the skewed distribution of the experimental data the 2d pdm reproduced the tail of the concentration curves fairly well on s6 and s9 even though the peak concentrations of the experiments on s4 were not simulated accurately by 2d pdm however ctm 2d failed to represent the skewed concentration curves in this study the shape of the concentration time curves was analyzed more quantitatively using the statistical values such as peak concentration cp time to peak concentration tp centroid μ t variance σ t 2 and skewness coefficient ξ t as given in below 24a m i 0 c s n t t i d t 24b μ t 2 m 1 m 0 24c σ t 2 m 2 m 0 μ t 2 24d ξ t m 3 m 0 3 μ t m 3 m 0 2 μ t 3 σ t 2 3 2 where mi is the ith moment of the concentration time curves table 3 shows that the average errors of the statistical values from the 2d pdm results were smaller than the errors of the ctm 2d especially the results of ξ t by 2d pdm were similar to the measurements whereas the results of ctm 2d show large discrepancies these errors of the fickian dispersion model were caused by the assumption of taylor s theory in which the effect of shear dispersion is represented only by the dispersion coefficient 4 2 application in the natural rivers the applicability of the 2d pdm was tested against the tracer test results carried out in the curved reach of the hongcheon river on october 25 27 in 2015 the hongcheon river is a tributary of the north han river inflow to the paldang lake which is an important source of water supply to metropolitan seoul and nearby cities the study reach has a moderately curved shape and irregular channel boundaries as shown in fig 13 a in this study reach the complex flow structures induced by the channel topography disturb the balance between the shear advection and vertical diffusion in the tracer study the fluorescent dye rhodamine wt widely used for tracer studies in natural streams as it is environmentally safe and has high detectability rowinski et al 2007 seo et al 2016 was used as a tracer material even though rhodamine wt might lead to a non conservative substance by sorption in contact with suspended solids runkel 2015 in this study it was treated as a conservative tracer because experimental time was relatively short de smedt et al 2005 for the tracer study 1 5 l of 20 000 ppm rhodamine wt was instantaneously introduced with the vertical line source at the injection point shown in fig 13a to measure the concentration of fluorescent dye the ysi 600oms equipped with the ysi 6130 optic sensor was installed on each tag line shown in fig 13a in each meandering section 6 7 sensors were laterally deployed to measure the lateral variation of concentration curves in the same tag line the velocity data were obtained using the adcp m9 manufactured by sontek and the measured hydraulic data along with simulation conditions are listed in table 4 flow fields in the hongcheon river were simulated using the hdm 2d model in which a computational mesh was constructed based on the topography data measured by rtk gps the depth averaged velocity distributions and water depth are shown in fig 13b and c in which the flow patterns dramatically changed between sections 1 and 4 due to the abrupt contraction of the channel width and bottom topography change thus the wide and slow flow between sections 1 and 2 became a shallow and fast flow between sections 3 and 4 furthermore the horizontal recirculation zone shown in fig 3b occurred near the left bank of section 4 due to the irregular sidewall embayment using the depth averaged flow field shown in fig 13b and c the vertical profiles of velocity were generated using eqs 17 and 23 for the simulation using 2d pdm the simulation conditions of 2d pdm are listed in table 4 in which nm and rc were manipulated following the flow patterns of the study reach fig 14 shows that the tail of the tracer cloud was bifurcated due to the sidewall friction which is similar to the aerial photo of the tracer cloud shown in fig 13a the tracer cloud was more stretched at the contraction part between section 2 and section 3 and the particles were then trapped at the horizontal recirculation zone near section 4 fig 15 shows comparisons of concentration time curves at two lateral points of each section at which the peak concentration occurred this figure reveals that the concentration curves were almost symmetrical at section 1 while the long tail of the concentration time curves in section 2 occurred due to the sidewall friction in section 3 the tracer cloud was more skewed whilst crossing the contraction part and the concentration time curves were smeared by the small eddies at the shallow and fast flow region of upstream the simulation results by 2d pdm showed that the rising and falling limbs of the breakthrough curves were properly fitted to the measurements even though the peak concentration was somewhat overestimated the statistical properties of the peak concentration curves in sections 1 and 2 are compared in table 5 the results show that the peak concentration arrived faster than the centroid of curves in both the experimental and simulation results and the results of ξ t were similar to the measurements therefore the 2d pdm properly reproduced the 2d mixing without adopting the fick s law in the hongcheon river where concentration curves were skewed due to the complex channel boundaries and flow structures 5 conclusions in this study the 2d particle dispersion model 2d pdm was developed to model the 2d pollutant mixing in open channel flows instead of using the taylor s approach the 2d pdm adopted the step by step arithmetic calculation method to reproduce shear dispersion by the vertical variations of the longitudinal and transverse velocities the calculation procedures of 2d pdm included the horizontal transport and vertical mixing steps in the horizontal transport step the introduced pollutant particles were transported by both the longitudinal and transverse vertical velocity profiles and the random turbulent fluctuations after the horizontal transport the vertical position of particles was redistributed by the vertical mixing methods which were classified into full mixing partial mixing and random mixing schemes according to the simulation conditions thus the 2d pdm could calculate the solute transport without inputting the dispersion coefficient and the model is applicable not only in the taylor period but also in the initial period where the taylor s assumption is not applicable the 2d pdm was applied to a straight open channel where the plane shear flow is dominant and the simulation results of 2d pdm were compared with the analytical solution of the fickian dispersion model the concentration distance curves from the fickian dispersion model show the symmetrical distribution in the entire region whereas the results of 2d pdm provided the asymmetrical distribution during the initial period and these anomalous concentration curves gradually approached the symmetrical distribution in the taylor period these results can also be explained by the change of skewness coefficient which was abruptly increased at the instant of pollutant injection and the value was slowly decreased after the initial period furthermore the dispersion coefficients in both the longitudinal and transverse directions changed with time during the initial period due to the nonlinear increase of variance whereas they showed nearly invariant values during the taylor period after finishing the initial period the calculation results of the dimensionless longitudinal dispersion coefficient were in the range of 5 58 5 88 which was similar to the theoretical study by elder 1959 from these results 2d pdm can reproduce non fickian mixing in the initial period and fickian mixing in the taylor period the simulation results of 2d pdm were tested against the tracer test results in the meandering channel and the hongcheon river for the simulation of 2d pdm the vertical profiles of velocity were generated using the logarithmic profile for the longitudinal velocity and linear profile for the transverse velocity the comparisons of the concentration time curves in the meandering channel show that the simulation results of 2d pdm reproduced the tail of concentration curves fairly well whereas the results of ctm 2d failed to calculate the skewed concentration curves the calculation results of the skewness coefficient by 2d pdm show 0 113 3 errors and the errors of most statistical parameters were smaller than the results of ctm 2d furthermore the proposed model properly demonstrated the tail of breakthrough curves caused by the irregular channel boundaries in the hongcheon river and the calculation results of the skewness coefficient was in the range of 4 1 to 6 5 from these results it can be concluded that the proposed model which directly calculates the effect of vertical variations of velocity can provide reasonable results for the 2d mixing problems in the meandering channels and streams acknowledgments this research was supported by a grant 11 ti c06 from advanced water management research program funded by ministry of land infrastructure and transport of korean government

896,the non fickian particle dispersion model was developed in this study to model two dimensional pollutant mixing in open channel flows the proposed model represents shear dispersion using step by step arithmetic calculations which consist of horizontal transport and vertical mixing steps instead of using fick s law in the sequential calculations the model directly applied the effect of vertical variations of both longitudinal and transverse velocities whereas the fickian dispersion model incorporates the effect of shear flow in the dispersion coefficients furthermore in order to avoid the numerical diffusion errors induced by the grid tracking method of previously developed non fickian dispersion models this model adopted the particle tracking technique to trace each particle the simulation results in the straight channel show that the proposed model reproduced the anomalous mixing which shows a non linear increase of variance with time and large skewness coefficient in the initial period however in the taylor period the variance and skewness of the concentration curves approached the fickian mixing the simulation results in the meandering channel reveal that the proposed model adequately reproduced the skewed concentration time curves of the experimental results whereas the fickian dispersion model ctm 2d generated symmetrical curves further comparison between the simulation results and the tracer test results conducted in the hongcheon river shows that the proposed model properly demonstrated the two dimensional mixing without adopting fick s law keywords 2d pollutant mixing non fickian dispersion model step by step calculation particle tracking technique initial period variance and skewness of concentration curves 1 introduction in streams and rivers in the intermediate mixing region after the completion of vertical mixing pollutant mixing can be modeled by adopting the two dimensional 2d dispersion theory as shown in fig 1 this mixing process is called shear flow dispersion in which for 2d shear flow shown in fig 1b and c the pollutant column is stretched due to the different velocities over the depth in both the longitudinal s and transverse n directions the stretched pollutant column is then well mixed due to the turbulent diffusion in the vertical direction after time t finally the pollutant cloud is widely dispersed and the depth averaged concentration curves spread wider with time as shown in fig 1d among the various mixing mechanisms affecting the mixing of pollutant slugs that are introduced into the streams and rivers the dispersion of the pollutant cloud by the shear flow is regarded as the most important because the shear flow is the largest fluctuation that controls the motion of water parcels over the whole flow field of the river daily and harleman 1966 schwab and rehmann 2015 in order to model the aforementioned dispersion mechanism using a 2d approach a 2d advection dispersion equation has previously been used fischer et al 1979 rutherford 1994 this equation can be derived by averaging the three dimensional 3d diffusion equation for turbulent flows over the depth rutherford 1994 in the natural coordinate system as 1 h c t h u s c s h u n c n s h ɛ l c s n h ɛ t c n s 0 h u s c d z n 0 h u n c d z where z is the vertical direction h is the water depth ε l and ε t are the longitudinal and transverse turbulent diffusion coefficients respectively u s and u n are the depth averaged velocity components corresponding to the s and n directions respectively u s u s u s us and un are the time averaged velocity components which vary over depth c is the depth averaged concentration c c c and c is the time averaged concentration as aforementioned the effect of the shear flow on the 2d mixing is incorporated into the correlation term on the right hand side of eq 1 and this dispersive mass flux is due to the combined effect of shear transport and vertical diffusion as shown in fig 1 to model the mass flux term on the right hand side of eq 1 fischer 1978 obtained the analytical solution of c z by simply expanding the one dimensional 1d dispersion theory originally introduced by taylor 1954 to 2d mixing then found the relation as follows 2a 0 h u s c d z h d l c s 2b 0 h u n c d z h d t c n where dl and dt are the longitudinal and transverse dispersion coefficients respectively this result concurs with the fickian diffusion for molecular diffusion this model is therefore called the 2d fickian dispersion model because the mass transport due to the combined effect of shear advection and vertical diffusion follows fick s law further in eq 2 the combined effect of shear flow and turbulent diffusion is incorporated into the single dispersion coefficient which is calculated by the following equation fischer 1978 3a d l 1 h 0 h u s 0 z 1 ɛ v 0 z u s d z d z d z 3b d t 1 h 0 h u n 0 z 1 ɛ v 0 z u n d z d z d z where ε v is the vertical turbulent diffusion coefficient as aforementioned the dispersion coefficient in eq 3 is the bulk mixing coefficient which integrates the shear effects of the velocity variation over the entire flow depth and thus is usually much larger than the turbulent diffusion coefficients daily and harleman 1966 finally the 2d fickian dispersion model can be derived by substituting eq 2 into eq 1 as follows 4 h c t h u s c s h u n c n s h d l c s n h d t c n the fickian dispersion model eq 4 has previously been used to analyze the 2d pollutant mixing problems both in the eulerian piasecki and katopodes 1999 king et al 2005 lee and seo 2007 2010 seo et al 2008 2010 and lagrangian frames dimou and adams 1993 weitbrecht et al 2004 suh 2006 however two major limitations arise in using the fickian dispersion model firstly the 2d fickian dispersion model demands the input of both longitudinal and transverse dispersion coefficients which are the most important parameters of the model however it is difficult to estimate these coefficients using eq 3 because the formula requires the vertical profiles of the longitudinal and transverse velocities which are not easily measured in the laboratory and field experiments thus a number of tracer studies have previously been conducted to find the 2d dispersion coefficients the transverse dispersion coefficient dt was obtained from the field tests using the continuous injection of tracers yotsukura et al 1970 holley and abraham 1973 jackman and yotsukura 1977 sayre 1979 beltaos 1980 lau and krishinapan 1981 holley and nerat 1983 rutherford 1994 boxall and guymer 2003 zhang and zhu 2011 while both dl and dt were obtained from the 2d tracer tests with instantaneously introduced tracers seo et al 2006 2016 baek and seo 2010 however despite the many field and laboratory studies it is still difficult to determine the dispersion coefficients from the measured concentration data since these coefficients strongly depend on the various hydraulic and geometric parameters of the river secondly the 2d fickian dispersion model has an inherent limitation since the 2d fickian dispersion model was derived based on the taylor s 1d dispersion theory thus as this model applied the same assumption that the balance between shear advection in the horizontal direction and the turbulent diffusion in the vertical direction is successfully achieved this model can be applied only after the so called initial period after the injection given by chatwin 1970 as 5 t i 0 4 h 2 ɛ v where ti is the initial period thus as presented by chatwin 1970 up to this time the concentration curves are asymmetrical while after sufficient time the so called taylor period the curves approach the symmetric distribution which would be predictable by the fickian dispersion model therefore in the initial period an alternative method to the fickian dispersion model to calculate the pollutant mixing is required instead of using fick s law to overcome these two limitations of taylor s model non fickian dispersion models that avoid the use of fick s law have been suggested aris 1956 using the concentration moment method obtained the same results of the 1d fickian dispersion model without introducing the assumption by taylor 1954 thus aris s theory can be applied to both the initial and taylor periods even though model equations are expressed via the moment of the concentration distribution chatwin 1970 also derived an asymptotic series solution based on aris s theory to analyze the asymmetric concentration curves in the initial period which was suggested as eq 5 to compute the concentrations in both the initial and taylor reaches fischer 1968 presented a step by step calculation method which calculates the shear advection and transverse diffusion steps sequentially the pollutant mixing in the initial period was therefore able to be analyzed without using taylor s theory the 1d step by step calculation method divides the continuous solute mixing procedure into discontinuous calculation steps which consist of the longitudinal shear advection eq 6a and the lateral mixing eq 6b according to the physical interpretation of the 1d shear dispersion as shown in fig 2 6a c i j t 1 c i j t h v u u c i 1 j t c i j t h v u u c i j t c i 1 j t 6b c i j t δ t c i j t 1 k t i j 1 c i j 1 t 1 c i j t 1 k t i j 1 c i j 1 t 1 c i j t 1 where i is the index of longitudinal grid j is the jth stream tube hv is the heaviside step function which equals 1 if the argument is positive and zero otherwise u is the dimensionless convective velocity t 1 is the time after the longitudinal advection δt is the time step and kt is the transfer coefficient between adjacent stream tubes in this method the pollutant cloud is transported to the downstream computational grid in the shear advection step and the concentration is then diffused to the next grid in the lateral mixing step fischer 1968 applied this method to simulate the green duwamish river using eight stream tubes based on the computation results of two different sources a line source and a point source he maintained that the effect of source type on the longitudinal variance is small the step by step calculation method was revisited by seo and son 2006 to simulate 1d longitudinal pollutant mixing in straight open channel flows in which they used empirical equations for a lateral velocity profile jung and seo 2013 was the first to adopt the step by step method for simulating 2d pollutant mixing in open channels in which they applied theoretical equations for the vertical velocity profiles by rozovskii 1957 and odgaard 1986 the equations for the sequential calculation to represent the 2d dispersion processes read as follows 7a c s n 1 z c s u s z δ t n 1 z 7b c s n 1 1 l i 1 l c s n 1 z i 7c c s 1 n z c s 1 n u n z δ t z 7d c s 1 n 1 l i 1 l c s 1 n z i where s 1 and n 1 are specific positions in longitudinal and transverse directions respectively l is the number of horizontal planes over the water depth eqs 7a and 7c describe the horizontal translations of the pollutant cloud caused by the skewed vertical velocity profiles the vertically well mixed pollutant cloud is then calculated using eqs 7b and 7d jung and seo 2013 maintained that their 2d model could generate the skewed concentration curves in the initial period and the symmetrical curves in the taylor period the aforementioned non fickian dispersion models based on the step by step calculation of shear advection and turbulent diffusion can be classified as the lagrangian method because the water parcels containing the pollutant mass are transported to the next computational grid by the velocity of each grid thus in these models advection due to shear flow can be adequately described even though random fluctuation by turbulent motion was not included however tracking of the polluted grid rather than tracking the individual pollutant particle would induce large computation errors due to the grid resolution this so called numerical diffusion error was defined by fischer 1968 as a function of time step and grid size and he suggested that the grid size should be small to ensure the effect of numerical diffusion remained insignificant compared to the physical dispersion thus in order to avoid this numerical error a particle tracking method in which random properties of pollutant transport can be modeled more effectively needs to be developed in this study the 2d particle dispersion model was developed to model the 2d pollutant mixing in both the initial and taylor periods without adopting fick s law the proposed model describes the physical process of shear dispersion through sequential calculations of the horizontal transport and vertical mixing of pollutant particles as an alternative to tracking the polluted grid in which particles are transported by both deterministic velocity component and random fluctuations the simulation results of the proposed model were compared with the fickian dispersion model and experimental results in the straight and meandering channels during the initial and taylor periods furthermore the applicability of the proposed model was tested against the tracer results obtained in the hongcheon river south korea 2 model development in this study the non fickian dispersion model based on the step by step calculation procedure was developed using the lagrangian particle tracking method in the surface water modeling the particle tracking method has been used for the simulation of various environmental problems such as prediction of larva migration dilution of heated water and transport of miscible and immiscible pollutants kitanidis 1994 pedersen et al 2003 chang et al 2011 hyun et al 2012 the non fickian particle tracking model developed in this study is named the 2d particle dispersion model 2d pdm in which the 2d dispersion by shear flow was calculated via the step by step calculation of shear advection and turbulent diffusion even though in reality the pollutant mixing procedures occur simultaneously following a similar scheme as that of the previous non fickian models the 2d pdm calculates the dispersion through two successive computational steps fischer 1968 seo and son 2006 jung and seo 2013 1 the horizontal transport step and 2 the vertical mixing step by performing this two step calculation this model could adequately represent the shear flow dispersion in the 2d shear flow of which mechanism was depicted in fig 1 in this study as aforementioned in applying the step by step calculation method 2d pdm described the shear dispersion through the sequential calculations of horizontal transport and vertical diffusion by tracking pollutant particles in each step furthermore unlike previous step by step calculation models fischer 1968 seo and son 2006 jung and seo 2013 in the horizontal transport step of 2d pdm particles are transported by both the deterministic velocity component and random fluctuations based on the itō stochastic differential equation as given in eq 8 itō and nisio 1964 8 δ x a δ t b δ w where δx δs δn is the transported distance of pollutant particles corresponding to the longitudinal and transverse directions a is the drift coefficient vector b is the diffusion coefficient matrix and δ w r δ t is the wiener process where r is the random number based on the theory presented by itō and nisio 1964 in the first step of 2d pdm which is the horizontal transport step each particle is advected by the average velocity and turbulent fluctuation the new position of each kth particle in both the s and n directions can then be written as fig 3 a 9a s k z t s a s k z t u s s k z t δ t r 2 ɛ h δ t 9b n k z t s a n k z t u n n k z t δ t r 2 ɛ h δ t where tsa is the time after the shear advection z is the vertical position of a particle ε h is the horizontal diffusion coefficient and sk nk is the position of the kth particle after shear advection and turbulent fluctuation in eq 9 the first term of the right hand side indicates the old position at time t the second term indicates advection by the deterministic velocity and the third term indicates the transport by the random fluctuation in the calculation of the second term the particles at the different vertical positions would each be translated by different velocities of us and un in the 2d pdm us and un were represented by the theoretical and empirical equations of the longitudinal and transverse velocity profiles because it is not easy to use measured velocity profiles the random fluctuation by the turbulent diffusion in the third term of eq 9 was represented by the random number r which follows the gaussian distribution fischer et al 1979 in this study r was generated using the box muller transform box and muller 1958 the turbulent diffusion coefficient ε h according to experimental studies reported in fischer et al 1979 was defined as follows 10 ɛ h β h u where β is a constant which ranges from 0 15 to 3 0 depending on the hydraulic and geometric conditions of streams and u is the shear velocity which is given in eq 11 11 u g r h s f where rh is the hydraulic radius s f n m u r h 2 3 2 the energy slope and nm is the manning s roughness coefficient in this study the turbulent field was assumed to be isotropic so that longitudinal and transverse diffusion would be the same ε l ε t ε h because the effect of turbulent motion is relatively minor in shear dominated flows the second step is the vertical mixing step in which horizontally transported particles at a specific horizontal plane were vertically migrated to the other plane as shown in fig 3b the vertical mixing step is necessary to rearrange the particles on other horizontal layers for transport by different velocities from the previous computation step in this study vertical mixing was modeled using three different schemes 1 random mixing 2 full mixing and 3 partial mixing in the random mixing scheme as shown in fig 4 a the vertical position of particles was determined by the turbulent fluctuations as given in eq 12 12 x i k z t v d x i k z r 2 ɛ v δ t t s a where x i k s k n k and tvd is the time after vertical mixing step in this study ε v was assumed to have a parabolic distribution over the flow depth fischer et al 1979 as follows 13 ɛ v κ h u z h 1 z h where κ is the von karman constant the random number r for the random mixing method was also generated by the box muller transform box and muller 1958 in this study the full mixing scheme was applied if the computational time step is selected to be larger than time for complete mixing tvm in the vertical direction in this scheme the particles were evenly distributed on all of the horizontal planes to represent the depth averaged concentration as follows fig 4b 14 x i k z t v d x i k z h l t s a where l is the number of horizontal planes the time for complete vertical mixing tvm is defined in eq 15 fischer et al 1979 rutherford 1994 jung and seo 2013 15 t v m 0 1 h 2 ɛ v the partial mixing scheme was applied after the pollutant particles are mixed fully over the flow depth by the full mixing scheme and the time step is smaller than tvm in this scheme as shown in fig 4c only a fraction of pollutant particles α colored in black was evenly distributed on the horizontal plane using the full mixing scheme and the other fraction of particles 1 α which were depicted as a gray color were randomly distributed by the random mixing scheme as follows 16 x i k z t v d x i k z h l t s a for α n p s n t s a x i k z r 2 ɛ z δ t t s a for 1 α n p s n t s a where α δt tvm and np is the number of particles in a water column the detailed computation algorithm of 2d pdm is shown in fig 5 a number of particles were first introduced to the injection point and the particle positions were stored in memory to trace the individual particles the vertical velocity profiles in the s and n directions were generated using theoretical equations and depth averaged velocity field computed with the 2d grid based shallow water models such as hdm 2d song et al 2012 because it is not easy to use the measured data of 2d depth averaged velocity field in open channels and streams thus the host cell which contains pollutant particles was searched to interpolate the depth averaged velocity at the location of particles using the point in polygon pip algorithm alciatore and mirnada 1995 after the host cell search and velocity interpolation the new position of each particle was calculated using the vertical profiles of velocity and the random transport in each plane in the horizontal transport step as shown in fig 3a in the vertical mixing step as shown in fig 3b the migrated particles in the horizontal translation step were redistributed over the flow depth to complete the 2d mixing after finishing the vertical mixing step the particle positions were stored and these two step calculations were started again until the end time t was reached 3 model verifications 3 1 mixing in the initial and taylor periods in this study pollutant mixing in the straight open channel flow was analyzed using 2d pdm in both the initial and taylor periods in this study flow in the straight channel was assumed to be the plane shear flow in which the vertical profile of longitudinal velocity has a logarithmic profile and the effect of transverse shear flow is negligible rutherford 1994 in the numerical modeling pollutant mixing simulations were conducted in various flow conditions in which the cross sectional averaged velocity u 1 0 m s and h were varied from 0 12 to 0 42 m as listed in table 1 for the simulation using 2d pdm 15 000 particles with 1 kg total mass were instantaneously introduced at the center of the channel and the time step δt was set as 0 4 s to satisfy the need for the courant number to be unity in these simulation conditions both ti and tvm increase when the width to depth ratio w h decreases as aforementioned the vertical profile of the longitudinal velocity for the calculation of horizontal translation was generated using the logarithmic profile as given in eq 17 rozovskii 1957 17 u s z u s 1 1 m 1 ln z h where m κ c h g g is the gravitational acceleration and c h r h 1 6 n m is the chezy coefficient in the case of the vertical profile of transverse velocity the effect of the 2nd kind secondary current which occurred in the straight channel was assumed to be neglected in the calculation of deterministic translation because the transverse shear flow is relatively weak rutherford 1994 thus the translation in the transverse mixing was calculated by the random component the third term of the right hand side of eq 9b in which ε h 0 15hu was adopted as the horizontal turbulent diffusion coefficient the simulation results of 2d pdm were compared with the analytical solution of the fickian dispersion model as given in eq 18 fischer et al 1979 18 c s n t m h 4 π t d l d t exp s s 0 u s t 2 4 d l t n n 0 2 4 d t t exp i n n 0 i w 2 4 d t t where s 0 n 0 is the injection point in this equation the effect of particle reflection at the channel side walls was accounted for in the second term in eq 18 dl was inputted as 5 93hu which was derived by elder 1959 using the logarithmic velocity profile and has been used for the simulation of 2d mixing lee and seo 2007 seo et al 2008 for the transverse dispersion d t h u 0 15 was used following the same condition as the 2d pdm simulation fig 6 shows comparisons of the simulation results by 2d pdm and the analytical solution of the fickian dispersion model in the condition of case wh13 since the 2d pdm calculated the particle positions after each time step the results were converted to a concentration distribution using eq 19 19 c s n m p h δ a i 1 l n p s n z i where mp is the mass of an individual particle and δa is the area of the computational grid by using eq 19 particle distributions were converted to the concentration field as shown in fig 6a in the initial period the shape of the pollutant cloud by the 2d pdm shows large discrepancies with the fickian dispersion model which generated the symmetrical contaminant cloud as shown in fig 6b after 36 s the asymmetric pollutant cloud of 2d pdm was gradually changed to a symmetric shape similar to the fickian dispersion model for the quantitative comparison the concentration distance curves were plotted at the center of the channel shown in fig 7 in the initial period the concentration distance curves from 2d pdm show a negatively skewed distribution in which the rising limb was steeper than the falling limb also the peak concentration of the 2d pdm results appeared at the front of the centroid and the peak value of 2d pdm was larger than the analytical solution after the initial period the leading edge of the pollutant cloud of the 2d pdm results was stretched to the downstream direction and the concentration curves were reshaped into a symmetrical distribution in the 2d pdm modeling pollutant particles in the upper plane where they have a faster velocity than in the lower plane were transported more rapidly than the particles in the lower plane these velocity deviations thus caused a long tail in the concentration curves as aforementioned after the horizontal transport the pollutant particles situated in the fast and slow horizontal planes were mixed during the vertical mixing step these combined processes realized by 2d pdm led to the equilibrium state between the shear advection and vertical mixing after sufficient time thereafter the concentration curves were transformed to a symmetrical distribution thus after the initial period the concentration curves in 2d pdm showed a similar distribution to that of the analytical solution of the fickian model the skewness coefficient of the concentration distance curves ξ by the 2d pdm were calculated to analyze the difference in the concentration curves between the initial and taylor periods the skewness coefficients of cases wh09 and wh13 were plotted against the dimensionless time tε z h 2 in fig 8 this figure clearly show that in both cases the skewness coefficient was very high in the initial period and the value gradually decreased after tε z h 2 0 4 which is the taylor period according to chatwin 1970 even though the skewness persisted after tε z h 2 1 0 the skewness coefficients of the simulation results were compared with the theoretical formula proposed by nordin and troutman 1980 in which the analytical solution of the skewness coefficient was derived in the assumption of the absence of a storage zone and large value of longitudinal distance as 20 ξ 3 2 k u s where ξ is the skewness coefficient of the concentration distance curve and k is the longitudinal dispersion coefficient in 1d pollutant mixing in this study k was replaced by d l h u 5 93 for applying in 2d mixing the comparison results show that the time change of ξ in 2d pdm follows the theoretical formula of eq 20 3 2 calculation results of the dispersion coefficients from the simulated particle distribution of the pollutant cloud by 2d pdm the dispersion coefficients can be calculated by applying the moment method in which the dispersion coefficients are estimated using the time rate of variance of the particle distribution in the assumption of fickian dispersion the time rate of variance shows the linear increase which means the invariant coefficient with time in contrast the variance change of non fickian dispersion shows a nonlinear increase with time due to the imbalance between the shear advection and vertical diffusion rutherford 1994 therefore the dispersion coefficients would change with time according to the definition of the moment method in this study the time change of the dispersion coefficients calculated from the results of 2d pdm were compared with the dispersion coefficients inputted in the fickian dispersion model of eq 18 the spatial variance of the discrete particle distributions obtained by 2d pdm can be calculated using eq 21 rowinski et al 2005 21a σ l 2 k 1 n p s k s 2 n p 21b σ t 2 k 1 n p n k n 2 n p where σ l 2 and σ t 2 are the spatial variances in the longitudinal and transverse directions respectively and s n 1 n p k 1 n p s k n k is the centroid of particle distribution in this study dl and dt were calculated by applying the moment method as follows 22a d l 1 2 d σ l 2 d t 22b d t 1 2 d σ t 2 d t the calculation results of dl hu and dt hu were plotted against dimensionless time tε z h 2 in fig 9 the dl hu was increased immediately after the particle injection and rapidly decreased until tε z h 2 0 4 which is the end of the initial period when tε z h 2 1 0 dl hu asymptotically reached the value of 5 58 5 88 which was similar to the theoretical value of elder 1959 namely 5 93 in the case of the transverse direction dt hu started at 0 20 then asymptotically approached 0 15 which was the same value as the theoretical value when tε z h 2 0 4 these results show that the time varying dispersion coefficients in the initial period indicate that the non fickian mixing is dominant and in the taylor period the fickian mixing which shows the constant dispersion coefficients is attained gradually the proposed model adequately reproduced non fickian and fickian mixing in both the initial and taylor periods 4 model validations and applications 4 1 meandering channel the pollutant transport simulations using the 2d pdm were conducted in the meandering channel which was depicted in fig 10 the simulation results were then compared with the tracer test results by seo and park 2009 in which the salt solution was introduced instantaneously as the vertical line source the meandering channel has a rectangular cross section with a channel width of 1 m and the two channel bends were connected with the straight part with a length of 1 m the experimental and simulation conditions in the meandering channel are listed in table 2 table 2 shows that all of the test sections of the meandering channel were located within the initial reach which was maintained to about 28 9 m and 39 6 m following the hydraulic conditions of cases 306 and 406 respectively flow fields for simulation of 2d pdm in the meandering channel were simulated using the 2d depth averaged flow analysis model hdm 2d developed by song et al 2012 using the depth averaged flow fields by hdm 2d the vertical velocity profiles in both the longitudinal and transverse directions were reproduced using the proposed velocity formulas in fig 11 using the proposed formulas the generated vertical velocity profiles over the flow depth were compared with the measurements of s4 of the meandering channel in the case of us z two logarithmic profiles and a power law were plotted with the measurements as shown in fig 11a in this figure the logarithmic profiles were suggested by rozovskii 1957 and fischer et al 1979 and the power law formula was derived by odgaard 1986 as shown in fig 11a both the log profile and the power law show good agreements with the measurements in the longitudinal direction thus in this study the logarithmic profile in eq 17 proposed by rozovskii 1957 was adopted to generate the vertical profile of the longitudinal velocity because the log profile was previously validated through several experimental and theoretical studies jackson 1981 in the case of un z the vertical profiles of velocity were generated to represent a spiral motion the 1st kind secondary current in the curved channels which occurred by the centrifugal force and the pressure difference in the channel bends due to the complexities of the secondary current many researchers have attempted to develop velocity formulas that represent adequate secondary currents rozovskii 1957 derived un z by establishing an of equilibrium between the centrifugal forces the pressure forces and the turbulent shear stresses kikkawa et al 1976 also proposed un z using the equation of motion with the assumption of the main flow following the velocity defect law furthermore odgaard 1986 derived un z by assuming that the transverse velocity has a linear profile from the equality between the centrifugal force and the transverse pressure gradient in an empirical approach jung 2012 proposed un z using dimensional analysis that considers the no slip boundary condition in the channel bed the aforementioned vertical velocity formulas in the transverse direction were compared with the measurements in fig 11b as shown in this figure among the various velocity profiles the linear profile suggested by odgaard 1986 shows good agreement with the measurements despite the limited applicable conditions such as constant channel width isotropic turbulence and large aspect ratio thus in this study the linear profile odgaard 1986 was adopted to reproduce the vertical velocity profile of transverse velocity as follows 23a u n z u n 2 v s z h 1 2 23b v s u s 2 m 1 2 κ 2 m h r c where rc is the radius of curvature solute transport simulations were conducted by using 2d pdm with the conditions listed in table 2 and 30 000 particles were introduced at the injection point as shown in fig 10 the simulation results of 2d pdm were compared with the ctm 2d which is the fickian dispersion model and a component of the river analysis software rams lee and seo 2007 the ctm 2d adopted the streamline upwind petrov galerkin su pg finite element scheme and the algebraic equations were solved using the frontal solver the ctm 2d incorporates a dispersion tensor which provides the spatially varied dispersion coefficients using eq 3 in which the longitudinal and transverse vertical profiles of velocity were generated using eqs 17 and 23 respectively seo et al 2011 showed that ctm 2d adequately reproduced the spatial distributions of dispersion coefficients when compared with the experimental results obtained in this meandering channel fig 12 shows comparisons of the concentration time curves at n w 0 45 of s4 s5 s6 and s9 while c 0 is the initial concentration of the injected tracer which is 100 000 ppm from the results the experimental data show a positively skewed distribution due to the interaction between the primary and secondary currents on the channel bends following the skewed distribution of the experimental data the 2d pdm reproduced the tail of the concentration curves fairly well on s6 and s9 even though the peak concentrations of the experiments on s4 were not simulated accurately by 2d pdm however ctm 2d failed to represent the skewed concentration curves in this study the shape of the concentration time curves was analyzed more quantitatively using the statistical values such as peak concentration cp time to peak concentration tp centroid μ t variance σ t 2 and skewness coefficient ξ t as given in below 24a m i 0 c s n t t i d t 24b μ t 2 m 1 m 0 24c σ t 2 m 2 m 0 μ t 2 24d ξ t m 3 m 0 3 μ t m 3 m 0 2 μ t 3 σ t 2 3 2 where mi is the ith moment of the concentration time curves table 3 shows that the average errors of the statistical values from the 2d pdm results were smaller than the errors of the ctm 2d especially the results of ξ t by 2d pdm were similar to the measurements whereas the results of ctm 2d show large discrepancies these errors of the fickian dispersion model were caused by the assumption of taylor s theory in which the effect of shear dispersion is represented only by the dispersion coefficient 4 2 application in the natural rivers the applicability of the 2d pdm was tested against the tracer test results carried out in the curved reach of the hongcheon river on october 25 27 in 2015 the hongcheon river is a tributary of the north han river inflow to the paldang lake which is an important source of water supply to metropolitan seoul and nearby cities the study reach has a moderately curved shape and irregular channel boundaries as shown in fig 13 a in this study reach the complex flow structures induced by the channel topography disturb the balance between the shear advection and vertical diffusion in the tracer study the fluorescent dye rhodamine wt widely used for tracer studies in natural streams as it is environmentally safe and has high detectability rowinski et al 2007 seo et al 2016 was used as a tracer material even though rhodamine wt might lead to a non conservative substance by sorption in contact with suspended solids runkel 2015 in this study it was treated as a conservative tracer because experimental time was relatively short de smedt et al 2005 for the tracer study 1 5 l of 20 000 ppm rhodamine wt was instantaneously introduced with the vertical line source at the injection point shown in fig 13a to measure the concentration of fluorescent dye the ysi 600oms equipped with the ysi 6130 optic sensor was installed on each tag line shown in fig 13a in each meandering section 6 7 sensors were laterally deployed to measure the lateral variation of concentration curves in the same tag line the velocity data were obtained using the adcp m9 manufactured by sontek and the measured hydraulic data along with simulation conditions are listed in table 4 flow fields in the hongcheon river were simulated using the hdm 2d model in which a computational mesh was constructed based on the topography data measured by rtk gps the depth averaged velocity distributions and water depth are shown in fig 13b and c in which the flow patterns dramatically changed between sections 1 and 4 due to the abrupt contraction of the channel width and bottom topography change thus the wide and slow flow between sections 1 and 2 became a shallow and fast flow between sections 3 and 4 furthermore the horizontal recirculation zone shown in fig 3b occurred near the left bank of section 4 due to the irregular sidewall embayment using the depth averaged flow field shown in fig 13b and c the vertical profiles of velocity were generated using eqs 17 and 23 for the simulation using 2d pdm the simulation conditions of 2d pdm are listed in table 4 in which nm and rc were manipulated following the flow patterns of the study reach fig 14 shows that the tail of the tracer cloud was bifurcated due to the sidewall friction which is similar to the aerial photo of the tracer cloud shown in fig 13a the tracer cloud was more stretched at the contraction part between section 2 and section 3 and the particles were then trapped at the horizontal recirculation zone near section 4 fig 15 shows comparisons of concentration time curves at two lateral points of each section at which the peak concentration occurred this figure reveals that the concentration curves were almost symmetrical at section 1 while the long tail of the concentration time curves in section 2 occurred due to the sidewall friction in section 3 the tracer cloud was more skewed whilst crossing the contraction part and the concentration time curves were smeared by the small eddies at the shallow and fast flow region of upstream the simulation results by 2d pdm showed that the rising and falling limbs of the breakthrough curves were properly fitted to the measurements even though the peak concentration was somewhat overestimated the statistical properties of the peak concentration curves in sections 1 and 2 are compared in table 5 the results show that the peak concentration arrived faster than the centroid of curves in both the experimental and simulation results and the results of ξ t were similar to the measurements therefore the 2d pdm properly reproduced the 2d mixing without adopting the fick s law in the hongcheon river where concentration curves were skewed due to the complex channel boundaries and flow structures 5 conclusions in this study the 2d particle dispersion model 2d pdm was developed to model the 2d pollutant mixing in open channel flows instead of using the taylor s approach the 2d pdm adopted the step by step arithmetic calculation method to reproduce shear dispersion by the vertical variations of the longitudinal and transverse velocities the calculation procedures of 2d pdm included the horizontal transport and vertical mixing steps in the horizontal transport step the introduced pollutant particles were transported by both the longitudinal and transverse vertical velocity profiles and the random turbulent fluctuations after the horizontal transport the vertical position of particles was redistributed by the vertical mixing methods which were classified into full mixing partial mixing and random mixing schemes according to the simulation conditions thus the 2d pdm could calculate the solute transport without inputting the dispersion coefficient and the model is applicable not only in the taylor period but also in the initial period where the taylor s assumption is not applicable the 2d pdm was applied to a straight open channel where the plane shear flow is dominant and the simulation results of 2d pdm were compared with the analytical solution of the fickian dispersion model the concentration distance curves from the fickian dispersion model show the symmetrical distribution in the entire region whereas the results of 2d pdm provided the asymmetrical distribution during the initial period and these anomalous concentration curves gradually approached the symmetrical distribution in the taylor period these results can also be explained by the change of skewness coefficient which was abruptly increased at the instant of pollutant injection and the value was slowly decreased after the initial period furthermore the dispersion coefficients in both the longitudinal and transverse directions changed with time during the initial period due to the nonlinear increase of variance whereas they showed nearly invariant values during the taylor period after finishing the initial period the calculation results of the dimensionless longitudinal dispersion coefficient were in the range of 5 58 5 88 which was similar to the theoretical study by elder 1959 from these results 2d pdm can reproduce non fickian mixing in the initial period and fickian mixing in the taylor period the simulation results of 2d pdm were tested against the tracer test results in the meandering channel and the hongcheon river for the simulation of 2d pdm the vertical profiles of velocity were generated using the logarithmic profile for the longitudinal velocity and linear profile for the transverse velocity the comparisons of the concentration time curves in the meandering channel show that the simulation results of 2d pdm reproduced the tail of concentration curves fairly well whereas the results of ctm 2d failed to calculate the skewed concentration curves the calculation results of the skewness coefficient by 2d pdm show 0 113 3 errors and the errors of most statistical parameters were smaller than the results of ctm 2d furthermore the proposed model properly demonstrated the tail of breakthrough curves caused by the irregular channel boundaries in the hongcheon river and the calculation results of the skewness coefficient was in the range of 4 1 to 6 5 from these results it can be concluded that the proposed model which directly calculates the effect of vertical variations of velocity can provide reasonable results for the 2d mixing problems in the meandering channels and

897,the quantification of timescales associated with the movement of the seawater freshwater interface is useful for developing effective management strategies for controlling seawater intrusion swi in this study for the first time we derive an explicit analytical solution for the timescales of swi and seawater retreat swr in a confined homogeneous coastal aquifer system under the quasi steady assumption based on a classical sharp interface solution for approximating freshwater outflow rates into the sea the flow continuity and hydrostatic equilibrium across the interface are identified as two primary mechanisms governing timescales of the interface movement driven by an abrupt change in discharge rates or hydraulic heads at the inland boundary through theoretical analysis we quantified the dependence of interface movement timescales on porosity hydraulic conductivity aquifer thickness aquifer length density ratio and boundary conditions predictions from the analytical solution closely agreed with those from numerical simulations in addition we define a temporal asymmetry index the ratio of the swi timescale to the swr timescale to represent the resilience of the coastal aquifer in response to swi the developed analytical solutions provide a simple tool for the quick assessment of swi and swr timescales and reveal that the temporal asymmetry between swi and swr mainly relies on the initial and final values of the freshwater flux at the inland boundary and is weakly affected by aquifer parameters furthermore we theoretically examined the log linearity relationship between the timescale and the freshwater flux at the inland boundary and found that the relationship may be approximated by two linear functions with a slope of 2 and 1 for large changes at the boundary flux for swi and swr respectively keywords timescale seawater intrusion coastal aquifer analytical solution 1 introduction seawater intrusion swi is a commonly encountered phenomenon in coastal regions around the globe the continuously increasing demand for water resulting from population growth and heavy industrialization in coastal areas has further aggravated the problem of swi as a result of more extensive groundwater withdrawals from coastal aquifers chang et al 2011 the extent of swi is typically characterized in terms of the toe position namely the distance from the coastal boundary to the tip of the seawater wedge at the base of the aquifer most previous studies strack 1976 werner and simmons 2009 fahs et al 2016 lu et al 2013 estimating the extent of swi were based on the steady state condition and they have not taken into account the dynamic movement of the freshwater seawater interface and its associated timescales however the transient nature of swi is crucial for developing effective management strategies for controlling swi watson et al 2010 furthermore the dynamic movement of the interface causes significant changes in submarine groundwater discharge rates and chemical outputs into the sea e g li et al 1999 michael et al 2005 robinson et al 2007 an interesting finding in recent studies regarding transient swi is the temporal asymmetry between swi and seawater retreat swr which represents the reversibility and remediation timescales of seawater intruded coastal aquifers watson et al 2010 explored the transience of swi caused by sea level rise slr in an unconfined aquifer via numerical modeling diersch 1998 watson et al 2010 chose the timescale associated with the toe position as a quantitative indicator and revealed the timescale disparity in swi and swr chang and clement 2012 conducted laboratory experiments to study the timescales of swi and swr in aquifer systems with specified flux as the inland boundary condition referred henceforth as specified flux boundary case they found that for the same magnitude of change in the boundary condition the wedge took less time to recede from the aquifer than the time to advance into the aquifer they showed that the swi case exhibits two opposing flow fields with a distinct stagnation point at the aquifer bottom and a diffused stagnation zone along the saltwater wedge where the flow velocities reverse direction while the swr case supports a unidirectional flow field with all velocity vectors pointing toward the coastal boundary they concluded that the difference in the flow fields during swi and swr resulted in the difference in their timescales lu and werner 2013 conducted a numerical investigation of timescales associated with swi and swr and identified simple log linear relationships between the timescale and specified head values at the inland boundary referred henceforth as specified head boundary case in homogeneous aquifers they presented the sensitivities of these relationships to aquifer parameters reflected by the changes in regression coefficients however their analyses relied heavily on empirical relationships and failed to reveal specific effects of various aquifer parameters on the timescale in addition a detailed numerical analysis of the effect of aquifer parameters and boundary conditions on the toe response timescales is susceptible to excessive computational efforts other studies on the transience of swi meisler et al 1984 essaid 1990 harrar et al 2001 bratton 2007 cartwright et al 2004 are mostly restricted to site specific complexities such that the generalization of such research is challenging because of the lack of field scale transient swi studies werner et al 2013 and the shortcomings of numerical methods in simulating density dependent problems analytical methods offer an attractive alternative to more complex approaches to gain insights into the processes controlling swi and swr analytical solutions provide the ability of quick computation and may assist in identifying the relative influence of each parameter at a glance bear 1972 developed approximate analytical solutions for describing toe positions and discharge flow rates into the sea during the movement of the freshwater seawater interface in a confined homogeneous aquifer with an inland boundary as specified flux vappicha and nagaraja 1976 obtained approximate solutions for toe positions in unconfined aquifers for a changing specified flux boundary kiro et al 2008 developed a simple analytical model to predict the timescale of the responses of the water table and the transition zone to a sea level drop for an aquifer system with a specified flux inland boundary however none of the previous studies provide a single explicit solution for the quick estimation of the timescales of swi and swr or mathematically prove and analytically solve for the temporal asymmetry observed in numerical watson et al 2010 lu and werner 2013 and laboratory chang and clement 2012 studies these studies highlight a need for an explicit analytical solution for estimating the timescale an improvement in the theoretical reasoning a quantification of the temporal asymmetry between swi and swr and an examination of the effects of the hydrogeological parameters and boundary conditions on the temporal asymmetry in addition previous analytical studies were limited to specified flux boundary case whereas there is a need to also evaluate specified head boundary cases in this study we aim to systematically analyze and quantify timescales associated with swi and swr we derive an explicit analytical solution based on the sharp interface assumption to evaluate the timescales of the interface movement in response to an instantaneous change in the freshwater flux at the inland boundary based on bear s bear 1972 approximate implicit solution for transient freshwater outflow to the sea we extend the solution to the specified head boundary case using a conversion between the flux and hydraulic head at the inland boundary to the best of our knowledge the explicit analytical solutions of the toe response timescale are developed for the first time we verify analytical solutions by numerical simulations apply them to explain and quantify the temporal asymmetry between swi and swr and analyze the effects of hydrogeological conditions on timescales and asymmetry despite the assumptions made for the development of the analytical solutions the insights offered by the solutions about the interface dynamics in coastal aquifers may be extended to real field scenarios 2 theoretical derivation of the explicit timescale solution for the specified flux boudary case we analyze a 2 d vertical section of a confined homogeneous isotropic aquifer as our conceptual model which is shown in fig 1 a the left side of the domain represents the inland boundary with a constant seaward freshwater flux and the right side a coastal boundary with a constant seawater head for the fluxes the first subscript i e f or s indicates water salinity representing freshwater or seawater respectively the second subscript i e 0 or l gives a spatial distinction representing the seaward boundary or inland boundary respectively the superscript 0 or gives a temporal distinction representing the initial or final value respectively the sign convention adopted for the fluxes is such that the direction towards the sea is positive the toe position is measured from the coastal boundary at the steady state the freshwater flux at the inland boundary q f l 0 l2 t is equal to the freshwater outflow into the sea at the coastal boundary q f 0 0 l2 t to simulate the moving interface we assume an abrupt change in the freshwater flux at the inland boundary from q f l 0 to q f l resulting in unsteady flow conditions that cause the interface to move till the new equilibrium is reached during this transition the freshwater outflow into the sea q f0 t gradually changes from q f l 0 to q f l we are interested in the time taken for this change to occur q s0 t l2 t is the net seawater flux to the sea at any time t qf x t l2 t and η x t l are the seaward freshwater flux and the depth of the interface measured from the top of the aquifer respectively at a distance x from the coastal boundary and at time t x t represents the toe position the point where the interface meets the base of the aquifer the distribution of the flux over the seawater wedge affects the hydraulic head distribution which controls the interface shape and location with the assumption of the linear variation of qf x t between the toe location and coastal boundary the interface profile can be explicitly described in terms of the seaward freshwater outflow q f0 t only because the rate of the movement of the interface is controlled by q f0 t through the continuity of the flux we can then derive the explicit solution for the timescale of the interface movement based on the solution for transient q f0 t bear 1972 derived an implicit solution eq 1 for the transient freshwater outflow at the coastal boundary q f0 t under the influence of an abrupt change in the freshwater flux at the inland boundary from q f l 0 to q f l the derivation is briefly summarized in appendix a their solution is based on the dupuit approximation and the method of successive steady states kochina 1962 1 6 t nk ɛ b 3 1 q fl 2 ln q f 0 t q f 0 0 1 q fl 1 q f 0 t 1 q f 0 0 1 q fl 2 ln q fl q f 0 t q fl q f 0 0 where n is the porosity k l t is the hydraulic conductivity ε is the density ratio given by ρ s ρ f ρ f ρ s m l3 is the density of seawater ρ f m l3 is the density of freshwater and b l is the depth of the aquifer the hydraulic conductivity is assumed to be same for both freshwater and seawater the hydrostatic equilibrium at the interface defines the shape of the interface for a given q f0 t bear 1972 2 η 2 x t 2 q f 0 t k ɛ x the toe position x t is obtained by substituting η with b in eq 2 bear et al 1985 3 x t k ɛ b 2 2 q f 0 t we use the timescale definition suggested by watson et al 2010 and adopted by lu and werner 2013 which describes a representative toe response timescale as the time to reach 95 of the new steady state as the transition from one steady state to another is often characterized by the toe movement the timescale can be defined as the time for the toe to travel a distance equal to 95 of the total toe response distance thus the toe position xt corresponding to the toe response timescale is given by 4 x t x 0 0 95 x x 0 where x 0 l is the initial toe position and x l is the final toe position at the steady state after the change in the boundary condition substituting the toe position expression from eq 3 into eq 4 yields 5 k ɛ b 2 2 q f 0 t k ɛ b 2 2 q f l 0 0 95 k ɛ b 2 2 q f l k ɛ b 2 2 q f l 0 where t is the toe response timescale simplifying eq 5 gives 6 q f 0 t 1 1 q f l 0 0 95 1 q f l 1 q f l 0 by substituting q f0 t from eq 6 into eq 1 we get an expression for t as 7 t n k b 3 ɛ 6 q f l 2 ln β β 0 95 1 β 0 95 1 β 1 l n β β β 0 95 1 β β 1 where β is the ratio of the final freshwater flux to the initial freshwater flux at the inland boundary β q fl q fl 0 which is greater than 1 for swr and less than 1 for swi note that eq 7 is not applicable for the condition of β 1 i e the boundary condition does not change interestingly we found that the complicated part of eq 7 namely e ln β β 0 95 1 β 0 95 1 β 1 l n β β β 0 95 1 β β 1 can be converted into a simple linear expression e 0 95 β 2 046 see appendix b hence we can rewrite eq 7 in a simplified form 8 t n k b 3 ɛ 6 q f l 2 0 95 q f l q 0 f l 2 046 eq 8 is a simple analytical solution in an explicit form for the timescale associated with the interface movement in response to an abrupt change in the specified flux boundary based on eq 8 we can conveniently extend the timescale solution for the specified flux boundary case to the specified head boundary case by expressing freshwater flux at the inland boundary in terms of the hydraulic heads using the relationship derived by lu et al 2015 for a 2 d vertical section of a homogeneous isotropic confined aquifer as shown in fig 1 b the left side of the domain represents a specified head inland boundary and the right side represents a specified head coastal boundary the head at the coastal boundary is h s l the initial head at the inland boundary and the initial head difference across the aquifer are represented as h f 0 l and h f s 0 l respectively to simulate the moving interface we assume an abrupt change in the inland boundary head from h f 0 to h f l l and b l represents the length and depth of the aquifer respectively lu et al 2015 introduced a simple correction to the coastal heads as given in eq 9 9 h s 1 ɛ h s ɛ 2 b where h s is the corrected coastal boundary head we obtain the freshwater flux using corrected coastal boundary heads as 10 q f l k b h f h s l by substituting eqs 9 and 10 into eq 8 we get an explicit analytical solution for the timescale for a specified head boundary case 11 t n b l 2 ɛ 6 k h f 1 ɛ h

2 b 2 1 quantification of temporal asymmetry analytical solutions eqs 8 and 12 suggest that the toe responses during swi and swr are temporally asymmetrical to quantify this asymmetry we express the timescale equations for swi and swr for the specified flux boundary case qh and ql represent two specific values of q f0 such that qh ql the swi and swr cases involve q f0 changing from qh to ql and ql to qh respectively the timescale equations are given as 13 t s w i n k b 3 ɛ 6 q l 2 0 95 q l q h 2 046 14 t s w r n k b 3 ɛ 6 q h 2 0 95 q h q l 2 046 by dividing eq 13 by eq 14 we get the ratio of the swi timescale to the swr timescale rt as 15 r t t s w i t s w r 0 95 2 046 σ 0 95 2 046 σ where σ q h q l 1 this ratio is termed as the temporal asymmetry index representing the resilience of a coastal aquifer in response to the swi similarly the temporal asymmetry index can be defined for the specified head boundary case hh and hl represent two specific values of head hf l at the inland boundary such that hh hl the swi and swr processes are driven by changes to hf namely hh to hl for swi and hl to hh for swr the resulting equation for rt is given by eq 15 except with σ h h h s h l h s the numerator in eq 15 is clearly greater than the denominator rt 1 implying that tswi is greater than tswr or in other words the toe retreat is faster than the toe advance in both the specified flux and specified head boundary cases this adds to the previous finding of temporal disparity observed in numerical watson et al 2010 lu and werner 2013 and laboratory chang and clement 2012 studies 2 2 dimensionless timescale we can also express the timescale solution in the dimensionless form by rearranging eq 8 for the specified flux boundary case or eq 12 for the specified head boundary case we get 16 τ t t 1 β 2 0 95 β 2 046 where the dimensionless timescale τ is normalized by t nk b 3 ɛ 6 q fl 0 2 in the specified flux boundary case or t n l 2 b ɛ 6 k h f s 0 2 in the specified head boundary case eq 16 shows important relationships between the interface movement timescales and hydrogeological conditions 3 comparison with numerical results to verify analytical solutions eqs 8 and 12 we numerically solved the problems represented by the conceptual models shown in fig 1 using seawat a modflow mt3dms based computer program designed to simulate three dimensional variable density flow langevin et al 2003 the spatial discretization was determined according to the criteria based on grid peclet number voss and souza 1987 17 p e ν δ x d m α l ν δ x α l 4 where ν l t is the average pore velocity δx l is the grid spacing dm l2 t is the molecular diffusion coefficient and α l l is the longitudinal dispersion coefficient lu and werner 2013 suggested that the relationships between the timescales and the final head differences between inland and coastal boundaries for swi can be described using simple log linear equations we used a similar log log plot between the timescale and the final specified flux or head at the inland boundary to compare the analytical and numerical timescales in figs 2 and 3 for specified head and specified flux boundary cases respectively for the specified head boundary case we solved the scenarios presented by lu and werner 2013 with a wide range of hydrogeological parameters and boundary conditions fig 2 shows the comparison for a specific set of aquifer parameters summarized in table 1 and a range of boundary conditions summarized in table 2 for swi the logarithmic timescales ln tswi are plotted against the final boundary head differences ln h f s for different changes in the head at the inland boundary δhf for swr the logarithmic timescales ln tswr are plotted against the final boundary head differences ln h f s for different initial head values at the inland boundary h f 0 similarly fig 3 compares the numerical and analytical results for swi and swr in the specified flux boundary case for a specific set of aquifer parameters listed in table 3 we numerically simulated 12 scenarios with different boundary conditions summarized in table 4 overall analytical solutions agree well with numerical results small deviations may be because of the assumption that the seawater freshwater interface instantaneously responses to the changes in the freshwater outflow into the sea in reality however a time lag exists between a change in the freshwater outflow and in the interface profile another possible reason may be the sharp interface approximation which does not consider dispersive effects pool and carrera 2011 kiro et al 2008 however argued that the sharp interface approximation is reasonable for studying the transience of the interface movement at a large spatial scale we also conducted numerical simulations for doubled dispersivity values and found that the change in the timescale value was less than 5 for both swi and swr indicating the relative insensitivity of toe response timescales to the dispersivity values for the considered range of aquifer parameters in addition the derived analytical solutions show that the relationship between the timescale and final boundary condition value is not perfectly log linear as suggested by lu and werner 2013 the conditions for the goodness of the log linearity assumption are explored using the dimensionless timescale in section 4 3 4 analysis and discussion 4 1 dynamics controlling the timescale the timescale of the toe movement in response to an abrupt change in the boundary conditions is controlled by the distance and rate of the toe movement for the successive steady state the toe response distance can be determined by the hydrostatic equilibrium across the interface in agreement with the hydraulic gradient and the movement rate is controlled by the resultant seawater flux at the coastal boundary which can be determined by the flow continuity in the aquifer since the freshwater outflow at the coastal boundary q f0 is equal to the inflow flux at the inland boundary qfl at the large time steady state the difference between them during the interface movement can be a good measure of the degree of disequilibrium prior to an abrupt change in the inland boundary condition the system is in equilibrium i e qfl q f0 and q s0 0 i e the seawater volume in the aquifer remains constant an instantaneous change in qfl results in the disequilibrium with the degree of δ q q fl q fl 0 which leads to an instantaneous increase in q s0 from zero to δq to satisfy the flow continuity driven by the disequilibrium δq q f0 gradually changes along with the corresponding interface movement to maintain a hydrostatic equilibrium the interface moves at the rate for which the resulting seawater flux described by the rate of the seawater volume change as a consequence wedge movement n d u s t d t q s 0 satisfies the condition of flow continuity at the coastal boundary q s0 q fl q f 0 as also depicted in fig 4 4 2 temporal asymmetry between swi and swr we can conveniently explain the temporal asymmetry between swi and swr through the framework discussed in section 4 1 during swi the degree of the disequilibrium is maximum δ q q fl q fl 0 right after the abrupt change at the inland boundary resulting in the maximum magnitude of both q s0 and the rate of the interface movement however interface profiles corresponding to higher initial q f0 values have steeper interface angles and shorter toe displacements δx per unit change in q f0 when the system is about to reach the new equilibrium the degree of the disequilibrium and q s0 are small but the toe displacements are longer corresponding to the smaller final q f0 values this essentially means that during swi longer toe displacements are travelled at lower rates and shorter toe displacements are travelled at higher rates while in the swr case this trend is reversed i e longer toe displacements are travelled at higher rates and shorter toe displacements are travelled at lower rates see fig 5 since the total toe displacement distance is the same in both cases for two given bounding steady states the time taken by the toe to advance into the aquifer is longer than the time to recede into the sea resulting in the temporal asymmetry between swi and swr the non dimensional forms of the variables of interest can help to generalize the analysis smith 2004 chang and clement 2013 we present q s0 and δx in non dimensional forms q s 0 and δx respectively where q s0 is normalized by its maximum value δq and δx is normalized by the total toe displacement for a specific case with inland boundary flux values of 0 3 and 0 6 m2 d and aquifer parameters listed in table 3 we present q s 0 vs δx in fig 5 showing the temporal disparity between swi and swr eq 15 quantifies the temporal asymmetry index rt for the specified flux boundary case and describes its relationship with the changing flux at the inland boundary fig 6 shows a good agreement between numerical and analytical results of rt for qh ql values less than 4 discrepancy at high ratios of qh ql could be due to potentially significant impact of dispersive mixing on the interface movement which is ignored in our analytical solution eq 15 also suggests that aquifer parameters do not influence rt table 5 shows the rt values estimated from numerical simulations for aquifer systems with four different sets of parameters qh and ql values are constant 0 7 m2 d and 0 5 m2 d respectively in all cases the numerical results confirm that rt is predominantly governed by boundary conditions and insignificantly influenced by other hydrogeological parameters in the specified flux boundary case rt for the specified head boundary case has a similar form as that for the specified flux boundary case eq 15 however σ in the specified head boundary case is also dependent on b which makes the temporal asymmetry dependent of the aquifer depth unlike the specified flux boundary case 4 3 effects of inland boundary condition and aquifer parameters on the timescale 4 3 1 log linear relationship between the dimensionless timescale and β we further explore the log linearity of the timescale with respect to the freshwater flux at the inland boundary using the dimensionless timescale equation for the specified flux boundary case by taking the logarithm of both sides of eq 16 we get 18 log τ 2 log β log 0 95 β 2 046 fig 7 shows the variation of log τ with log β obtained analytically and numerically for a typical range of β from 0 01 to 100 whereby the freshwater flux decreases to only 1 of or increases to 100 times the original value as evidenced from eq 18 and seen in fig 8 the relationship is not perfectly linear over the entire range but may be approximated by two linear functions with different slopes for swi and swr respectively in fact for the cases of large changes in the boundary flux i e β 1 for swi and β 1 for swr eq 16 implies that the relation tends to be linear with the slope equal to 2 and 1 respectively 4 4 2 sensitivity of timescales eqs 8 and 12 explicitly provide the relationship between different hydrogeological parameters and the toe response timescale for the specified flux boundary case the analytical solution reveals that the timescale increases linearly with the porosity hydraulic conductivity density ratio and cubic aquifer thickness and is not affected by the sea level and aquifer length fig 8 shows sensitivity results from numerical simulations for hydraulic conductivity aquifer depth and porosity in addition numerical simulations were also conducted for different sea levels 30 m 40 m and 50 m and different aquifer length values 1000 m 2000 m and 500 m and the resulting timescales were almost the same in all cases for a specified head boundary case the analytical solution reveals that the timescale is directly proportional to the porosity aquifer thickness density ratio coastal boundary head and squared aquifer length and is inversely proportional to the hydraulic conductivity fig 9 compares the sensitivity results of swi and swr timescales obtained from the derived explicit analytical solution eq 12 and numerical simulations results obtained by lu and werner 2013 for a specified head boundary case the analytical solution matches the numerical results of sensitivities with a good accuracy as discussed in section 4 1 the effects of different aquifer parameters on the timescales can be understood by analyzing their effects on i the head gradient controlling the toe location in accordance with the hydrostatic equilibrium across the interface and ii flow continuity controlling the rate of the interface movement porosity n and aquifer thickness b have similar effects on the timescale for both specified flux and specified head boundary cases an increase in n or b will not only increase the total volume of seawater to be displaced to reach the new steady state but also the volume of seawater displaced per unit displacement of the seawater wedge this results in the slower movement of the wedge to maintain flow continuity thus a longer timescale in the specified flux boundary case the timescale is directly proportional to k whereas in the specified head boundary case the timescale is inversely proportional in the specified flux boundary case an increase in k decreases the hydraulic gradient the lower hydraulic gradient results in a shallower interface angle and a longer toe response distance thus a longer timescale in the specified head boundary case a higher k results in a higher degree of disequilibrium in terms of the magnitudes of the freshwater flux leading to faster wedge movement to yield a higher q s0 thus a shorter timescale the aquifer length l and sea level hs do not affect toe response distance or the toe travel rate in the specified flux boundary case thus do not influence the timescale in the specified head boundary case an increase in hs or l results in a lower head gradient and thus a longer toe response distance to satisfy the hydrostatic equilibrium in addition a higher h s or l leads to a lower freshwater flux and a lower degree of disequilibrium causing the lower travel rate of the interface to satisfy flow continuity therefore the longer toe distance and lower rate of the movement of the interface result in a longer timescale for a higher hs or l in the specified head boundary case 5 summary and conclusion this study has three major contributions first we derived for the first time a simple explicit analytical solution for the timescale of the interface movement in response to an abrupt change in the freshwater flux at the inland boundary allowing quick assessment of the swi and swr timescales the solution was extended to the case of specified hydraulic head at the inland boundary condition these solutions can be potentially used as a first order prediction tool for estimating the timescale of swi and swr second we theoretically verified the temporal disparity between swi and swr and quantified it using a temporal asymmetry index third we proposed a two mechanism based theoretical framework to explain the temporal asymmetry and analyzed the effects of aquifer parameters and boundary conditions on the timescales the analytical solutions provide many useful insights into swi and swr timescales albeit within the constraints of the approximation of a sharp interface in a confined homogenous isotropic aquifer for specified flux boundary cases the timescale is linearly proportional to porosity hydraulic conductivity and cubic aquifer thickness and is insensitive to the aquifer length and the coastal boundary head for specified head boundary cases the timescale is directly proportional to the porosity aquifer thickness density ratio coastal boundary head and squared aquifer length and inversely proportional to the hydraulic conductivity the close agreement in sensitivity results of analytical and numerical solutions demonstrates the robustness of the analytical solutions more importantly we conveniently explained and quantified the temporal asymmetry between swi and swr given two bounding steady states defined by specified fluxes or heads at the inland boundary longer toe displacements are traveled at lower rates and shorter toe displacements are traveled at higher rates in swi but this trend reverses in swr such that the timescales of swr are shorter than those of swi the temporal asymmetry index defined as the ratio between swi and swr timescales was found to be heavily dependent on changing boundary conditions and weakly influenced by aquifer parameters furthermore we theoretically examined the log linearity relationship between the timescale and the freshwater flux at the inland boundary recently identified by numerical simulations lu and werner 2013 we found that the relationship is not perfectly linear over the entire flux change range but may be approximated by two linear functions with different slopes for swi and swr respectively for the cases of large changes in the boundary flux for swi and swr the log linearity slope tends to be 2 and 1 respectively the present study is limited by the sharp interface approximation hence the proposed analytical approach does not explain the effect of the dispersivity on the timescale however it is possible to include a correction factor similar to that introduced by pool and carrera 2011 to account for dispersive mixing this study also neglects the time lag between the change in the boundary head and the corresponding change in the flux for the specified head boundary case other hydrogeological conditions such as heterogeneous hydraulic conductivities tidal effects and aquifer slopes may also affect timescales nonetheless the analytical nature of the solution enables us to develop new understanding of the conditions controlling swi and swr timescales for both specified flux and specified head boundary cases acknowledgments we thank the editor and three anonymous reviewers for their constructive comments we particularly thank the

897,the quantification of timescales associated with the movement of the seawater freshwater interface is useful for developing effective management strategies for controlling seawater intrusion swi in this study for the first time we derive an explicit analytical solution for the timescales of swi and seawater retreat swr in a confined homogeneous coastal aquifer system under the quasi steady assumption based on a classical sharp interface solution for approximating freshwater outflow rates into the sea the flow continuity and hydrostatic equilibrium across the interface are identified as two primary mechanisms governing timescales of the interface movement driven by an abrupt change in discharge rates or hydraulic heads at the inland boundary through theoretical analysis we quantified the dependence of interface movement timescales on porosity hydraulic conductivity aquifer thickness aquifer length density ratio and boundary conditions predictions from the analytical solution closely agreed with those from numerical simulations in addition we define a temporal asymmetry index the ratio of the swi timescale to the swr timescale to represent the resilience of the coastal aquifer in response to swi the developed analytical solutions provide a simple tool for the quick assessment of swi and swr timescales and reveal that the temporal asymmetry between swi and swr mainly relies on the initial and final values of the freshwater flux at the inland boundary and is weakly affected by aquifer parameters furthermore we theoretically examined the log linearity relationship between the timescale and the freshwater flux at the inland boundary and found that the relationship may be approximated by two linear functions with a slope of 2 and 1 for large changes at the boundary flux for swi and swr respectively keywords timescale seawater intrusion coastal aquifer analytical solution 1 introduction seawater intrusion swi is a commonly encountered phenomenon in coastal regions around the globe the continuously increasing demand for water resulting from population growth and heavy industrialization in coastal areas has further aggravated the problem of swi as a result of more extensive groundwater withdrawals from coastal aquifers chang et al 2011 the extent of swi is typically characterized in terms of the toe position namely the distance from the coastal boundary to the tip of the seawater wedge at the base of the aquifer most previous studies strack 1976 werner and simmons 2009 fahs et al 2016 lu et al 2013 estimating the extent of swi were based on the steady state condition and they have not taken into account the dynamic movement of the freshwater seawater interface and its associated timescales however the transient nature of swi is crucial for developing effective management strategies for controlling swi watson et al 2010 furthermore the dynamic movement of the interface causes significant changes in submarine groundwater discharge rates and chemical outputs into the sea e g li et al 1999 michael et al 2005 robinson et al 2007 an interesting finding in recent studies regarding transient swi is the temporal asymmetry between swi and seawater retreat swr which represents the reversibility and remediation timescales of seawater intruded coastal aquifers watson et al 2010 explored the transience of swi caused by sea level rise slr in an unconfined aquifer via numerical modeling diersch 1998 watson et al 2010 chose the timescale associated with the toe position as a quantitative indicator and revealed the timescale disparity in swi and swr chang and clement 2012 conducted laboratory experiments to study the timescales of swi and swr in aquifer systems with specified flux as the inland boundary condition referred henceforth as specified flux boundary case they found that for the same magnitude of change in the boundary condition the wedge took less time to recede from the aquifer than the time to advance into the aquifer they showed that the swi case exhibits two opposing flow fields with a distinct stagnation point at the aquifer bottom and a diffused stagnation zone along the saltwater wedge where the flow velocities reverse direction while the swr case supports a unidirectional flow field with all velocity vectors pointing toward the coastal boundary they concluded that the difference in the flow fields during swi and swr resulted in the difference in their timescales lu and werner 2013 conducted a numerical investigation of timescales associated with swi and swr and identified simple log linear relationships between the timescale and specified head values at the inland boundary referred henceforth as specified head boundary case in homogeneous aquifers they presented the sensitivities of these relationships to aquifer parameters reflected by the changes in regression coefficients however their analyses relied heavily on empirical relationships and failed to reveal specific effects of various aquifer parameters on the timescale in addition a detailed numerical analysis of the effect of aquifer parameters and boundary conditions on the toe response timescales is susceptible to excessive computational efforts other studies on the transience of swi meisler et al 1984 essaid 1990 harrar et al 2001 bratton 2007 cartwright et al 2004 are mostly restricted to site specific complexities such that the generalization of such research is challenging because of the lack of field scale transient swi studies werner et al 2013 and the shortcomings of numerical methods in simulating density dependent problems analytical methods offer an attractive alternative to more complex approaches to gain insights into the processes controlling swi and swr analytical solutions provide the ability of quick computation and may assist in identifying the relative influence of each parameter at a glance bear 1972 developed approximate analytical solutions for describing toe positions and discharge flow rates into the sea during the movement of the freshwater seawater interface in a confined homogeneous aquifer with an inland boundary as specified flux vappicha and nagaraja 1976 obtained approximate solutions for toe positions in unconfined aquifers for a changing specified flux boundary kiro et al 2008 developed a simple analytical model to predict the timescale of the responses of the water table and the transition zone to a sea level drop for an aquifer system with a specified flux inland boundary however none of the previous studies provide a single explicit solution for the quick estimation of the timescales of swi and swr or mathematically prove and analytically solve for the temporal asymmetry observed in numerical watson et al 2010 lu and werner 2013 and laboratory chang and clement 2012 studies these studies highlight a need for an explicit analytical solution for estimating the timescale an improvement in the theoretical reasoning a quantification of the temporal asymmetry between swi and swr and an examination of the effects of the hydrogeological parameters and boundary conditions on the temporal asymmetry in addition previous analytical studies were limited to specified flux boundary case whereas there is a need to also evaluate specified head boundary cases in this study we aim to systematically analyze and quantify timescales associated with swi and swr we derive an explicit analytical solution based on the sharp interface assumption to evaluate the timescales of the interface movement in response to an instantaneous change in the freshwater flux at the inland boundary based on bear s bear 1972 approximate implicit solution for transient freshwater outflow to the sea we extend the solution to the specified head boundary case using a conversion between the flux and hydraulic head at the inland boundary to the best of our knowledge the explicit analytical solutions of the toe response timescale are developed for the first time we verify analytical solutions by numerical simulations apply them to explain and quantify the temporal asymmetry between swi and swr and analyze the effects of hydrogeological conditions on timescales and asymmetry despite the assumptions made for the development of the analytical solutions the insights offered by the solutions about the interface dynamics in coastal aquifers may be extended to real field scenarios 2 theoretical derivation of the explicit timescale solution for the specified flux boudary case we analyze a 2 d vertical section of a confined homogeneous isotropic aquifer as our conceptual model which is shown in fig 1 a the left side of the domain represents the inland boundary with a constant seaward freshwater flux and the right side a coastal boundary with a constant seawater head for the fluxes the first subscript i e f or s indicates water salinity representing freshwater or seawater respectively the second subscript i e 0 or l gives a spatial distinction representing the seaward boundary or inland boundary respectively the superscript 0 or gives a temporal distinction representing the initial or final value respectively the sign convention adopted for the fluxes is such that the direction towards the sea is positive the toe position is measured from the coastal boundary at the steady state the freshwater flux at the inland boundary q f l 0 l2 t is equal to the freshwater outflow into the sea at the coastal boundary q f 0 0 l2 t to simulate the moving interface we assume an abrupt change in the freshwater flux at the inland boundary from q f l 0 to q f l resulting in unsteady flow conditions that cause the interface to move till the new equilibrium is reached during this transition the freshwater outflow into the sea q f0 t gradually changes from q f l 0 to q f l we are interested in the time taken for this change to occur q s0 t l2 t is the net seawater flux to the sea at any time t qf x t l2 t and η x t l are the seaward freshwater flux and the depth of the interface measured from the top of the aquifer respectively at a distance x from the coastal boundary and at time t x t represents the toe position the point where the interface meets the base of the aquifer the distribution of the flux over the seawater wedge affects the hydraulic head distribution which controls the interface shape and location with the assumption of the linear variation of qf x t between the toe location and coastal boundary the interface profile can be explicitly described in terms of the seaward freshwater outflow q f0 t only because the rate of the movement of the interface is controlled by q f0 t through the continuity of the flux we can then derive the explicit solution for the timescale of the interface movement based on the solution for transient q f0 t bear 1972 derived an implicit solution eq 1 for the transient freshwater outflow at the coastal boundary q f0 t under the influence of an abrupt change in the freshwater flux at the inland boundary from q f l 0 to q f l the derivation is briefly summarized in appendix a their solution is based on the dupuit approximation and the method of successive steady states kochina 1962 1 6 t nk ɛ b 3 1 q fl 2 ln q f 0 t q f 0 0 1 q fl 1 q f 0 t 1 q f 0 0 1 q fl 2 ln q fl q f 0 t q fl q f 0 0 where n is the porosity k l t is the hydraulic conductivity ε is the density ratio given by ρ s ρ f ρ f ρ s m l3 is the density of seawater ρ f m l3 is the density of freshwater and b l is the depth of the aquifer the hydraulic conductivity is assumed to be same for both freshwater and seawater the hydrostatic equilibrium at the interface defines the shape of the interface for a given q f0 t bear 1972 2 η 2 x t 2 q f 0 t k ɛ x the toe position x t is obtained by substituting η with b in eq 2 bear et al 1985 3 x t k ɛ b 2 2 q f 0 t we use the timescale definition suggested by watson et al 2010 and adopted by lu and werner 2013 which describes a representative toe response timescale as the time to reach 95 of the new steady state as the transition from one steady state to another is often characterized by the toe movement the timescale can be defined as the time for the toe to travel a distance equal to 95 of the total toe response distance thus the toe position xt corresponding to the toe response timescale is given by 4 x t x 0 0 95 x x 0 where x 0 l is the initial toe position and x l is the final toe position at the steady state after the change in the boundary condition substituting the toe position expression from eq 3 into eq 4 yields 5 k ɛ b 2 2 q f 0 t k ɛ b 2 2 q f l 0 0 95 k ɛ b 2 2 q f l k ɛ b 2 2 q f l 0 where t is the toe response timescale simplifying eq 5 gives 6 q f 0 t 1 1 q f l 0 0

final freshwater flux to the initial freshwater flux at the inland boundary β q fl q fl 0 which is greater than 1 for swr and less than 1 for swi note that eq 7 is not applicable for the condition of β 1 i e the boundary condition does not change interestingly we found that the complicated part of eq 7 namely e ln β β 0 95 1 β 0 95 1 β 1 l n β β β 0 95 1 β β 1 can be converted into a simple linear expression e 0 95 β 2 046 see appendix b hence we can rewrite eq 7 in a simplified form 8 t n k b 3 ɛ 6 q f l 2 0 95 q f l q 0 f l 2 046 eq 8 is a simple analytical solution in an explicit form for the timescale associated with the interface movement in response to an abrupt change in the specified flux boundary based on eq 8 we can conveniently extend the timescale solution for the specified flux boundary case to the specified head boundary case by expressing freshwater flux at the inland boundary in terms of the hydraulic heads using the relationship derived by lu et al 2015 for a 2 d vertical section of a homogeneous isotropic confined aquifer as shown in fig 1 b the left side of the domain represents a specified head inland boundary and the right side represents a specified head coastal boundary the head at the coastal boundary is h s l the initial head at the inland boundary and the initial head difference across the aquifer are represented as h f 0 l and h f s 0 l respectively to simulate the moving interface we assume an abrupt change in the inland boundary head from h f 0 to h f l l and b l represents the length and depth of the aquifer respectively lu et al 2015 introduced a simple correction to the coastal heads as given in eq 9 9 h s 1 ɛ h s ɛ 2 b where h s is the corrected coastal boundary head we obtain the freshwater flux using corrected coastal boundary heads as 10 q f l k b h f h s l by substituting eqs 9 and 10 into eq 8 we get an explicit analytical solution for the timescale for a specified head boundary case 11 t n b l 2 ɛ 6 k h f 1 ɛ h

2 b 2 1 quantification of temporal asymmetry analytical solutions eqs 8 and 12 suggest that the toe responses during swi and swr are temporally asymmetrical to quantify this asymmetry we express the timescale equations for swi and swr for the specified flux boundary case qh and ql represent two specific values of q f0 such that qh ql the swi and swr cases involve q f0 changing from qh to ql and ql to qh respectively the timescale equations are given as 13 t s w i n k b 3 ɛ 6 q l 2 0 95 q l q h 2 046 14 t s w r n k b 3 ɛ 6 q h 2 0 95 q h q l 2 046 by dividing eq 13 by eq 14 we get the ratio of the swi timescale to the swr timescale rt as 15 r t t s w i t s w r 0 95 2 046 σ 0 95 2 046 σ where σ q h q l 1 this ratio is termed as the temporal asymmetry index representing the resilience of a coastal aquifer in response to the swi similarly the temporal asymmetry index can be defined for the specified head boundary case hh and hl represent two specific values of head hf l at the inland boundary such that hh hl the swi and swr processes are driven by changes to hf namely hh to hl for swi and hl to hh for swr the resulting equation for rt is given by eq 15 except with σ h h h s h l h s the numerator in eq 15 is clearly greater than the denominator rt 1 implying that tswi is greater than tswr or in other words the toe retreat is faster than the toe advance in both the specified flux and specified head boundary cases this adds to the previous finding of temporal disparity observed in numerical watson et al 2010 lu and werner 2013 and laboratory chang and clement 2012 studies 2 2 dimensionless timescale we can also express the timescale solution in the dimensionless form by rearranging eq 8 for the specified flux boundary case or eq 12 for the specified head boundary case we get 16 τ t t 1 β 2 0 95 β 2 046 where the dimensionless timescale τ is normalized by t nk b 3 ɛ 6 q fl 0 2 in the specified flux boundary case or t n l 2 b ɛ 6 k h f s 0 2 in the specified head boundary case eq 16 shows important relationships between the interface movement timescales and hydrogeological conditions 3 comparison with numerical results to verify analytical solutions eqs 8 and 12 we numerically solved the problems represented by the conceptual models shown in fig 1 using seawat a modflow mt3dms based computer program designed to simulate three dimensional variable density flow langevin et al 2003 the spatial discretization was determined according to the criteria based on grid peclet number voss and souza 1987 17 p e ν δ x d m α l ν δ x α l 4 where ν l t is the average pore velocity δx l is the grid spacing dm l2 t is the molecular diffusion coefficient and α l l is the longitudinal dispersion coefficient lu and werner 2013 suggested that the relationships between the timescales and the final head differences between inland and coastal boundaries for swi can be described using simple log linear equations we used a similar log log plot between the timescale and the final specified flux or head at the inland boundary to compare the analytical and numerical timescales in figs 2 and 3 for specified head and specified flux boundary cases respectively for the specified head boundary case we solved the scenarios presented by lu and werner 2013 with a wide range of hydrogeological parameters and boundary conditions fig 2 shows the comparison for a specific set of aquifer parameters summarized in table 1 and a range of boundary conditions summarized in table 2 for swi the logarithmic timescales ln tswi are plotted against the final boundary head differences ln h f s for different changes in the head at the inland boundary δhf for swr the logarithmic timescales ln tswr are plotted against the final boundary head differences ln h f s for different initial head values at the inland boundary h f 0 similarly fig 3 compares the numerical and analytical results for swi and swr in the specified flux boundary case for a specific set of aquifer parameters listed in table 3 we numerically simulated 12 scenarios with different boundary conditions summarized in table 4 overall analytical solutions agree well with numerical results small deviations may be because of the assumption that the seawater freshwater interface instantaneously responses to the changes in the freshwater outflow into the sea in reality however a time lag exists between a change in the freshwater outflow and in the interface profile another possible reason may be the sharp interface approximation which does not consider dispersive effects pool and carrera 2011 kiro et al 2008 however argued that the sharp interface approximation is reasonable for studying the transience of the interface movement at a large spatial scale we also conducted numerical simulations for doubled dispersivity values and found that the change in the timescale value was less than 5 for both swi and swr indicating the relative insensitivity of toe response timescales to the dispersivity values for the considered range of aquifer parameters in addition the derived analytical solutions show that the relationship between the timescale and final boundary condition value is not perfectly log linear as suggested by lu and werner 2013 the conditions for the goodness of the log linearity assumption are explored using the dimensionless timescale in section 4 3 4 analysis and discussion 4 1 dynamics controlling the timescale the timescale of the toe movement in response to an abrupt change in the boundary conditions is controlled by the distance and rate of the toe movement for the successive steady state the toe response distance can be determined by the hydrostatic equilibrium across the interface in agreement with the hydraulic gradient and the movement rate is controlled by the resultant seawater flux at the coastal boundary which can be determined by the flow continuity in the aquifer since the freshwater outflow at the coastal boundary q f0 is equal to the inflow flux at the inland boundary qfl at the large time steady state the difference between them during the interface movement can be a good measure of the degree of disequilibrium prior to an abrupt change in the inland boundary condition the system is in equilibrium i e qfl q f0 and q s0 0 i e the seawater volume in the aquifer remains constant an instantaneous change in qfl results in the disequilibrium with the degree of δ q q fl q fl 0 which leads to an instantaneous increase in q s0 from zero to δq to satisfy the flow continuity driven by the disequilibrium δq q f0 gradually changes along with the corresponding interface movement to maintain a hydrostatic equilibrium the interface moves at the rate for which the resulting seawater flux described by the rate of the seawater volume change as a consequence wedge movement n d u s t d t q s 0 satisfies the condition of flow continuity at the coastal boundary q s0 q fl q f 0 as also depicted in fig 4 4 2 temporal asymmetry between swi and swr we can conveniently explain the temporal asymmetry between swi and swr through the framework discussed in section 4 1 during swi the degree of the disequilibrium is maximum δ q q fl q fl 0 right after the abrupt change at the inland boundary resulting in the maximum magnitude of both q s0 and the rate of the interface movement however interface profiles corresponding to higher initial q f0 values have steeper interface angles and shorter toe displacements δx per unit change in q f0 when the system is about to reach the new equilibrium the degree of the disequilibrium and q s0 are small but the toe displacements are longer corresponding to the smaller final q f0 values this essentially means that during swi longer toe displacements are travelled at lower rates and shorter toe displacements are travelled at higher rates while in the swr case this trend is reversed i e longer toe displacements are travelled at higher rates and shorter toe displacements are travelled at lower rates see fig 5 since the total toe displacement distance is the same in both cases for two given bounding steady states the time taken by the toe to advance into the aquifer is longer than the time to recede into the sea resulting in the temporal asymmetry between swi and swr the non dimensional forms of the variables of interest can help to generalize the analysis smith 2004 chang and clement 2013 we present q s0 and δx in non dimensional forms q s 0 and δx respectively where q s0 is normalized by its maximum value δq and δx is normalized by the total toe displacement for a specific case with inland boundary flux values of 0 3 and 0 6 m2 d and aquifer parameters listed in table 3 we present q s 0 vs δx in fig 5 showing the temporal disparity between swi and swr eq 15 quantifies the temporal asymmetry index rt for the specified flux boundary case and describes its relationship with the changing flux at the inland boundary fig 6 shows a good agreement between numerical and analytical results of rt for qh ql values less than 4 discrepancy at high ratios of qh ql could be due to potentially significant impact of dispersive mixing on the interface movement which is ignored in our analytical solution eq 15 also suggests that aquifer parameters do not influence rt table 5 shows the rt values estimated from numerical simulations for aquifer systems with four different sets of parameters qh and ql values are constant 0 7 m2 d and 0 5 m2 d respectively in all cases the numerical results confirm that rt is predominantly governed by boundary conditions and insignificantly influenced by other hydrogeological parameters in the specified flux boundary case rt for the specified head boundary case has a similar form as that for the specified flux boundary case eq 15 however σ in the specified head boundary case is also dependent on b which makes the temporal asymmetry dependent of the aquifer depth unlike the specified flux boundary case 4 3 effects of inland boundary condition and aquifer parameters on the timescale 4 3 1 log linear relationship between the dimensionless timescale and β we further explore the log linearity of the timescale with respect to the freshwater flux at the inland boundary using the dimensionless timescale equation for the specified flux boundary case by taking the logarithm of both sides of eq 16 we get 18 log τ 2 log β log 0 95 β 2 046 fig 7 shows the variation of log τ with log β obtained analytically and numerically for a typical range of β from 0 01 to 100 whereby the freshwater flux decreases to only 1 of or increases to 100 times the original value as evidenced from eq 18 and seen in fig 8 the relationship is not perfectly linear over the entire range but may be approximated by two linear functions with different slopes for swi and swr respectively in fact for the cases of large changes in the boundary flux i e β 1 for swi and β 1 for swr eq 16 implies that the relation tends to be linear with the slope equal to 2 and 1 respectively 4 4 2 sensitivity of timescales eqs 8 and 12 explicitly provide the relationship between different hydrogeological parameters and the toe response timescale for the specified flux boundary case the analytical solution reveals that the timescale increases linearly with the porosity hydraulic conductivity density ratio and cubic aquifer thickness and is not affected by the sea level and aquifer length fig 8 shows sensitivity results from numerical simulations for hydraulic conductivity aquifer depth and porosity in addition numerical simulations were also conducted for different sea levels 30 m 40 m and 50 m and different aquifer length values 1000 m 2000 m and 500 m and the resulting timescales were almost the same in all cases for a specified head boundary case the analytical solution reveals that the timescale is directly proportional to the porosity aquifer thickness density ratio coastal boundary head and squared aquifer length and is inversely proportional to the hydraulic conductivity fig 9 compares the sensitivity results of swi and swr timescales obtained from the derived explicit analytical solution eq 12 and numerical simulations results obtained by lu and werner 2013 for a specified head boundary case the analytical solution matches the numerical results of sensitivities with a good accuracy as discussed in section 4 1 the effects of different aquifer parameters on the timescales can be understood by analyzing their effects on i the head gradient controlling the toe location in accordance with the hydrostatic equilibrium across the interface and ii flow continuity controlling the rate of the interface movement porosity n and aquifer thickness b have similar effects on the timescale for both specified flux and specified head boundary cases an increase in n or b will not only increase the total volume of seawater to be displaced to reach the new steady state but also the volume of seawater displaced per unit displacement of the seawater wedge this results in the slower movement of the wedge to maintain flow continuity thus a longer timescale in the specified flux boundary case the timescale is directly proportional to k whereas in the specified head boundary case the timescale is inversely proportional in the specified flux boundary case an increase in k decreases the hydraulic gradient the lower hydraulic gradient results in a shallower interface angle and a longer toe response distance thus a longer timescale in the specified head boundary case a higher k results in a higher degree of disequilibrium in terms of the magnitudes of the freshwater flux leading to faster wedge movement to yield a higher q s0 thus a shorter timescale the aquifer length l and sea level hs do not affect toe response distance or the toe travel rate in the specified flux boundary case thus do not influence the timescale in the specified head boundary case an increase in hs or l results in a lower head gradient and thus a longer toe response distance to satisfy the hydrostatic equilibrium in addition a higher h s or l leads to a lower freshwater flux and a lower degree of disequilibrium causing the lower travel rate of the interface to satisfy flow continuity therefore the longer toe distance and lower rate of the movement of the interface result in a longer timescale for a higher hs or l in the specified head boundary case 5 summary and conclusion this study has three major contributions first we derived for the first time a simple explicit analytical solution for the timescale of the interface movement in response to an abrupt change in the freshwater flux at the inland boundary allowing quick assessment of the swi and swr timescales the solution was extended to the case of specified hydraulic head at the inland boundary condition these solutions can be potentially used as a first order prediction tool for estimating the timescale of swi and swr second we theoretically verified the temporal disparity between swi and swr and quantified it using a temporal asymmetry index third we proposed a two mechanism based theoretical framework to explain the temporal asymmetry and analyzed the effects of aquifer parameters and boundary conditions on the timescales the analytical solutions provide many useful insights into swi and swr timescales albeit within the constraints of the approximation of a sharp interface in a confined homogenous isotropic aquifer for specified flux boundary cases the timescale is linearly proportional to porosity hydraulic conductivity and cubic aquifer thickness and is insensitive to the aquifer length and the coastal boundary head for specified head boundary cases the timescale is directly proportional to the porosity aquifer thickness density ratio coastal boundary head and squared aquifer length and inversely proportional to the hydraulic conductivity the close agreement in sensitivity results of analytical and numerical solutions demonstrates the robustness of the analytical solutions more importantly we conveniently explained and quantified the temporal asymmetry between swi and swr given two bounding steady states defined by specified fluxes or heads at the inland boundary longer toe displacements are traveled at lower rates and shorter toe displacements are traveled at higher rates in swi but this trend reverses in swr such that the timescales of swr are shorter than those of swi the temporal asymmetry index defined as the ratio between swi and swr timescales was found to be heavily dependent on changing boundary conditions and weakly influenced by aquifer parameters furthermore we theoretically examined the log linearity relationship between the timescale and the freshwater flux at the inland boundary recently identified by numerical simulations lu and werner 2013 we found that the relationship is not perfectly linear over the entire flux change range but may be approximated by two linear functions with different slopes for swi and swr respectively for the cases of large changes in the boundary flux for swi and swr the log linearity slope tends to be 2 and 1 respectively the present study is limited by the sharp interface approximation hence the proposed analytical approach does not explain the effect of the dispersivity on the timescale however it is possible to include a correction factor similar to that introduced by pool and carrera 2011 to account for dispersive mixing this study also neglects the

898,an elastic viscoplastic model ulrich 2013 is combined to a multi phase sph formulation hu and adams 2006 ghaitanellis et al 2015 to model granular flows and non cohesive sediment transport the soil is treated as a continuum exhibiting a viscoplastic behaviour thus below a critical shear stress i e the yield stress the soil is assumed to behave as an isotropic linear elastic solid when the yield stress is exceeded the soil flows and behaves as a shear thinning fluid a liquid solid transition threshold based on the granular material properties is proposed so as to make the model free of numerical parameter the yield stress is obtained from drucker prager criterion that requires an accurate computation of the effective stress in the soil a novel method is proposed to compute the effective stress in sph solving a laplace equation the model is applied to a two dimensional soil collapse bui et al 2008 and a dam break over mobile beds spinewine and zech 2007 results are compared with experimental data and a good agreement is obtained keywords smoothed particle hydrodynamics sediment transport granular rheology viscoplastic materials 1 introduction the physics of granular material is a major concern for many physical and industrial purposes because of the wide range of problems it is involved into in the field of soil mechanics the study of large deformations and post failure behaviour of soils are active research topics in this kind of problem the soil is assimilated to a continuum and theories of elasticity plasticity and viscosity are used in the field of hydraulics attention is focused on soil water interactions in order to deal with sediment transport usually the bed evolution is obtained from exner equation combined to transport formulae involving the empirical shields erosion criterion therefore the soil is not explicitly modelled and the evolution of the mesh geometry is used to take the bed evolution into account although this approach relies on a simple mass balance equation it has proven its efficiency in modelling bed load transport for large scale problems however this approach suffers from lack of physical modelling of the soil behaviour as a consequence it is not suitable for problems involving highly dynamic behaviour such flows involves several phases and exhibit highly non linear deformations they are common in applied hydrodynamics problems and raise many scientific and technical issues in particular the modelling of local scour flow induced erosion or landslide induced water waves are particularly complex since they require both an accurate treatment of mechanic behaviour of the soil and of soil water interactions modelling granular soils is particularly difficult because they behave with some respect to both liquids and solids thus as a first approximation they can suitably be assimilated to viscoplastic materials gdr midi 2004 morichon et al 2013 ulrich et al 2013 below a critical shear stress the soil behaves like a solid when the critical shear stress is exceeded the soil starts to flow exhibiting a shear thinning behaviour campbell 1990 jop et al 2006 gdr midi 2004 numerically the solid state is usually approached by a highly viscous state this kind of regularized viscoplastic model has been applied in the framework of finite volumes morichon et al 2013 however with such a multi phase mesh based method the presence of a free surface requires to solve the air flow and to reconstruct interfaces between air water and sediment moreover the highly non linear deformations and the interface fragmentation make these problems difficult to treat with traditional mesh based eulerian methods on the contrary lagrangian approaches are particularly adapted for modelling such phenomena regularized viscoplastic models have been successfully applied with smoothed particle hydrodynamics method sph to test cases such as saturation driven embankment failure ulrich 2013 submarine landslide capone et al 2010 xenakis et al 2015 scouring and sediment flushing problems fourtakas and rogers 2016 manenti et al 2011 recently nabian and farhadi 2016 used a similar approach in the framework of moving particle semi implicit method mps nevertheless regularized viscoplastic models exhibit severe drawbacks regarding lowly deformed regions where the soil is supposed to behave like a solid according to beverly and tanner 1992 misleading velocity fields can result from these models when stresses are everywhere very low compared to the yield stress because they can only mimics the rigid body behaviour in low stressed regions this is particularly important regarding erosion and scour development for which an accurate treatment of motionless regions is essential to correctly estimate the bed evolution therefore in this work the sediment is treated as a continuum whose behaviour law takes account for its granular nature ulrich s 2013 elastic viscoplastic model was thus implemented in an in house gpu code based on the cuda language 1 1 the code is based on a simplified version of the open source gpusph solver gpusph official website and improved on physical and numerical aspects in this model the sediment behaviour depends on a yield stress determined according to drucker prager s criterion in unyielded regions the shear stresses are calculated in line with the linear elastic theory in yielded regions a shear thinning rheological law is used and the transitions between solid and liquid states are ensured by a blending function driven by the strain rate magnitude and sediment granular properties three main improvements of ulrich s model ulrich 2013 were presented namely a simple and reliable method to compute the effective pressure within the material which is essential to correctly capture the failure process and the regime transitions an improvement of solid forces calculation using a sph second order derivative operator espanol and revenga 2003 and a physical threshold for the liquid solid transition therefore contrary to ulrich s 2013 original model the mechanical behaviour of the soil does not depend on any numerical parameter in the present model the granular and water phases are treated in the frame of hu and adams s 2006 sph multi phase formulation the multi phase model was adapted to semi analytical wall boundary conditions ferrand et al 2013 in order to model multi phase flows that both require an accurate pressure and shear stress treatment at the wall and present complex boundary geometries first the sph multi phase model is presented and validated a description of the soil constitutive equations as well as their sph discrete form are then provided numerical results are finally compared with experimental data for two 2d cases we assume that the reader is familiar with sph violeau and rogers 2016 throughout this document the sign convention of mechanics is used 2 weakly compressible multi phase sph model 2 1 governing equations in this work the sediment is treated as a continuum whose behaviour law takes account for its granular nature thus sediment transport is modelled adopting a multi phase approach water and soil deviatoric stresses are calculated with different behaviour laws otherwise the same set of equations is used for the two phases for weakly compressible flows the lagrangian form of continuity equation reads 1 d ρ d t ρ div u with ρ the density of the material t the time and u the velocity then momentum equation reads 2 d u d t 1 ρ grad p 1 ρ div τ g with p the pressure g the gravity and τ the shear stress tensor in the weakly compressible materials pressure is related to the density through the following state equation 3 p ρ 0 c 0 2 ξ ρ ρ 0 ξ 1 p b g with ρ 0 the reference density of the material c 0 the numerical speed of sound ξ the isentropic coefficient and p b g the dimensionless background pressure it should be highlighted that the weakly compressible model is less physical than numerical the main idea is to allow the density to vary because of the particle lagrangian motion while maintaining the compressibility as weak as possible thanks to a large enough speed of sound given that it has no physical meaning the same equation of state can be used for both phases i e water and soil with suitable values of ρ 0 and c 0 and ξ 7 2 2 sph multi phase formulation 2 2 1 hu and adams multi phase formulation the main difficulty in simulating multi phase flows remains in the treatment of discontinuities across phase interfaces with sph the density discontinuity raises particular issues indeed the classical sph differential operators highly depend on the density of neighbouring particles consequently numerical instabilities can occur near the interface for quite large density ratios note that the density ratio usually involved in sediment transport problems do not strictly require a multi phase formulation of sph operators as an example manenti et al 2011 and ulrich 2013 successfully applied one phase sph models to such problems however colagrossi and landrini 2003 showed that the sph gradient of pressure used in manenti et al s 2011 and ulrich s 2013 formulations implicitly involves a gradient of density then at the interface of two phases this formula computes the derivative of a discontinuous field even if it does not always lead to numerical instability this formulation is formally not adapted to multi phase problem on the other hand fourtakas and rogers 2016 used colagrossi and landrini s 2003 multi phase formulation although this model is suitable for multi phase problems the density field is obtained through an explicit integration of the continuity equation this leads to the accumulation of systematic integration errors which can make the density and velocity fields become inconsistent ferrand et al 2010 2013 vila 1999 thus hu and adams s 2006 multi phase formulation will be used in this work in standard one phase sph formulations the density ρ of a particle a is usually computed as the interpolation of the density of neighbouring particles b 4 ρ a b f v b ρ b w a b with v the particle volume w a b w r a b where w is the sph kernel in all this paper we use wendland s 5th order kernel wendland 1995 r a b r a r b and r the particle position vector f denotes the set of free particles one clearly sees that using eq 4 in the vicinity of the interface between two phases of different densities leads to a numerical smoothing of the interface this loss of information is a substantial drawback but it can be avoided since it is purely numerical to circumvent this issue hu and adams 2006 proposed a formulation based on the interpolation of the inverse volume instead of density 5 1 v a b f w a b then the definition of density becomes 6 ρ a m a 1 v a m a b f w a b therefore the mass ma of a particle being constant in wcsph weakly compressible sph the variation of density is only due to the evolution of the spatial organisation of neighbouring particles thus the interface smoothing is avoided in order to simplify notation we will refer to the particle volume as va defined as 7 v a 1 v a 1 hu and adams 2006 then proposed a pressure gradient that can be derived from 6 and the lagrangian variational principle of virtual work grenier et al 2009 8 g a p b 1 v a b f p a v a 2 p b v b 2 w a b grad p a where uline uline wab is the kernel gradient at the location of particle a note that the pressure gradient does not depend on density any more and is consequently stable near the interface in addition hu and adams 2006 also proposed a modified viscous term so as to deal with multiple viscosities ensuring the continuity of velocity and shear stress across the interface 9 l a η b u b n a b f 2 η a η b η a η b v a 2 v b 2 u a b r a b 2 r a b w a b div η grad u a where η is the dynamic viscosity u a b u a u b with u the velocity of a particle 2 2 2 adaptation to usaw boundary conditions hu and adams formulation is a straightforward robust and variationally consistent multi phase model however a rigorous treatment of boundary conditions is necessary to make it capable of simulating flows presenting complex boundary geometries to do so the model is adapted to unified semi analytical wall usaw boundary conditions usaw boundary conditions framework is based on a mesh used to discretized boundaries of the domain ferrand et al 2013 the mesh is composed of boundary elements s being segments in two dimensions and triangles in three dimensions see fig 1 a free particles are placed at the vertices of the mesh they move at wall velocity and are referred to as vertex particles v contrary to boundary elements they carry a mass m and should be taken into account in the continuity equation their volume v depends on the local geometry of the boundary and is calculated as a fraction θ of a reference volume v v θ v see fig 1b in two dimensions θ is defined as the angle between two connected segments divided by 2π thus for vertex particles we have θb 0 1 in order to have a general formulation we also define θ a 1 for free particles of matter f and θ s 1 2 for boundary elements in three dimensions θ is calculated in a similar way using solid angles for boundary elements and vertex particles the reference volume v is obtained from a shepard interpolation of the inverse volume for more details see ferrand et al 2013 10 a v s v a b f w a b b f v b w a b 1 for free particles the volume is equal to the reference volume θ 1 and is obtained adapting 5 and 7 to this framework 11 a f v a 1 γ a b f v θ b w a b 1 where γ is a renormalization factor used to correct the interpolation error due to the lack of particles beyond the boundary 12 γ a ω ω a w r r a d r thus from 10 and 11 we see that the reference volume is not constant and only depends on the geometrical configuration of neighbouring particles around the point of interest for free particles density is obtained adapting vila s form of the continuity equation vila 1999 13 a f d γ a ρ a d t d d t m a b f v θ b w a b then adapting the variationally consistent pressure gradient to usaw boundary conditions we get an approximation of the pressure gradient 14 g a p b 1 γ a v a b f v θ b p a v a 2 p b v b 2 w a b 1 γ a v a s s 1 v s p a v a 2 p s v s 2 γ a s where p is the pressure and γas is the contribution of segment s to the gradient of γa for a 1 d segment s delimited by two vertex particles v 1 v 2 γas is defined by 15 γ a s v 1 v 2 w r d l n s where n s is the inward normal of the segment s note that the discrete sph differential operator 14 contains a volumic term related to free and vertex particles and a boundary term related to boundary elements in the absence of boundaries 14 gives back hu and adams original formula 8 similarly we define the consistent divergence operator for a vector field a 16 d a a b v a γ a b f v θ b a a b w a b v a γ a s s 1 v s a a s γ a s div a a where a ab denotes a a a b now we proceed the same way for the viscous term paying particular attention to the viscosity of segments and vertex particles since we do not want to assign a phase to boundaries we take η b η a when b v s first we adapt hu and adams viscous term 9 to usaw boundary conditions 17 l a h η b u b 1 γ a v a b f v 2 η a η b η a η b θ b v a 2 v b 2 u a b r a b 2 r a b w a b 1 γ a v a s s η a v s v a 2 v s 2 u a s r a s 2 r a s γ a s as of now we will refer to it as hu and adams viscous term then we write the classical usaw laplacian resulting from the model of morris et al 1997 in the multi phase framework 18 l a m η b u b 1 γ a b f v θ b v b 4 η a η b η a η b u a b r a b 2 r a b w a b 1 γ a s s 2 η a u a s r a s 2 r a s γ a s from now on we will refer to it as morris et al s 1997 viscous term note that this viscous term also ensures continuity of velocity and shear stress across the interface the two latter formula are approximations of the laplacian operators 19 l a h m η b u b div η grad u a a more general discrete second order operator can also be defined it will be referred to as espanol and revenga s operator and will be denoted l e in the frame of the multi phase formulation with usaw boundary conditions it is defined for any vector and scalar fields a and b by 20 l a e b b a b 1 γ a b f v θ b v b 2 b a b b b a b b d 2 a a b e a

indeed violeau 2009 showed 21 l a e b b a b div b grad a grad a t a 2 2 3 rhie and chow correction far from the boundaries and considering the time as a continuous variable vila 1999 showed that that the discrete equation of continuity 13 can be related to some kind of implicit time integration of the continuity equation 22 d ρ a d t ρ a d a u b an implicit scheme being used for integrating 22 and neglecting the viscous term in integrating the momentum eq 2 using the sph gradient operator 14 we can write 23 ρ a n 1 ρ a n δ t ρ a n d a u b n 1 ρ a n d a u b n δ t ρ b n g b p c n δ t g ρ a n d a u b n δ t d a g b p c n δ t d a g b g r b n where δt is the time step the latter equation shows that the approximate laplacian of pressure d a g b p c n is implicitly contained into the time discretized equation of continuity acting like a diffusion term fatehi and manzari 2011 and more recently hashemi et al 2016 stated that substituting this discrete form of the laplacian by an sph laplacian operator l to be defined can significantly reduce the numerical pressure oscillations this technique was first introduced for finite volumes by rhie and chow 1983 it consists in adding to 13 the difference between d a g b p c n and l a p b n this will result in a smoothing term that will tend to zero as the particle spacing δr decreases several combinations of discrete laplacian operators have been tested and we finally chose the following smoothing term 24 δ n ρ a n δ t l a m 1 ρ b n p b n d a g b p c n ρ b n with lm the morris operator 18 g the symmetric sph gradient defined by 25 g a a b v a γ a b f θ b a a a b w a b and d the anti symmetric divergence defined by 26 d a a b 1 γ a v a b f θ b a a v a 2 a b v b 2 w a b the last two sph operators have inverse symmetry properties with respect to the original ones used above this particular combination was not chosen on a theoretical basis but after numerical tests moreover these operators are built on the basis of the multi phase operators 14 and 16 so the rhie and chow s 1983 correction terms are computed from all neighbouring particles irrespective of the phase they belong to on the other hand this correction only occurs between free particles so the discrete operators in 24 26 do not have boundary terms and do not include the vertex particles the continuity eq 13 is corrected as follows 27 ρ a n 1 1 γ n 1 γ n ρ a n m a b f v θ b w a b n 1 w a b n λ δ n where λ is a weighting coefficient from numerical experiments λ 1 gives satisfactory results note that no particle shifting algorithm is used in this work 2

integration scheme the first one relies the classical courant friedrichs levy cfl number the cfl number compares the time step to the time for the information to travel the characteristic distance of the simulation i e the discretization scale h at the characteristic velocity of the problem in wcsph the cfl number is defined as 29 c cfl c 0 δ t h for the viscous forces an additional condition must be enforce through the following dimensionless number 30 c visc η δ t ρ h 2 this number expresses the fact that the higher the viscosity the faster the information propagate along the successive layers of the fluid more details about the numerical stability of wcsph can be found in violeau and leroy 2014 and hashemi et al 2016 the latter includes the effect of density smoothing 2 2 5 validation the present formulation is validated on a two fluid laminar plane poiseuille flow in a closed channel involving two fluids of different kinematic viscosities ν 1 ν 2 and densities ρ 1 ρ 2 the 2d flow is driven by a gravity force ρ g oriented in the direction of the flow e x e x e y being the base vectors periodic open boundaries are used and the height of the channel is l 1 m the interface between the two fluids is in y 0 the top wall in y l 2 and the bottom wall in y l 2 where e y denotes the transverse direction in the present work the subscript 1 refers to the fluid in the bottom part y 0 in all simulations the ratio between δr and the smoothing length h is δ r h 2 note that in this case the rhie and chow s 1983 correction presented in section 2 2 3 was not used instead the brezzi and pitkäranta s 1984 correction presented in ghaitanellis et al 2015 was used in order to compare their results to the present results results are compared with the analytical solution that depends on the ratio between densities and viscosities respectively denoted λ and ω 31 λ ρ 1 ρ 2 ω ν 1 ν 2 we also define u 1 a characteristic velocity of the flow and re 1 the corresponding reynolds number 32 u 1 g l 2 2 ν 1 r e 1 u 1 l ν 1 g l 3 2 ν 1 2 finally we define the following dimensionless quantities 33 y y l u u x u 1 where u x u e x with u the velocity of the fluid with these notations the analytical solution u th reads 34 u th y 1 y 2 1 ω 1 λ ω y 1 if y 0 1 ω 1 y 2 λ ω 1 ω 1 λ ω y 1 if y 1 0 comparison of viscous terms r e 1 1 25 fig 2 shows the longitudinal velocity profile obtained using morris et al s 1997 viscous term 18 with l δ r 385 sph particles on the channel width numerical results are in excellent agreement with the analytical solution 34 represented by the solid line results obtained with hu and adams s 2006 viscous term 17 and espanol and revenga s 2003 one 20 also give such good qualitative results thus demonstrating that the shear stresses at the wall and at the interface are correctly calculated by the present multi phase model in order to validate further the multi phase model and to quantitatively compare the three viscous terms 18 17 and 20 we performed a convergence study with the parameters summarized in table 1 for each simulation velocity field is initialized to zero the numerical solution converges to a steady state see fig 3 a that is compared to the analytical solution 34 through the velocity instantaneous l 2 relative error e defined as follows 35 e t b f u b t u th y b t 2 b f u th y b t 2 where u b is the particle velocity u th yb the theoretical velocity at the position of particle b the steady state is assumed to be achieved when the profile is fully developed the characteristic time of the viscous effects propagation through the channel width l can be evaluated as t 1 l 2 ρ 1 η 1 from which we defined the dimensionless time t t t 1 fig 3a shows the instantaneous error with respect to the dimensionless time we can see that the steady state is achieved at t 1 and that the solution remains stable afterwards in order to have an objective measure of the error independent from the small oscillations of the instantaneous error we define the time averaged error e computed from 35 as 36 e 1 n t i 1 n t e t i where t i i 1 n t corresponds to the nt iterations in the time interval t 1 5 3 5 grey region in fig 3a fig 3b shows the time average error e with respect to the dimensionless particle size δr l i e the inverse of the number of particles along the channel height we see that the convergence slope of the present method using the three viscous terms is approximately of order 2 as long as δ r l 5 10 2 afterwards the convergence slope decreases for morris et al s 1997 and hu and adams operators while the error stabilized for espanol and revenga s 2003 viscous term these results are consistent with those obtained by ferrand et al 2013 for one fluid sph formulation with usaw boundary conditions thus validating the present multi phase model note that contrary to the results obtained by ghaitanellis et al 2015 hu and adams operators is not less accurate than morris s one this is because there was an implementation error in ghaitanellis et al s 2015 code 3 sediment constitutive model 3 1 context the main difficulty in modelling granular materials is that they cannot be classified as solids or liquids indeed they can behave like both of them under slightly different conditions that is the reason why rheological approach is often adopted to model granular flows in particular soil is usually treated as a viscoplastic material thus it has a yield stress τ y under which no deformation occurs when the yield stress is exceeded the material starts to flow in such a model the yield stress has to be compared to an invariant measure of the deviatoric stress tensor τ in this work the tensor second invariant is used according to drucker prager yield criterion drucker and prager 1952 37 τ 1 2 i j τ i j τ i j viscoplastic models include herschel bulkley s and casson s ones but the most common and best known model was proposed by bingham 1917 and reads 38 γ 0 if τ τ y τ 2 η τ y γ γ if τ τ y where η is the plastic viscosity γ the strain rate tensor and γ its second invariant defined as 39 γ 2 i j γ i j γ i j with γ i j the components of the strain rate tensor defined as 40 γ 1 2 grad u grad u t the ideal bingham model 38 describes a material that behaves as a rigid body at low stresses and flows as a fluid when the yield stress is exceeded unfortunately ideal bingham s model as well as herschel bulkley s and casson s ones all involve discontinuous behaviour law that corresponds to the liquid solid phase change they are thus poorly adapted to numerical simulation because they require additional numerical procedures to track down yielded unyielded regions indeed it can be easily verified that the transitions between liquid and solid states are not included in the model to do so let us calculate τ applying 37 to the second equation in 38 which corresponds to the liquid state 41 τ η γ τ y one can see that when the strain rate vanishes the deviatoric stress decreases and tends to τ y but never goes below to circumvent this issue these models can be approximated assuming that the viscoplastic material is a liquid that exhibits infinitely high viscosity when the strain rate vanishes beverly and tanner s 1992 bi viscosity model and papanastasiou s 1987 formula are two widely used examples of such regularized viscoplastic models thus the material is always liquid but mimics the ideal models behaviour for all rates of deformation numerically this is achieved using shear thinning rheological law and limiting the viscosity to a huge but finite maximum value this method is straightforward and has been widely applied to the simulation of sediment transport with finite volumes morichon et al 2013 moving particle semi implicit method nabian and farhadi 2016 and smoothed particle hydrodynamics method capone et al 2010 regarding sediment transport modelling this approach is well adapted for highly dynamic scenarios but exhibits severe drawbacks regarding small strain rates and deformations indeed the maximum viscosity has to be large enough to guarantee that no significant motion occurs in unyielded regions this is particularly important regarding erosion and scour development for which an accurate treatment of motionless regions is essential to correctly estimate the bed evolution thus it is necessary to ensure that results do not depend on the chosen maximum viscosity but in practice the maximum value of viscosity is actually limited for explicit time integration schemes because of computational cost as a consequence in the present paper a different approach is tested the model of ulrich 2013 is implemented in the framework of multi phase formulation and adapted to usaw boundary conditions the soil is treated as a linear elastic solid in unyielded regions and as a shear thinning liquid in yielded regions a continuous transition between the two states is ensured by a blending function driven by the strain rate magnitude besides improvements of the yield stress and solid forces computation are proposed as well as phase transition threshold based on the physical properties of the granular material 3 2 modelling assumptions in this work the granular material being dry or saturated is treated as a continuum under this assumption the continuous medium represents a mixture of grains and air or grains and water therefore we need to define equivalent properties of the continuous material from the physical properties of the granular material components the continuum properties should also depend on the grain concentration however the continuum hypothesis presents a major difficulty within the framework of the sph formulations presented in section 2 2 physically the evolution of grain concentration results from differences of velocity between the solid phase and the liquid phase when the mixture is assumed to be continuous the concentration evolution must be taken into account through the transport of a concentration field however this is not straightforward in the framework of the present sph model because this implies mass transfers between sph particles the particle masses being no longer constant the sph formulation presented in section 2 2 is not valid anymore and a whole new sph formulation would be necessary such a model is beyond the scope of this paper thus although it has be shown that the grain concentration is an important parameter for the description of dense granular flows armanini et al 2005 gdr midi 2004 the grain concentration will be assumed to be constant and homogeneous within the mixture domain therefore in practise ϕ is simply the porosity of the granular material at initial time in addition the fluid surrounding the grains will be assumed to be at rest with respect to the granular material skeleton indeed solving the fluid flow through the porous medium raises many practical issues in particular at water mixture interfaces for example let us consider an outgoing water flow from the mixture phase to the water phase then the mixture sph particles should give some water mass up to the water sph particles in order to ensure the mass conservation again this would require variable sph particle masses ulrich 2013 proposed a simplified model of partly saturated soil solving the flow in the porous material and transporting a concentration field however with this model the mass of water is not conserved consequently in his work the water flow through the porous medium is also neglected and the interstitial water is assumed to move at the mixture velocity this simplification implies several disadvantages first the seepage cannot be taken into account while it can have a significant effect when a stable structure of dry granular material becomes partially saturated liu and li 2015 thus in the present work we will only consider cases in which the material is initially totally dry denoted by dry or fully saturated denoted by sat and remains that way for ever for the dry case the mass of air in the pore is neglected while for the saturated case the equivalent density also depends on water density ρ w 42 ρ eq dry 1 ϕ ρ g ρ eq sat 1 ϕ ρ g ϕ ρ w although a weakly compressible formulation is used in this work we aim at modelling incompressible materials the equation of state 3 is a numerical way of closing the equations of motion system but the compressible effects are not supposed to play any role in the behaviour of the granular material thus we assume here that ρ w and ρ eq sat are constant secondly neglecting the flow through the porous material also implies that the pore water pressure field is unknown therefore another approximation is necessary and the pore water pressure will be assumed to be hydrostatic finally the granular medium will be considered incompressible in soil mechanics this hypothesis is only valid for fully saturated soils under fast loading un drained condition craig 1983 davis and selvadurai 2005 thus as regards bed load transport and scouring resulting from violent flows this assumption is suitable although this hypothesis is not valid for problems involving dry granular media we will see that the model is able to give satisfactory results in that case too 3 3 yield stress there are many yield criteria that are adapted to the different kinds of viscoplastic materials although the mohr coulomb criterion is widely used in geotechnical engineering its implementation raises numerical issues because the corresponding yield surface is an irregular hexagonal pyramid jiang and xie 2011 thus the drucker prager yield criterion is usually used as a smooth alternative it is a pressure dependent model that can be expressed in terms of internal friction angle ψ for non cohesive soils as 43 τ y 2 3 sin ψ 3 sin ψ p eff where p eff is the effective pressure that is to say the normal stress that the grains actually exert on each other considering a situation where the stress configuration is close to the failure almost no motion occurs within the material therefore the isotropic stress i e the total pressure p tot is solely due to pressure derived from the weight of the column of material and interstitial fluid above a specified level consequently denoting z i the soil water interface vertical position z fs the free surface vertical position and z the vertical position of the point of interest see fig 4 the total pressure reads 44 p tot ρ w g z fs z i ρ eq sat g z i z moreover terzaghi s principle terzaghi 1936 states that the effective pressure depends on the total pressure p tot and the pore water pressure p pw according to the following relation 45 p eff p tot p pw assuming no porous flow inside the soil the pore water pressure reads 46 p pw ρ w g z fs z finally effective pressure can be obtained using 45 47 p eff g z i z ρ eq sat ρ w nevertheless getting p eff from 47 requires to detect soil water interface beforehand such a detection has been tested by manenti et al 2011 but it seems to us that it can lead to inaccurate result when the interface is highly deformed in order to get effective pressure without interface tracking fourtakas and rogers 2016 proposed to use a modified state equation however we found that this method leads to a large overestimation of p eff when the soil is submerged furthermore with such an approach the well known wcsph pressure oscillations fatehi and manzari 2011 also impact the yield stress therefore we propose here another simple and reliable solution recall that ρ w and ρ eq sat are constant in addition z i is the function that gives the mixture water interface above the point of interest so it does not depend on the vertical coordinate as long as the water mixture interface is not too much deformed we can besides assume that the interface varies linearly in the horizontal directions in the vicinity of the point of interest this is the strongest assumption done in this reasoning thus taking the laplacian of 47 yields 48 δ p eff 0 taking the laplacian of 47 with suitable boundary conditions we get the following system 49 δ p eff r 0 for r ω p eff r 0 for r i p eff n r g n for r s with ω the simulation domain s the solid boundaries n the inward boundary normal and i the boundary corresponding to soil free surface and soil water interface see fig 4 in the present model p eff is only used to compute the yield stress it cannot be used in the momentum conservation equation because 49 is valid when the total pressure is approximately lithostatic which is not true in yielded regions thus the total pressure calculated with the state eq 3 is used to compute the pressure gradient in the momentum conservation equation this amounts to assume that the pore water pressure gradient can be neglected compared to the effective pressure gradient 50 p eff p tot p pw p tot note that it would be possible to eliminate this approximation observing that 49 can easily be adapted to compute the hydrostatic pore water pressure the pressure gradient in the momentum conservation equation could thus be computed from p tot p pw this was not tested in this work 3 4 shear stresses 3 4 1 elastic solid state in the present model the solid state of the granular material is evaluated in line with linear elastic theory the shear stress tensor in the solid regions reads 51 τ g s 2 g γ can be obtained from the following rate of stress equation 52 τ g s 2 g γ where the dot denotes the time derivative the subscript g refers to the granular material and the superscripts s refers to the elastic solid model i e the solid state and g is the shear modulus defined by 53 g e 2 1 ν with e the young s modulus and ν the poisson s coefficient note that similarly to many authors in sph literature gray et al 2001 randles and libersky 1996 ulrich 2013 hooke s law will be used to model the deviatoric part of the stress tensor while an equation of state will be used to compute the pressure according to the weakly compressible approach see section 2 as mentioned in section 2 1 here the compressibility is only a numerical trick to mimic the incompressible behaviour this is consistent with the assumption of an incompressible linear elastic material see section 3 2 note that such a state equation has already been successfully used to compute the pressure in a linear elastic material in the sph literature e g in gray et al 2001 and ulrich 2013 in 52 we differentiated the solid state behaviour law 51 for the following reason it can be shown that the rate of stress 52 is not objective i e it is not independent on the frame of reference in particular it is not invariant with respect to rigid body rotation though the material constitutive equations should be frame indifferent since the mechanical response of a material must not depend on the observer thus the dynamic quantities such as the cauchy stress tensor are frame invariant dienes 1979 gurtin 1981 to circumvent this issue objective material time derivatives must be used the most commonly used in computational mechanics is the jaumann time derivative denoted with a triangle δ and defined by 54 σ δ σ σ ω ω σ where ω is the rotation rate tensor that is directly related to the rate of rigid body rotation within a material 55 ω 1 2 grad u grad u t note that when no rigid body rotation occurs within the material the jaumann material derivative 54 is tantamount to the standard material time derivative applying 54 to the deviatoric stress tensor τ yields 56 τ δ g s 2 g γ j denoting j the jaumann rate tensor defined by 57 j τ g s ω ω τ g s the shear stress tensor finally reads 58 τ g s 2 g γ j which is more relevant than the initial attempt 51 3 4 2 viscoplastic fluid state in yielded regions the material is modelled as a shear thinning liquid thus the viscous fluid behaviour law stokes 1851 is used to model the shear stress 59 τ g l 2 η eff γ where the superscript l refers to the viscoplastic model i e the liquid state in ulrich s 2013 original model the effective viscosity η eff was calculated according to a rheological law similar to the μ i rheology jop et al 2006 here we propose a different law in order to be consistent with the drucker prager yield criterion the effective viscosity is thus defined by 60 η eff τ y γ where τ y is the yield stress calculated according to 43 therefore similarly to the μ i rheology jop et al 2006 revil baudard and chauchat 2013 the effective viscosity is related to the friction within the granular material however here the friction coefficient is constant in time since the internal friction ψ is a constant parameter in our model it should be noted that 60 ensures the continuity of the shear stress magnitude in the liquid solid transition since we have 61 τ g l 1 2 τ g l τ g l η eff γ τ y 3 4 3 solid fluid transition similarly to the ideal viscoplastic models mitsoulis 2007 bingham herschel bulkley casson the elastic viscoplastic model ulrich 2013 involves a discontinuous behaviour law thus the liquid solid phase transition cannot solely be based on the yield stress consider the material is in the liquid state then the shear stress magnitude is always equal to τ y as shows in 61 thus the material cannot become solid as a consequence similarly to regularized viscoplastic models papanastasiou 1987 tanner and milthorpe 1983 the yield criterion is not based on a dynamic condition anymore τ τ y but on a kinematic condition γ γ y thus we need to build a new threshold expressed in terms of strain rate that still depends on the yield stress to do so we write 62 γ y τ y η y where η y is a dynamic viscosity referred to as yield viscosity thus 62 points out that the solid liquid transition now depends on an additional parameter η y moreover the yield viscosity not only determines the threshold strain rate but also the maximum possible viscosity for the material in liquid state in ulrich 2013 the value of η y is chosen in a trial and error approach increasing incrementally its value until obtaining satisfying result here we propose to find a value based on the physical properties of the material to do so we first consider the deborah number de which characterizes the fluidity of a material under the flow conditions of a specific experiment 63 d e t r t c where tc is the characteristic time scale of the experiment and tr the stress relaxation time for a granular material assuming spherical grains sun and wang 2013 proposed to use the characteristic time of rayleigh waves propagating along a grain surface 64 t r g π d g 0 162 ν 0 887 ρ g g with d g the grain diameter on the other hand during the transition the soil can be seen as a viscoelastic material in that case the deborah number is calculated with a relaxation time defined as 65 t r v e η y g for a given material the two relaxation time definitions should match therefore combining 64 and 65 gives a definition of the yield viscosity 66 η y π d g g ρ g 0 163 ν 0 877 we can now use the blending function proposed by ulrich 2013 67 ζ γ q 1 γ γ y q q γ γ y q 1 if γ γ y 1 if γ γ y with q a positive integer the solid liquid transition sharpness can be adjusted varying q similarly to ulrich 2013 we use q 2 note that the blending function has the same role as papanastasiou s 1987 regularization it smooths the phase transition which is more appropriate than a sharp interface for numerical modelling the liquid solid deviatoric stress tensor is thus given by 68 τ ζ τ g l 1 ζ τ g s it is important to note that the solid stresses in the soil should vanish when the liquid state is reached after flowing the grains have no memory of their initial position thus the strain tensor must be reinitialized when ζ 1 furthermore the phase transition is based on a condition on the strain rate magnitude γ while the elastic solid stresses do not depend on the strain rate thus there can be situations where the liquid state is not fully reached γ γ y but where the solid stress magnitude exceeds the yield stress τ τ y this happens when the failure is followed by very slow deformations thus the strain rate γ remains smaller than γ y but the strain keeps increasing consequently the solid stress magnitude also keeps increasing and ends up exceeding the yield stress however the material is supposed to yield when the stress magnitude reaches the yield stress so this never happens physically to avoid unphysical overestimation of the solid stresses we need to rescale the solid stress tensor so that the solid stress magnitude never exceeds the yield stress 69 τ g ss τ g s if τ g s τ y τ g ss τ y τ τ g s if τ g s τ y where τ g ss denotes the rescaled deviatoric stress tensor the final form of the liquid solid deviatoric stress tensor is thus 70 τ ζ τ g l 1 ζ τ g ss finally in this model the mechanical behaviour of the soil only depends on elastic e ν and granular d g ρ g ϕ ψ properties of the material especially through 43 and 66 that drive the liquid solid transition 4 sph implementation in sph the continuum is sampled in a set of interpolation points f having a constant mass ma and referred to as particles an sph particle used to discretize a granular material continuum represents a small volume that contains a mixture of solid grains and surrounding fluid the equivalent density of the continuum is calculated from 42 the present granular material model is implemented within the scope of the multi phase sph formulation presented in section 2 2 first let us define or recall the following sets of sph particles v is the set of vertex particles see usaw framework in section 2 2 2 s is the set of boundary elements see usaw framework in section 2 2 2 m is the set of free particles of granular material mixture of grains and surrounding fluid w is the set of free particles of water f is the set of free particles of matter f m w i is the set of free particles of matter at the water mixture interface i f 4 1 effective pressure to compute the effective pressure p eff we need to solve the laplace eq 49 thus we use morris laplacian 18 to write the corresponding discrete equation 71 a m i l a u 1 p eff b 0 where m i refers to the set of sph particles of mixture that are not located at the interface at the wall the neumann boundary conditions 49 must be satisfied applying the technique used by ferrand et al 2013 to compute the dynamic pressure at the wall we use a shepard like interpolation of the effective pressure field 72 a v s p eff a 1 b f s v b w a b b f s v b p eff b δ ρ eq g r a r b w a b with v s the set of boundary elements and vertex particles besides a particular attention must be paid to the dirichlet condition imposed to soil particles located at the soil water interface second line of 49 indeed the pressure due to their own weight must be taken into account otherwise the yield stress 43 is always zero at interface particles 73 a m i p eff a g δ r δ ρ eq with m i the set of sph particles of mixture located at the interface and δr the initial particle spacing i e the particle size finally 71 is solved using a jacobi solver initialized with the previous time step solution thus ensuring low computational cost 4 2 shear forces 4 2 1 elastic solid force density to compute elastic forces we first need to compute the strain rate tensor γ and the rotation rate tensor ω 74 γ a 1 2 g a u b g a u b t 1 3 tr g a u b i 75 ω a 1 2 g a u b g a u b t where the multi phase anti symmetric gradient based on 16 is used here 76 g a u b v a γ a b f v θ b u a u b w a b v a γ a s s 1 v s u a u s γ a s with denoting the tensor product note that the anti symmetric gradient 76 is used instead of 14 for more accuracy it should also be reminded that the trace of the velocity gradient should be zero for an incompressible fluid but within the scope of wcsph we have to remove the trace from the strain rate tensor in 74 to ensure that the deviatoric stress tensor τ is really traceless the shear stress tensor then follows from an explicit time integration of the jaumann rate of shear stress 56 77 τ g s 2 g γ τ ω ω τ where the overbar indicates explicit time integration then the elastic solid force density could be simply computed from the divergence of the deviatoric stress tensor 78 div τ g s div 2 g γ div j numerically this implies two iterative use of first order sph derivative operators indeed 77 requires computing the strain rate tensor γ using the sph gradient of velocity then 78 requires to take the sph divergence of the shear stress tensor gray et al 2001 ulrich 2013 thus focusing on the first term in 78 yields 79 div 2 g γ a g d a g b u c g b u c t but due to the collocated nature of sph applying iteratively first order derivative operators to get higher order derivatives leads to significant inaccuracy see section 2 2 3 this can be avoided observing that the shear strain tensor γ can be calculated from the displacement x instead of the time integration of the strain rate tensor 80 γ 1 2 grad x grad x t this definition of shear strain tensor 80 is particularly adapted to sph whose lagrangian characteristic gives a direct access to particle displacement 81 x t r t r 0 with r the particle position and r 0 the initial particle position note that the initial particle position is reinitialised every time the material passes from liquid to solid state after flowing a grain has no memory of its initial position then the shear strain divergence can be obtained using espanol and revenga s 2003 second order derivative operator l e defined in 20 contrary to 9 and 18 espanol and revenga s 2003 formula 20 is not an approximation of the laplacian see 21 now applying 20 to shear modulus g and displacement x we get 82 div 2 g γ a g l a e 1 x b a similar treatment of the jaumann term does not seem to be possible so the shear force density f finally reads 83 f g s a g l a e 1 x b d a j b div τ g l a where the tensor j follows from an explicit time integration of the jaumann rate tensor 57 84 j n 1 j n δ t τ g s ω ω τ g s n the force density f g s is rescaled afterwards according to 69 here we omit the sph particle labels for the sake of clarity 85 f g ss f g s if τ g s τ y f g ss τ y τ g s f g s if τ g s τ y note that the latter rescaling is not tantamount to 69 indeed here we rescale forces instead of stresses which means that the following approximation is done 86 div τ y τ g s τ g s τ y τ g s div τ g s this is mandatory when using 82 instead of 79 because the stress tensor τ g s is not directly used to compute the forces although it will be seen that using 82 improves the computation of elastic forces see section 4 3 it would be necessary to evaluate the effect of the latter approximation on the model accuracy to ascertain whether 82 is globally better unfortunately such an investigation has not been carried out in the scope of this work 4 2 2 viscous force density when the material is in the viscoplastic liquid state the force density is given by 87 div τ g l a div 2 η eff γ a thus it is computed applying 20 to the effective viscosity η eff and the velocity u 88 f g l a l a e η eff b u b div 2 η eff γ a here again espanol and revenga s 2003 operator is used instead of morris viscous term this is due to the fact that the transposed velocity gradient in 40 cannot be neglected when modelling non newtonian fluids the effective viscosity is computed according to 60 that depends on the yield stress 43 and the mean scalar rate of strain γ 39 4 2 3 blending of shear forces the continuous transition between solid and liquid state is ensured by the blending function ζ 67 defined in section 3 4 3 here again we omit the sph particle labels 89 f g ζ f g l 1 ζ f g s where f g s and f g l are computed respectively through 83 and 87 note that here the blending applies to the forces instead of the stresses even though 89 is not tantamount to 67 since ζ in not constant in space however the blending being a numerical trick to ensure a continuous transition 89 can be used too a simple way of getting 67 back would be to use 90 f g a l a e ζ b η eff b u b g l a e 1 ζ b x b d a 1 ζ b j b however the differences between 89 and 90 were not investigated in this work 4 2 4 boundary conditions 4 2 4 1 conditions at water granular material interface in the frame of the multi phase formulation presented in section 2 2 the density and the pressure fields do not require any special treatment for the interaction of sph particles of water w and of granular material m the density is computed according to 13 from all the neighbouring particles irrespective of the phase w or m they belong to besides that both phases have a pressure field so the pressure gradient is simply computed with the multi phase gradient 14 in regard to the shear forces the two phases only interact though viscous effects for which espanol and revenga s 2003 viscous term 20 is used in the two phases in water the granular material neighbours are seen as liquid particles having a viscosity η eff thus the force density exerted by a particle b of granular material m on a particle a of water w reads 91 a w b m f w b a θ b v b η w a η eff b η w a η eff b d 2 u a u b e a b e a b u a u b w a b r a b r a b 2 where the subscript w refers to the water and d is the space dimension on the other hand the viscous force density exerted by the water particle on the granular material contribute to the viscoplastic term in 89 through 92 a m b w f g l a b ζ θ b v b η w a η eff b η w a η eff b d 2 u a u b e a b e a b u a u b w a b r a b r a b 2 it should be noted that since there is no contribution of the water neighbour the elastic solid term in 89 the action reaction principle is not respected when ζ 1 indeed from the two latter equations we can see that we only have 93 a m b w f w b a 1 ζ f g l a b nevertheless the strain rate of granular material particles close to the interface is usually high due to the water particles velocity that contribute 74 therefore for particles in m having neighbours in w we usually have ζ 1 so the action reaction principle is respected most of the time despite that 93 remains a weakness of the present model and further investigation should be carried out to improve this aspect as a consequence of 91 and 92 the suspended sediment and water only exert viscous forces on each other when the sediment resettles viscoplastic and elastic forces exert between sediment sph particles as regards erosion the water sediment interaction could be improved taking account for turbulence in the present model the shear stress at the water sediment interface depends on the shear rate the dynamic viscosity of water and the local viscoplastic viscosity of the sediment physically erosion results from the viscous and turbulent shear stresses exerted by water on the solid grains of sediment thus it may be possible to use and sph form of the standard k ϵ model in the water phase ferrand et al 2013 treating the water sediment interface as a solid wall the stress exerted on the sediment sph particles would then be deduced from the action reaction principle that way the bottom shear stress would not depend on the rheological law used within the granular material this approach has not been tested here conditions at wall granular material interface wall boundary conditions must enforced on both the viscoplastic term 88 and the elastic solid term 83 with regard to the former the method proposed by ferrand et al 2013 for the viscous wall condition is simply applied as regards the elastic solid term the displacement of vertex v and boundary elements s et imposed to zero we recall espanol and revenga s 2003 boundary term 94 l a e bound 1 x b 1 γ a s s x a x s γ a s using a taylor expansion we can write 95 x a e a s x a x s r a s x s e a s x a x s r a s thus imposing x s 0 espanol and revenga s 2003 boundary term 94 can be approximated as 96 l a e bound 1 x b 2 γ a s s x a r a s γ a s r a s 2 the latter approximation is not exact because γas is a vector oriented along the inward wall normal vector not along r as then we assume a locally uniform distribution of j at the walls recall j is the time anti derivative of the jaumann tensor as defined in section 3 4 1 the corresponding boundary term reads 97 d a bound j b v a γ a s s 1 v s j a j s γ a s the present assumption yields j s j a hence 98 d a bound j b 0 similarly we assume j b j a for vertex particles b v thus the contribution of vertex particles to the volumic term also vanishes the divergence of jaumann rate finally simplifies to 99 d a j b v a γ a b f θ b j a j b w a b where the boundary terms vanished and the sum now only extends to free particles f 4 3 validation of elastic forces computation this test case is a simple numerical experiment that aims at testing the improvement resulting from the computation of solid forces from the displacement field i e using 82 instead of 79 see section 4 2 1 for a detailed description of the method the quantity of interest is thus 100 f div grad x grad x t this is usually computed from the velocity field integrating the strain rate tensor γ and using 79 101 f a u d a 2 γ n δ t g b u c g b u c t n the proposed alternative consists in calculating f from the displacement field x using espanol and revenga s 2003 second order differential operator 20 102 f x a l a e 1 x b in order to compare the two approaches accuracy we consider the periodic case of 2d taylor green vortices for which the analytical velocity field is known 103 u x y t cos 2 π x l sin 2 π y l sin 2 π x l cos 2 π y l exp 2 η t ρ in order to quantify the error due to the sph operators only we consider a cartesian grid of fixed sph particles their velocity and corresponding theoretical displacement are imposed according to 103 the simulation is carried out for l 1 η ρ 0 1 m2 s 2 and l δ r 100 after 10 s of physical time expressions 101 and 102 are evaluated and compared to the exact value 100 obtained with mathematica wolfram research inc 2017 the comparison is performed calculating the error defined by 104 e a f a s p h f x a y a 2 1 n a f f x a y a 2 where f a s p h is the quantity f calculated at particle a with sph using either 101 or 102 f xa ya is the theoretical values calculated with mathematica at the particle a position xa ya and n is the total number of sph particles results are plotted in fig 5 that shows the error we got for both approaches we clearly see that the error is much larger using 79 with a maximum error twice the one obtained using 82 this demonstrates the accuracy gain due to the use of a second order operator instead of two iterative uses of a first order operator within the scope of collocated methods 5 simulation of 2d soil collapse to validate the present model a simulation of an experimental 2 d collapse of dry soil is first carried out the experiment was conducted by bui et al 2008 and the experimental set up is illustrated in fig 6 the material is composed of aluminium bars of diameter 1 mm and 1 5 mm length 50 mm and density 2650 kg m 3 the material porosity is not specified by the authors so we approximate it using the highest compact binary circle packing leading to ϕ 0 1 all other physical parameters were determined experimentally by bui et al 2008 and are summarized in table 2 the simulations were performed using approximately 20 000 particles of soil and 1400 vertex and boundary elements with an initial particle spacing of δ r 0 001 m in all simulations the ratio between δr and the smoothing length h is δ r h 2 the numerical speed of sound was set to 10 m s 1 fig 7 shows the simulation result at four physical times we see that 49 leads to an accurate calculation of the yield stress free of the typical sph numerical oscillations of pressure besides almost no deformation occurs between t 1 5 s and t 2 0 s thus demonstrating that the model is able to represent the solid state even after a large time compared to the characteristic time of the experiment h g 0 1 s in fig 8 the surface configuration at the end of the experiment as well as the failure line are compared with numerical results obtained at 1 5 s experimentally the failure line is defined as the line delimiting the non deformed region numerically we define the non deformed region as the area where the displacement magnitude is less than the grain size i e 1 5 mm both surface configuration and failure line are well predicted by the model although we assume that the granular medium is incompressible while it is not a valid hypothesis for dry soils thus compressible effects are probably negligible in that case note that we observed significant numerical noise when the solid state is reached when its velocity tends to zero the material should reach a steady motionless state and behave like a pure elastic solid in the present model we thus expect the shear forces to be solely calculated from the elastic solid model i e the blending function should be homogeneously equal to zero within the material however because of numerical noise some strain rate is artificially produced consequently the sediment is in an unstable equilibrium continuously oscillating between a solid state and a highly viscous liquid state this emphasizes the fact that the blending approach 70 has a stabilization effect contrary to bui et al 2008 the tensile instability is not directly observed however it still leads to numerical noise when the material is in the solid state to circumvent this issue the artificial stress method gray et al 2001 could be tested in a future work this technique was developed to remove the tensile instability that may be partly responsible for the above mentioned numerical noise 6 simulation of 2d dam break wave on movable beds the present model was also assessed to a case of dam break wave propagating over a saturated granular bed this study is based on the small scale experiments carried out by spinewine and zech 2007 the experiments were performed in a flume being 25 cm wide and 6 m long the initial configuration of the experiment is illustrated in fig 9 the dam break is initiated by the sudden lowering of a gate that is not taken into account in the simulation two materials sand and pvc are tested to investigate the capability of the model to exhibit different behaviours with respect to different materials the physical parameters of the materials are summarized in table 3 note that experimental young s modulus and poisson s coefficient were available for these materials consequently we used generic values from ulrich 2013 for similar cases the first simulations were carried out setting a particle spacing of δ r 0 002 m resulting in 525 000 particles of water 150 000 particles of saturated soil and 13 000 particles vertex and boundary particles the numerical speed of sound and isentropic coefficient are set identically for the saturated granular material and the water that is c 0 37 m s 1 and ξ 7 rhie and chow s 1983 chequerboard correction 27 was applied with a coefficient of λ rc 1 0 and no background pressure was used fig 10 shows a comparison of the experiment and the sph simulation carried out for the sand for δ r 2 d g we can see that the dynamics of the flow is qualitatively well reproduced by the model total eroded mass of soil first let us focus on the total mass of sediments that reaches the downstream flume outlet to do so we define the relative error on the total eroded mass with respect to the experimental value 105 e r m sph m exp m exp fig 11 shows the error er as a function of the ratio δr d g particle size grain diameter we can see that sand and pvc simulations exhibit similar behaviours although they have different grain sizes 106 d g pvc 2 d g sand for the two materials decreasing the sph particle size improves the result until the critical value δ r d g below this threshold the soil model is no more valid and erosion is dramatically overestimated this discretization limitation may be due to the fact that sph particles are supposed to represent a macroscopic volume of the saturated soil the continuum hypothesis amounts to assume that the physical state of a heterogeneous system e g a multi phase system involving fluid and solid discrete particles can be described by continuous field variables whose space and time dependence is represented by differential equations for mass momentum and energy balances baveye and sposito 1984 such a description is based on the concept of representative elementary volume over which a local volume average allows a transition from microscopic physical properties to macroscopic field variables as well as from microscopic differential balance laws to macroscopic differential balance laws baveye and sposito 1984 the continuous fields result from the microscopic properties of the system but they are macroscopic quantities that do not have any physical sense at the microscopic scale thus the representative elementary volume should be small enough with regards to the problem dimensions to be an approximation of a mathematical neighbourhood of its centre but large enough to enclose many spatial heterogeneity baveye and sposito 1984 as an example the derivation of darcy s equations that describes flows in porous media requires that the characteristic length of the pores is smaller than the characteristic length of the averaging volume whitaker 1986 using sph particles or mesh cells smaller than the pores or the grains in our case amounts to using averaging volumes that do not satisfy this constraint thus the numerical solution approaches a theoretical solution that is not a correct description of the physical problem issues related to the length scales constraints and the continuum hypothesis have been addressed in the frame of porous media flows baveye and sposito 1984 whitaker 1986 in the scope of multi phase flows gómez and milioli 2005 claim that a minimum limit should be enforced on numerical spatial mesh sizes having in view the validity of the average eulerian continuum equations for the solid phase according to clemiņš 1988 using mesh cells whose size does not satisfy the minimum size condition may lead to non physical fluctuations of the resolved fields in that case it is necessary to average the result on a larger volume to get relevant physical quantities extending this conclusion to lagrangian methods seems to raise additional issues indeed if a non physical fluctuation of the velocity field occurs within an sph particle the particle moves and the simulation is irreversibly affected contrary to mesh based methods it is not possible to average the fluctuating fields afterwards to get relevant physical quantities therefore an sph particle should not be smaller than the sediment grain size otherwise the model would lead to deformations that do not occur in the real material and overestimated strain rates this may be partly due to the fact that the macroscopic elastic properties e g young s modulus of the granular materials are very different from elastic properties of individual grains they are composed of guan et al 2012 consequently a particular attention must be paid to the discretization limitations when modelling granular materials with sph this might be avoided using alternative rheological laws or different elastic properties when δr d g on the other hand fig 11 clearly shows that a sub particle model would be necessary to correctly predict erosion when δr d g within the scope of the present elastic viscoplastic model the problem depends on 10 physical parameters the density ρ w and dynamic viscosity of water η w the grain density ρ g the granular material porosity ϕ the internal friction angle ψ the young s modulus e the poisson s coefficient the grain size d g the gravity acceleration g and a characteristic length of the problem l applying the buckingham π theorem we obtain 7 dimensionless parameters that characterize this problem 107 ϕ ρ g ρ w ψ ν r e g 1 2 l 3 2 ρ w η w d g l e d g ρ g ρ w g in a way using δr d g amounts to setting d g δ r we would then have sph particles being solid matter while other are viscoplastic the latter two dimensionless numbers are thus modified as 108 δ r l e δ r ρ g ρ w g regarding the first one the decrease of the grain size has probably no influence on the results since we have δr l 1 as well as d g l 1 however we see that the second dimensionless number is significantly changed recovering its physical value can be done by changing young s modulus when δ r α d g with α 1 we would set the young s modulus to αe however this was not tested in the scope of this work in fig 11 we see that an optimum seems to be achieved for δr d g 3d g for both sand and pvc however it must be pointed out that δr 3d g is a coarse spatial discretization for this problem 22 particles on the water height thus the error due to the hydrodynamics solver is also probably partly responsible on the erosion overestimation note that erosion is overestimated for almost all configurations thus at worst simulations give a superior limit of the real erosion in the following results are presented for δr 2d g e g for the sand simulations were carried out setting a particle spacing of δ r 0 004 m resulting in 130 000 particles of water 38 000 particles of saturated soil and 3000 particles vertex and boundary particles flows interfaces fig 12 shows the interface between moving and motionless sediment black the water sediment interface blue and the water free surface red for the sand the interface between the motionless and the moving sediment is defined in line with the experimental detection method in the experiment a camera set to 200 images per second i e one image every δ t 5 ms was used to acquire image sequences of the flow every image was then subtracted to the preceding image the black region in the resulting image was defined as the motionless region given that the spatial resolution for one pixel is approximately δ x 1 mm spinewine and zech 2007 we define a threshold velocity below which the sediment sph particle is considered as motionless 109 u motion δ x δ t continuous lines represent the numerical results while experimental data are represented as dotted lines a general good agreement is obtained for the sand bed interfaces as well as free surface and water front are well predicted for the five considered times fig 14 shows a comparison of flow interfaces for δ r 2 d g solid lines and δ r d g 2 dashed lines we clearly see that having sph particles smaller that the grain size dashed lines leads to overestimated bed deformations while the results obtained for δ r 2 d g figs 12 and 14 match the experimental data for the pvc bed fig 13 shows that the initial liquefaction is slightly underestimated in particular the experimental bed profile i e the black dotted line at t 250 ms is deeper than the numerical one this may be due to the fact that the lowering of a gate is not taken into account in the simulation moreover there is a large uncertainty on pvc beds elastic properties indeed elastic properties of sand are widely used in soil mechanics and a lot of experimental data is available we did not find such data for pvc soils hence the differences between numerical and experimental results nevertheless simulations give good results for the pvc too in addition they exhibit very different behaviours for sand and pvc demonstrating the capability of the model to account for different material properties 7 conclusion in this work ulrich s 2013 elastic viscoplastic model was implemented and improves in the frame of a sph multi phase formulation hu and adams s 2006 multi phase formulation was adapted to usaw boundary conditions and vila s 1999 continuity equation is used so that the model can handle free surface flows the soil is treated as a continuum whose behaviour depends on a yield stress determined according to drucker prager s criterion in unyielded regions the shear stress is calculated in line with linear elastic theory in yielded regions a shear thinning rheological law is used and the transitions between solid and liquid states are ensured by a blending function driven by the strain rate magnitude a yield strain rate definition based on the yield stress and physical properties of the soil was proposed thus contrary to ulrich 2013 the mechanical behaviour of the soil does not depend on any numerical parameter in addition a reliable method based on a laplace equation was developed to compute the effective pressure that is mandatory to compute the yield stress this elastic viscoplastic model was tested on a two dimensional soil collapse test case the soil surface configuration and the failure line were compared to experimental results and a good agreement was found the surface remaining constant after a few seconds the model was then applied to a two dimensional dam break wave on movable beds two different materials were tested i e sand and pvc pullets numerical free surface moving soil water and motionless soil moving soil interfaces were compared to experimental data a good agreement was found for the sand for the pvc the lack of elastic properties experimental values leads to less accurate but still reasonable results for both materials the total mass of eroded sediment is predicted with a correct order of magnitude when the sph particle size does not exceed three times the grain size note that this work may be implemented in future versions of the open source gpusph code gpusph official website to improve results turbulence models could be tested indeed the force exerted by water on the sediment is strongly related to the turbulent viscosity of water near the soil water interface moreover a sub particle model could improve erosion prediction when the particle size is large compared to the grain size more radically unified solid liquid models peshkov and romenski 2016 could be considered to model granular flows in sph 
898,an elastic viscoplastic model ulrich 2013 is combined to a multi phase sph formulation hu and adams 2006 ghaitanellis et al 2015 to model granular flows and non cohesive sediment transport the soil is treated as a continuum exhibiting a viscoplastic behaviour thus below a critical shear stress i e the yield stress the soil is assumed to behave as an isotropic linear elastic solid when the yield stress is exceeded the soil flows and behaves as a shear thinning fluid a liquid solid transition threshold based on the granular material properties is proposed so as to make the model free of numerical parameter the yield stress is obtained from drucker prager criterion that requires an accurate computation of the effective stress in the soil a novel method is proposed to compute the effective stress in sph solving a laplace equation the model is applied to a two dimensional soil collapse bui et al 2008 and a dam break over mobile beds spinewine and zech 2007 results are compared with experimental data and a good agreement is obtained keywords smoothed particle hydrodynamics sediment transport granular rheology viscoplastic materials 1 introduction the physics of granular material is a major concern for many physical and industrial purposes because of the wide range of problems it is involved into in the field of soil mechanics the study of large deformations and post failure behaviour of soils are active research topics in this kind of problem the soil is assimilated to a continuum and theories of elasticity plasticity and viscosity are used in the field of hydraulics attention is focused on soil water interactions in order to deal with sediment transport usually the bed evolution is obtained from exner equation combined to transport formulae involving the empirical shields erosion criterion therefore the soil is not explicitly modelled and the evolution of the mesh geometry is used to take the bed evolution into account although this approach relies on a simple mass balance equation it has proven its efficiency in modelling bed load transport for large scale problems however this approach suffers from lack of physical modelling of the soil behaviour as a consequence it is not suitable for problems involving highly dynamic behaviour such flows involves several phases and exhibit highly non linear deformations they are common in applied hydrodynamics problems and raise many scientific and technical issues in particular the modelling of local scour flow induced erosion or landslide induced water waves are particularly complex since they require both an accurate treatment of mechanic behaviour of the soil and of soil water interactions modelling granular soils is particularly difficult because they behave with some respect to both liquids and solids thus as a first approximation they can suitably be assimilated to viscoplastic materials gdr midi 2004 morichon et al 2013 ulrich et al 2013 below a critical shear stress the soil behaves like a solid when the critical shear stress is exceeded the soil starts to flow exhibiting a shear thinning behaviour campbell 1990 jop et al 2006 gdr midi 2004 numerically the solid state is usually approached by a highly viscous state this kind of regularized viscoplastic model has been applied in the framework of finite volumes morichon et al 2013 however with such a multi phase mesh based method the presence of a free surface requires to solve the air flow and to reconstruct interfaces between air water and sediment moreover the highly non linear deformations and the interface fragmentation make these problems difficult to treat with traditional mesh based eulerian methods on the contrary lagrangian approaches are particularly adapted for modelling such phenomena regularized viscoplastic models have been successfully applied with smoothed particle hydrodynamics method sph to test cases such as saturation driven embankment failure ulrich 2013 submarine landslide capone et al 2010 xenakis et al 2015 scouring and sediment flushing problems fourtakas and rogers 2016 manenti et al 2011 recently nabian and farhadi 2016 used a similar approach in the framework of moving particle semi implicit method mps nevertheless regularized viscoplastic models exhibit severe drawbacks regarding lowly deformed regions where the soil is supposed to behave like a solid according to beverly and tanner 1992 misleading velocity fields can result from these models when stresses are everywhere very low compared to the yield stress because they can only mimics the rigid body behaviour in low stressed regions this is particularly important regarding erosion and scour development for which an accurate treatment of motionless regions is essential to correctly estimate the bed evolution therefore in this work the sediment is treated as a continuum whose behaviour law takes account for its granular nature ulrich s 2013 elastic viscoplastic model was thus implemented in an in house gpu code based on the cuda language 1 1 the code is based on a simplified version of the open source gpusph solver gpusph official website and improved on physical and numerical aspects in this model the sediment behaviour depends on a yield stress determined according to drucker prager s criterion in unyielded regions the shear stresses are calculated in line with the linear elastic theory in yielded regions a shear thinning rheological law is used and the transitions between solid and liquid states are ensured by a blending function driven by the strain rate magnitude and sediment granular properties three main improvements of ulrich s model ulrich 2013 were presented namely a simple and reliable method to compute the effective pressure within the material which is essential to correctly capture the failure process and the regime transitions an improvement of solid forces calculation using a sph second order derivative operator espanol and revenga 2003 and a physical threshold for the liquid solid transition therefore contrary to ulrich s 2013 original model the mechanical behaviour of the soil does not depend on any numerical parameter in the present model the granular and water phases are treated in the frame of hu and adams s 2006 sph multi phase formulation the multi phase model was adapted to semi analytical wall boundary conditions ferrand et al 2013 in order to model multi phase flows that both require an accurate pressure and shear stress treatment at the wall and present complex boundary geometries first the sph multi phase model is presented and validated a description of the soil constitutive equations as well as their sph discrete form are then provided numerical results are finally compared with experimental data for two 2d cases we assume that the reader is familiar with sph violeau and rogers 2016 throughout this document the sign convention of mechanics is used 2 weakly compressible multi phase sph model 2 1 governing equations in this work the sediment is treated as a continuum whose behaviour law takes account for its granular nature thus sediment transport is modelled adopting a multi phase approach water and soil deviatoric stresses are calculated with different behaviour laws otherwise the same set of equations is used for the two phases for weakly compressible flows the lagrangian form of continuity equation reads 1 d ρ d t ρ div u with ρ the density of the material t the time and u the velocity then momentum equation reads 2 d u d t 1 ρ grad p 1 ρ div τ g with p the pressure g the gravity and τ the shear stress tensor in the weakly compressible materials pressure is related to the density through the following state equation 3 p ρ 0 c 0 2 ξ ρ ρ 0 ξ 1 p b g with ρ 0 the reference density of the material c 0 the numerical speed of sound ξ the isentropic coefficient and p b g the dimensionless background pressure it should be highlighted that the weakly compressible model is less physical than numerical the main idea is to allow the density to vary because of the particle lagrangian motion while maintaining the compressibility as weak as possible thanks to a large enough speed of sound given that it has no physical meaning the same equation of state can be used for both phases i e water and soil with suitable values of ρ 0 and c 0 and ξ 7 2 2 sph multi phase formulation 2 2 1 hu and adams multi phase formulation the main difficulty in simulating multi phase flows remains in the treatment of discontinuities across phase interfaces with sph the density discontinuity raises particular issues indeed the classical sph differential operators highly depend on the density of neighbouring particles consequently numerical instabilities can occur near the interface for quite large density ratios note that the density ratio usually involved in sediment transport problems do not strictly require a multi phase formulation of sph operators as an example manenti et al 2011 and ulrich 2013 successfully applied one phase sph models to such problems however colagrossi and landrini 2003 showed that the sph gradient of pressure used in manenti et al s 2011 and ulrich s 2013 formulations implicitly involves a gradient of density then at the interface of two phases this formula computes the derivative of a discontinuous field even if it does not always lead to numerical instability this formulation is formally not adapted to multi phase problem on the other hand fourtakas and rogers 2016 used colagrossi and landrini s 2003 multi phase formulation although this model is suitable for multi phase problems the density field is obtained through an explicit integration of the continuity equation this leads to the accumulation of systematic integration errors which can make the density and velocity fields become inconsistent ferrand et al 2010 2013 vila 1999 thus hu and adams s 2006 multi phase formulation will be used in this work in standard one phase sph formulations the density ρ of a particle a is usually computed as the interpolation of the density of neighbouring particles b 4 ρ a b f v b ρ b w a b with v the particle volume w a b w r a b where w is the sph kernel in all this paper we use wendland s 5th order kernel wendland 1995 r a b r a r b and r the particle position vector f denotes the set of free particles one clearly sees that using eq 4 in the vicinity of the interface between two phases of different densities leads to a numerical smoothing of the interface this loss of information is a substantial drawback but it can be avoided since it is purely numerical to circumvent this issue hu and adams 2006 proposed a formulation based on the interpolation of the inverse volume instead of density 5 1 v a b f w a b then the definition of density becomes 6 ρ a m a 1 v a m a b f w a b therefore the mass ma of a particle being constant in wcsph weakly compressible sph the variation of density is only due to the evolution of the spatial organisation of neighbouring particles thus the interface smoothing is avoided in order to simplify notation we will refer to the particle volume as va defined as 7 v a 1 v a 1 hu and adams 2006 then proposed a pressure gradient that can be derived from 6 and the lagrangian variational principle of virtual work grenier et al 2009 8 g a p b 1 v a b f p a v a 2 p b v b 2 w a b grad p a where uline uline wab is the kernel gradient at the location of particle a note that the pressure gradient does not depend on density any more and is consequently stable near the interface in addition hu and adams 2006 also proposed a modified viscous term so as to deal with multiple viscosities ensuring the continuity of velocity and shear stress across the interface 9 l a η b u b n a b f 2 η a η b η a η b v a 2 v b 2 u a b r a b 2 r a b w a b div η grad u a where η is the dynamic viscosity u a b u a u b with u the velocity of a particle 2 2 2 adaptation to usaw boundary conditions hu and adams formulation is a straightforward robust and variationally consistent multi phase model however a rigorous treatment of boundary conditions is necessary to make it capable of simulating flows presenting complex boundary geometries to do so the model is adapted to unified semi analytical wall usaw boundary conditions usaw boundary conditions framework is based on a mesh used to discretized boundaries of the domain ferrand et al 2013 the mesh is composed of boundary elements s being segments in two dimensions and triangles in three dimensions see fig 1 a free particles are placed at the vertices of the mesh they move at wall velocity and are referred to as vertex particles v contrary to boundary elements they carry a mass m and should be taken into account in the continuity equation their volume v depends on the local geometry of the boundary and is calculated as a fraction θ of a reference volume v v θ v see fig 1b in two dimensions θ is defined as the angle between two connected segments divided by 2π thus for vertex particles we have θb 0 1 in order to have a general formulation we also define θ a 1 for free particles of matter f and θ s 1 2 for boundary elements in three dimensions θ is calculated in a similar way using solid angles for boundary elements and vertex particles the reference volume v is obtained from a shepard interpolation of the inverse volume for more details see ferrand et al 2013 10 a v s v a b f w a b b f v b w a b 1 for free particles the volume is equal to the reference volume θ 1 and is obtained adapting 5 and 7 to this framework 11 a f v a 1 γ a b f v θ b w a b 1 where γ is a renormalization factor used to correct the interpolation error due to the lack of particles beyond the boundary 12 γ a ω ω a w r r a d r thus from 10 and 11 we see that the reference volume is not constant and only depends on the geometrical configuration of neighbouring particles around the point of interest for free particles density is obtained adapting vila s form of the continuity equation vila 1999 13 a f d γ a ρ a d t d d t m a b f v θ b w a b then adapting the variationally consistent pressure gradient to usaw boundary conditions we get an approximation of the pressure gradient 14 g a p b 1 γ a v a b f v θ b p a v a 2 p b v b 2 w a b 1 γ a v a s s 1 v s p a v a 2 p s v s 2 γ a s where p is the pressure and γas is the contribution of segment s to the gradient of γa for a 1 d segment s delimited by two vertex particles v 1 v 2 γas is defined by 15 γ a s v 1 v 2 w r d l n s where n s is the inward normal of the segment s note that the discrete sph differential operator 14 contains a volumic term related to free and vertex particles and a boundary term related to boundary elements in the absence of boundaries 14 gives back hu and adams original formula 8 similarly we define the consistent divergence operator for a vector field a 16 d a a b v a γ a b f v θ b a a b w a b v a γ a s s 1 v s a a s γ a s div a a where a ab denotes a a a b now we proceed the same way for the viscous term paying particular attention to the viscosity of segments and vertex particles since we do not want to assign a phase to boundaries we take η b η a when b v s first we adapt hu and adams viscous term 9 to usaw boundary conditions 17 l a h η b u b 1 γ a v a b f v 2 η a η b η a η b θ b v a 2 v b 2 u a b r a b 2 r a b w a b 1 γ a v a s s η a v s v a 2 v s 2 u a s r a s 2 r a s γ a s as of now we will refer to it as hu and adams viscous term then we write the classical usaw laplacian resulting from the model of morris et al 1997 in the multi phase framework 18 l a m η b u b 1 γ a b f v θ b v b 4 η a η b η a η b u a b r a b 2 r a b w a b 1 γ a s s 2 η a u a s r a s 2 r a s γ a s from now on we will refer to it as morris et al s 1997 viscous term note that this viscous term also ensures continuity of velocity and shear stress across the interface the two latter formula are approximations of the laplacian operators 19 l a h m η b u b div η grad u a a more general discrete second order operator can also be defined it will be referred to as espanol and revenga s operator and will be denoted l e in the frame of the multi phase formulation with usaw boundary conditions it is defined for any vector and scalar fields a and b by 20 l a e b b a b 1 γ a b f v θ b v b 2 b a b b b a b b d 2 a a b e a

indeed violeau 2009 showed 21 l a e b b a b div b grad a grad a t a 2 2 3 rhie and chow correction far from the boundaries and considering the time as a continuous variable vila 1999 showed that that the discrete equation of continuity 13 can be related to some kind of implicit time integration of the continuity equation 22 d ρ a d t ρ a d a u b an implicit scheme being used for integrating 22 and neglecting the viscous term in integrating the momentum eq 2 using the sph gradient operator 14 we can write 23 ρ a n 1 ρ a n δ t ρ a n d a u b n 1 ρ a n d a u b n δ t ρ b n g b p c n δ t g ρ a n d a u b n δ t d a g b p c n δ t d a g b g r b n where δt is the time step the latter equation shows that the approximate laplacian of pressure d a g b p c n is implicitly contained into the time discretized equation of continuity acting like a diffusion term fatehi and manzari 2011 and more recently hashemi et al 2016 stated that substituting this discrete form of the laplacian by an sph laplacian operator l to be defined can significantly reduce the numerical pressure oscillations this technique was first introduced for finite volumes by rhie and chow 1983 it consists in adding to 13 the difference between d a g b p c n and l a p b n this will result in a smoothing term that will tend to zero as the particle spacing δr decreases several combinations of discrete laplacian operators have been tested and we finally chose the following smoothing term 24 δ n ρ a n δ t l a m 1 ρ b n p b n d a g b p c n ρ b n with lm the morris operator 18 g the symmetric sph gradient defined by 25 g a a b v a γ a b f θ b a a a b w a b and d the anti symmetric divergence defined by 26 d a a b 1 γ a v a b f θ b a a v a 2 a b v b 2 w a b the last two sph operators have inverse symmetry properties with respect to the original ones used above this particular combination was not chosen on a theoretical basis but after numerical tests moreover these operators are built on the basis of the multi phase operators 14 and 16 so the rhie and chow s 1983 correction terms are computed from all neighbouring particles irrespective of the phase they belong to on the other hand this correction only occurs between free particles so the discrete operators in 24 26 do not have boundary terms and do not include the vertex particles the continuity eq 13 is corrected as follows 27 ρ a n 1 1 γ n 1 γ n ρ a n m a b f v θ b w a b n 1 w a b n λ δ n where λ is a weighting coefficient from numerical experiments λ 1 gives satisfactory results note that no particle shifting algorithm is used in this work 2 2 4 time integration scheme time integration is done with a fully explicit symplectic method ferrand et al 2013 that leads to the following scheme 28 u a n 1 u a n δ t ρ a n g a p b n δ t ρ a n l a η

integration scheme the first one relies the classical courant friedrichs levy cfl number the cfl number compares the time step to the time for the information to travel the characteristic distance of the simulation i e the discretization scale h at the characteristic velocity of the problem in wcsph the cfl number is defined as 29 c cfl c 0 δ t h for the viscous forces an additional condition must be enforce through the following dimensionless number 30 c visc η δ t ρ h 2 this number expresses the fact that the higher the viscosity the faster the information propagate along the successive layers of the fluid more details about the numerical stability of wcsph can be found in violeau and leroy 2014 and hashemi et al 2016 the latter includes the effect of density smoothing 2 2 5 validation the present formulation is validated on a two fluid laminar plane poiseuille flow in a closed channel involving two fluids of different kinematic viscosities ν 1 ν 2 and densities ρ 1 ρ 2 the 2d flow is driven by a gravity force ρ g oriented in the direction of the flow e x e x e y being the base vectors periodic open boundaries are used and the height of the channel is l 1 m the interface between the two fluids is in y 0 the top wall in y l 2 and the bottom wall in y l 2 where e y denotes the transverse direction in the present work the subscript 1 refers to the fluid in the bottom part y 0 in all simulations the ratio between δr and the smoothing length h is δ r h 2 note that in this case the rhie and chow s 1983 correction presented in section 2 2 3 was not used instead the brezzi and pitkäranta s 1984 correction presented in ghaitanellis et al 2015 was used in order to compare their results to the present results results are compared with the analytical solution that depends on the ratio between densities and viscosities respectively denoted λ and ω 31 λ ρ 1 ρ 2 ω ν 1 ν 2 we also define u 1 a characteristic velocity of the flow and re 1 the corresponding reynolds number 32 u 1 g l 2 2 ν 1 r e 1 u 1 l ν 1 g l 3 2 ν 1 2 finally we define the following dimensionless quantities 33 y y l u u x u 1 where u x u e x with u the velocity of the fluid with these notations the analytical solution u th reads 34 u th y 1 y 2 1 ω 1 λ ω y 1 if y 0 1 ω 1 y 2 λ ω 1 ω 1 λ ω y 1 if y 1 0 comparison of viscous terms r e 1 1 25 fig 2 shows the longitudinal velocity profile obtained using morris et al s 1997 viscous term 18 with l δ r 385 sph particles on the channel width numerical results are in excellent agreement with the analytical solution 34 represented by the solid line results obtained with hu and adams s 2006 viscous term 17 and espanol and revenga s 2003 one 20 also give such good qualitative results thus demonstrating that the shear stresses at the wall and at the interface are correctly calculated by the present multi phase model in order to validate further the multi phase model and to quantitatively compare the three viscous terms 18 17 and 20 we performed a convergence study with the parameters summarized in table 1 for each simulation velocity field is initialized to zero the numerical solution converges to a steady state see fig 3 a that is compared to the analytical solution 34 through the velocity instantaneous l 2 relative error e defined as follows 35 e t b f u b t u th y b t 2 b f u th y b t 2 where u b is the particle velocity u th yb the theoretical velocity at the position of particle b the steady state is assumed to be achieved when the profile is fully developed the characteristic time of the viscous effects propagation through the channel width l can be evaluated as t 1 l 2 ρ 1 η 1 from which we defined the dimensionless time t t t 1 fig 3a shows the instantaneous error with respect to the dimensionless time we can see that the steady state is achieved at t 1 and that the solution remains stable afterwards in order to have an objective measure of the error independent from the small oscillations of the instantaneous error we define the time averaged error e computed from 35 as 36 e 1 n t i 1 n t e t i where t i i 1 n t corresponds to the nt iterations in the time interval t 1 5 3 5 grey region in fig 3a fig 3b shows the time average error e with respect to the dimensionless particle size δr l i e the inverse of the number of particles along the channel height we see that the convergence slope of the present method using the three viscous terms is approximately of order 2 as long as δ r l 5 10 2 afterwards the convergence slope decreases for morris et al s 1997 and hu and adams operators while the error stabilized for espanol and revenga s 2003 viscous term these results are consistent with those obtained by ferrand et al 2013 for one fluid sph formulation with usaw boundary conditions thus validating the present multi phase model note that contrary to the results obtained by ghaitanellis et al 2015 hu and adams operators is not less accurate than morris s one this is because there was an implementation error in ghaitanellis et al s 2015 code 3 sediment constitutive model 3 1 context the main difficulty in modelling granular materials is that they cannot be classified as solids or liquids indeed they can behave like both of them under slightly different conditions that is the reason why rheological approach is often adopted to model granular flows in particular soil is usually treated as a viscoplastic material thus it has a yield stress τ y under which no deformation occurs when the yield stress is exceeded the material starts to flow in such a model the yield stress has to be compared to an invariant measure of the deviatoric stress tensor τ in this work the tensor second invariant is used according to drucker prager yield criterion drucker and prager 1952 37 τ 1 2 i j τ i j τ i j viscoplastic models include herschel bulkley s and casson s ones but the most common and best known model was proposed by bingham 1917 and reads 38 γ 0 if τ τ y τ 2 η τ y γ γ if τ τ y where η is the plastic viscosity γ the strain rate tensor and γ its second invariant defined as 39 γ 2 i j γ i j γ i j with γ i j the components of the strain rate tensor defined as 40 γ 1 2 grad u grad u t the ideal bingham model 38 describes a material that behaves as a rigid body at low stresses and flows as a fluid when the yield stress is exceeded unfortunately ideal bingham s model as well as herschel bulkley s and casson s ones all involve discontinuous behaviour law that corresponds to the liquid solid phase change they are thus poorly adapted to numerical simulation because they require additional numerical procedures to track down yielded unyielded regions indeed it can be easily verified that the transitions between liquid and solid states are not included in the model to do so let us calculate τ applying 37 to the second equation in 38 which corresponds to the liquid state 41 τ η γ τ y one can see that when the strain rate vanishes the deviatoric stress decreases and tends to τ y but never goes below to circumvent this issue these models can be approximated assuming that the viscoplastic material is a liquid that exhibits infinitely high viscosity when the strain rate vanishes beverly and tanner s 1992 bi viscosity model and papanastasiou s 1987 formula are two widely used examples of such regularized viscoplastic models thus the material is always liquid but mimics the ideal models behaviour for all rates of deformation numerically this is achieved using shear thinning rheological law and limiting the viscosity to a huge but finite maximum value this method is straightforward and has been widely applied to the simulation of sediment transport with finite volumes morichon et al 2013 moving particle semi implicit method nabian and farhadi 2016 and smoothed particle hydrodynamics method capone et al 2010 regarding sediment transport modelling this approach is well adapted for highly dynamic scenarios but exhibits severe drawbacks regarding small strain rates and deformations indeed the maximum viscosity has to be large enough to guarantee that no significant motion occurs in unyielded regions this is particularly important regarding erosion and scour development for which an accurate treatment of motionless regions is essential to correctly estimate the bed evolution thus it is necessary to ensure that results do not depend on the chosen maximum viscosity but in practice the maximum value of viscosity is actually limited for explicit time integration schemes because of computational cost as a consequence in the present paper a different approach is tested the model of ulrich 2013 is implemented in the framework of multi phase formulation and adapted to usaw boundary conditions the soil is treated as a linear elastic solid in unyielded regions and as a shear thinning liquid in yielded regions a continuous transition between the two states is ensured by a blending function driven by the strain rate magnitude besides improvements of the yield stress and solid forces computation are proposed as well as phase transition threshold based on the physical properties of the granular material 3 2 modelling assumptions in this work the granular material being dry or saturated is treated as a continuum under this assumption the continuous medium represents a mixture of grains and air or grains and water therefore we need to define equivalent properties of the continuous material from the physical properties of the granular material components the continuum properties should also depend on the grain concentration however the continuum hypothesis presents a major difficulty within the framework of the sph formulations presented in section 2 2 physically the evolution of grain concentration results from differences of velocity between the solid phase and the liquid phase when the mixture is assumed to be continuous the concentration evolution must be taken into account through the transport of a concentration field however this is not straightforward in the framework of the present sph model because this implies mass transfers between sph particles the particle masses being no longer constant the sph formulation presented in section 2 2 is not valid anymore and a whole new sph formulation would be necessary such a model is beyond the scope of this paper thus although it has be shown that the grain concentration is an important parameter for the description of dense granular flows armanini et al 2005 gdr midi 2004 the grain concentration will be assumed to be constant and homogeneous within the mixture domain therefore in practise ϕ is simply the porosity of the granular material at initial time in addition the fluid surrounding the grains will be assumed to be at rest with respect to the granular material skeleton indeed solving the fluid flow through the porous medium raises many practical issues in particular at water mixture interfaces for example let us consider an outgoing water flow from the mixture phase to the water phase then the mixture sph particles should give some water mass up to the water sph particles in order to ensure the mass conservation again this would require variable sph particle masses ulrich 2013 proposed a simplified model of partly saturated soil solving the flow in the porous material and transporting a concentration field however with this model the mass of water is not conserved consequently in his work the water flow through the porous medium is also neglected and the interstitial water is assumed to move at the mixture velocity this simplification implies several disadvantages first the seepage cannot be taken into account while it can have a significant effect when a stable structure of dry granular material becomes partially saturated liu and li 2015 thus in the present work we will only consider cases in which the material is initially totally dry denoted by dry or fully saturated denoted by sat and remains that way for ever for the dry case the mass of air in the pore is neglected while for the saturated case the equivalent density also depends on water density ρ w 42 ρ eq dry 1 ϕ ρ g ρ eq sat 1 ϕ ρ g ϕ ρ w although a weakly compressible formulation is used in this work we aim at modelling incompressible materials the equation of state 3 is a numerical way of closing the equations of motion system but the compressible effects are not supposed to play any role in the behaviour of the granular material thus we assume here that ρ w and ρ eq sat are constant secondly neglecting the flow through the porous material also implies that the pore water pressure field is unknown therefore another approximation is necessary and the pore water pressure will be assumed to be hydrostatic finally the granular medium will be considered incompressible in soil mechanics this hypothesis is only valid for fully saturated soils under fast loading un drained condition craig 1983 davis and selvadurai 2005 thus as regards bed load transport and scouring resulting from violent flows this assumption is suitable although this hypothesis is not valid for problems involving dry granular media we will see that the model is able to give satisfactory results in that case too 3 3 yield stress there are many yield criteria that are adapted to the different kinds of viscoplastic materials although the mohr coulomb criterion is widely used in geotechnical engineering its implementation raises numerical issues because the corresponding yield surface is an irregular hexagonal pyramid jiang and xie 2011 thus the drucker prager yield criterion is usually used as a smooth alternative it is a pressure dependent model that can be expressed in terms of internal friction angle ψ for non cohesive soils as 43 τ y 2 3 sin ψ 3 sin ψ p eff where p eff is the effective pressure that is to say the normal stress that the grains actually exert on each other considering a situation where the stress configuration is close to the failure almost no motion occurs within the material therefore the isotropic stress i e the total pressure p tot is solely due to pressure derived from the weight of the column of material and interstitial fluid above a specified level consequently denoting z i the soil water interface vertical position z fs the free surface vertical position and z the vertical position of the point of interest see fig 4 the total pressure reads 44 p tot ρ w g z fs z i ρ eq sat g z i z moreover terzaghi s principle terzaghi 1936 states that the effective pressure depends on the total pressure p tot and the pore water pressure p pw according to the following relation 45 p eff p tot p pw assuming no porous flow inside the soil the pore water pressure reads 46 p pw ρ w g z fs z finally effective pressure can be obtained using 45 47 p eff g z i z ρ eq sat ρ w nevertheless getting p eff from 47 requires to detect soil water interface beforehand such a detection has been tested by manenti et al 2011 but it seems to us that it can lead to inaccurate result when the interface is highly deformed in order to get effective pressure without interface tracking fourtakas and rogers 2016 proposed to use a modified state equation however we found that this method leads to a large overestimation of p eff when the soil is submerged furthermore with such an approach the well known wcsph pressure oscillations fatehi and manzari 2011 also impact the yield stress therefore we propose here another simple and reliable solution recall that ρ w and ρ eq sat are constant in addition z i is the function that gives the mixture water interface above the point of interest so it does not depend on the vertical coordinate as long as the water mixture interface is not too much deformed we can besides assume that the interface varies linearly in the horizontal directions in the vicinity of the point of interest this is the strongest assumption done in this reasoning thus taking the laplacian of 47 yields 48 δ p eff 0 taking the laplacian of 47 with suitable boundary conditions we get the following system 49 δ p eff r 0 for r ω p eff r 0 for r i p eff n r g n for r s with ω the simulation domain s the solid boundaries n the inward boundary normal and i the boundary corresponding to soil free surface and soil water interface see fig 4 in the present model p eff is only used to compute the yield stress it cannot be used in the momentum conservation equation because 49 is valid when the total pressure is approximately lithostatic which is not true in yielded regions thus the total pressure calculated with the state eq 3 is used to compute the pressure gradient in the momentum conservation equation this amounts to assume that the pore water pressure gradient can be neglected compared to the effective pressure gradient 50 p eff p tot p pw p tot note that it would be possible to eliminate this approximation observing that 49 can easily be adapted to compute the hydrostatic pore water pressure the pressure gradient in the momentum conservation equation could thus be computed from p tot p pw this was not tested in this work 3 4 shear stresses 3 4 1 elastic solid state in the present model the solid state of the granular material is evaluated in line with linear elastic theory the shear stress tensor in the solid regions reads 51 τ g s 2 g γ can be obtained from the following rate of stress equation 52 τ g s 2 g γ where the dot denotes the time derivative the subscript g refers to the granular material and the superscripts s refers to the elastic solid model i e the solid state and g is the shear modulus defined by 53 g e 2 1 ν with e the young s modulus and ν the poisson s coefficient note that similarly to many authors in sph literature gray et al 2001 randles and libersky 1996 ulrich 2013 hooke s law will be used to model the deviatoric part of the stress tensor while an equation of state will be used to compute the pressure according to the weakly compressible approach see section 2 as mentioned in section 2 1 here the compressibility is only a numerical trick to mimic the incompressible behaviour this is consistent with the assumption of an incompressible linear elastic material see section 3 2 note that such a state equation has already been successfully used to compute the pressure in a linear elastic material in the sph literature e g in gray et al 2001 and ulrich 2013 in 52 we differentiated the solid state behaviour law 51 for the following reason it can be shown that the rate of stress 52 is not objective i e it is not independent on the frame of reference in particular it is not invariant with respect to rigid body rotation though the material constitutive equations should be frame indifferent since the mechanical response of a material must not depend on the observer thus the dynamic quantities such as the cauchy stress tensor are frame invariant dienes 1979 gurtin 1981 to circumvent this issue objective material time derivatives must be used the most commonly used in computational mechanics is the jaumann time derivative denoted with a triangle δ and defined by 54 σ δ σ σ ω ω σ where ω is the rotation rate tensor that is directly related to the rate of rigid body rotation within a material 55 ω 1 2 grad u grad u t note that when no rigid body rotation occurs within the material the jaumann material derivative 54 is tantamount to the standard material time derivative applying 54 to the deviatoric stress tensor τ yields 56 τ δ g s 2 g γ j denoting j the jaumann rate tensor defined by 57 j τ g s ω ω τ g s the shear stress tensor finally reads 58 τ g s 2 g γ j which is more relevant than the initial attempt 51 3 4 2 viscoplastic fluid state in yielded regions the material is modelled as a shear thinning liquid thus the viscous fluid behaviour law stokes 1851 is used to model the shear stress 59 τ g l 2 η eff γ where the superscript l refers to the viscoplastic model i e the liquid state in ulrich s 2013 original model the effective viscosity η eff was calculated according to a rheological law similar to the μ i rheology jop et al 2006 here we propose a different law in order to be consistent with the drucker prager yield criterion the effective viscosity is thus defined by 60 η eff τ y γ where τ y is the yield stress calculated according to 43 therefore similarly to the μ i rheology jop et al 2006 revil baudard and chauchat 2013 the effective viscosity is related to the friction within the granular material however here the friction coefficient is constant in time since the internal friction ψ is a constant parameter in our model it should be noted that 60 ensures the continuity of the shear stress magnitude in the liquid solid transition since we have 61 τ g l 1 2 τ g l τ g l η eff γ τ y 3 4 3 solid fluid transition similarly to the ideal viscoplastic models mitsoulis 2007 bingham herschel bulkley casson the elastic viscoplastic model ulrich 2013 involves a discontinuous behaviour law thus the liquid solid phase transition cannot solely be based on the yield stress consider the material is in the liquid state then the shear stress magnitude is always equal to τ y as shows in 61 thus the material cannot become solid as a consequence similarly to regularized viscoplastic models papanastasiou 1987 tanner and milthorpe 1983 the yield criterion is not based on a dynamic condition anymore τ τ y but on a kinematic condition γ γ y thus we need to build a new threshold expressed in terms of strain rate that still depends on the yield stress to do so we write 62 γ y τ y η y where η y is a dynamic viscosity referred to as yield viscosity thus 62 points out that the solid liquid transition now depends on an additional parameter η y moreover the yield viscosity not only determines the threshold strain rate but also the maximum possible viscosity for the material in liquid state in ulrich 2013 the value of η y is chosen in a trial and error approach increasing incrementally its value until obtaining satisfying result here we propose to find a value based on the physical properties of the material to do so we first consider the deborah number de which characterizes the fluidity of a material under the flow conditions of a specific experiment 63 d e t r t c where tc is the characteristic time scale of the experiment and tr the stress relaxation time for a granular material assuming spherical grains sun and wang 2013 proposed to use the characteristic time of rayleigh waves propagating along a grain surface 64 t r g π d g 0 162 ν 0 887 ρ g g with d g the grain diameter on the other hand during the transition the soil can be seen as a viscoelastic material in that case the deborah number is calculated with a relaxation time defined as 65 t r v e η y g for a given material the two relaxation time definitions should match therefore combining 64 and 65 gives a definition of the yield viscosity 66 η y π d g g ρ g 0 163 ν 0 877 we can now use the blending function proposed by ulrich 2013 67 ζ γ q 1 γ γ y q q γ γ y q 1 if γ γ y 1 if γ γ y with q a positive integer the solid liquid transition sharpness can be adjusted varying q similarly to ulrich 2013 we use q 2 note that the blending function has the same role as papanastasiou s 1987 regularization it smooths the phase transition which is more appropriate than a sharp interface for numerical modelling the liquid solid deviatoric stress tensor is thus given by 68 τ ζ τ g l 1 ζ τ g s it is important to note that the solid stresses in the soil should vanish when the liquid state is reached after flowing the grains have no memory of their initial position thus the strain tensor must be reinitialized when ζ 1 furthermore the phase transition is based on a condition on the strain rate magnitude γ while the elastic solid stresses do not depend on the strain rate thus there can be situations where the liquid state is not fully reached γ γ y but where the solid stress magnitude exceeds the yield stress τ τ y this happens when the failure is followed by very slow deformations thus the strain rate γ remains smaller than γ y but the strain keeps increasing consequently the solid stress magnitude also keeps increasing and ends up exceeding the yield stress however the material is supposed to yield when the stress magnitude reaches the yield stress so this never happens physically to avoid unphysical overestimation of the solid stresses we need to rescale the solid stress tensor so that the solid stress magnitude never exceeds the yield stress 69 τ g ss τ g s if τ g s τ y τ g ss τ y τ τ g s if τ g s τ y where τ g ss denotes the rescaled deviatoric stress tensor the final form of the liquid solid deviatoric stress tensor is thus 70 τ ζ τ g l 1 ζ τ g ss finally in this model the mechanical behaviour of the soil only depends on elastic e ν and granular d g ρ g ϕ ψ properties of the material especially through 43 and 66 that drive the liquid solid transition 4 sph implementation in sph the continuum is sampled in a set of interpolation points f having a constant mass ma and referred to as particles an sph particle used to discretize a granular material continuum represents a small volume that contains a mixture of solid grains and surrounding fluid the equivalent density of the continuum is calculated from 42 the present granular material model is implemented within the scope of the multi phase sph formulation presented in section 2 2 first let us define or recall the following sets of sph particles v is the set of vertex particles see usaw framework in section 2 2 2 s is the set of boundary elements see usaw framework in section 2 2 2 m is the set of free particles of granular material mixture of grains and surrounding fluid w is the set of free particles of water f is the set of free particles of matter f m w i is the set of free particles of matter at the water mixture interface i f 4 1 effective pressure to compute the effective pressure p eff we need to solve the laplace eq 49 thus we use morris laplacian 18 to write the corresponding discrete equation 71 a m i l a u 1 p eff b 0 where m i refers to the set of sph particles of mixture that are not located at the interface at the wall the neumann boundary conditions 49 must be satisfied applying the technique used by ferrand et al 2013 to compute the dynamic pressure at the wall we use a shepard like interpolation of the effective pressure field 72 a v s p eff a 1 b f s v b w a b b f s v b p eff b δ ρ eq g r a r b w a b with v s the set of boundary elements and vertex particles besides a particular attention must be paid to the dirichlet condition imposed to soil particles located at the soil water interface second line of 49 indeed the pressure due to their own weight must be taken into account otherwise the yield stress 43 is always zero at interface particles 73 a m i p eff a g δ r δ ρ eq with m i the set of sph particles of mixture located at the interface and δr the initial particle spacing i e the particle size finally 71 is solved using a jacobi solver initialized with the previous time step solution thus ensuring low computational cost 4 2 shear forces 4 2 1 elastic solid force density to compute elastic forces we first need to compute the strain rate tensor γ and the rotation rate tensor ω 74 γ a 1 2 g a u b g a u b t 1 3 tr g a u b i 75 ω a 1 2 g a u b g a u b t where the multi phase anti symmetric gradient based on 16 is used here 76 g a u b v a γ a b f v θ b u a u b w a b v a γ a s s 1 v s u a u s γ a s with denoting the tensor product note that the anti symmetric gradient 76 is used instead of 14 for more accuracy it should also be reminded that the trace of the velocity gradient should be zero for an incompressible fluid but within the scope of wcsph we have to remove the trace from the strain rate tensor in 74 to ensure that the deviatoric stress tensor τ is really traceless the shear stress tensor then follows from an explicit time integration of the jaumann rate of shear stress 56 77 τ g s 2 g γ τ ω ω τ where the overbar indicates explicit time integration then the elastic solid force density could be simply computed from the divergence of the deviatoric stress tensor 78 div τ g s div 2 g γ div j numerically this implies two iterative use of first order sph derivative operators indeed 77 requires computing the strain rate tensor γ using the sph gradient of velocity then 78 requires to take the sph divergence of the shear stress tensor gray et al 2001 ulrich 2013 thus focusing on the first term in 78 yields 79 div 2 g γ a g d a g b u c g b u c t but due to the collocated nature of sph applying iteratively first order derivative operators to get higher order derivatives leads to significant inaccuracy see section 2 2 3 this can be avoided observing that the shear strain tensor γ can be calculated from the displacement x instead of the time integration of the strain rate tensor 80 γ 1 2 grad x grad x t this definition of shear strain tensor 80 is particularly adapted to sph whose lagrangian characteristic gives a direct access to particle displacement 81 x t r t r 0 with r the particle position and r 0 the initial particle position note that the initial particle position is reinitialised every time the material passes from liquid to solid state after flowing a grain has no memory of its initial position then the shear strain divergence can be obtained using espanol and revenga s 2003 second order derivative operator l e defined in 20 contrary to 9 and 18 espanol and revenga s 2003 formula 20 is not an approximation of the laplacian see 21 now applying 20 to shear modulus g and displacement x we get 82 div 2 g γ a g l a e 1 x b a similar treatment of the jaumann term does not seem to be possible so the shear force density f finally reads 83 f g s a g l a e 1 x b d a j b div τ g l a where the tensor j follows from an explicit time integration of the jaumann rate tensor 57 84 j n 1 j n δ t τ g s ω ω τ g s n the force density f g s is rescaled afterwards according to 69 here we omit the sph particle labels for the sake of clarity 85 f g ss f g s if τ g s τ y f g ss τ y τ g s f g s if τ g s τ y note that the latter rescaling is not tantamount to 69 indeed here we rescale forces instead of stresses which means that the following approximation is done 86 div τ y τ g s τ g s τ y τ g s div τ g s this is mandatory when using 82 instead of 79 because the stress tensor τ g s is not directly used to compute the forces although it will be seen that using 82 improves the computation of elastic forces see section 4 3 it would be necessary to evaluate the effect of the latter approximation on the model accuracy to ascertain whether 82 is globally better unfortunately such an investigation has not been carried out in the scope of this work 4 2 2 viscous force density when the material is in the viscoplastic liquid state the force density is given by 87 div τ g l a div 2 η eff γ a thus it is computed applying 20 to the effective viscosity η eff and the velocity u 88 f g l a l a e η eff b u b div 2 η eff γ a here again espanol and revenga s 2003 operator is used instead of morris viscous term this is due to the fact that the transposed velocity gradient in 40 cannot be neglected when modelling non newtonian fluids the effective viscosity is computed according to 60 that depends on the yield stress 43 and the mean scalar rate of strain γ 39 4 2 3 blending of shear forces the continuous transition between solid and liquid state is ensured by the blending function ζ 67 defined in section 3 4 3 here again we omit the sph particle labels 89 f g ζ f g l 1 ζ f g s where f g s and f g l are computed respectively through 83 and 87 note that here the blending applies to the forces instead of the stresses even though 89 is not tantamount to 67 since ζ in not constant in space however the blending being a numerical trick to ensure a continuous transition 89 can be used too a simple way of getting 67 back would be to use 90 f g a l a e ζ b η eff b u b g l a e 1 ζ b x b d a 1 ζ b j b however the differences between 89 and 90 were not investigated in this work 4 2 4 boundary conditions 4 2 4 1 conditions at water granular material interface in the frame of the multi phase formulation presented in section 2 2 the density and the pressure fields do not require any special treatment for the interaction of sph particles of water w and of granular material m the density is computed according to 13 from all the neighbouring particles irrespective of the phase w or m they belong to besides that both phases have a pressure field so the pressure gradient is simply computed with the multi phase gradient 14 in regard to the shear forces the two phases only interact though viscous effects for which espanol and revenga s 2003 viscous term 20 is used in the two phases in water the granular material neighbours are seen as liquid particles having a viscosity η eff thus the force density exerted by a particle b of granular material m on a particle a of water w reads 91 a w b m f w b a θ b v b η w a η eff b η w a η eff b d 2 u a u b e a b e a b u a u b w a b r a b r a b 2 where the subscript w refers to the water and d is the space dimension on the other hand the viscous force density exerted by the water particle on the granular material contribute to the viscoplastic term in 89 through 92 a m b w f g l a b ζ θ b v b η w a η eff b η w a η eff b d 2 u a u b e a b e a b u a u b w a b r a b r a b 2 it should be noted that since there is no contribution of the water neighbour the elastic solid term in 89 the action reaction principle is not respected when ζ 1 indeed from the two latter equations we can see that we only have 93 a m b w f w b a 1 ζ f g l a b nevertheless the strain rate of granular material particles close to the interface is usually high due to the water particles velocity that contribute 74 therefore for particles in m having neighbours in w we usually have ζ 1 so the action reaction principle is respected most of the time despite that 93 remains a weakness of the present model and further investigation should be carried out to improve this aspect as a consequence of 91 and 92 the suspended sediment and water only exert viscous forces on each other when the sediment resettles viscoplastic and elastic forces exert between sediment sph particles as regards erosion the water sediment interaction could be improved taking account for turbulence in the present model the shear stress at the water sediment interface depends on the shear rate the dynamic viscosity of water and the local viscoplastic viscosity of the sediment physically erosion results from the viscous and turbulent shear stresses exerted by water on the solid grains of sediment thus it may be possible to use and sph form of the standard k ϵ model in the water phase ferrand et al 2013 treating the water sediment interface as a solid wall the stress exerted on the sediment sph particles would then be deduced from the action reaction principle that way the bottom shear stress would not depend on the rheological law used within the granular material this approach has not been tested here conditions at wall granular material interface wall boundary conditions must enforced on both the viscoplastic term 88 and the elastic solid term 83 with regard to the former the method proposed by ferrand et al 2013 for the viscous wall condition is simply applied as regards the elastic solid term the displacement of vertex v and boundary elements s et imposed to zero we recall espanol and revenga s 2003 boundary term 94 l a e bound 1 x b 1 γ a s s x a x s γ a s using a taylor expansion we can write 95 x a e a s x a x s r a s x s e a s x a x s r a s thus imposing x s 0 espanol and revenga s 2003 boundary term 94 can be approximated as 96 l a e bound 1 x b 2 γ a s s x a r a s γ a s r a s 2 the latter approximation is not exact because γas is a vector oriented along the inward wall normal vector not along r as then we assume a locally uniform distribution of j at the walls recall j is the time anti derivative of the jaumann tensor as defined in section 3 4 1 the corresponding boundary term reads 97 d a bound j b v a γ a s s 1 v s j a j s γ a s the present assumption yields j s j a hence 98 d a bound j b 0 similarly we assume j b j a for vertex particles b v thus the contribution of vertex particles to the volumic term also vanishes the divergence of jaumann rate finally simplifies to 99 d a j b v a γ a b f θ b j a j b w a b where the boundary terms vanished and the sum now only extends to free particles f 4 3 validation of elastic forces computation this test case is a simple numerical experiment that aims at testing the improvement resulting from the computation of solid forces from the displacement field i e using 82 instead of 79 see section 4 2 1 for a detailed description of the method the quantity of interest is thus 100 f div grad x grad x t this is usually computed from the velocity field integrating the strain rate tensor γ and using 79 101 f a u d a 2 γ n δ t g b u c g b u c t n the proposed alternative consists in calculating f from the displacement field x using espanol and revenga s 2003 second order differential operator 20 102 f x a l a e 1 x b in order to compare the two approaches accuracy we consider the periodic case of 2d taylor green vortices for which the analytical velocity field is known 103 u x y t cos 2 π x l sin 2 π y l sin 2 π x l cos 2 π y l exp 2 η t ρ in order to quantify the error due to the sph operators only we consider a cartesian grid of fixed sph particles their velocity and corresponding theoretical displacement are imposed according to 103 the simulation is carried out for l 1 η ρ 0 1 m2 s 2 and l δ r 100 after 10 s of physical time expressions 101 and 102 are evaluated and compared to the exact value 100 obtained with mathematica wolfram research inc 2017 the comparison is performed calculating the error defined by 104 e a f a s p h f x a y a 2 1 n a f f x a y a 2 where f a s p h is the quantity f calculated at particle a with sph using either 101 or 102 f xa ya is the theoretical values calculated with mathematica at the particle a position xa ya and n is the total number of sph particles results are plotted in fig 5 that shows the error we got for both approaches we clearly see that the error is much larger using 79 with a maximum error twice the one obtained using 82 this demonstrates the accuracy gain due to the use of a second order operator instead of two iterative uses of a first order operator within the scope of collocated methods 5 simulation of 2d soil collapse to validate the present model a simulation of an experimental 2 d collapse of dry soil is first carried out the experiment was conducted by bui et al 2008 and the experimental set up is illustrated in fig 6 the material is composed of aluminium bars of diameter 1 mm and 1 5 mm length 50 mm and density 2650 kg m 3 the material porosity is not specified by the authors so we approximate it using the highest compact binary circle packing leading to ϕ 0 1 all other physical parameters were determined experimentally by bui et al 2008 and are summarized in table 2 the simulations were performed using approximately 20 000 particles of soil and 1400 vertex and boundary elements with an initial particle spacing of δ r 0 001 m in all simulations the ratio between δr and the smoothing length h is δ r h 2 the numerical speed of sound was set to 10 m s 1 fig 7 shows the simulation result at four physical times we see that 49 leads to an accurate calculation of the yield stress free of the typical sph numerical oscillations of pressure besides almost no deformation occurs between t 1 5 s and t 2 0 s thus demonstrating that the model is able to represent the solid state even after a large time compared to the characteristic time of the experiment h g 0 1 s in fig 8 the surface configuration at the end of the experiment as well as the failure line are compared with numerical results obtained at 1 5 s experimentally the failure line is defined as the line delimiting the non deformed region numerically we define the non deformed region as the area where the displacement magnitude is less than the grain size i e 1 5 mm both surface configuration and failure line are well predicted by the model although we assume that the granular medium is incompressible while it is not a valid hypothesis for dry soils thus compressible effects are probably negligible in that case note that we observed significant numerical noise when the solid state is reached when its velocity tends to zero the material should reach a steady motionless state and behave like a pure elastic solid in the present model we thus expect the shear forces to be solely calculated from the elastic solid model i e the blending function should be homogeneously equal to zero within the material however because of numerical noise some strain rate is artificially produced consequently the sediment is in an unstable equilibrium continuously oscillating between a solid state and a highly viscous liquid state this emphasizes the fact that the blending approach 70 has a stabilization effect contrary to bui et al 2008 the tensile instability is not directly observed however it still leads to numerical noise when the material is in the solid state to circumvent this issue the artificial stress method gray et al 2001 could be tested in a future work this technique was developed to remove the tensile instability that may be partly responsible for the above mentioned numerical noise 6 simulation of 2d dam break wave on movable beds the present model was also assessed to a case of dam break wave propagating over a saturated granular bed this study is based on the small scale experiments carried out by spinewine and zech 2007 the experiments were performed in a flume being 25 cm wide and 6 m long the initial configuration of the experiment is illustrated in fig 9 the dam break is initiated by the sudden lowering of a gate that is not taken into account in the simulation two materials sand and pvc are tested to investigate the capability of the model to exhibit different behaviours with respect to different materials the physical parameters of the materials are summarized in table 3 note that experimental young s modulus and poisson s coefficient were available for these materials consequently we used generic values from ulrich 2013 for similar cases the first simulations were carried out setting a particle spacing of δ r 0 002 m resulting in 525 000 particles of water 150 000 particles of saturated soil and 13 000 particles vertex and boundary particles the numerical speed of sound and isentropic coefficient are set identically for the saturated granular material and the water that is c 0 37 m s 1 and ξ 7 rhie and chow s 1983 chequerboard correction 27 was applied with a coefficient of λ rc 1 0 and no background pressure was used fig 10 shows a comparison of the experiment and the sph simulation carried out for the sand for δ r 2 d g we can see that the dynamics of the flow is qualitatively well reproduced by the model total eroded mass of soil first let us focus on the total mass of sediments that reaches the downstream flume outlet to do so we define the relative error on the total eroded mass with respect to the experimental value 105 e r m sph m exp m exp fig 11 shows the error er as a function of the ratio δr d g particle size grain diameter we can see that sand and pvc simulations exhibit similar behaviours although they have different grain sizes 106 d g pvc 2 d g sand for the two materials decreasing the sph particle size improves the result until the critical value δ r d g below this threshold the soil model is no more valid and erosion is dramatically overestimated this discretization limitation may be due to the fact that sph particles are supposed to represent a macroscopic volume of the saturated soil the continuum hypothesis amounts to assume that the physical state of a heterogeneous system e g a multi phase system involving fluid and solid discrete particles can be described by continuous field variables whose space and time dependence is represented by differential equations for mass momentum and energy balances baveye and sposito 1984 such a description is based on the concept of representative elementary volume over which a local volume average allows a transition from microscopic physical properties to macroscopic field variables as well as from microscopic differential balance laws to macroscopic differential balance laws baveye and sposito 1984 the continuous fields result from the microscopic properties of the system but they are macroscopic quantities that do not have any physical sense at the microscopic scale thus the representative elementary volume should be small enough with regards to the problem dimensions to be an approximation of a mathematical neighbourhood of its centre but large enough to enclose many spatial heterogeneity baveye and sposito 1984 as an example the derivation of darcy s equations that describes flows in porous media requires that the characteristic length of the pores is smaller than the characteristic length of the averaging volume whitaker 1986 using sph particles or mesh cells smaller than the pores or the grains in our case amounts to using averaging volumes that do not satisfy this constraint thus the numerical solution approaches a theoretical solution that is not a correct description of the physical problem issues related to the length scales constraints and the continuum hypothesis have been addressed in the frame of porous media flows baveye and sposito 1984 whitaker 1986 in the scope of multi phase flows gómez and milioli 2005 claim that a minimum limit should be enforced on numerical spatial mesh sizes having in view the validity of the average eulerian continuum equations for the solid phase according to clemiņš 1988 using mesh cells whose size does not satisfy the minimum size condition may lead to non physical fluctuations of the resolved fields in that case it is necessary to average the result on a larger volume to get relevant physical quantities extending this conclusion to lagrangian methods seems to raise additional issues indeed if a non physical fluctuation of the velocity field occurs within an sph particle the particle moves and the simulation is irreversibly affected contrary to mesh based methods it is not possible to average the fluctuating fields afterwards to get relevant physical quantities therefore an sph particle should not be smaller than the sediment grain size otherwise the model would lead to deformations that do not occur in the real material and overestimated strain rates this may be partly due to the fact that the macroscopic elastic properties e g young s modulus of the granular materials are very different from elastic properties of individual grains they are composed of guan et al 2012 consequently a particular attention must be paid to the discretization limitations when modelling granular materials with sph this might be avoided using alternative rheological laws or different elastic properties when δr d g on the other hand fig 11 clearly shows that a sub particle model would be necessary to correctly predict erosion when δr d g within the scope of the present elastic viscoplastic model the problem depends on 10 physical parameters the density ρ w and dynamic viscosity of water η w the grain density ρ g the granular material porosity ϕ the internal friction angle ψ the young s modulus e the poisson s coefficient the grain size d g the gravity acceleration g and a characteristic length of the problem l applying the buckingham π theorem we obtain 7 dimensionless parameters that characterize this problem 107 ϕ ρ g ρ w ψ ν r e g 1 2 l 3 2 ρ w η w d g l e d g ρ g ρ w g in a way using δr d g amounts to setting d g δ r we would then have sph particles being solid matter while other are viscoplastic the latter two dimensionless numbers are thus modified as 108 δ r l e δ r ρ g ρ w g regarding the first one the decrease of the grain size has probably no influence on the results since we have δr l 1 as well as d g l 1 however we see that the second dimensionless number is significantly changed recovering its physical value can be done by changing young s modulus when δ r α d g with α 1 we would set the young s modulus to αe however this was not tested in the scope of this work in fig 11 we see that an optimum seems to be achieved for δr d g 3d g for both sand and pvc however it must be pointed out that δr 3d g is a coarse spatial discretization for this problem 22 particles on the water height thus the error due to the hydrodynamics solver is also probably partly responsible on the erosion overestimation note that erosion is overestimated for almost all configurations thus at worst simulations give a superior limit of the real erosion in the following results are presented for δr 2d g e g for the sand simulations were carried out setting a particle spacing of δ r 0 004 m resulting in 130 000 particles of water 38 000 particles of saturated soil and 3000 particles vertex and boundary particles flows interfaces fig 12 shows the interface between moving and motionless sediment black the water sediment interface blue and the water free surface red for the sand the interface between the motionless and the moving sediment is defined in line with the experimental detection method in the experiment a camera set to 200 images per second i e one image every δ t 5 ms was used to acquire image sequences of the flow every image was then subtracted to the preceding image the black region in the resulting image was defined as the motionless region given that the spatial resolution for one pixel is approximately δ x 1 mm spinewine and zech 2007 we define a threshold velocity below which the sediment sph particle is considered as motionless 109 u motion δ x δ t continuous lines represent the numerical results while experimental data are represented as dotted lines a general good agreement is obtained for the sand bed interfaces as well as free surface and water front are well predicted for the five considered times fig 14 shows a comparison of flow interfaces for δ r 2 d g solid lines and δ r d g 2 dashed lines we clearly see that having sph particles smaller that the grain size dashed lines leads to overestimated bed deformations while the results obtained for δ r 2 d g figs 12 and 14 match the experimental data for the pvc bed fig 13 shows that the initial liquefaction is slightly underestimated in particular the experimental bed profile i e the black dotted line at t 250 ms is deeper than the numerical one this may be due to the fact that the lowering of a gate is not taken into account in the simulation moreover there is a large uncertainty on pvc beds elastic properties indeed elastic properties of sand are widely used in soil mechanics and a lot of experimental data is available we did not find such data for pvc soils hence the differences between numerical and experimental results nevertheless simulations give good results for the pvc too in addition they exhibit very different behaviours for sand and pvc demonstrating the capability of the model to account for different material properties 7 conclusion in this work ulrich s 2013 elastic viscoplastic model was implemented and improves in the frame of a sph multi phase formulation hu and adams s 2006 multi phase formulation was adapted to usaw boundary conditions and vila s 1999 continuity equation is used so that the model can handle free surface flows the soil is treated as a continuum whose behaviour depends on a yield stress determined according to drucker prager s criterion in unyielded regions the shear stress is calculated in line with linear elastic theory in yielded regions a shear thinning rheological law is used and the transitions between solid and liquid states are ensured by a blending function driven by the strain rate magnitude a yield strain rate definition based on the yield stress and physical properties of the soil was proposed thus contrary to ulrich 2013 the mechanical behaviour of the soil does not depend on any numerical parameter in addition a reliable method based on a laplace equation was developed to compute the effective pressure that is mandatory to compute the yield stress this elastic viscoplastic model was tested on a two dimensional soil collapse test case the soil surface configuration and the failure line were compared to experimental results and a good agreement was found the surface remaining constant after a few seconds the model was then applied to a two dimensional dam break wave on movable beds two different materials were tested i e sand and pvc pullets numerical free surface moving soil water and motionless soil moving soil interfaces were compared to experimental data a good agreement was found for the sand for the pvc the lack of elastic properties experimental values leads to less accurate but still reasonable results for both materials the total mass of eroded sediment is predicted with a correct order of magnitude when the sph particle size does not exceed three times the grain size note that this work may be implemented in future versions of the open source gpusph code gpusph official website to improve results turbulence models could be tested indeed the force exerted by water on the sediment is strongly related to the turbulent viscosity of water near the soil water interface moreover a sub particle model could improve erosion prediction when the particle size is large compared to the grain size more radically unified solid liquid models peshkov and romenski 2016 could be considered to model granular flows in sph 
899,modeling of uncertainty associated with subsurface dynamics has long been a major research topic its significance is widely recognized for real life applications despite the huge effort invested in the area major obstacles still remain on the way from theory and applications particularly problematic here is the confusion between modeling uncertainty and modeling spatial variability which translates into a mis conception in fact an inconsistency in that it suggests that modeling of uncertainty and modeling of spatial variability are equivalent and as such requiring a lot of data this paper investigates this challenge against the backdrop of a 7 km deep underground tunnel in china where environmental impacts are of major concern we approach the data challenge by pursuing a new concept for rapid impact modeling rim which bypasses altogether the need to estimate posterior distributions of model parameters focusing instead on detailed stochastic modeling of impacts conditional to all information available including prior ex situ information and in situ measurements as well a foundational element of rim is the construction of informative priors for target parameters using ex situ data relying on ensembles of well documented sites pre screened for geological and hydrological similarity to the target site the ensembles are built around two sets of similarity criteria a physically based set of criteria and an additional set covering epistemic criteria in another variation to common bayesian practice we update the priors to obtain conditional distributions of the target environmental impact dependent variables and not the hydrological variables this recognizes that goal oriented site characterization is in many cases more useful in applications compared to parameter oriented characterization keywords hydrogeology uncertainty tunneling environmental impacts bayesian priors site characterization 1 introduction this study looks at the hydrogeological aspects of the mingtang deep underground tunneling project located in a mountainous terrain in china of 7 5 km in length and at depths exceeding 450 m in a mixed granite gneiss rock formation the mingtang tunnel project poses a unique challenge to acceptable modes of analyzing uncertainty because of the complexity of the study site on one hand and the scarcity of data on the other in addressing this challenge we explore the interface between theory and practical yet rigorous approaches for modeling uncertainty subject to the limitations imposed by severe data constraints the mingtang tunnel is an example for a heavy impact yet poorly sampled project a situation quite common in large scale projects in general and deep underground structures in particular e g yang et al 2009 molinero et al 2002 although the mongtang tunnel connects two major urban areas it is located in a largely uninhabited area in a mountainous terrain with limited economic activity as a result 1 there is no information on the spatial variability of the conductivity and other hydraulic parameters and on recharge 2 there is no information available to indicate the spatial extent of the groundwater basin and the boundary conditions 3 there is no information on water table elevation it is well known however that the domain is comprised of interweaved granite and gneiss rocks and it is intersected by multiple fault zones two faults were identified to intersect the tunnel during construction the challenge behind these difficulties is the need to estimate model parameters as a preliminary step for any uncertainty analysis stochastic modeling has almost always focused on parameter estimation for example bayesian approaches e g rubin et al 2010 focus on estimating posterior distributions of parameters as a first step towards uncertainty quantification the posterior distributions can then be used to generate multiple realizations of the investigated domain these realizations are then processed through a forward model to generate the statistical distributions of the performance metrics of interest such as concentration travel times or other environmental performance metrics such as enhanced cancer risk de barros et al 2012 de barros and rubin 2008 de barros et al 2009 maxwell et al 1999 nowak et al 2010 to get to that point requires going through a computationally intensive calculation of the likelihood function this effort becomes extremely unwieldy when a likelihood function cannot be specified requiring instead to develop non parametric likelihood functions the computational challenge has been addressed in multiple papers but it is still formidable especially in situations where a large number of parameters are involved an appealing alternative is offered by approximate bayesian computation also known as abc turner and van zandt 2012 csilléry et al 2012 in abc the computation of the likelihood function is bypassed altogether instead a set of summary statistics is computed from the simulated parameters and compared to the summary statistics obtained from the actual data csilléry et al 2012 leading to approximate posterior distributions of parameters a similar concept although in a different context was offered by beven and binley 1992 in the form of the glue although not a bayesian approach glue intends to bypass expensive optimization searches in complex parameter spaces by ranking parameter sets based on a comparison between simulated and observed data our approach named rapid impact modeling or rim in short follows a somewhat similar line of thinking but takes it in a different direction with rim we recognize that in many situations the targets of the site investigation are impacts and not model parameters and that posterior distributions of parameters are but a step along the way which we intend to bypass altogether instead of deriving posterior distributions of parameters and going through expensive likelihood function calculations rim couples prior knowledge with in situ information using the total probability theorem and concepts of conditional probability the way we approach the data challenge is by pursuing rapid impact modeling rim which avoids altogether the need to estimate posterior distributions of the model parameters focusing instead on stochastic modeling of impacts conditional to all information available including prior ex situ information and in situ measurements as well the conditioning information is used in its original form without reducing it to statistics and hence rim does not lose any information compared to alternative methodologies in this paper we will pursue a stochastic approach the question addressed in this paper is as follows how can we address uncertainty in the presence of limited data availability in a practical way and without sacrificing rigor this paper proposes a methodology for answering this question the key elements of the proposed methodology are as follows 1 defining informative statistical prior distributions for the critical parameters the idea here is to define the hydraulic parameters as random variables and to model the priors for the relevant parameters based on information gleaned from geologically similar sites to that end a methodology is outlined for identifying an ensemble of suitable sites it consists of screening a large number of candidate sites using a series of similarity criteria that can be grouped into two groups physical and epistemic the first group includes measures of physical geological conditions the second group covers the technology used for obtaining the measurements such as field test methodology and measurement support scale the parameter values from each of the similar sites are viewed as realizations generated by a common random process much like the ensemble of realizations generated in a monte carlo simulation because of the reliance on ex situ information we refer to these priors as ex situ priors 2 scaling is key for simplification in designing a solution strategy we should note the multiple length scales that define the flow and transport problem this includes the scale of the flow domain the scales of heterogeneity the scales of the target variables measurement scales and problem specific scales e g scale of the solute plume the relationship between the scales offers opportunities for simplification e g rubin et al 1999 de barros and rubin 2011 the strategy adopted for this study calls for populating the model cells with effective hydraulic conductivities in this study the conditions required to support such an approach are explored the effective conductivity is then modeled as a random variable with the parameters of the distribution obtained from the priors for its parameters 3 goal oriented characterization goal oriented characterization is addressed by focusing on environmental impact assessment instead of stochastic modeling of parameter distributions following de barros et al 2012 de barros and rubin 2008 de barros et al 2009 nowak et al 2010 and geiges et al 2015 this paper pursues the rim strategy against the backdrop of a major deep underground tunnelling project where environmental impacts are of major concern this project provides a unique opportunity to evaluate the modeling needs of a real life project and to identify useful and practical stochastic concepts the paper is built as follows section 2 provides a brief site description section 3 provides a detailed discussion of the methodology including the numerical model and the stochastic approach section 4 discusses the principles and application of our method for constructing priors and it is followed by analysis section 5 and conclusions section 6 2 study site description this section provides general information about the study site including location geology ecosystem and potential impacts 2 1 location and climate the mingtang site is located in yuexi county anhui province mid eastern china fig 1 it connects hubei province and anhui province the tunnel is 7 548 km long and runs from east to west 266 272 the maximum depth of the tunnel is about 548 m below ground surface the mingtang site consists of a study area of approximately 180 km2 around the mingtang tunnel the topography is mountainous with moderate slopes the average temperature is 14 5 c the rainfall in spring and summer account for more than 70 of the whole year and the average annual precipitation is 1452 2 mm the land cover is primarily pine forests with sparsely distributed farmlands 2 2 geology the rock mass along the tunnel axis consists primarily of moderately weathered granite and gneiss fig 2 detailed information is provided in chen et al 2016 and li et al 2016 there are three major faults along the tunnel axis marked as f7 f6 and f14 respectively from west to east but only two f6 and f7 were encountered during excavation and thus considered in the model additional information is provided in chen et al 2017 2 3 potential environmental impacts induced by groundwater inflow into the tunnel the main impacts of concern relate to ecosystem health and to sustainable agriculture these impacts could be assessed by evaluating the effects of the decline in the water table hence the primary focus of this study is on the decline in groundwater table elevation as a consequence of groundwater inflow into the tunnel the water table decline is expected to have a direct impact on local residents in terms of domestic and agriculture water supply a high water table is particularly important for rice paddies the sustainability of the natural ecosystem could also be influenced if the water table declines to the point which would affect the root water uptake other concerns include impact on the seasonal surface water systems e g rivers streams springs and waterfalls but they are not explored in this study 3 stochastic modeling of the drawdown following section 2 we plan to model the drawdown as a random variable and to derive its statistics from available data of particular challenge is addressing data scarcity our plan is built around the following principles 1 the drawdown is defined as an environmental performance metric epm we define d x as the drawdown at x representing drawdown at location x 2 estimates of the baseline water table pre excavation needed for calculating drawdowns are obtained following two different precipitation and recharge scenarios representing multi year wet and dry conditions the wet scenario is employed for estimating impacts on rice paddies as stated above whereas the dry scenario targets water supply wells and it is motivated by the concern that significant drawdowns would lower the water table to levels below the water supply wells which is likely or more likely to happen if we have an extended dry period to begin with in this paper we report results from the wet scenario as there is no information on the water supply wells in the region at this time 3 the drawdown is modeled as a random variable with d x denoting the random variable representing d x as such it is characterized by its probability mass function 1 p d x d i where p denotes probability and d i denoting a drawdown interval e g 0 1 m etc eq 1 provides the unconditional distribution of the drawdown at a given location x unconditional here implies that no measurements were available to condition in a bayesian sense the statistics of d x eq 1 is solved with the aid of the total probability theorem as follows 2 p d x d i θ p d x d i θ f θ d n θ where θ is a vector of order n standing for the parameter space of the random variables used for modeling the hydraulic attributes eq 2 is solved using monte carlo integration with the probabilities given by the priors as discussed subsequently in section 4 this entails generating multiple realizations of θ from the parameter space defined by the priors followed by solving the flow equation numerically further simplification of 2 is enabled by dividing the parameter probability space into hyper cubes with the aid of the total probability theorem as follows 3 p d x d i j 1 m p d x d i a j p a j where aj denotes one of m hypercubes defining subsets of the parameter space the probabilities p aj j 1 m are obtained from the priors with j 1 m p a j 1 eq 3 provides an option for conditioning the drawdown statistics on a range of parameter values that are in agreement with in situ observations item 4 below shows how to weigh the parameter sets based on the quality of predictions the probability mass function defined by eq 3 provides us with the means to assign probabilities to drawdown intervals based on prior information to condition these probabilities on in situ data we resort to the next step the infiltration flux into the mingtang tunnel was measured over a period of 360 days this information is used to condition the drawdown probabilities consider the range absolute differences between modeled and the actual tunnel infiltration defined by the various parameter combinations under consideration this difference covers both measurement errors averaging and modeling error it could be divided into several intervals ek k 1 k the selection of intervals is discussed below the general approach is outlined in eq 4 4 p c d x d i e k j 1 m p d x d i e k a j p a j e k where pc in the probability mass function conditioned on the ek interval to solve eq 4 each of the realizations analyzed under item 3 above will be used to simulate the tunnel infiltration and the result compared to the measured infiltration this will allow us to look at the statistics of the drawdown for any given error interval ek while avoiding computationally intensive parameter updates eq 4 is the essence of rapid impact modeling rim as it provides the means to analyze impacts directly without going through a computationally intensive parameter estimation while at the same time integrating ex situ information with local in situ information selection of the maximum error bracket to consider in eq 4 is subjective whereas the tunnel infiltration s measurement error is well documented the true value of the infiltration is unknown thus the range of values considered for the errors should reflect a wide range of scenarios large errors may be associated with low probabilities but they could represent extreme scenarios and need to be considered 4 defining the ex situ conditional priors the approach we pursue here combines the following elements 1 establishing prior distributions for critical parameters based on published data from similar sites we refer to these as ex situ conditional priors or ex situ priors in short 2 in the absence of conditional priors exploring the bounds of physical plausibility 3 reducing data needs by identifying potential for homogenization 4 assessing environmental impact using the ex situ conditional priors combined with local information when appropriate in the present case using tunnel infiltration data at the mingtang site we have limited in situ information primarily of a qualitative nature not enough for detailed site characterization but sufficient for providing some indications of which sites could be used for borrowing information that could be used for construction of priors for example geophysical surveys coupled with several borehole logs were found useful for delineating the boundaries between the granite and gneiss units along the tunnel while not directly informative on hydraulic conductivity the rock type information is useful for identifying geologically similar and better sampled sites around the world from which priors could be defined we refer to priors constructed from borrowed information as conditional ex situ priors because they are obtained from sites other than the target site and they are selected after determining that they meet criteria of similarity similarity is established using two sets of criteria supporting two complementary perspectives the first perspective considers intrinsic properties such as lithology open fracture and tectonic activity etc the other perspective considers epistemic properties such as sampling depth testing method and the relationship between support volume and statistical scale etc the following subsections demonstrate applications of this approach to the hydraulic parameters of the mingtang site 4 1 hydraulic conductivity of granite this section defines criteria for assessing site similarity followed by selection of comparable sites and data assimilation 4 1 1 site similarity criteria similarity between sites is determined by screening candidate sites using the list of similarity criteria provided in table 1 which provides a general description of each criterion coupled with its application for the mingtang site an extended list of similarity criteria is desirable as it increases the potential of finding sites that are hydro geologically similar however it is difficult to obtain the information needed to evaluate all criteria and we are often limited to employing a subset of criteria a subset of criteria consisting of the field testing method employed rock type fracture condition and tectonic condition is used to establish ex situ priors the selection of the criteria is based on data availability at the mingtang site as described in section 2 and at the comparable sites see additional discussion in section 6 4 1 2 comparable site selected for granite prior analysis the ensemble of sites used to establish the ex situ prior for the granite conductivity is provided in table 2 4 1 3 modeling the conductivity from ex situ comparable sites statistics of the conductivity values from the ensemble of comparable sites table 2 were used to model the conductivity for the numerical model of the mingtang site our general approach for modeling the conductivity of the granites is to homogenize the conductivity field and to represent it using effective conductivities homogenization of the conductivity field is a viable strategy for modeling the effects of spatial variability when dealing with average fluxes in this study we are interested in modeling large scale average fluxes and such fluxes can be modeled using effective conductivities as has been shown in rubin 2003 and dagan 1989 there are several models for the effective conductivity reported in the literature and in general they are associated with assumptions regarding the flow regime 2d 3d uniform in the average radial flow etc e g indelman and dagan 1993 dykaar and kitanidis 1992 binley et al 1989 and the statistical distribution of the conductivity e g normal log normal bimodal etc as it is difficult to associate the mingtang site flow regime with any set of assumptions that would allow us to select a tightly defined model we must resort to the least restrictive and hence the most general model rubin 2003 which states that the effective conductivity is bounded between the arithmetic and harmonic means of the conductivity depending neither on the flow regime nor on the shape of the distribution of the conductivity for this model to be valid the following conditions must be met first the flow domain needs to be stationary as shown in table 2 the conductivity decreases with depth and so we limited the assumption of stationarity for fixed depth intervals with the bounds computed based on conductivity measurements of equal depth second the domain must be larger than the correlation length review of multiple studies wen and kung 1993 walker et al 2005 poteri et al 2002 jaquet et al 2013 follin 1990 erhel et al 2009 sawada et al 2015 indicates that the horizontal correlation lengths in granite rocks vary from 1 to 300 m with most domains showing correlation lengths between 20 to 50 m these length scales are smaller than the dimensions of the mingtang flow domain and at the same time are larger than the measurement scale which is typically of the order of 1 to 7 m see table 2 to summarize our approach for selecting conductivity values to the mingtang numerical model follows these steps define an ensemble of geologically similar sites following intrinsic and epistemic screening criteria generate a scatterplot of the conductivities from the comparable sites while avoiding bias due to disparities in number of samples between sites compute the upper and lower bounds on the effective conductivity at each depth interval with n values of the conductivity within a depth interval around a nodal depth ki i 1 n the arithmetic and harmonic mean values k a k h of that nodal depth interval are given by the following definitions see rubin 2003 dagan 1989 indelman and dagan 1993 dykaar and kitanidis 1992 5 k a 1 n i 1 n k i k h 1 n i 1 n k i 1 1 perform this analysis sequentially for different depth intervals model the effective conductivity as a random variable distributed uniformly between the bounds generate values for the vertical profiles of the effective conductivity to be used in the numerical model each profile defines a realization of the conductivity field the ensemble of realizations is then used to generate the statistical distributions of the dependent variables the scatterplot of the log conductivity of granite as a function of depth below ground surface with data drawn from multiple comparable sites is shown in fig 3 a the arithmetic geometric and harmonic mean values of data at each nodal depth are shown in fig 3 b with the arithmetic and harmonic means constituting the upper and lower bounds on the hydraulic conductivity respectively rubin 2003 the bounds are found to decrease exponentially with depth which is consistent with previous studies bense et al 2013 the bounds as represented by the regression lines form the upper and lower bounds on the effective conductivity as shown in fig 3 the two mingtang conductivity values lie next to the computed upper bounds as defined by the regression curves these conductivity values were measured near the faults damage zones which are known to be characterized by relatively high conductivity values indeed these values are in better agreement with the prior information on damage zone conductivity as seen later in fig 13 in the appendix 4 2 analysis of priors for gneiss fault zones and recharge detailed listings of similarity criteria and applications for gneiss recharge and fault zone conductivities are provided in appendix a 5 unconditional and conditional statistics of the drawdowns this section explores the unconditional and conditional statistics of the drawdowns at multiple locations and evaluates 1 the predictive power of the ex situ informative priors unconditional predictions and 2 the effect of conditioning the predictions on the tunnel infiltration fluxes 5 1 exploring the parameter space fig 4 provides a scan of the parameter space showing for each combination of parameter values the corresponding estimation error of the tunnel infiltration flux the scan is performed over the full range of parameter values as defined by the priors identified in section 4 and appendix a for example the effective conductivity of the granite is allowed to vary between the lower and upper bounds as defined in fig 3 this scan provides the means to distinguish between subsets of parameters based on their predictive capabilities for example the region dominated by blue is defined by parameter sets that most accurately predict the tunnel infiltration fluxes whereas the yellow dominated regions are populated by parameter combinations that provide poorer match with observations fig 5 provides a complementary perspective providing yet another confirmation of the existence of a well defined subset with superior performance the parameter scan is used to construct the conditional pdfs of the model parameters following eq 4 fig 6 shows the unconditional in red pdf of the granite s ln kef the log effective conductivity the other three plots show the conditional pdfs or posterior pdfs of the conductivity conditioned on the error level in predicting the flux as shown in figs 4 and 5 with blue and yellow representing the distributions conditional to the smallest and largest error levels respectively the error levels corresponding to the colors are 1 yellow 0 45 0 65 m2 d 2 green 0 25 0 45 m2 d and 3 blue below 0 25 m2 d it follows the rationale presented following eq 4 the average flux measured is 0 65 m2 day the measurement error is approximately 0 03 m2 day so we expect the total error to be in the blue parameter range but we allowed for a wider range of errors corresponding to the entire parameter space scan to be on the conservative side and to allow project managers to decide on acceptable error ranges based on the projected impacts the blue diagram with conditioning on the smallest errors shows a unimodal distribution approaching normality with a concentration of probability around a well defined mode it shows a marked reduction in spread and modality compared to the yellow and green diagrams this suggests that conditioning on the infiltration flux has a favorable effect it is of course to be expected that conditioning on field data would have a favorable effect but what is significant here is the conditioning of the effective conductivity on indirect information the infiltration flux furthermore recalling that the effective conductivity represents homogenization over large spatial extents this result is important in that it shows the conditioning on the tunnel infiltration flux carries an impact on a variable defined over large support volumes the second point above deserves further discussion the effective conductivity is not a space random function and it is not in general defined by a statistical distribution because it is defined over the ergodic limit of a stationary variable in the present study kef is defined as a uniformly distributed random variable varying between its lower and upper bounds which opens the door for conditioning 5 2 unconditional and conditional statistics of the drawdown this section analyzes the drawdowns at 4 different locations shown in fig 7 representing each a different combination of distances from the tunnel and from the fault planes the green spots in fig 7 represent a few rice paddies in the vicinity of the tunnel locations 1 and 2 are quite close to the tunnel and to faults the water table drawdown statistics at these two locations are very similar and are shown in fig 8 the simulation results for location 3 and 4 are shown in fig 9 and fig 10 respectively these results suggest the following 1 conditioning on the average flux has stronger impact at locations 3 and 4 whereas locations 1 and 2 show limited sensitivity to conditioning 2 predictions based on the blue parameter set provide the narrower drawdown cdfs 3 drawdowns increase as we get closer to the tunnel or to the faults but they are still significant at distances of several kilometers from the tunnel the drawdowns in locations 3 and 4 are quite similar although location 4 is much closer to the tunnel in both cases the drawdowns are much smaller than those observed for locations 1 and 2 this shows the strong impact of the faults on the drawdowns with the effects of the faults stretching out over large distances away from the tunnel also locations 3 and 4 show much more sensitivity to conditioning and that have a much stronger impact on drawdowns compared to the tunnel to summarize the drawdowns in locations 1 and 2 are dominated by the faults and are insensitive to conditioning proximity to the tunnel not near faults does not lead to extreme drawdowns to understand the effect of conditioning we should note that the tunnel infiltration flux i e the data used for conditioning represents an average taken over a very large stretch of the tunnel and as such is not representative of local conditions except in an average sense the infiltration flux is controlled by the effective conductivity and not by local conditions and as such estimating the effective conductivity benefits from conditioning on the fluxes the drawdowns at locations 1 and 2 are dominated by local conditions proximity to the faults and hence they are not informed by conditioning on the average flux at locations 3 and 4 on the other hand being far removed from the faults the factors affecting the drawdown are less local and hence the drawdown statistics are informed by and are sensitive to the information on the average flux what do we learn from this the tunnel engineering perspective tunnel structures experience enormous pressures the pressure can be reduced by allowing water to drain through the tunnel s walls this obviously has an impact on construction costs but it comes with an environmental price the larger the savings on construction costs the larger would be the environmental impacts the environmental impact perspective despite the mitigating effects of the tunnel s construction details drawdowns are significant even at distances of a few kilometers from the tunnel for the agricultural practices common in the study area even a small drawdown of the order of 1 5 m is detrimental the stochastic approach perspective the new concept that emerges from this discussion is that of selective conditioning through the total probability theorem it was formally summarized in eq 4 what that means is that rather than deriving the posterior distributions of the effective conductivity conditional to the tunnel infiltration flux we derive the conditional distribution of the drawdowns limiting predictions to only those parameter sets that are in the best agreement with the observations in this case it is the blue set see fig 6 this offers significant savings in computations because it eliminates the need to derive the likelihood function which is extremely demanding at the tails 5 3 the environmental impact of the drawdowns the pine forest at the mingtang site is the dominant land cover according to the criteria listed by eamus et al 2006 it is likely to be a part of a groundwater dependent ecosystem to assess the potential for impacts a comparison is needed between the rooting depth of the vegetation and the statistics of the drawdowns obtained in section 5 2 canadell et al 1996 showed that the maximum rooting depth of pine trees on weathered granite could range from 4 m to 7 5 m while peñuelas and filella 2003 found evidence of hydraulic lift by pine tree roots reaching 8 m in depth this is deeper than the drawdown shown in figs 9 and 10 but corresponds only to roughly the median values of the cdf value in fig 8 in other words the drawdowns at locations 1 and 2 are likely to exceed the maximum rooting depth this leads us to consider how the pine trees would respond to drawdown in a drier environment the effects of drier environments on pine rooting depth have been found to be positive laiho and finér 1996 studied pine mire in southern finland and showed that following drawdown of tens of centimeters the living root biomass increased considerably bakker et al 2006 studied the fine roots of pinus pinaster and showed that when the water table depth was 3 m instead of 1 3 m the rooting depth was 3 m instead of 0 9 m in other words it is reasonable to expect pine vegetation to be capable of growing deeper roots to fetch deeper water the depth to water table at the mingtang site ranges from 0 1 to 10 in meters given that the maximum rooting depth is about 8 m the length of root below water table is thus of the order of 1 m or smaller according to figs 9 and 10 the drawdowns at locations 3 and 4 are very likely to be lower than 3 m which is likely to be overcome by growing deeper roots e g hydraulic lift of pine trees during dry seasons peñuelas and filella 2003 domec et al 2010 however the drawdown at locations 1 and 2 as shown in fig 8 could exceed the maximum rooting depth a drawdown of 8 m corresponds to the cdf value of roughly 0 8 which means that the pine trees could be unable to reach the groundwater resource therefore an environmental impact would be expected at locations 1 and 2 drawdown is significantly higher when close to both tunnel and faults if we move away from the tunnel and the faults e g the northern part of basins a and b and the southern part of basin d in fig 7 the modeled drawdown is generally smaller than 1 m regardless of values of hydraulic parameters thus at these areas the environmental impact is expected to be negligible one should note that drawdown does not necessarily lead to wilting of the pine trees as the available water content in the soil is still accessible the drawdowns are expected to and in fact shown at this time to affect the rice paddies during the growing season rice paddies should be submerged in a shallow layer of water schmidt et al 2011 scanned the soil layers in a rice paddy and showed that the rooting depth of rice is roughly 20 cm morita et al 1988 showed that the root density of rice plunged significantly at depths larger than 25 cm both studies showed that the rooting depth of rice is of orders of magnitude smaller than our calculated drawdowns thus the effect of drawdown on rice paddies is obvious and significant and can happen at all locations shown in fig 7 6 summary and conclusions this study looks at the environmental impacts of the mingtang tunneling project the issues of primary concerns include the potential impacts of drawdown in the water table on the natural vegetation of the overlying ecosystem and on agricultural activities given that estimating the extent of the drawdown in the water table is identified as a variable of major concern from a broader perspective this paper addressed the data challenge issues raised in a series of forensic papers published in 2004 zhang and zhang 2004 winter 2004 sudicky 2004 rubin 2004 neuman 2004 molz 2004 ginn 2004 freeze 2004 dagan 2004 christakos 2004 and again in a series of papers summarized by rajaram 2016 this paper adopts a stochastic approach for modeling the environmental impacts in the form of drawdowns the approach we present and pursued called rim for rapid impact modeling derives the distribution of the environmental performance metrics in this case drawdowns at multiple critical locations conditional on data rim s primary innovations are first in the use of all the evidence available in the form of in situ and ex situ information for rapid assessment of impacts while bypassing the need for deriving statistical distributions of model parameters and second in the formulation of ex situ priors rim provides a huge reduction in computational effort because it replaces the computation of a likelihood function with integration over the parameter space defined by priors by focusing on the total probability theorem instead of posterior parameter distributions rim recognizes that in many applications the identification of parameters is just an interim step towards the end goal which is impact assessment and that this interim step incurs disproportionally large computational effort and in many cases requires unnecessary data acquisition efforts with this rim complements and augments previous efforts on goal oriented site characterization de barros et al 2012 de barros and rubin 2008 de barros et al 2009 maxwell et al 1999 nowak et al 2010 the starting point of rim includes construction of informative priors based on ex situ data unlike bayesian approaches the priors are not used as a prelude for computing posterior distributions of parameters but rather as an element in a comprehensive total probability theorem framework aiming at impacts this study presents extensive lists of similarity criteria for the conductivities of granite and gneiss rock formations for the conductivity and geometry of fault zones and for recharge in general one could adopt a restrictive approach for site selection whereby a large number of criteria must be met before a site is admitted into the pool of acceptable sites this could possibly lead to narrower priors and tighter estimates for the dependent variables however and unfortunately there are no uniform standards for scientific reporting and it is somewhere between difficult to impossible to find information on all the criteria that we wish to inspect for each of our candidate sites and as a result there may be sites admitted for comparison that do not meet the strictest criteria of similarity while not desirable such relaxation of similarity criteria is not necessarily detrimental the penalty for relaxing the similarity criteria could only mean wider prior distributions possibly overestimating uncertainty which is a reasonable price to pay transferring information from well sampled to poorly sampled sites is not a new concept it is quite intuitive carsel and parrish 1988 as an example computed the statistics of soil properties based on information from multiple sites they used soil type as defined by textural classification as a criterion of similarity but they did not introduce criteria for site similarity physical or epistemic another important work on this topic is reported by tague et al 2013 where criteria of site similarity such as stream order elevation and geology were employed singh et al 2014 proposed and reviewed various approaches for transferring rainfall runoff parameters from gauged to ungauged basins using physical climatic catchment characteristics and streamflow response characteristics distinctions based on epistemology e g measurements techniques were not discussed in these studies equally significant is that these studies did not employ a strategy for updating the ex situ prior through conditioning on local data local conditioning provides an important advantage in that it allows modelers to use the transferred information as a starting point and to update it as additional in situ information becomes available the conditioning scheme provides the means for updating the priors using a variety of information types including direct measurements of the target variables as well as information that is related to the target variables using mathematical models indirect information for example in this study we used measurements of the tunnel infiltration flux for updating acknowledgments the authors gratefully

for gneiss recharge and fault zones conductivity and geometry a 1 analysis of prior data for gneiss eight sites and their site specific information are listed in table 3 among which three are in europe one is in north america and four are in china similar to fig 3 the scatterplot of log conductivity and the regression curves for the bounds on the effective conductivity as well as the geometric mean are shown in fig 11 a and b respectively the mingtang measurements are closer to the upper bound and scattered around the regression curve a 2 analysis of prior information for recharge recharge is modeled by 6 r c r p where p is the average annual precipitation cr is the recharge precipitation ratio and r is the average annual recharge the use of this model is quite common e g rangarajan and athavale 2000 magruder et al 2009 obuobie et al 2012 de vries and simmers 2002 heppner et al 2007 and the references provided in table 4 we shall adopt the model as a working hypothesis without claiming optimality the estimation of recharge now becomes the estimation of cr similarity criteria are listed in table 4 due to limited documentation at the comparable sites a subset of three intrinsic criteria are considered in this study geological structure climate and land use the selection is based on the fact that at the mingtang site the dominant rock type the annual rainfall pattern and the dominant land use are known as described in section 2 the three selected criteria are applied qualitatively by direct comparison given that the dominant rock types at the mingtang site are granite and gneiss further that satellite images and land use maps show that the mingtang site is highly forested and finally that the annual precipitation pattern is characterized by prominent wet dry seasons roughly 45 of rainfall occurs from june to august and roughly 16 occurs from november to february furthermore snow ice melt contribution is negligible a number of studies satisfying at least one of the aforementioned criteria are listed in table 5 as well as their corresponding cr values the histograms and the estimated ex situ priors for cr are shown in fig 12 a 3 hydraulic conductivities of the fault zones the hydraulic conductivities of the fault zones could be very distinct from those of the fractured rocks in general average hydraulic conductivities are often assigned to fault zones which could be based on scaling factors from neighboring rock stratum yang et al 2009 reproduction of model parameters that fit observed water tables raposo et al 2010 derivation from an average of nearby borehole measurements molinero et al 2002 or statistical simulations assuming a representative average fault conductivity kitterød et al 2000 however bense et al 2013 showed that this is not the case instead depicting the fault zone of crystalline rocks as a combination of highly conductive outer damage zones enveloping a barely conductive inner fault core these fault zones are thus highly anisotropic in that the hydraulic conductivities in the damage zone have been reported in many studies to be several orders of magnitude higher than those near to the fault core in this manner the damage zones act as conduits for flow parallel to the fault plane whereas the fault core acts as a barrier to flow normal to the fault plane while the aforementioned core damage zone framework may assume that several fault zone processes reducing fault permeability are negligible e g dissolution and cementation in fracture networks we consider this to be reasonable in light of the large water influx quantities observed at fault intersections during the mingtang tunnel excavation at the mingtang site two faults were recognized to be intersecting the tunnel as described in section 2 the outer damage zone has an approximate width normal to the fault plane of 5 6 m on either side of the 30 cm fault core the same approach described in section 4 is again adopted but two adjustments are made first due to less available information about fault zones at the mingtang site among all criteria listed in table 1 only the geological structure similarity criterion is adopted second instead of 50 m the depth interval at which mean values are computed is set as 100 m accounting for the reduction in available observations at similar sites this is expected since boreholes only intersect fault affected areas at certain depths depending on a variety of factors including the width of the fault architecture fault inclination etc geologically similar sites for the ex situ prior of the hydraulic conductivity of fault zones are listed in table 6 including information on whether the fault zones are embedded in granite or gneiss or a combination of both note that there is no information exclusively for faults embedded in gneiss with all compiled sites having either granite or a combination of granite and gneiss as the dominant rock type in reality granite and gneiss rocks can either be fused together in formation or separated in alternating bands however it is unclear if most conductivity measurements arise from granite or gneiss rocks exclusively to that end an assumption is made that the ex situ prior for faults embedded in gneiss can be established by conditioning on the measurements from sites characterized by a combination of granite and gneiss the ex situ prior for faults embedded in granite on the other hand can be established by considering the measurements from all the sites listed in table 6 following the same steps as in section 4 the prior uncertainty bounds of can be established as shown in fig 13 the difference between the hydraulic conductivities of damage zones and of fault cores is about 3 orders of magnitude which is actually quite consistent with the range reported in the literature of ex situ priors the hydraulic conductivities of fault zones depending on whether they are damage zones or fault cores or are embedded in granite or gneiss are thus bounded by the upper and lower bounds shown in fig 13 appendix b numerical modeling the geographical scales of the mingtang tunnel and the impacted domain surrounding it are challenging the horizontal extent of the domain is in the tens of kilometers with depths to the tunnel reaching 500 m and more adding to the complexity is the need to employ variable grid density using small grid blocks of the order of a few meters to model the tunnel and faults while coarsening the grid to tens and hundreds of meters farther away from these elements to address the scale challenges we adopted a nested modeling strategy which we describe next to accurately simulate the groundwater flow system a structured grid refinement method referred to as nested modeling also known as telescopic mesh refinement tmr was employed regional inter basin flow effects were incorporated into the modeling analysis of smaller model domains and critical areas encompassing the local study site were simulated with high grid resolution nested modeling with variable density grid has the advantage of providing significant savings in computational cost dunning et al 2004 fig 14 presents schematically the nested modeling concept as implemented in this study the nested modeling follows a progression of steps from the multi catchment to regional to the local scales this progression intends to a systematically communicate boundary conditions across modeling scales b preserve continuity and consistency across scales and c allow usage of fine grid near the tunnel and coarsening of the grid with distance from the tunnel as a starting point in this approach the hydraulic heads at the edges of the coarse grid multi catchment scale model were determined using a regression model which correlates water table elevations with topography while similarly used in previous studies yang et al 2009 and reasonably accurate the regression may not be upheld near major flow conduits and barriers such as rivers and faults therefore to ensure the accuracy of results near the tunnel the regression model is not directly implemented at the regional model boundaries where these features may be close by next the multi catchment scale model is simulated to assign hydraulic head boundaries to the regional model the regional model is then processed with coarse grids to simulate regional flow effects outside of the local model area values of the hydraulic heads along the local scale model were then used as prescribed boundary conditions around the local flow model of the mingtang tunnel site the local model employs a fine grid with block size of the order of 0 1 m following zaidel et al 2010 modflow drain nodes were applied around the tunnel face to simulate zero pressure conditions along the tunnel interior and seepage the nested modeling approach intends to transfer information across scales without affecting the simulated flow effects in the local model specifically the boundaries of the local model should capture regional trends without affecting the local flow conditions at the vicinity of the tunnel towards this end the effects of boundary positions on simulated drawdown and head results in the local model were iteratively analyzed to establish a safe distance we concluded that positioning the nested model boundaries at a close distance of 100 m away from the tunnel resulted in drawdown simulations being greatly subdued in contrast expanding the local model beyond a threshold distance of 500 m away from the tunnel displayed no observable changes in the gradient and values of simulated drawdowns and heads hence nested model boundary conditions were applied at a minimum of 500 m away from the length and ends of the modeled mingtang tunnel this finding is in line with raposo et al 2010 
899,modeling of uncertainty associated with subsurface dynamics has long been a major research topic its significance is widely recognized for real life applications despite the huge effort invested in the area major obstacles still remain on the way from theory and applications particularly problematic here is the confusion between modeling uncertainty and modeling spatial variability which translates into a mis conception in fact an inconsistency in that it suggests that modeling of uncertainty and modeling of spatial variability are equivalent and as such requiring a lot of data this paper investigates this challenge against the backdrop of a 7 km deep underground tunnel in china where environmental impacts are of major concern we approach the data challenge by pursuing a new concept for rapid impact modeling rim which bypasses altogether the need to estimate posterior distributions of model parameters focusing instead on detailed stochastic modeling of impacts conditional to all information available including prior ex situ information and in situ measurements as well a foundational element of rim is the construction of informative priors for target parameters using ex situ data relying on ensembles of well documented sites pre screened for geological and hydrological similarity to the target site the ensembles are built around two sets of similarity criteria a physically based set of criteria and an additional set covering epistemic criteria in another variation to common bayesian practice we update the priors to obtain conditional distributions of the target environmental impact dependent variables and not the hydrological variables this recognizes that goal oriented site characterization is in many cases more useful in applications compared to parameter oriented characterization keywords hydrogeology uncertainty tunneling environmental impacts bayesian priors site characterization 1 introduction this study looks at the hydrogeological aspects of the mingtang deep underground tunneling project located in a mountainous terrain in china of 7 5 km in length and at depths exceeding 450 m in a mixed granite gneiss rock formation the mingtang tunnel project poses a unique challenge to acceptable modes of analyzing uncertainty because of the complexity of the study site on one hand and the scarcity of data on the other in addressing this challenge we explore the interface between theory and practical yet rigorous approaches for modeling uncertainty subject to the limitations imposed by severe data constraints the mingtang tunnel is an example for a heavy impact yet poorly sampled project a situation quite common in large scale projects in general and deep underground structures in particular e g yang et al 2009 molinero et al 2002 although the mongtang tunnel connects two major urban areas it is located in a largely uninhabited area in a mountainous terrain with limited economic activity as a result 1 there is no information on the spatial variability of the conductivity and other hydraulic parameters and on recharge 2 there is no information available to indicate the spatial extent of the groundwater basin and the boundary conditions 3 there is no information on water table elevation it is well known however that the domain is comprised of interweaved granite and gneiss rocks and it is intersected by multiple fault zones two faults were identified to intersect the tunnel during construction the challenge behind these difficulties is the need to estimate model parameters as a preliminary step for any uncertainty analysis stochastic modeling has almost always focused on parameter estimation for example bayesian approaches e g rubin et al 2010 focus on estimating posterior distributions of parameters as a first step towards uncertainty quantification the posterior distributions can then be used to generate multiple realizations of the investigated domain these realizations are then processed through a forward model to generate the statistical distributions of the performance metrics of interest such as concentration travel times or other environmental performance metrics such as enhanced cancer risk de barros et al 2012 de barros and rubin 2008 de barros et al 2009 maxwell et al 1999 nowak et al 2010 to get to that point requires going through a computationally intensive calculation of the likelihood function this effort becomes extremely unwieldy when a likelihood function cannot be specified requiring instead to develop non parametric likelihood functions the computational challenge has been addressed in multiple papers but it is still formidable especially in situations where a large number of parameters are involved an appealing alternative is offered by approximate bayesian computation also known as abc turner and van zandt 2012 csilléry et al 2012 in abc the computation of the likelihood function is bypassed altogether instead a set of summary statistics is computed from the simulated parameters and compared to the summary statistics obtained from the actual data csilléry et al 2012 leading to approximate posterior distributions of parameters a similar concept although in a different context was offered by beven and binley 1992 in the form of the glue although not a bayesian approach glue intends to bypass expensive optimization searches in complex parameter spaces by ranking parameter sets based on a comparison between simulated and observed data our approach named rapid impact modeling or rim in short follows a somewhat similar line of thinking but takes it in a different direction with rim we recognize that in many situations the targets of the site investigation are impacts and not model parameters and that posterior distributions of parameters are but a step along the way which we intend to bypass altogether instead of deriving posterior distributions of parameters and going through expensive likelihood function calculations rim couples prior knowledge with in situ information using the total probability theorem and concepts of conditional probability the way we approach the data challenge is by pursuing rapid impact modeling rim which avoids altogether the need to estimate posterior distributions of the model parameters focusing instead on stochastic modeling of impacts conditional to all information available including prior ex situ information and in situ measurements as well the conditioning information is used in its original form without reducing it to statistics and hence rim does not lose any information compared to alternative methodologies in this paper we will pursue a stochastic approach the question addressed in this paper is as follows how can we address uncertainty in the presence of limited data availability in a practical way and without sacrificing rigor this paper proposes a methodology for answering this question the key elements of the proposed methodology are as follows 1 defining informative statistical prior distributions for the critical parameters the idea here is to define the hydraulic parameters as random variables and to model the priors for the relevant parameters based on information gleaned from geologically similar sites to that end a methodology is outlined for identifying an ensemble of suitable sites it consists of screening a large number of candidate sites using a series of similarity criteria that can be grouped into two groups physical and epistemic the first group includes measures of physical geological conditions the second group covers the technology used for obtaining the measurements such as field test methodology and measurement support scale the parameter values from each of the similar sites are viewed as realizations generated by a common random process much like the ensemble of realizations generated in a monte carlo simulation because of the reliance on ex situ information we refer to these priors as ex situ priors 2 scaling is key for simplification in designing a solution strategy we should note the multiple length scales that define the flow and transport problem this includes the scale of the flow domain the scales of heterogeneity the scales of the target variables measurement scales and problem specific scales e g scale of the solute plume the relationship between the scales offers opportunities for simplification e g rubin et al 1999 de barros and rubin 2011 the strategy adopted for this study calls for populating the model cells with effective hydraulic conductivities in this study the conditions required to support such an approach are explored the effective conductivity is then modeled as a random variable with the parameters of the distribution obtained from the priors for its parameters 3 goal oriented characterization goal oriented characterization is addressed by focusing on environmental impact assessment instead of stochastic modeling of parameter distributions following de barros et al 2012 de barros and rubin 2008 de barros et al 2009 nowak et al 2010 and geiges et al 2015 this paper pursues the rim strategy against the backdrop of a major deep underground tunnelling project where environmental impacts are of major concern this project provides a unique opportunity to evaluate the modeling needs of a real life project and to identify useful and practical stochastic concepts the paper is built as follows section 2 provides a brief site description section 3 provides a detailed discussion of the methodology including the numerical model and the stochastic approach section 4 discusses the principles and application of our method for constructing priors and it is followed by analysis section 5 and conclusions section 6 2 study site description this section provides general information about the study site including location geology ecosystem and potential impacts 2 1 location and climate the mingtang site is located in yuexi county anhui province mid eastern china fig 1 it connects hubei province and anhui province the tunnel is 7 548 km long and runs from east to west 266 272 the maximum depth of the tunnel is about 548 m below ground surface the mingtang site consists of a study area of approximately 180 km2 around the mingtang tunnel the topography is mountainous with moderate slopes the average temperature is 14 5 c the rainfall in spring and summer account for more than 70 of the whole year and the average annual precipitation is 1452 2 mm the land cover is primarily pine forests with sparsely distributed farmlands 2 2 geology the rock mass along the tunnel axis consists primarily of moderately weathered granite and gneiss fig 2 detailed information is provided in chen et al 2016 and li et al 2016 there are three major faults along the tunnel axis marked as f7 f6 and f14 respectively from west to east but only two f6 and f7 were encountered during excavation and thus considered in the model additional information is provided in chen et al 2017 2 3 potential environmental impacts induced by groundwater inflow into the tunnel the main impacts of concern relate to ecosystem health and to sustainable agriculture these impacts could be assessed by evaluating the effects of the decline in the water table hence the primary focus of this study is on the decline in groundwater table elevation as a consequence of groundwater inflow into the tunnel the water table decline is expected to have a direct impact on local residents in terms of domestic and agriculture water supply a high water table is particularly important for rice paddies the sustainability of the natural ecosystem could also be influenced if the water table declines to the point which would affect the root water uptake other concerns include impact on the seasonal surface water systems e g rivers streams springs and waterfalls but they are not explored in this study 3 stochastic modeling of the drawdown following section 2 we plan to model the drawdown as a random variable and to derive its statistics from available data of particular challenge is addressing data scarcity our plan is built around the following principles 1 the drawdown is defined as an environmental performance metric epm we define d x as the drawdown at x representing drawdown at location x 2 estimates of the baseline water table pre excavation needed for calculating drawdowns are obtained following two different precipitation and recharge scenarios representing multi year wet and dry conditions the wet scenario is employed for estimating impacts on rice paddies as stated above whereas the dry scenario targets water supply wells and it is motivated by the concern that significant drawdowns would lower the water table to levels below the water supply wells which is likely or more likely to happen if we have an extended dry period to begin with in this paper we report results from the wet scenario as there is no information on the water supply wells in the region at this time 3 the drawdown is modeled as a random variable with d x denoting the random variable representing d x as such it is characterized by its probability mass function 1 p d x d i where p denotes probability and d i denoting a drawdown interval e g 0 1 m etc eq 1 provides the unconditional distribution of the drawdown at a given location x unconditional here implies that no measurements were available to condition in a bayesian sense the statistics of d x eq 1 is solved with the aid of the total probability theorem as follows 2 p d x d i θ p d x d i θ f θ d n θ where θ is a vector of order n standing for the parameter space of the random variables used for modeling the hydraulic attributes eq 2 is solved using monte carlo integration with the probabilities given by the priors as discussed subsequently in section 4 this entails generating multiple realizations of θ from the parameter space defined by the priors followed by solving the flow equation numerically further simplification of 2 is enabled by dividing the parameter probability space into hyper cubes with the aid of the total probability theorem as follows 3 p d x d i j 1 m p d x d i a j p a j where aj denotes one of m hypercubes defining subsets of the parameter space the probabilities p aj j 1 m are obtained from the priors with j 1 m p a j 1 eq 3 provides an option for conditioning the drawdown statistics on a range of parameter values that are in agreement with in situ observations item 4 below shows how to weigh the parameter sets based on the quality of predictions the probability mass function defined by eq 3 provides us with the means to assign probabilities to drawdown intervals based on prior information to condition these probabilities on in situ data we resort to the next step the infiltration flux into the mingtang tunnel was measured over a period of 360 days this information is used to condition the drawdown probabilities consider the range absolute differences between modeled and the actual tunnel infiltration defined by the various parameter combinations under consideration this difference covers both measurement errors averaging and modeling error it could be divided into several intervals ek k 1 k the selection of intervals is discussed below the general approach is outlined in eq 4 4 p c d x d i e k j 1 m p d x d i e k a j p a j e k where pc in the probability mass function conditioned on the ek interval to solve eq 4 each of the realizations analyzed under item 3 above will be used to simulate the tunnel infiltration and the result compared to the measured infiltration this will allow us to look at the statistics of the drawdown for any given error interval ek while avoiding computationally intensive parameter updates eq 4 is the essence of rapid impact modeling rim as it provides the means to analyze impacts directly without going through a computationally intensive parameter estimation while at the same time integrating ex situ information with local in situ information selection of the maximum error bracket to consider in eq 4 is subjective whereas the tunnel infiltration s measurement error is well documented the true value of the infiltration is unknown thus the range of values considered for the errors should reflect a wide range of scenarios large errors may be associated with low probabilities but they could represent extreme scenarios and need to be considered 4 defining the ex situ conditional priors the approach we pursue here combines the following elements 1 establishing prior distributions for critical parameters based on published data from similar sites we refer to these as ex situ conditional priors or ex situ priors in short 2 in the absence of conditional priors exploring the bounds of physical plausibility 3 reducing data needs by identifying potential for homogenization 4 assessing environmental impact using the ex situ conditional priors combined with local information when appropriate in the present case using tunnel infiltration data at the mingtang site we have limited in situ information primarily of a qualitative nature not enough for detailed site characterization but sufficient for providing some indications of which sites could be used for borrowing information that could be used for construction of priors for example geophysical surveys coupled with several borehole logs were found useful for delineating the boundaries between the granite and gneiss units along the tunnel while not directly informative on hydraulic conductivity the rock type information is useful for identifying geologically similar and better sampled sites around the world from which priors could be defined we refer to priors constructed from borrowed information as conditional ex situ priors because they are obtained from sites other than the target site and they are selected after determining that they meet criteria of similarity similarity is established using two sets of criteria supporting two complementary perspectives the first perspective considers intrinsic properties such as lithology open fracture and tectonic activity etc the other perspective considers epistemic properties such as sampling depth testing method and the relationship between support volume and statistical scale etc the following subsections demonstrate applications of this approach to the hydraulic parameters of the mingtang site 4 1 hydraulic conductivity of granite this section defines criteria for assessing site similarity followed by selection of comparable sites and data assimilation 4 1 1 site similarity criteria similarity between sites is determined by screening candidate sites using the list of similarity criteria provided in table 1 which provides a general description of each criterion coupled with its application for the mingtang site an extended list of similarity criteria is desirable as it increases the potential of finding sites that are hydro geologically similar however it is difficult to obtain the information needed to evaluate all criteria and we are often limited to employing a subset of criteria a subset of criteria consisting of the field testing method employed rock type fracture condition and tectonic condition is used to establish ex situ priors the selection of the criteria is based on data availability at the mingtang site as described in section 2 and at the comparable sites see additional discussion in section 6 4 1 2 comparable site selected for granite prior analysis the ensemble of sites used to establish the ex situ prior for the granite conductivity is provided in table 2 4 1 3 modeling the conductivity from ex situ comparable sites statistics of the conductivity values from the ensemble of comparable sites table 2 were used to model the conductivity for the numerical model of the mingtang site our general approach for modeling the conductivity of the granites is to homogenize the conductivity field and to represent it using effective conductivities homogenization of the conductivity field is a viable strategy for modeling the effects of spatial variability when dealing with average fluxes in this study we are interested in modeling large scale average fluxes and such fluxes can be modeled using effective conductivities as has been shown in rubin 2003 and dagan 1989 there are several models for the effective conductivity reported in the literature and in general they are associated with assumptions regarding the flow regime 2d 3d uniform in the average radial flow etc e g indelman and dagan 1993 dykaar and kitanidis 1992 binley et al 1989 and the statistical distribution of the conductivity e g normal log normal bimodal etc as it is difficult to associate the mingtang site flow regime with any set of assumptions that would allow us to select a tightly defined model we must resort to the least restrictive and hence the most general model rubin 2003 which states that the effective conductivity is bounded between the arithmetic and harmonic means of the conductivity depending neither on the flow regime nor on the shape of the distribution of the conductivity for this model to be valid the following conditions must be met first the flow domain needs to be stationary as shown in table 2 the conductivity decreases with depth and so we limited the assumption of stationarity for fixed depth intervals with the bounds computed based on conductivity measurements of equal depth second the domain must be larger than the correlation length review of multiple studies wen and kung 1993 walker et al 2005 poteri et al 2002 jaquet et al 2013 follin 1990 erhel et al 2009 sawada et al 2015 indicates that the horizontal correlation lengths in granite rocks vary from 1 to 300 m with most domains showing correlation lengths between 20 to 50 m these length scales are smaller than the dimensions of the mingtang flow domain and at the same time are larger than the measurement scale which is typically of the order of 1 to 7 m see table 2 to summarize our approach for selecting conductivity values to the mingtang numerical model follows these steps define an ensemble of geologically similar sites following intrinsic and epistemic screening criteria generate a scatterplot of the conductivities from the comparable sites while avoiding bias due to disparities in number of samples between sites compute the upper and lower bounds on the effective conductivity at each depth interval with n values of the conductivity within a depth interval around a nodal depth ki i 1 n the arithmetic and harmonic mean values k a k h of that nodal depth interval are given by the following definitions see rubin 2003 dagan 1989 indelman and dagan 1993 dykaar and kitanidis 1992 5 k a 1 n i 1 n k i k h 1 n i 1 n k i 1 1 perform this analysis sequentially for different depth intervals model the effective conductivity as a random variable distributed uniformly between the bounds generate values for the vertical profiles of the effective conductivity to be used in the numerical model each profile defines a realization of the conductivity field the ensemble of realizations is then used to generate the statistical distributions of the dependent variables the scatterplot of the log conductivity of granite as a function of depth below ground surface with data drawn from multiple comparable sites is shown in fig 3 a the arithmetic geometric and harmonic mean values of data at each nodal depth are shown in fig 3 b with the arithmetic and harmonic means constituting the upper and lower bounds on the hydraulic conductivity respectively rubin 2003 the bounds are found to decrease exponentially with depth which is consistent with previous studies bense et al 2013 the bounds as represented by the regression lines form the upper and lower bounds on the effective conductivity as shown in fig 3 the two mingtang conductivity values lie next to the computed upper bounds as defined by the regression curves these conductivity values were measured near the faults damage zones which are known to be characterized by relatively high conductivity values indeed these values are in better agreement with the prior information on damage zone conductivity as seen later in fig 13 in the appendix 4 2 analysis of priors for gneiss fault zones and recharge detailed listings of similarity criteria and applications for gneiss recharge and fault zone conductivities are provided in appendix a 5 unconditional and conditional statistics of the drawdowns this section explores the unconditional and conditional statistics of the drawdowns at multiple locations and evaluates 1 the predictive power of the ex situ informative priors unconditional predictions and 2 the effect of conditioning the predictions on the tunnel infiltration fluxes 5 1 exploring the parameter space fig 4 provides a scan of the parameter space showing for each combination of parameter values the corresponding estimation error of the tunnel infiltration flux the scan is performed over the full range of parameter values as defined by the priors identified in section 4 and appendix a for example the effective conductivity of the granite is allowed to vary between the lower and upper bounds as defined in fig 3 this scan provides the means to distinguish between subsets of parameters based on their predictive capabilities for example the region dominated by blue is defined by parameter sets that most accurately predict the tunnel infiltration fluxes whereas the yellow dominated regions are populated by parameter combinations that provide poorer match with observations fig 5 provides a complementary perspective providing yet another confirmation of the existence of a well defined subset with superior performance the parameter scan is used to construct the conditional pdfs of the model parameters following eq 4 fig 6 shows the unconditional in red pdf of the granite s ln kef the log effective conductivity the other three plots show the conditional pdfs or posterior pdfs of the conductivity conditioned on the error level in predicting the flux as shown in figs 4 and 5 with blue and yellow representing the distributions conditional to the smallest and largest error levels respectively the error levels corresponding to the colors are 1 yellow 0 45 0 65 m2 d 2 green 0 25 0 45 m2 d and 3 blue below 0 25 m2 d it follows the rationale presented following eq 4 the average flux measured is 0 65 m2 day the measurement error is approximately 0 03 m2 day so we expect the total error to be in the blue parameter range but we allowed for a wider range of errors corresponding to the entire parameter space scan to be on the conservative side and to allow project managers to decide on acceptable error ranges based on the projected impacts the blue diagram with conditioning on the smallest errors shows a unimodal distribution approaching normality with a concentration of probability around a well defined mode it shows a marked reduction in spread and modality compared to the yellow and green diagrams this suggests that conditioning on the infiltration flux has a favorable effect it is of course to be expected that conditioning on field data would have a favorable effect but what is significant here is the conditioning of the effective conductivity on indirect information the infiltration flux furthermore recalling that the effective conductivity represents homogenization over large spatial extents this result is important in that it shows the conditioning on the tunnel infiltration flux carries an impact on a variable defined over large support volumes the second point above deserves further discussion the effective conductivity is not a space random function and it is not in general defined by a statistical distribution because it is defined over the ergodic limit of a stationary variable in the present study kef is defined as a uniformly distributed random variable varying between its lower and upper bounds which opens the door for conditioning 5 2 unconditional and conditional statistics of the drawdown this section analyzes the drawdowns at 4 different locations shown in fig 7 representing each a different combination of distances from the tunnel and from the fault planes the green spots in fig 7 represent a few rice paddies in the vicinity of the tunnel locations 1 and 2 are quite close to the tunnel and to faults the water table drawdown statistics at these two locations are very similar and are shown in fig 8 the simulation results for location 3 and 4 are shown in fig 9 and fig 10 respectively these results suggest the following 1 conditioning on the average flux has stronger impact at locations 3 and 4 whereas locations 1 and 2 show limited sensitivity to conditioning 2 predictions based on the blue parameter set provide the narrower drawdown cdfs 3 drawdowns increase as we get closer to the tunnel or to the faults but they are still significant at distances of several kilometers from the tunnel the drawdowns in locations 3 and 4 are quite similar although location 4 is much closer to the tunnel in both cases the drawdowns are much smaller than those observed for locations 1 and 2 this shows the strong impact of the faults on the drawdowns with the effects of the faults stretching out over large distances away from the tunnel also locations 3 and 4 show much more sensitivity to conditioning and that have a much stronger impact on drawdowns compared to the tunnel to summarize the drawdowns in locations 1 and 2 are dominated by the faults and are insensitive to conditioning proximity to the tunnel not near faults does not lead to extreme drawdowns to understand the effect of conditioning we should note that the tunnel infiltration flux i e the data used for conditioning represents an average taken over a very large stretch of the tunnel and as such is not representative of local conditions except in an average sense the infiltration flux is controlled by the effective conductivity and not by local conditions and as such estimating the effective conductivity benefits from conditioning on the fluxes the drawdowns at locations 1 and 2 are dominated by local conditions proximity to the faults and hence they are not informed by conditioning on the average flux at locations 3 and 4 on the other hand being far removed from the faults the factors affecting the drawdown are less local and hence the drawdown statistics are informed by and are sensitive to the information on the average flux what do we learn from this the tunnel engineering perspective tunnel structures experience enormous pressures the pressure can be reduced by allowing water to drain through the tunnel s walls this obviously has an impact on construction costs but it comes with an environmental price the larger the savings on construction costs the larger would be the environmental impacts the environmental impact perspective despite the mitigating effects of the tunnel s construction details drawdowns are significant even at distances of a few kilometers from the tunnel for the agricultural practices common in the study area even a small drawdown of the order of 1 5 m is detrimental the stochastic approach perspective the new concept that emerges from this discussion is that of selective conditioning through the total probability theorem it was formally summarized in eq 4 what that means is that rather than deriving the posterior distributions of the effective conductivity conditional to the tunnel infiltration flux we derive the conditional distribution of the drawdowns limiting predictions to only those parameter sets that are in the best agreement with the observations in this case it is the blue set see fig 6 this offers significant savings in computations because it eliminates the need to derive the likelihood function which is extremely demanding at the tails 5 3 the environmental impact of the drawdowns the pine forest at the mingtang site is the dominant land cover according to the criteria listed by eamus et al 2006 it is likely to be a part of a groundwater dependent ecosystem to assess the potential for impacts a comparison is needed between the rooting depth of the vegetation and the statistics of the drawdowns obtained in section 5 2 canadell et al 1996 showed that the maximum rooting depth of pine trees on weathered granite could range from 4 m to 7 5 m while peñuelas and filella 2003 found evidence of hydraulic lift by pine tree roots reaching 8 m in depth this is deeper than the drawdown shown in figs 9 and 10 but corresponds only to roughly the median values of the cdf value in fig 8 in other words the drawdowns at locations 1 and 2 are likely to exceed the maximum rooting depth this leads us to consider how the pine trees would respond to drawdown in a drier environment the effects of drier environments on pine rooting depth have been found to be positive laiho and finér 1996 studied pine mire in southern finland and showed that following drawdown of tens of centimeters the living root biomass increased considerably bakker et al 2006 studied the fine roots of pinus pinaster and showed that when the water table depth was 3 m instead of 1 3 m the rooting depth was 3 m instead of 0 9 m in other words it is reasonable to expect pine vegetation to be capable of growing deeper roots to fetch deeper water the depth to water table at the mingtang site ranges from 0 1 to 10 in meters given that the maximum rooting depth is about 8 m the length of root below water table is thus of the order of 1 m or smaller according to figs 9 and 10 the drawdowns at locations 3 and 4 are very likely to be lower than 3 m which is likely to be overcome by growing deeper roots e g hydraulic lift of pine trees during dry seasons peñuelas and filella 2003 domec et al 2010 however the drawdown at locations 1 and 2 as shown in fig 8 could exceed the maximum rooting depth a drawdown of 8 m corresponds to the cdf value of roughly 0 8 which means that the pine trees could be unable to reach the groundwater resource therefore an environmental impact would be expected at locations 1 and 2 drawdown is significantly higher when close to both tunnel and faults if we move away from the tunnel and the faults e g the northern part of basins a and b and the southern part of basin d in fig 7 the modeled drawdown is generally smaller than 1 m regardless of values of hydraulic parameters thus at these areas the environmental impact is expected to be negligible one should note that drawdown does not necessarily lead to wilting of the pine trees as the available water content in the soil is still accessible the drawdowns are expected to and in fact shown at this time to affect the rice paddies during the growing season rice paddies should be submerged in a shallow layer of water schmidt et al 2011 scanned the soil layers in a rice paddy and showed that the rooting depth of rice is roughly 20 cm morita et al 1988 showed that the root density of rice plunged significantly at depths larger than 25 cm both studies showed that the rooting depth of rice is of orders of magnitude smaller than our calculated drawdowns thus the effect of drawdown on rice paddies is obvious and significant and can happen at all locations shown in fig 7 6 summary and conclusions this study looks at the environmental impacts of the mingtang tunneling project the issues of primary concerns include the potential impacts of drawdown in the water table on the natural vegetation of the overlying ecosystem and on agricultural activities given that estimating the extent of the drawdown in the water table is identified as a variable of major concern from a broader perspective this paper addressed the data challenge issues raised in a series of forensic papers published in 2004 zhang and zhang 2004 winter 2004 sudicky 2004 rubin 2004 neuman 2004 molz 2004 ginn 2004 freeze 2004 dagan 2004 christakos 2004 and again in a series of papers summarized by rajaram 2016 this paper adopts a stochastic approach for modeling the environmental impacts in the form of drawdowns the approach we present and pursued called rim for rapid impact modeling derives the distribution of the environmental performance metrics in this case drawdowns at multiple critical locations conditional on data rim s primary innovations are first in the use of all the evidence available in the form of in situ and ex situ information for rapid assessment of impacts while bypassing the need for deriving statistical distributions of model parameters and second in the formulation of ex situ priors rim provides a huge reduction in computational effort because it replaces the computation of a likelihood function with integration over the parameter space defined by priors by focusing on the total probability theorem instead of posterior parameter distributions rim recognizes that in many applications the identification of parameters is just an interim step towards the end goal which is impact assessment and that this interim step incurs disproportionally large computational effort and in many cases requires unnecessary data acquisition efforts with this rim complements and augments previous efforts on goal oriented site characterization de barros et al 2012 de barros and rubin 2008 de barros et al 2009 maxwell et al 1999 nowak et al 2010 the starting point of rim includes construction of informative priors based on ex situ data unlike bayesian approaches the priors are not used as a prelude for computing posterior distributions of parameters but rather as an element in a comprehensive total probability theorem framework aiming at impacts this study presents extensive lists of similarity criteria for the conductivities of granite and gneiss rock formations for the conductivity and geometry of fault zones and for recharge in general one could adopt a restrictive approach for site selection whereby a large number of criteria must be met before a site is admitted into the pool of acceptable sites this could possibly lead to narrower priors and tighter estimates for the dependent variables however and unfortunately there are no uniform standards for scientific reporting and it is somewhere between difficult to impossible to find information on all the criteria that we wish to inspect for each of our candidate sites and as a result there may be sites admitted for comparison that do not meet the strictest criteria of similarity while not desirable such relaxation of similarity criteria is not necessarily detrimental the penalty for relaxing the similarity criteria could only mean wider prior distributions possibly overestimating uncertainty which is a reasonable price to pay transferring information from well sampled to poorly sampled sites is not a new concept it is quite intuitive carsel and parrish 1988 as an example computed the statistics of soil properties based on information from multiple sites they used soil type as defined by textural classification as a criterion of similarity but they did not introduce criteria for site similarity physical or epistemic another important work on this topic is reported by tague et al 2013 where criteria of site similarity such as stream order elevation and geology were employed singh et al 2014 proposed and reviewed various approaches for transferring rainfall runoff parameters from gauged to ungauged basins using physical climatic catchment characteristics and streamflow response characteristics distinctions based on epistemology e g measurements techniques were not discussed in these studies equally significant is that these studies did not employ a strategy for updating the ex situ prior through conditioning on local data local conditioning provides an important advantage in that it allows modelers to use the transferred information as a starting point and to update it as additional in situ information becomes available the conditioning scheme provides the means for updating the priors using a variety of information types including direct measurements of the target variables as well as information that is related to the target variables using mathematical models indirect information for example in this study we used measurements of the tunnel infiltration flux for updating acknowledgments the authors gratefully

for gneiss recharge and fault zones conductivity and geometry a 1 analysis of prior data for gneiss eight sites and their site specific information are listed in table 3 among which three are in europe one is in north america and four are in china similar to fig 3 the scatterplot of log conductivity and the regression curves for the bounds on the effective conductivity as well as the geometric mean are shown in fig 11 a and b respectively the mingtang measurements are closer to the upper bound and scattered around the regression curve a 2 analysis of prior information for recharge recharge is modeled by 6 r c r p where p is the average annual precipitation cr is the recharge precipitation ratio and r is the average annual recharge the use of this model is quite common e g rangarajan and athavale 2000 magruder et al 2009 obuobie et al 2012 de vries and simmers 2002 heppner et al 2007 and the references provided in table 4 we shall adopt the model as a working hypothesis without claiming optimality the estimation of recharge now becomes the estimation of cr similarity criteria are listed in table 4 due to limited documentation at the comparable sites a subset of three intrinsic criteria are considered in this study geological structure climate and land use the selection is based on the fact that at the mingtang site the dominant rock type the annual rainfall pattern and the dominant land use are known as described in section 2 the three selected criteria are applied qualitatively by direct comparison given that the dominant rock types at the mingtang site are granite and gneiss further that satellite images and land use maps show that the mingtang site is highly forested and finally that the annual precipitation pattern is characterized by prominent wet dry seasons roughly 45 of rainfall occurs from june to august and roughly 16 occurs from november to february furthermore snow ice melt contribution is negligible a number of studies satisfying at least one of the aforementioned criteria are listed in table 5 as well as their corresponding cr values the histograms and the estimated ex situ priors for cr are shown in fig 12 a 3 hydraulic conductivities of the fault zones the hydraulic conductivities of the fault zones could be very distinct from those of the fractured rocks in general average hydraulic conductivities are often assigned to fault zones which could be based on scaling factors from neighboring rock stratum yang et al 2009 reproduction of model parameters that fit observed water tables raposo et al 2010 derivation from an average of nearby borehole measurements molinero et al 2002 or statistical simulations assuming a representative average fault conductivity kitterød et al 2000 however bense et al 2013 showed that this is not the case instead depicting the fault zone of crystalline rocks as a combination of highly conductive outer damage zones enveloping a barely conductive inner fault core these fault zones are thus highly anisotropic in that the hydraulic conductivities in the damage zone have been reported in many studies to be several orders of magnitude higher than those near to the fault core in this manner the damage zones act as conduits for flow parallel to the fault plane whereas the fault core acts as a barrier to flow normal to the fault plane while the aforementioned core damage zone framework may assume that several fault zone processes reducing fault permeability are negligible e g dissolution and cementation in fracture networks we consider this to be reasonable in light of the large water influx quantities observed at fault intersections during the mingtang tunnel excavation at the mingtang site two faults were recognized to be intersecting the tunnel as described in section 2 the outer damage zone has an approximate width normal to the fault plane of 5 6 m on either side of the 30 cm fault core the same approach described in section 4 is again adopted but two adjustments are made first due to less available information about fault zones at the mingtang site among all criteria listed in table 1 only the geological structure similarity criterion is adopted second instead of 50 m the depth interval at which mean values are computed is set as 100 m accounting for the reduction in available observations at similar sites this is expected since boreholes only intersect fault affected areas at certain depths depending on a variety of factors including the width of the fault architecture fault inclination etc geologically similar sites for the ex situ prior of the hydraulic conductivity of fault zones are listed in table 6 including information on whether the fault zones are embedded in granite or gneiss or a combination of both note that there is no information exclusively for faults embedded in gneiss with all compiled sites having either granite or a combination of granite and gneiss as the dominant rock type in reality granite and gneiss rocks can either be fused together in formation or separated in alternating bands however it is unclear if most conductivity measurements arise from granite or gneiss rocks exclusively to that end an assumption is made that the ex situ prior for faults embedded in gneiss can be established by conditioning on the measurements from sites characterized by a combination of granite and gneiss the ex situ prior for faults embedded in granite on the other hand can be established by considering the measurements from all the sites listed in table 6 following the same steps as in section 4 the prior uncertainty bounds of can be established as shown in fig 13 the difference between the hydraulic conductivities of damage zones and of fault cores is about 3 orders of magnitude which is actually quite consistent with the range reported in the literature of ex situ priors the hydraulic conductivities of fault zones depending on whether they are damage zones or fault cores or are embedded in granite or gneiss are thus bounded by the upper and lower bounds shown in fig 13 appendix b numerical modeling the geographical scales of the mingtang tunnel and the impacted domain surrounding it are challenging the horizontal extent of the domain is in the tens of kilometers with depths to the tunnel reaching 500 m and more adding to the complexity is the need to employ variable grid density using small grid blocks of the order of a few meters to model the tunnel and faults while coarsening the grid to tens and hundreds of meters farther away from these elements to address the scale challenges we adopted a nested modeling strategy which we describe next to accurately simulate the groundwater flow system a structured grid refinement method referred to as nested modeling also known as telescopic mesh refinement tmr was employed regional inter basin flow effects were incorporated into the modeling analysis of smaller model domains and critical areas encompassing the local study site were simulated with high grid resolution nested modeling with variable density grid has the advantage of providing significant savings in computational cost dunning et al 2004 fig 14 presents schematically the nested modeling concept as implemented in this study the nested modeling follows a progression of steps from the multi catchment to regional to the local scales this progression intends to a systematically communicate boundary conditions across modeling scales b preserve continuity and consistency across scales and c allow usage of fine grid near the tunnel and coarsening of the grid with distance from the tunnel as a starting point in this approach the hydraulic heads at the edges of the coarse grid multi catchment scale model were determined using a regression model which correlates water table elevations with topography while similarly used in previous studies yang et al 2009 and reasonably accurate the regression may not be upheld near major flow conduits and barriers such as rivers and faults therefore to ensure the accuracy of results near the tunnel the regression model is not directly implemented at the regional model boundaries where these features may be close by next the multi catchment scale model is simulated to assign hydraulic head boundaries to the regional model the regional model is then processed with coarse grids to simulate regional flow effects outside of the local model area values of the hydraulic heads along the local scale model were then used as prescribed boundary conditions around the local flow model of the mingtang tunnel site the local model employs a fine grid with block size of the order of 0 1 m following zaidel et al 2010 modflow drain nodes were applied around the tunnel face to simulate zero pressure conditions along the tunnel interior and seepage the nested modeling approach intends to transfer information across scales without affecting the simulated flow effects in the local model specifically the boundaries of the local model should capture regional trends without affecting the local flow conditions at the vicinity of the tunnel towards this end the effects of boundary positions on simulated drawdown and head results in the local model were iteratively analyzed to establish a safe distance we concluded that positioning the nested model boundaries at a close distance of 100 m away from the tunnel resulted in drawdown simulations being greatly subdued in contrast expanding the local model beyond a threshold distance of 500 m away from the tunnel displayed no observable changes in the gradient and values of simulated drawdowns and heads hence nested model boundary conditions were applied at a minimum of 500 m away from the length and ends of the modeled mingtang tunnel this finding is in line with raposo et al 2010
