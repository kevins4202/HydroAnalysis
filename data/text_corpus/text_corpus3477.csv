17385,dissolved organic matter dom plays a critical role in determining the quality of wastewater and the safety of drinking water this is the first review to compare two types of popular dom monitoring techniques including absorption spectroscopy and fluorescence excitation emission matrices eems coupled with parallel factor analysis parafac vs fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry ft icr ms for the applications in wastewater and drinking water treatments the optical techniques provide a series of indices for tracking the quantity and quality of chromophoric and fluorescent dom while ft icr ms is capable of identifying thousands of dom compounds in wastewater and drinking water at the molecule level both types of monitoring techniques are increasingly used in studying dom in wastewater and drinking water treatments they provide valuable insights into the variability of dom composition in wastewater and drinking water the complexity and diversity of dom highlight the challenges for effective water treatments different effects of various treatment processes on dom are also assessed which indicates that the information on dom composition and its removal is key to optimize the treatment processes considering notable progress in advanced treatment processes and novel materials for removing dom it is important to continuously utilize these powerful monitoring tools for assessing the responses of different dom constituents to a series of treatment processes which can achieve an effective removal of dom and the quality of treated water graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords dom wastewater drinking water eem parafac ft icr ms 1 introduction dissolved organic matter dom is ubiquitous in natural aquatic environments and engineered systems and is a complex mixture of different compounds such as carbohydrates polysaccharides amino acids peptides proteins lipids humic substances and anthropogenic organic pollutants koch and dittmar 2006 yang et al 2015a wang et al 2018a berg et al 2019 the concentration and composition of dom change greatly in different water bodies due to different sources e g terrestrial algal and anthropogenic and transformation history e g particle adsorption photodegradation and microbial degradation heibati et al 2017 lee et al 2019 zhang et al 2019a mcdonough et al 2020 shi et al 2020 in wastewater and drinking water treatment plants wwtp and dwtp this is further complicated by dissimilar responses of different organic compounds to a series of treatment processes maizel and remucal 2017 li et al 2020 the quantity and quality of dom in treated water are critical for the utilization of water resources and for ensuring their water quality shonet al 2006 phong and hur 2016 zhang et al 2019b therefore it is important to identify different dom constituents and monitor their changes in wwtps and dwtps which helps develop effective treatment processes and evaluate the quality of treated water traditionally dom in wastewater and drinking water is tested by chemical and biochemical parameters such as chemical oxygen demand cod biochemical oxygen demand bod dissolved organic carbon doc and total organic carbon toc however those simple bulk parameters can not provide information for the chemical composition of dom and the concentration of different dom constituents which are essential for understanding the treatment processes with respect to dom removal mesquita et al 2017 liu et al 2019 in recent years a series of spectroscopy and mass spectrometry techniques have been increasingly applied for effective characterization and monitoring of dom in wastewater and drinking water treatments phong and hur 2016 heibati et al 2017 sgroi et al 2017 sweetman et al 2018 truong et al 2019 they provide valuable insights into the variable dom composition across different water bodies and are effective for tracking the changes of different dom constituents in a series of treatment processes ly and hur 2018 o driscoll et al 2018 chen et al 2020 xiao et al 2020 this review aims to 1 firstly compare the two popularly applied monitoring techniques for dom i e absorption and fluorescence spectroscopy vs ultra high resolution mass spectrometry 2 compare the dom composition between wastewater and drinking water based on these techniques and highlight the challenges associated with specific types of dom and 3 summarize the effects of different treatment processes on dom including traditional and advanced treatment processes to provide information for optimizing the treatment processes based on the comprehensive review the future applications of optical spectroscopy and mass spectrometry techniques in wastewater and drinking water treatments are finally suggested to our knowledge this is the first review to compile ultra high resolution mass spectrometry results for dom in wwtps and dwtps 2 comparison of optical spectroscopy and mass spectrometry for monitoring dom in wastewater and drinking water 2 1 absorption and fluorescence spectroscopy and their applications the commonly used indices from optical spectroscopy and mass spectrometry techniques are listed in table 1 with the calculation methods shown in the supplementary materials file uv vis absorption spectroscopy is a popular tool for effectively investigating the quantity and quality of light absorbing compounds in dom i e chromophoric colored dom cdom the absorbance and absorption coefficients at selected wavelengths e g uv254 and a 254 at 254 nm a 280 at 280 nm can be used to assess the content of cdom asmala et al 2013 derrien et al 2017 altmann et al 2016 the doc specific uv absorbance absorbance ratios at different wavelengths absorption spectral slope and slope ratio have been widely used as the indicators of the aromaticity and average molecular weight mw of dom weishaar et al 2003 mash et al 2004 helms et al 2008 one fraction of cdom can emit fluorescence after absorbing light which is termed fluorescent dom fdom fluorescence spectroscopy is a fast and non destructive technique for characterizing fdom which has high sensitivity and selectivity low costs and requires limited sample pre treatment yang et al 2015a zhou et al 2016a 2016b heibati et al 2017 in particular fluorescence can be monitored by sensors on line and in real time providing a valuable tool for monitoring the quality of effluents and the treatment process performance carstea et al 2018 the measurement of fluorescence may be affected by the inner filter effect thus the sample of high absorbance e g 0 05 at 1 cm pathlength requires dilution and or mathematical absorbance based correction kothawala et al 2013 carstea et al 2016 2020 the measured signals should be multiplied by the dilution factor if dilution is applied for high concentration samples and normalized to the quinine sulphate unit or the raman unit to compare different samples carstea et al 2018 fluorescence measurements may be affected by other factors such as the variations of ph temperature and the absorbance of inorganic ions at short wavelengths e g nitrate galinha et al 2011 carstea et al 2018 therefore the fluorescence signals from in situ sensors may require calibrations for robust quantification if the field conditions change notably although the signals without correction can be used for qualitative analysis carstea et al 2018 fluorescence excitation emission matrices eems provide a wealth of information on different fluorophores and the peaks on eems are traditionally analyzed i e the peak picking coble 2007 fluorescence regional integration fri is a quantitative technique to integrate the volume beneath different eems regions chen et al 2003 jacquin et al 2017 the peak picking and fri are both capable of tracking different fluorophores using the raw eems but they may be affected by the overlapping of fluorescent peaks the total volume of fluorescence can also be used for studying the changes of fdom in water treatments ziska et al 2016 although the diversity of different fluorophores is lost parallel factor analysis parafac is a powerful tool to decompose eems into several individual fluorescent components stedmon et al 2003 murphy et al 2008 2013 briefly a dataset of several tens to 1000 eems can be modeled with parafac which identifies 2 to 10 individual components based on diagnostic tools such as split half validation and core consistency test stedmon and bro 2008 in addition to these diagnostic tools the model is also validated by comparing the measured and the modeled eems and by the residual signals stedmon and bro 2008 murphy et al 2013 the identified components in different studies are traditionally compared based on their ex em maxima and an online comparison with the openfluor database based on the spectra over the whole wavelength range is available recently murphy et al 2014 the components identified by parafac mainly include several humic like and protein like components which are assigned by their excitation and emission wavelengths and are commonly compared with components in previous studies murphy et al 2014 the fluorescence intensity of each component indicates its level while the intensity ratio between different components and the percentage of each component in the total fluorescence is useful for characterizing the chemical composition of dom phong and hur 2016 moona et al 2018 li et al 2020 shi et al 2020 in addition several fluorescence indices can be calculated from eems to indicate the humic content and the source of dom such as humification index hix biological index bix and fluorescence index fi huguet et al 2009 derrien et al 2017 absorption and fluorescence spectroscopy techniques have been widely used in the studies of dom in wastewater and drinking water treatments the absorption coefficient and the fluorescence intensity of various parafac components have been correlated with the traditional water quality parameters such as bod cod and doc which demonstrate the potential of optical parameters for assessing organic matter related water quality for example the tyrosine like component correlates highly with bod r 2 0 709 and cod r 2 0 829 in wwtps goffin et al 2018 goffin et al 2019 in the textile wastewater the tryptophan like component shows strong correlations with doc and cod r 0 736 0 956 and 0 891 0 908 respectively cheng et al 2018 in drinking water watson et al 2018 found that doc correlated significantly with terrestrial and anthropogenic humic like components r 0 85 0 87 absorption and fluorescence spectroscopy techniques have notable advantages over traditional water quality parameters since they can provide a series of indices for the chemical composition of dom table 1 for example the specific uv absorbance at 254 nm suva254 is an index for the aromaticity and mw of dom which is important in determining the behavior of dom in wastewater and drinking water treatments watson et al 2018 fluorescence eem parafac is valuable for detecting individual fluorescent components and for tracking their different responses to wastewater and drinking water treatments cheng et al 2018 pan et al 2018 moona et al 2018 truong et al 2019 recent studies have shown different distributions of fluorescent components between the hydrophobic and hydrophilic fractions and between low and high mw fractions xiao et al 2016 found that the hydrophobic acid base fractions hoa hob in wastewater mainly contained fluorophores at lower excitation wavelengths ex 235 nm than the hydrophilic substance his especially for the emission wavelengths em of 300 360nm xiao et al 2018 revealed that the low mw and hydrophobic fractionsin wastewater contained more fluorophores at lower wavelengths em 280 than the high mw and hydrophilic substances em 400nm therefore the optical properties are also useful for evaluating the hydrophobic nature and mw of dom which can affect coagulation precipitation separation migration behavior and biological treatments xiao et al 2016 2018 2020 for example an et al 2017 found that the coagulation with fecl3 removed more effectively the protein like component and high mw molecules 1000 kda while al2 so4 3 removed more humic like components and low mw organics 2kda korak et al 2015 showed that the raw water optical properties suva254 and fluorescence ratios could be used to model the doc removal by coagulation in addition it is important to study the changes of fluorescence intensity with time which can reflect the variation of water quality and can be used for the adjustment of treatment processes in a dynamic and timely way singh et al 2015 carstea et al 2018 for example singh et al 2015 conducted online monitoring with a fluorescence sensor and found increasing fluorescence in reverse osmosis permeates with time due to underperforming and fouling of membranes they suggested that real time fluorescence monitoring was very sensitive to membrane performance singh et al 2015 carstea et al 2018 monitored the effluent of wwtp in real time using three portable fluorimeters for one month and identified the dependence of water quality on the flow rate and precipitation their results indicated the capability of online fluorescence measurement for monitoring the minor changes of effluent quality and the treatment performance carstea et al 2018 the application of optical techniques for probing specific organic compounds has also been explored recently for example sgroi et al 2017 tested the potential of fluorescence spectroscopy for assessing trace organic pollutants by mass spectrometry from wastewater the humic like components correlated strongly with the concentrations of sucralose sulfamethoxazole and carbamazepine while the tyrosine like components correlated with the concentrations of ibuprofen and caffeine sgroi et al 2017 fluorescence spectroscopy has the potential of monitoring pollutants in real time at a low cost in routine controls although a more robust control technique e g mass spectrometry should be available for accurately determining single compounds extracellular polymeric substances eps are the major constituents accounting for the irreversible membrane fouling that results in blockage and shorter life of membranes okamura et al 2009 wang et al 2010 sun et al 2016 applied fluorescence eem parafac to assess the composition of eps and identified the protein like humicacid like and fulvic acid like components contained in eps sweetman et al 2018 found a strong correlation between the fluorescence and harmful trihalomethanes thms in drinking water since dom is the precursor for thm formation during the chlorine treatment in membrane treatment processes the optical properties of dom have also been correlated with membrane fouling yu et al 2015 found that the tyrosine like component correlated significantly with the ultrafiltration uf membrane fouling index r 0 945 in wastewater treatment vera et al 2017 revealed that microbial byproducts and humic like components correlated with the fouling index of the uf membrane in drinking water treatment r 0 768 the correlations between fluorescent components and other parameters in wastewater and drinking water treatments are summarized in tables 2 3 2 2 mass spectrometry techniques and their applications mass spectrometry techniques are powerful tools for detecting individual organic compounds in wastewater and drinking water at the molecule level such as gas chromatography mass spectrometry gc ms liquid chromatography mass spectrometry lc ms and fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry ft icr ms they can provide the molecular formula and structural information of detected compounds with the intensity indicating the mass quantity of specific compounds gc ms allows accurate identification and characterization of non polar volatile and thermally stable compounds in complex matrices hao et al 2007 zhang et al 2016 2017 while lc ms is mainly used for the analysis of polar non volatile and acidic compounds oliveira et al 2015 he et al 2019 peng et al 2019 yang et al 2019 generally both techniques have high sensitivity low detection limits and promising analytical accuracy gumbi et al 2017 kumirska et al 2015 they have been applied widely for measuring organic pollutants such as pesticides pharmaceuticals hormones and personal care products etc berge et al 2014 gasperi et al 2014 mailler et al 2015 in particular lc ms especially lc triple quadrupole ms is very suitable for monitoring single compounds at a lower cost than ft icr ms ft icr ms is probably the most powerful tool for characterizing the dom structure and molecular characteristics which provides a resolution high enough to measure thousands of ions with high precision riedel and dittmar 2014 maizel and remucal 2017 ly and hur 2018 chen et al 2020 the formulas identified with ft icr ms are usually grouped into different classes based on the h c and o c ratio such as lipids proteins carbohydrates unsaturated hydrocarbons lignins carboxyl rich alicyclic compounds cram tannins and condensed aromatics riedel and dittmar 2014 chen et al 2020 the structural information can be deduced by calculating indices such as double bond equivalent dbe and modified aromaticity index aimod for assessing the unsaturation degree and aromaticity koch and dittmar 2006 even though gc ms and lc ms have been used to study specific organic compounds in wastewater and drinking water the preliminary separation may act too aggressively as a filter and exclude many compounds from identification this paper focuses on the applications of ft icr ms for the more comprehensive identification of dom molecules the dom samples are usually concentrated and cleaned up with solid phase extraction and reverse osmosis electrodialysis for ft icr ms analysis koch et al 2005 dittmar et al 2008 koprivnjak et al 2009 organic compounds are ionized and resolved by ft icr ms based on individual cyclotron frequencies which are dependent on the mass to charge ratios m z of the ions electrospray ionization esi atmospheric pressure chemical ionization apci and atmospheric pressure photoionization appi are three common ionization methods esi produces the largest number of species covering a larger chemical space m z 900 than apci and appi minor et al 2012 qi et al 2020 esi includes two ionization modes i e positive and negative ion esi which may show different ionization ability for complex compounds zuber et al 2017 therefore the extraction and ionization processes should be considered for comparing ft icr ms results in different studies it is currently difficult to apply this technique in real time monitoring which requires a lot of sample pre treatments and data analysis however it is probably the most powerful tool for studying the quality of dom and the signal intensity may be used as a semi quantitative parameter ft icr ms has been used to identify thousands of dom compounds in wwtp and dwtp a number much higher than those identified with gc ms and lc ms therefore it can provide more comprehensive information for the chemical composition of the highly complex dom mixture and the effects of treatment processes on different dom compounds this information can help optimize treatment processes for example maizel and remucal 2017 identified up to three thousands of molecular formulas in dom from a municipal wwtp which contained abundant heteroatoms n s p and cl and mainly included lipids proteins carbohydrates and lignins chen et al 2020 detected 6816 compounds in a mature landfill leachate sample which was dominated by highly unsaturated and phenolic compounds ft icr ms is also powerful for identifying specific classes of compounds from different water sources by comparing samples at the molecule level and for tracking the removal of organic compounds zhang et al 2019a for example headley et al 2015 combined ozone and ultrasonication to reduce total naphthenic acid fraction components by 89 in oil sand processed water and observed selective removals of the s and oxsy heteroatomic compounds and the decrease in the dbe value in addition ft icr ms can be used to identify dissolved metal organic complexes at low concentrations such as dissolved fe cu organic complexes in water samples waska et al 2015 furthermore the ft icr ms results can be correlated with the properties of dom such as hydrophilicity and toxicity for example derrien et al 2018 have reported higher h c and o c values for the hydrophobic acid and hydrophilic neutral base fractions and higher n s dbe and aimod values for the transphilic acid fraction zhang et al 2019b found that the acute toxicity correlated positively with polyphenols and highly unsaturated phenols 0 32 o c 0 63 and aliphatic compounds 0 22 o c 0 56 ft icr ms can also be used to reveal the variation of dom with time in water treatments to optimize the treatment conditions for example chen et al 2014 studied the variation of dom in heavy oil refining wastewater by advanced ozone treatment and found increases of h c and o c with time they also showed the transformation of major organic pollutants to refractory intermediates after 15 min and then into small molecules after 30 min indicating that the reaction time is an important factor for the ozone treatment chen et al 2014 headley et al 2015 examined the removal of ox species in oil sands processed water by coagulation after different treatment times lv et al 2017 tested the changes of different formulas in natural and anthropogenic dom with time under photo irradiation the results of dom changes with time can provide the basis for setting the optimal time of water treatments 3 comparison of dom composition between wastewater and drinking water spectroscopic analysis and mass spectrometry both provide valuable information on the chemical composition of dom in this section we compare the organic components between wastewater and drinking water identified by these techniques in particular the advanced eem parafac and ft icr ms and highlight the challenges associated with specific types of dom 3 1 comparison of fluorescent components between wastewater and drinking water generally fluorescence eem parafac shows that wastewater mainly contains protein like humic like and some untypical components depending on the sources of wastewater table 2 significant differences have been reported between municipal wastewater and industrial wastewater on the one hand the typical characteristic of dom in municipal wastewater is strong protein like fluorescence yang et al 2015a goffin et al 2019 li et al 2020 for example goffin et al 2019 collected 69 untreated wastewater samples in the suburban city of colombes france and identified three protein like components a tyrosine like component c1 a mixture of tyrosine and tryptophan like component c2 and a tryptophan like component c3 li et al 2020 found that two tryptophan like components c1 and c4 contributed to 60 75 of total fluorescence in 15 municipal wwtps of china the strong protein like fluorescence in municipal wastewater indicates biological treatments are effective processes since the protein like fluorophores are typically labile to biodegradation carstea et al 2016 however humic like components are more resistant to biodegradation and require further treatments such as adsorption coagulation membrane filtration and advanced oxidation technologies carstea et al 2016 ignatev et al 2019 zhang et al 2019a section 4 on the other hand industrial wastewater may have a complex dom composition from a variety of industrial production processes thus it has shown the presence of protein like humic like and untypical components for example yang et al 2015b identified six parafac components in the industrial wastewater from 57 facilities and found that five clusters of eems were dominated by a single parafac component in each cluster liu et al 2019 found that the textile wastewater from 12 wwtps mainly contained two protein like components and was different from river water in the parafac components zhou et al 2020 found that coking wastewater mainly contained humic acid like tyrosine like and tryptophan like components which were linked to hydrocarbons with benzene ring structures polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons soluble microbial byproducts and aromatic proteins identified with gc ms the above mentioned examples indicate the potential of eem parafac for detecting the pollution signal in receiving water bodies and for identifying the source of wastewater the complexity and diversity of dom in industrial wastewaters pose notable challenges for efficient treatments the removals of dom from industrial wastewaters by biological treatments are usually incomplete li et al 2015 hong et al 2016 therefore advanced treatment processes are needed to achieve further removal of residual dom and decoloration such as ozonation and fenton oxidation cheng et al 2018 dom in drinking water from natural aquatic systems mainly contains humic like components which can be further grouped into terrestrial and microbial humic like components table 3 for example zhou et al 2016a found three main humic like components in the drinking water from qiandao lake two terrestrial humic like c1 and c3 and one microbial humic likecomponent c6 o driscoll et al 2018 found a much higher fluorescence intensity for two humic like components c1 and c2 than for a protein like component c3 in dwtps of ireland drinking water sources may be affected by pollution and algal blooms which can result in elevated levels of protein like components sanchez et al 2013 zhou et al 2016a demonstrated the possibility of using the fluorescence intensity of the tryptophan like component as a monitoring signal for point source contamination in drinking water heibati et al 2017 suggested the applicability of tryptophan like fluorescence for the detection of small infiltration and sewage contamination in the distribution system of drinking water land use and rainfall are important parameters in shaping the quantity and composition of dom in drinking water lakes with humic like components prevailing in the upstream tributaries and protein like components dominating in the lake shi et al 2020 the abundant humic like components in drinking water sources indicate that conventional uf and sand filtration sf may be insufficient to remove this fraction for example xu et al 2019 found that only 15 16 and 19 20 of microbial humic like components were removed by uf and sf respectively thus it is important to improve the treatment by optimizing the traditional treatments e g adsorption and coagulation hussain et al 2019 and applying advanced processes e g reverse osmosis and nanofiltration kohler et al 2016 vera et al 2017 3 2 comparison of ft icr ms results between wastewater and drinking water the molecular characteristics of dom change notably in the wastewater by the different sources as measured based on ft icr ms analysis table 4 dom in municipal wastewater contains abundant cho chos and chon formulas due to the presence of a variety of compounds such as lipids lignin carbohydrates proteins detergents surfactants and pharmaceuticals maizel and remucal 2017 wang et al 2018a xu et al 2018 berg et al 2019 for example the effluent of a wwtp and the reclaimed water contains up to 1451 and 1293 chos formulas mainly due to the anthropogenic surfactants wang et al 2018a berg et al 2019 identified 3823 formulas in wastewater 43 and 31 of which were cho and chos formulas hundreds of chop and chocl formulas have also been detected in municipal wastewater in addition to abundant cho chos and chon formulas maizel and remucal 2017 the chocl formulas in raw wastewater may be derived from pharmaceuticals e g diclofenac and pesticides e g chlorobutanoic acid maizel and remucal 2017 therefore municipal wastewater is generally rich in heteroatoms containing formulas the cho and chon compounds are generally susceptible to biodegradation in the traditional biological treatments of municipal wastewater while the chos compounds are more resistant to biodegradation coagulation and ozonation yuan et al 2017 wang et al 2018a therefore it is of interest to test novel coagulants and effective processes to remove the sulfur containing compounds geng et al 2018 xu et al 2018 section 4 the molecular level analysis reveals that industrial wastewater contains a variety of organic compounds which is largely dependent on the type of industrial facility table 5 wang et al 2014 li et al 2015 ma et al 2016 zhang et al 2019a for example dom in the dry spun acrylic fiber wastewater shows thousands of peaks in ft icr ms spectra and contains abundant c17h14n30o4s c21h30n3o2 c20h38no c20h21so and c22h34n wang et al 2014 li et al 2015 identified up to 76 class species in refinery wastewater which contained abundant naphthenic acids and formulas containing n and s they also showed lower dbe and o c for refinery wastewater than for suwannee river natural organic matter li et al 2015 zhang et al 2019a showed that the wastewater from pharmaceutical and chemical manufacturing facilities contained mainly cho compounds and was rich in heteroatoms they also found a higher unsaturation degree lower mw and higher toxicity for the chemical industry wastewater than for municipal wastewater zhang et al 2019a zhang et al 2019b found that dom in coal liquefaction wastewater had high dbe low h c and abundant compounds with n and s 77 which represented lignins 73 6 and condensed aromatics 19 8 overall the ft icr ms analysis shows the high variability of dom composition in industrial wastewaters which is a critical challenge for optimizing the treatment scheme since the treatability of different organic compounds changes notably with different treatment processes zhang et al 2019a 2019b dom in drinking water is likely to contain abundant cho formulas due to the presence of abundant biopolymers such as lignins for example cortes francisco et al 2014 found much more cho formulas than chos and chon formulas 2452 2623 vs 452 602 and 1226 1243 in pretreated drinking water of a dwtp which accounted for a higher percentage of assigned formulas 58 vs 12 and 28 wang et al 2017a identified 2452 cho formulas in 20 source water samples from different cities of china while the chon and chos formulas had a very low abundance the composition of dom in drinking water is affected by environmental factors and human activities first the hydrological condition plays a critical role in affecting dom in drinking water mcdonough et al 2020 suggested that dom was degraded into low mw and low aromaticity constituents with low o c and high h c in semi arid environments with low rainfalls while it had higher mw and more aromatic constituents with high o c and low h c after high rainfall due to the leaching of terrestrial dom second algae and macrophytes are capable of releasing the dom from biomass origins into aquatic environments the algae derived dom contains more lipid compounds while macrophyte derived dom contains more lignin and tannin compounds liu et al 2020 finally human activities can provide nutrients to facilitate the aquatic production of dom in aquatic systems and introduce anthropogenic organic pollutants such as synthetic surfactants with more chos formulas melendez et al 2016 ye et al 2019 generally the abundant phenolic compounds in drinking water sources may result in membrane fouling during the filtration process and react with disinfectants to form harmful by products zhang et al 2018a li et al 2019 thus it is important to remove these compounds in drinking water treatments lv et al 2017 section 4 4 effects of treatment processes on dom in wastewater and drinking water 4 1 traditional treatment processes 4 1 1 wastewater treatments adsorption coagulation and biological treatments the effects of various treatment processes on dom are summarized in tables 2 5 adsorption process can remove both organic and inorganic pollutants that exist in wastewater by the effects of adsorption which is widely used for reducing dom using adsorbents such as activated carbon and iron minerals halim et al 2010 singh et al 2012 mailler et al 2016 found that the removal of uv254 doc and all fluorescent components by powder activated carbon was 10 25 5 10 and 10 30 respectively chen et al 2016 reported more effective removals of fulvic acid like and humic acid like components than a protein like component by hydrocalumite chloride ca al cl ldh wang et al 2019 found that the sorption capacity of dom by four iron minerals was in the order of ferrihydrite iron sulfide hematite pyrite their ft icr ms results further showed that ferrihydrite and iron sulfide preferentially adsorbed the highly unsaturated compounds rich in oxygen therefore the removal of bulk dom by adsorption is largely related to the dom composition the efficiency of adsorption is also dependent on ph equilibrium time and the properties and dose of the adsorbent for example duan et al 2016 used a new type of acid modified attapulgite al2 so4 3 adsorbent which effectively removed humic like and fulvic like components due to the high specific surface area and adsorption sites the highest removals of doc and uv254 were 64 7 and 33 7 under optimized conditions adsorbent concentration 0 5 mol l 1 and ph 5 duan et al 2016 coagulation is another traditional process to agglomerate colloids and small particles into larger particles for removing organic matter and inorganic pollutants from wastewater which has the benefits of simple operation relatively simple design and low energy consumption teh et al 2016 the main coagulants include al2 so4 3 fecl3 polyaluminum chloride pac an et al 2017 found that al2 so4 3 was more effective to remove humic like components while fecl3 and pac were more effective for the removal of the protein like component hu et al 2016 found higher removal of refractory hydrophobic humic like components than the hydrophilic protein like fraction by coagulation which led to increased bioavailability concerning the formulas identified with ft icr ms coagulations with al or fe sulfate can preferentially remove unsaturated h c 1 0 and oxidized o c 0 4 compounds containing carboxyl groups yuan et al 2017 in addition geng et al 2018 showed a new covalently bound inorganic organic hybrid coagulant cbhyc effectively removed highly unsaturated phenolic compounds and aliphatic compounds 0 3 o c 0 8 1 0 h c 2 0 and removed almost all chos compounds these studies also indicate the importance of the characteristics of dom in the coagulation process such as the major organic components hydrophobicity saturation degree and the ranges of o c and h c a series of biological treatments have also been widely used in the wastewater treatment to remove biologically degradable dom constituents by biodegradation such as anaerobic anoxic oxic a2o process sequencing batch reactor sbr and membrane bioreactor mbr mesfioui et al 2012 a2o process is commonly used in wastewater treatment plants pan et al 2018 examined the removal efficiency of dom by the a2o process which decreased doc and uv254 values by 92 0 and 93 7 respectively the removal efficiency of fluorescence components follows the order of tyrosine like 89 58 humic like 39 83 tryptophan like 36 89 microbial humic like 12 47 fulvic like component 6 37 structural properties of individual dom molecules such as the contents of oxygen and heteroatom also have significant influences on the treatment processes yuan et al 2017 revealed that less oxidized compounds o c 0 3 were more reactive to biodegradation li et al 2015 found that the ox and nx class species with fewer oxygen atoms could be easily removed while those with more oxygen that usually represented humic substances were resistant to the a2o process wang et al 2020a found that high mw m z 500 compounds with 40 50 carbon atoms and 15 20 dbe were biodegraded into medium mw compounds with 10 20 carbon atoms and 10 dbe after a2o process which was accompanied with the removal of unsaturated hydrocarbons and lipids sbr process can provide a high flow rate through parallel devices which exhibited effective removal of protein like components fang et al 2019 the removal of doc was up to 98 6 when sbr was combined with the forward osmosis which rejected biopolymers humics and building blocks linares et al 2016 zhang et al 2018a found removals of both proteins and carbohydrates by mbr a process that combines biological treatment and membrane separation they also observed that fulvic acid like and humic acid like fluorophores were retained effectively in the system zhang et al 2019b indicated that the mbr process was more efficient in removing the n containing compounds with higher unsaturated states in coal liquefaction wastewater the removal of dom can be further enhanced by combining mbr and other processes for example zhang et al 2019a found that uf removed 2615 molecular formulas from the mbr effluent and reverse osmosis ro was effective to separate almost all the remaining organic compounds generally it is difficult to completely remove organic compounds with complex structures by biological treatments however the increase of retention time in the anaerobic unit can enable the decomposition of long chain organic compounds wang et al 2020a some s containing compounds can be degraded by the addition of sulfur oxidation bacteria eom et al 2019 the combined utilization of biological treatment and other processes can promote the removal of dom such as biological uf ro and biological advanced oxidation processes zhang et al 2019a fang et al 2019 4 1 2 drinking water treatments adsorption coagulation filtration and disinfection adsorption is a common process to remove organic matter in drinking water treatment through the adsorption process of adsorbates different molecular size charge and hydrophobicity to adsorbent variable chemical properties and surface area which effectively removes dom itself and dbps precursors as well as trace organic pollutants chow et al 2009 moona et al 2018 moona et al 2018 showed 12 23 removal of doc by granular activated carbon gac filtration which eliminated microbial humic like protein like and terrestrial humic like components by about 20 40 another study showed removals of all parafac components by 53 70 after the gac filtration vera et al 2017 hussain et al 2018 found higher removals of humic acid like and fulvic acid like fluorophores 86 and 71 by a natural clay material fuller s earth while natural sands and modified quartz sands were more effective for removing protein like fluorophores ft icr ms has also been applied for studying the adsorption behavior of different molecules for example lv et al 2018 demonstrated that molecules with a high oxidation state and high aromaticity e g oxidized black carbon polyphenol like and tannic like compounds could form ligand exchange complexes with oh groups on the surface of hematite nanocrystal adsorbent andersson et al 2020 showed selective adsorption of compounds with mid to high h c 1 0 1 7 low molecular weight and low oxidation state by gac the adsorption process can be designed in the filtration mode to improve the performance and a small part of the adsorbents can be replaced with time to achieve the optimal conditions for example gac filtration can effectively adsorb small to intermediate sized humic like components with a high oxidation state and aromaticity leading to the increase of filtration effect and the attachment of microbes for biodegradation kim et al 2014 moona et al 2018 coagulation can aggregate colloidal particles and tiny suspended substances in the drinking water which is capable of removing dom e g humic like components and decreasing the formation of dbps watson et al 2018 revealed that 72 of humic like components and 44 of protein like components were removed by alum coagulation lin et al 2020 also found higher removals of humic like and fulvic like than protein like fluorophores by coagulation with pac which reduced the formation potentials of dbps thms and haa hussain et al 2019 used ticl3 as a novel coagulant for treating low alkalinity water with high doc and showed higher removal of doc by ticl3 71 than by alum 56 under the optimal dosage moreover the highest removals of fulvic like and humic like acids by ticl3 were 50 and 66 which were higher than those by alum 14 and 64 hussain et al 2019 chen et al 2018 also showed more effective removals of humic and fulvic acid like fluorophores than aromatic proteins and soluble microbial byproduct like fluorophores by a new covalently bound hybrid coagulant which removed doc and uv254 by up to 40 and 71 meanwhile ft icr ms analysis showed that dom molecules with oxidized carbon high o c and low h c were preferentially removed during the coagulation with pac al2 so4 3 and fecl3 zhang et al 2012 lavonen et al 2015 it is noteworthy that humic substances with high o c and low h c are important precursors of dbps thus the removal of these precursors by coagulation is critical for reducing the formation of dbps lin et al 2020 zhang et al 2018b filtration is an important process to remove ions bacteria colloids and particles through sieving effects which are influenced by transmembrane pressures and the aperture size of filter media gibert et al 2017 ro uf and nanofiltration nf are the main membrane filtration processes in drinking water treatment ro has the advantages of high purification efficiency but has high energy costs vera et al 2017 showed high rejections of three humic like components 98 99 one tryptophan like component 98 and one tyrosine like component 91 by ro while uf had a negligible effect on dom uf is efficient in removing suspended particles colloids and microorganisms and is usually combined with other processes to improve the overall removal of dom for example gibert et al 2017 removed doc by 32 46 using combined magnetic ion exchange resin miex and uf which was more efficient than uf alone 5 they also found that miex retained mainly fulvic and humic acid like components while it had a poor effect on microbial by products gibert et al 2017 nf combined with coagulation can remove more than 90 of doc and uv254 which is more effective for humic like than for protein like fluorophores 83 vs 66 kohler et al 2016 nf is capable of removing both reduced and oxidized components as revealed by ft icr ms analysis with higher removal efficiency for more hydrophilic and oxidized compounds with higher nitrogen and oxygen content cortes francisco et al 2014 slow sand filtration may be less efficient in removing the bulk dom than membrane filtration but sand filtration could preferentially remove protein like components and chemical formulas containing reduced carbonwith less double bonds and oxygen h c 1 32 o c 0 43 lavonen et al 2015 membrane fouling is an important challenge for the performance of membrane filtration and the removals of dom and the monitoring of fluorescence can be used to detect the membrane fouling and membrane performance shao et al 2014 vera et al 2017 disinfection is a critical process to ensure the safety of drinking water via the typical routes of chlorination and chloramine treatment which can oxidize organic compounds and affect dom mainly in two ways mansor et al 2020 on the one hand chlorination can effectively remove fulvic and humic acid like components but has less effect on protein like components moyo et al 2019 the ft icr ms results reveal that dom molecules with low o c are more reactive toward chlorine and decrease significantly after the treatments while the fraction of high o c increases slightly zhang et al 2012 on the other hand dom in drinking water can react with disinfectants to form dbps for example yang et al 2015c found a strong correlation between the formation potential of thms and a humic like component r 0 874 while that of n nitrosodimethylamine correlated significantly with a protein like component r 0 628 wang et al 2017a revealed that dom molecules with high o c and low h c oxygen rich molecules with high unsaturation degree contributed greatly to the formation of thms and haas during chlorination ft icr ms has also been used to characterize the structure of dbps dbps are mainly in the mass range of 300 500 da with o c of 0 3 0 7 and h c of 0 7 1 4 which are mainly related to unsaturated aromatic compounds andersson et al 2019 zhang et al 2018b wang et al 2016 meanwhile huang et al 2020 showed the production of assimilable organic carbon in disinfection such as the molecules with carboxylic and alcohol functionalities and chlorinated aromatics due to oxidation and chlorine substitution on aromatic molecules overall the formation of dbps is a major challenge for disinfection and affects drinking water safety an effective strategy is to remove the precursors e g unsaturated aromatic compounds before disinfection by water treatments such as coagulation nanofiltration ozonation and electrolysis bose et al 2007 bond et al 2010 chen et al 2019 4 2 advanced treatment processes in recent years researchers have also made notable progress in developing advanced treatment processes for removing refractory dom from wastewater and drinking water such as catalytic oxidation photocatalysis and electrolysis these processes can decompose dom into small biodegradable molecules effectively through catalytic decomposition photo degradation and electrochemical reactions respectively yang et al 2017 truong et al 2019 teng et al 2020 for example teng et al 2020 found that fenton oxidation effectively removed fulvic like 87 9 90 3 and humic like 96 5 97 9 components in landfill leachate wang et al 2017b discussed the transformation of dom in landfill leachate by ozone based oxidation processes o3 h2o2 o3 uv which significantly decreased fulvic like and humic like components and effectively degraded high mw components into low mw dom headley et al 2015 studied the change of molecular composition of dom in oil sand processed water by ozonation and ultrasonication the ft icr ms analysis showed a reduction in dbe for all ox and oxs1species indicating the loss of unsaturation and aromatic structures headley et al 2015 therefore ozonation and ultrasonication can be applied as the subsequent processes of adsorption and coagulation to increase the degradability and reduce the toxicity of some organic compounds e g naphthenic acid compounds headley et al 2015 chen et al 2014 combined activated carbon supported iron oxides and ozone to effectively remove dom in heavy oil refining wastewater they found a decreasing carbon number of molecules by chain scission and transformation of initial organic pollutants into small molecules which were accompanied by increased h c value chen et al 2014 the removal of dom by fenton oxidation is affected by the dosage of h2o2 the molar ratio of h2o2 fe ii ph and oxidation time deng et al 2006 teng et al 2020 generally ozone based catalytic oxidation has higher removals of dom than ozone oxidation alone and is suitable for treating wastewater rich in high mw unsaturated and aromatic compounds headley et al 2015 wang et al 2017b teng et al 2020 there is also notable progress in the photo degradation of dom with catalysts phong and hur 2016 showed more effective removal of both protein like and humic like components by uv irradiation with two common catalysts 97 tio2 and zno than without catalyst they found that fluorescent components were more sensitive to photodegradation than doc 26 5 74 3 and uv254 60 6 84 3 and the protein like component had the highest degradation rate the ft icr ms results showed that tio2 was an efficient catalyst to promote the photodegradation of compounds with high mw aromaticity and low o c lv et al 2017 the tio2 photocatalysis can remove 52 7 82 1 of cho and 47 3 84 8 of chon molecules and completely removes chons andchos molecules lv et al 2017 in addition novel photo catalysts have been developed to target the removal of dom for example truong et al 2019 photo degraded dom using zinc bismuth oxides graphitic carbon nitride zbo cn which showed effective removal of doc and uv254 by 53 74 and 65 88 respectively under low intensity visible light irradiation the removal efficiency of fluorescence components follows the order of terrestrial humic like humic like microbial humic like truong et al 2019 xu et al 2018 developed a linbo3 photocatalytic membrane for effectively removing dom by 60 70 from secondary effluents which was enhanced by the addition of formic acid which generated carboxyl anion radicals this process mainly removed cho formulas with o c of 0 1 0 5 chon compounds with o c 0 5 and chos compounds with o c of 0 3 0 6 and h c of 1 0 1 6 xu et al 2018 photocatalytic membranes can improve the removal of dom by combining photocatalysis and filtration xu et al 2018 it is noteworthy that the presence of dom can inhibit the photocatalytic degradation of specific pollutants such as para chlorobenzoic acid through absorbing the light and quenching reactive oxygen species ros maghsoodi et al 2019 overall the photocatalysis process is dependent on the irradiance wavelengths the catalysts and the property of organic components thus different catalysts are likely to be suitable for removing different types of dom phong and hur 2016 lv et al 2017 xu et al 2018 truong et al 2019 electrolysis based on various types of materials has also been applied for wastewater and drinking water treatments for example wang et al 2018b combined a novel iron carbon micro electrolysis icme with h2o2 for treating the printing and dyeing wastewater which removed 81 8 53 8 and 70 8 of fulvic acid soluble microbial metabolites and aromatic proteins respectively chen et al 2019 combined icme with an up flow biological aerated filter ubaf to remove dom and dbp precursors from drinking water the icme removed 15 6 of doc with decreases of fluorescent components the transformation of high mw hydrophobic organic matter into low mw hydrophilic components and the enhancement of the bio degradation of dom by subsequent ubaf chen et al 2019 wang et al 2020b showed strong degradation of lipid like and cram lignin like compounds in concentrated leachate using a combination of ruo2 ti electrolysis and ozonation they also found effective removals of cho compounds by 92 5 97 0 and 98 4 in electrolysis ozonation and electrolysis ozonation respectively which were higher than those of chn 1 5 42 7 and 71 6 and chns compounds 34 4 75 5 and 77 5 wang et al 2020b a major challenge is the blockage of the reaction bed by the sludge produced in electrolysis which can be reduced by the modified micro electrolysis filter with large surface area and porous structure zhang et al 2014 generally electrolysis can effectively improve the biodegradability by removing or transforming refractory organic compounds e g high mw and hydrophobic fractions and cram lignin like compounds thus it can be used in combination with subsequent biological treatments yang et al 2017 zhang et al 2018c chen et al 2019 5 summary limitations and research perspectives in summary spectroscopic and mass spectrometry analyses reveal a lot of chemical diversity in the composition of dom in wastewater and drinking water fig 1 municipal wastewater is generally characterized by strong protein like fluorescence and contains abundant cho chos and chon formulas that are related to lipids lignins carbohydrates proteins detergents surfactants and pharmaceuticals the dom composition in industrial wastewater varies greatly depending on the industry category which contains diverse fluorescent components protein like humic like and untypical components abundant cho formulas and variable heteroatomic molecules drinking water contains mainly humic like fluorescent components and cho molecules although the protein like fluorescence and anthropogenic compounds e g chos molecules can be elevated by contamination and autochthonous production the high complexity and variability of dom composition is a critical challenge for wastewater and drinking water treatments both traditional and advanced treatment processes show variable effects on different constituents in the complex dom fig 2 adsorption and coagulation generally preferentially remove humic like fluorescent components e g by ca al cl ldh gac natural clay material and alum but sands and fecl3 show higher removals of protein like components adsorption with iron minerals and coagulation with alum and fecl3 are more effective for removing unsaturated and oxidized molecules resulting in higher h c and lower o c in contrast gac can selectively remove less oxidized compounds with mid to high h c biological treatments preferentially remove protein like fluorescent components less oxidized formulas and unsaturated hydrocarbons and lipids which increase h c and o c values ro can reject almost all organic components while uf has a limited effect on dom nf is more effective for removing humic like fluorescent components and results in higher h c and lower o c while sand filtration removes more protein like components and results in lower h c and higher o c disinfection with chlorine preferentially removes humic like fluorescent components and dom molecules with low o c advanced treatments including catalytic oxidation photocatalysis and electrolysis are effective for removing humic like fluorescent components and unsaturated aromatic formulas resulting in elevated h c and o c therefore the information on dom composition and its removal is key to optimize the treatment processes while spectroscopic and mass spectrometry analyses are both valuable tools for monitoring dom in water treatments and for system optimization the following limitations are noted fluorescence spectroscopy covers only fluorescent compounds but not all dom compounds e g polysaccharides and noncolored aliphatics although it can provide valuable information for the dom composition and the treatment performance the online monitoring of fluorescence is challenged by variable environmental conditions e g ph temperature particles and inorganic ions and inner filter effect for high concentration samples ft icr ms analysis is in part limited by the dom extraction and ionization processes in addition few studies have examined the relation between dom and acute toxicity even though the information is essential for assessing the quality and safety of wastewater and drinking water traditional treatment processes have been widely used in wastewater and drinking water while advanced treatment processes show less practical applications due to the high cost and low treatment scale although high removal efficiency of dom has been reported regarding the research perspectives we identified the followings the combined use of fluorescence spectroscopy and other techniques e g ft icr ms can provide more comprehensive information on the chemical composition of the complex dom mixture and the behavior of dom in water treatments this information is critical for optimizing the treatment processes in addition each fluorescent component may consist of many compounds and ft icr ms analysis can provide more detailed information for the compounds linked with fluorescent components fluorescence spectroscopy can be used for pre screening the samples before the expensive ft icr ms analysis testing the relationships of fluorescence with bulk parameters e g toc doc bod cod and specific pollutants can also help to expand the application of fluorescence spectroscopy the online monitoring of fluorescence is valuable for detecting the real time water quality and treatment performance and further developing tools for the correction of field conditions can help to achieve accurate quantification future studies are required to develop effective standard extraction and ionization methods for ft icr ms in particular for studying the complex and highly variable dom in wastewater and drinking water treatments in addition ft icr ms can be interpreted for understanding microbial communities and the activities through gene analysis which is important for elucidating the mechanisms underlying the removal of dom in biological treatments the chemical diversity of dom in drinking water municipal wastewater and different types of industrial wastewater highlight the potential applicability of dom tools for detecting anthropogenic pollution and identifying the source in a polluted drinking water source it is important to identify pollutants by mass spectrometry e g gc ms and lc ms for tracking the pollution and to study the fate and effects of pollutants in dwtps ft icr ms analysis of a few typical samples would provide more comprehensive information for the dom molecules fluorescence spectroscopy can be used to identify and monitor online the dom components associated with pollutants at a lower cost in routine controls although a more robust control technique should be available to ensure effective treatments and the safety of drinking water the relation between dom and acute toxicity is essential for assessing the quality and safety of wastewater and drinking water the direct effects of harmful organic compounds in dom and the indirect effects through the interaction of dom with heavy metals and organic pollutants on acute toxicity are both worth testing eem parafac and ft icr ms can provide insights into both the removal of dom from raw water and the production of dom constituents during water treatments e g soluble microbial byproducts and bio or photo degradation intermediates the results are important for revealing the pathway and mechanism of dom transformation during water treatments which would provide the basis for optimizing the treatment schemes in wwtp and dwtp future studies to combine traditional and advanced treatments are also important to achieve the best treatment effect at a low or reasonable economic cost 6 conclusion absorption spectroscopy and fluorescence eem parafac provide a series of indices for characterizing dom and ft icr ms is a powerful tool for studying dom at the molecular level both types of monitoring techniques have been widely used in studying wastewater and drinking water treatments the analysis with two advanced tools fluorescence eem parafac and ft icr ms revealed that the composition of dom is significantly different among municipal wastewater industrial wastewater and drinking water the high complexity and variability of dom composition is a critical challenge for efficient treatments the removal efficiency of dom in wastewater and drinking water treatment changes notably with both treatment processes and dom constituents the information on dom composition and its removal is key to optimize the treatment processes advanced treatment processes and novel materials are increasingly applied for enhancing the removal of dom from wastewater and drinking water thus spectroscopic analysis and ft icr ms will continue to play important roles in revealing the chemical composition of dom in representative water bodies and tracking the responses of different dom constituents to water treatments the results are critical for further optimizing the treatment

17385,dissolved organic matter dom plays a critical role in determining the quality of wastewater and the safety of drinking water this is the first review to compare two types of popular dom monitoring techniques including absorption spectroscopy and fluorescence excitation emission matrices eems coupled with parallel factor analysis parafac vs fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry ft icr ms for the applications in wastewater and drinking water treatments the optical techniques provide a series of indices for tracking the quantity and quality of chromophoric and fluorescent dom while ft icr ms is capable of identifying thousands of dom compounds in wastewater and drinking water at the molecule level both types of monitoring techniques are increasingly used in studying dom in wastewater and drinking water treatments they provide valuable insights into the variability of dom composition in wastewater and drinking water the complexity and diversity of dom highlight the challenges for effective water treatments different effects of various treatment processes on dom are also assessed which indicates that the information on dom composition and its removal is key to optimize the treatment processes considering notable progress in advanced treatment processes and novel materials for removing dom it is important to continuously utilize these powerful monitoring tools for assessing the responses of different dom constituents to a series of treatment processes which can achieve an effective removal of dom and the quality of treated water graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords dom wastewater drinking water eem parafac ft icr ms 1 introduction dissolved organic matter dom is ubiquitous in natural aquatic environments and engineered systems and is a complex mixture of different compounds such as carbohydrates polysaccharides amino acids peptides proteins lipids humic substances and anthropogenic organic pollutants koch and dittmar 2006 yang et al 2015a wang et al 2018a berg et al 2019 the concentration and composition of dom change greatly in different water bodies due to different sources e g terrestrial algal and anthropogenic and transformation history e g particle adsorption photodegradation and microbial degradation heibati et al 2017 lee et al 2019 zhang et al 2019a mcdonough et al 2020 shi et al 2020 in wastewater and drinking water treatment plants wwtp and dwtp this is further complicated by dissimilar responses of different organic compounds to a series of treatment processes maizel and remucal 2017 li et al 2020 the quantity and quality of dom in treated water are critical for the utilization of water resources and for ensuring their water quality shonet al 2006 phong and hur 2016 zhang et al 2019b therefore it is important to identify different dom constituents and monitor their changes in wwtps and dwtps which helps develop effective treatment processes and evaluate the quality of treated water traditionally dom in wastewater and drinking water is tested by chemical and biochemical parameters such as chemical oxygen demand cod biochemical oxygen demand bod dissolved organic carbon doc and total organic carbon toc however those simple bulk parameters can not provide information for the chemical composition of dom and the concentration of different dom constituents which are essential for understanding the treatment processes with respect to dom removal mesquita et al 2017 liu et al 2019 in recent years a series of spectroscopy and mass spectrometry techniques have been increasingly applied for effective characterization and monitoring of dom in wastewater and drinking water treatments phong and hur 2016 heibati et al 2017 sgroi et al 2017 sweetman et al 2018 truong et al 2019 they provide valuable insights into the variable dom composition across different water bodies and are effective for tracking the changes of different dom constituents in a series of treatment processes ly and hur 2018 o driscoll et al 2018 chen et al 2020 xiao et al 2020 this review aims to 1 firstly compare the two popularly applied monitoring techniques for dom i e absorption and fluorescence spectroscopy vs ultra high resolution mass spectrometry 2 compare the dom composition between wastewater and drinking water based on these techniques and highlight the challenges associated with specific types of dom and 3 summarize the effects of different treatment processes on dom including traditional and advanced treatment processes to provide information for optimizing the treatment processes based on the comprehensive review the future applications of optical spectroscopy and mass spectrometry techniques in wastewater and drinking water treatments are finally suggested to our knowledge this is the first review to compile ultra high resolution mass spectrometry results for dom in wwtps and dwtps 2 comparison of optical spectroscopy and mass spectrometry for monitoring dom in wastewater and drinking water 2 1 absorption and fluorescence spectroscopy and their applications the commonly used indices from optical spectroscopy and mass spectrometry techniques are listed in table 1 with the calculation methods shown in the supplementary materials file uv vis absorption spectroscopy is a popular tool for effectively investigating the quantity and quality of light absorbing compounds in dom i e chromophoric colored dom cdom the absorbance and absorption coefficients at selected wavelengths e g uv254 and a 254 at 254 nm a 280 at 280 nm can be used to assess the content of cdom asmala et al 2013 derrien et al 2017 altmann et al 2016 the doc specific uv absorbance absorbance ratios at different wavelengths absorption spectral slope and slope ratio have been widely used as the indicators of the aromaticity and average molecular weight mw of dom weishaar et al 2003 mash et al 2004 helms et al 2008 one fraction of cdom can emit fluorescence after absorbing light which is termed fluorescent dom fdom fluorescence spectroscopy is a fast and non destructive technique for characterizing fdom which has high sensitivity and selectivity low costs and requires limited sample pre treatment yang et al 2015a zhou et al 2016a 2016b heibati et al 2017 in particular fluorescence can be monitored by sensors on line and in real time providing a valuable tool for monitoring the quality of effluents and the treatment process performance carstea et al 2018 the measurement of fluorescence may be affected by the inner filter effect thus the sample of high absorbance e g 0 05 at 1 cm pathlength requires dilution and or mathematical absorbance based correction kothawala et al 2013 carstea et al 2016 2020 the measured signals should be multiplied by the dilution factor if dilution is applied for high concentration samples and normalized to the quinine sulphate unit or the raman unit to compare different samples carstea et al 2018 fluorescence measurements may be affected by other factors such as the variations of ph temperature and the absorbance of inorganic ions at short wavelengths e g nitrate galinha et al 2011 carstea et al 2018 therefore the fluorescence signals from in situ sensors may require calibrations for robust quantification if the field conditions change notably although the signals without correction can be used for qualitative analysis carstea et al 2018 fluorescence excitation emission matrices eems provide a wealth of information on different fluorophores and the peaks on eems are traditionally analyzed i e the peak picking coble 2007 fluorescence regional integration fri is a quantitative technique to integrate the volume beneath different eems regions chen et al 2003 jacquin et al 2017 the peak picking and fri are both capable of tracking different fluorophores using the raw eems but they may be affected by the overlapping of fluorescent peaks the total volume of fluorescence can also be used for studying the changes of fdom in water treatments ziska et al 2016 although the diversity of different fluorophores is lost parallel factor analysis parafac is a powerful tool to decompose eems into several individual fluorescent components stedmon et al 2003 murphy et al 2008 2013 briefly a dataset of several tens to 1000 eems can be modeled with parafac which identifies 2 to 10 individual components based on diagnostic tools such as split half validation and core consistency test stedmon and bro 2008 in addition to these diagnostic tools the model is also validated by comparing the measured and the modeled eems and by the residual signals stedmon and bro 2008 murphy et al 2013 the identified components in different studies are traditionally compared based on their ex em maxima and an online comparison with the openfluor database based on the spectra over the whole wavelength range is available recently murphy et al 2014 the components identified by parafac mainly include several humic like and protein like components which are assigned by their excitation and emission wavelengths and are commonly compared with components in previous studies murphy et al 2014 the fluorescence intensity of each component indicates its level while the intensity ratio between different components and the percentage of each component in the total fluorescence is useful for characterizing the chemical composition of dom phong and hur 2016 moona et al 2018 li et al 2020 shi et al 2020 in addition several fluorescence indices can be calculated from eems to indicate the humic content and the source of dom such as humification index hix biological index bix and fluorescence index fi huguet et al 2009 derrien et al 2017 absorption and fluorescence spectroscopy techniques have been widely used in the studies of dom in wastewater and drinking water treatments the absorption coefficient and the fluorescence intensity of various parafac components have been correlated with the traditional water quality parameters such as bod cod and doc which demonstrate the potential of optical parameters for assessing organic matter related water quality for example the tyrosine like component correlates highly with bod r 2 0 709 and cod r 2 0 829 in wwtps goffin et al 2018 goffin et al 2019 in the textile wastewater the tryptophan like component shows strong correlations with doc and cod r 0 736 0 956 and 0 891 0 908 respectively cheng et al 2018 in drinking water watson et al 2018 found that doc correlated significantly with terrestrial and anthropogenic humic like components r 0 85 0 87 absorption and fluorescence spectroscopy techniques have notable advantages over traditional water quality parameters since they can provide a series of indices for the chemical composition of dom table 1 for example the specific uv absorbance at 254 nm suva254 is an index for the aromaticity and mw of dom which is important in determining the behavior of dom in wastewater and drinking water treatments watson et al 2018 fluorescence eem parafac is valuable for detecting individual fluorescent components and for tracking their different responses to wastewater and drinking water treatments cheng et al 2018 pan et al 2018 moona et al 2018 truong et al 2019 recent studies have shown different distributions of fluorescent components between the hydrophobic and hydrophilic fractions and between low and high mw fractions xiao et al 2016 found that the hydrophobic acid base fractions hoa hob in wastewater mainly contained fluorophores at lower excitation wavelengths ex 235 nm than the hydrophilic substance his especially for the emission wavelengths em of 300 360nm xiao et al 2018 revealed that the low mw and hydrophobic fractionsin wastewater contained more fluorophores at lower wavelengths em 280 than the high mw and hydrophilic substances em 400nm therefore the optical properties are also useful for evaluating the hydrophobic nature and mw of dom which can affect coagulation precipitation separation migration behavior and biological treatments xiao et al 2016 2018 2020 for example an et al 2017 found that the coagulation with fecl3 removed more effectively the protein like component and high mw molecules 1000 kda while al2 so4 3 removed more humic like components and low mw organics 2kda korak et al 2015 showed that the raw water optical properties suva254 and fluorescence ratios could be used to model the doc removal by coagulation in addition it is important to study the changes of fluorescence intensity with time which can reflect the variation of water quality and can be used for the adjustment of treatment processes in a dynamic and timely way singh et al 2015 carstea et al 2018 for example singh et al 2015 conducted online monitoring with a fluorescence sensor and found increasing fluorescence in reverse osmosis permeates with time due to underperforming and fouling of membranes they suggested that real time fluorescence monitoring was very sensitive to membrane performance singh et al 2015 carstea et al 2018 monitored the effluent of wwtp in real time using three portable fluorimeters for one month and identified the dependence of water quality on the flow rate and precipitation their results indicated the capability of online fluorescence measurement for monitoring the minor changes of effluent quality and the treatment performance carstea et al 2018 the application of optical techniques for probing specific organic compounds has also been explored recently for example sgroi et al 2017 tested the potential of fluorescence spectroscopy for assessing trace organic pollutants by mass spectrometry from wastewater the humic like components correlated strongly with the concentrations of sucralose sulfamethoxazole and carbamazepine while the tyrosine like components correlated with the concentrations of ibuprofen and caffeine sgroi et al 2017 fluorescence spectroscopy has the potential of monitoring pollutants in real time at a low cost in routine controls although a more robust control technique e g mass spectrometry should be available for accurately determining single compounds extracellular polymeric substances eps are the major constituents accounting for the irreversible membrane fouling that results in blockage and shorter life of membranes okamura et al 2009 wang et al 2010 sun et al 2016 applied fluorescence eem parafac to assess the composition of eps and identified the protein like humicacid like and fulvic acid like components contained in eps sweetman et al 2018 found a strong correlation between the fluorescence and harmful trihalomethanes thms in drinking water since dom is the precursor for thm formation during the chlorine treatment in membrane treatment processes the optical properties of dom have also been correlated with membrane fouling yu et al 2015 found that the tyrosine like component correlated significantly with the ultrafiltration uf membrane fouling index r 0 945 in wastewater treatment vera et al 2017 revealed that microbial byproducts and humic like components correlated with the fouling index of the uf membrane in drinking water treatment r 0 768 the correlations between fluorescent components and other parameters in wastewater and drinking water treatments are summarized in tables 2 3 2 2 mass spectrometry techniques and their applications mass spectrometry techniques are powerful tools for detecting individual organic compounds in wastewater and drinking water at the molecule level such as gas chromatography mass spectrometry gc ms liquid chromatography mass spectrometry lc ms and fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry ft icr ms they can provide the molecular formula and structural information of detected compounds with the intensity indicating the mass quantity of specific compounds gc ms allows accurate identification and characterization of non polar volatile and thermally stable compounds in complex matrices hao et al 2007 zhang et al 2016 2017 while lc ms is mainly used for the analysis of polar non volatile and acidic compounds oliveira et al 2015 he et al 2019 peng et al 2019 yang et al 2019 generally both techniques have high sensitivity low detection limits and promising analytical accuracy gumbi et al 2017 kumirska et al 2015 they have been applied widely for measuring organic pollutants such as pesticides pharmaceuticals hormones and personal care products etc berge et al 2014 gasperi et al 2014 mailler et al 2015 in particular lc ms especially lc triple quadrupole ms is very suitable for monitoring single compounds at a lower cost than ft icr ms ft icr ms is probably the most powerful tool for characterizing the dom structure and molecular characteristics which provides a resolution high enough to measure thousands of ions with high precision riedel and dittmar 2014 maizel and remucal 2017 ly and hur 2018 chen et al 2020 the formulas identified with ft icr ms are usually grouped into different classes based on the h c and o c ratio such as lipids proteins carbohydrates unsaturated hydrocarbons lignins carboxyl rich alicyclic compounds cram tannins and condensed aromatics riedel and dittmar 2014 chen et al 2020 the structural information can be deduced by calculating indices such as double bond equivalent dbe and modified aromaticity index aimod for assessing the unsaturation degree and aromaticity koch and dittmar 2006 even though gc ms and lc ms have been used to study specific organic compounds in wastewater and drinking water the preliminary separation may act too aggressively as a filter and exclude many compounds from identification this paper focuses on the applications of ft icr ms for the more comprehensive identification of dom molecules the dom samples are usually concentrated and cleaned up with solid phase extraction and reverse osmosis electrodialysis for ft icr ms analysis koch et al 2005 dittmar et al 2008 koprivnjak et al 2009 organic compounds are ionized and resolved by ft icr ms based on individual cyclotron frequencies which are dependent on the mass to charge ratios m z of the ions electrospray ionization esi atmospheric pressure chemical ionization apci and atmospheric pressure photoionization appi are three common ionization methods esi produces the largest number of species covering a larger chemical space m z 900 than apci and appi minor et al 2012 qi et al 2020 esi includes two ionization modes i e positive and negative ion esi which may show different ionization ability for complex compounds zuber et al 2017 therefore the extraction and ionization processes should be considered for comparing ft icr ms results in different studies it is currently difficult to apply this technique in real time monitoring which requires a lot of sample pre treatments and data analysis however it is probably the most powerful tool for studying the quality of dom and the signal intensity may be used as a semi quantitative parameter ft icr ms has been used to identify thousands of dom compounds in wwtp and dwtp a number much higher than those identified with gc ms and lc ms therefore it can provide more comprehensive information for the chemical composition of the highly complex dom mixture and the effects of treatment processes on different dom compounds this information can help optimize treatment processes for example maizel and remucal 2017 identified up to three thousands of molecular formulas in dom from a municipal wwtp which contained abundant heteroatoms n s p and cl and mainly included lipids proteins carbohydrates and lignins chen et al 2020 detected 6816 compounds in a mature landfill leachate sample which was dominated by highly unsaturated and phenolic compounds ft icr ms is also powerful for identifying specific classes of compounds from different water sources by comparing samples at the molecule level and for tracking the removal of organic compounds zhang et al 2019a for example headley et al 2015 combined ozone and ultrasonication to reduce total naphthenic acid fraction components by 89 in oil sand processed water and observed selective removals of the s and oxsy heteroatomic compounds and the decrease in the dbe value in addition ft icr ms can be used to identify dissolved metal organic complexes at low concentrations such as dissolved fe cu organic complexes in water samples waska et al 2015 furthermore the ft icr ms results can be correlated with the properties of dom such as hydrophilicity and toxicity for example derrien et al 2018 have reported higher h c and o c values for the hydrophobic acid and hydrophilic neutral base fractions and higher n s dbe and aimod values for the transphilic acid fraction zhang et al 2019b found that the acute toxicity correlated positively with polyphenols and highly unsaturated phenols 0 32 o c 0 63 and aliphatic compounds 0 22 o c 0 56 ft icr ms can also be used to reveal the variation of dom with time in water treatments to optimize the treatment conditions for example chen et al 2014 studied the variation of dom in heavy oil refining wastewater by advanced ozone treatment and found increases of h c and o c with time they also showed the transformation of major organic pollutants to refractory intermediates after 15 min and then into small molecules after 30 min indicating that the reaction time is an important factor for the ozone treatment chen et al 2014 headley et al 2015 examined the removal of ox species in oil sands processed water by coagulation after different treatment times lv et al 2017 tested the changes of different formulas in natural and anthropogenic dom with time under photo irradiation the results of dom changes with time can provide the basis for setting the optimal time of water treatments 3 comparison of dom composition between wastewater and drinking water spectroscopic analysis and mass spectrometry both provide valuable information on the chemical composition of dom in this section we compare the organic components between wastewater and drinking water identified by these techniques in particular the advanced eem parafac and ft icr ms and highlight the challenges associated with specific types of dom 3 1 comparison of fluorescent components between wastewater and drinking water generally fluorescence eem parafac shows that wastewater mainly contains protein like humic like and some untypical components depending on the sources of wastewater table 2 significant differences have been reported between municipal wastewater and industrial wastewater on the one hand the typical characteristic of dom in municipal wastewater is strong protein like fluorescence yang et al 2015a goffin et al 2019 li et al 2020 for example goffin et al 2019 collected 69 untreated wastewater samples in the suburban city of colombes france and identified three protein like components a tyrosine like component c1 a mixture of tyrosine and tryptophan like component c2 and a tryptophan like component c3 li et al 2020 found that two tryptophan like components c1 and c4 contributed to 60 75 of total fluorescence in 15 municipal wwtps of china the strong protein like fluorescence in municipal wastewater indicates biological treatments are effective processes since the protein like fluorophores are typically labile to biodegradation carstea et al 2016 however humic like components are more resistant to biodegradation and require further treatments such as adsorption coagulation membrane filtration and advanced oxidation technologies carstea et al 2016 ignatev et al 2019 zhang et al 2019a section 4 on the other hand industrial wastewater may have a complex dom composition from a variety of industrial production processes thus it has shown the presence of protein like humic like and untypical components for example yang et al 2015b identified six parafac components in the industrial wastewater from 57 facilities and found that five clusters of eems were dominated by a single parafac component in each cluster liu et al 2019 found that the textile wastewater from 12 wwtps mainly contained two protein like components and was different from river water in the parafac components zhou et al 2020 found that coking wastewater mainly contained humic acid like tyrosine like and tryptophan like components which were linked to hydrocarbons with benzene ring structures polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons soluble microbial byproducts and aromatic proteins identified with gc ms the above mentioned examples indicate the potential of eem parafac for detecting the pollution signal in receiving water bodies and for identifying the source of wastewater the complexity and diversity of dom in industrial wastewaters pose notable challenges for efficient treatments the removals of dom from industrial wastewaters by biological treatments are usually incomplete li et al 2015 hong et al 2016 therefore advanced treatment processes are needed to achieve further removal of residual dom and decoloration such as ozonation and fenton oxidation cheng et al 2018 dom in drinking water from natural aquatic systems mainly contains humic like components which can be further grouped into terrestrial and microbial humic like components table 3 for example zhou et al 2016a found three main humic like components in the drinking water from qiandao lake two terrestrial humic like c1 and c3 and one microbial humic likecomponent c6 o driscoll et al 2018 found a much higher fluorescence intensity for two humic like components c1 and c2 than for a protein like component c3 in dwtps of ireland drinking water sources may be affected by pollution and algal blooms which can result in elevated levels of protein like components sanchez et al 2013 zhou et al 2016a demonstrated the possibility of using the fluorescence intensity of the tryptophan like component as a monitoring signal for point source contamination in drinking water heibati et al 2017 suggested the applicability of tryptophan like fluorescence for the detection of small infiltration and sewage contamination in the distribution system of drinking water land use and rainfall are important parameters in shaping the quantity and composition of dom in drinking water lakes with humic like components prevailing in the upstream tributaries and protein like components dominating in the lake shi et al 2020 the abundant humic like components in drinking water sources indicate that conventional uf and sand filtration sf may be insufficient to remove this fraction for example xu et al 2019 found that only 15 16 and 19 20 of microbial humic like components were removed by uf and sf respectively thus it is important to improve the treatment by optimizing the traditional treatments e g adsorption and coagulation hussain et al 2019 and applying advanced processes e g reverse osmosis and nanofiltration kohler et al 2016 vera et al 2017 3 2 comparison of ft icr ms results between wastewater and drinking water the molecular characteristics of dom change notably in the wastewater by the different sources as measured based on ft icr ms analysis table 4 dom in municipal wastewater contains abundant cho chos and chon formulas due to the presence of a variety of compounds such as lipids lignin carbohydrates proteins detergents surfactants and pharmaceuticals maizel and remucal 2017 wang et al 2018a xu et al 2018 berg et al 2019 for example the effluent of a wwtp and the reclaimed water contains up to 1451 and 1293 chos formulas mainly due to the anthropogenic surfactants wang et al 2018a berg et al 2019 identified 3823 formulas in wastewater 43 and 31 of which were cho and chos formulas hundreds of chop and chocl formulas have also been detected in municipal wastewater in addition to abundant cho chos and chon formulas maizel and remucal 2017 the chocl formulas in raw wastewater may be derived from pharmaceuticals e g diclofenac and pesticides e g chlorobutanoic acid maizel and remucal 2017 therefore municipal wastewater is generally rich in heteroatoms containing formulas the cho and chon compounds are generally susceptible to biodegradation in the traditional biological treatments of municipal wastewater while the chos compounds are more resistant to biodegradation coagulation and ozonation yuan et al 2017 wang et al 2018a therefore it is of interest to test novel coagulants and effective processes to remove the sulfur containing compounds geng et al 2018 xu et al 2018 section 4 the molecular level analysis reveals that industrial wastewater contains a variety of organic compounds which is largely dependent on the type of industrial facility table 5 wang et al 2014 li et al 2015 ma et al 2016 zhang et al 2019a for example dom in the dry spun acrylic fiber wastewater shows thousands of peaks in ft icr ms spectra and contains abundant c17h14n30o4s c21h30n3o2 c20h38no c20h21so and c22h34n wang et al 2014 li et al 2015 identified up to 76 class species in refinery wastewater which contained abundant naphthenic acids and formulas containing n and s they also showed lower dbe and o c for refinery wastewater than for suwannee river natural organic matter li et al 2015 zhang et al 2019a showed that the wastewater from pharmaceutical and chemical manufacturing facilities contained mainly cho compounds and was rich in heteroatoms they also found a higher unsaturation degree lower mw and higher toxicity for the chemical industry wastewater than for municipal wastewater zhang et al 2019a zhang et al 2019b found that dom in coal liquefaction wastewater had high dbe low h c and abundant compounds with n and s 77 which represented lignins 73 6 and condensed aromatics 19 8 overall the ft icr ms analysis shows the high variability of dom composition in industrial wastewaters which is a critical challenge for optimizing the treatment scheme since the treatability of different organic compounds changes notably with different treatment processes zhang et al 2019a 2019b dom in drinking water is likely to contain abundant cho formulas due to the presence of abundant biopolymers such as lignins for example cortes francisco et al 2014 found much more cho formulas than chos and chon formulas 2452 2623 vs 452 602 and 1226 1243 in pretreated drinking water of a dwtp which accounted for a higher percentage of assigned formulas 58 vs 12 and 28 wang et al 2017a identified 2452 cho formulas in 20 source water samples from different cities of china while the chon and chos formulas had a very low abundance the composition of dom in drinking water is affected by environmental factors and human activities first the hydrological condition plays a critical role in affecting dom in drinking water mcdonough et al 2020 suggested that dom was degraded into low mw and low aromaticity constituents with low o c and high h c in semi arid environments with low rainfalls while it had higher mw and more aromatic constituents with high o c and low h c after high rainfall due to the leaching of terrestrial dom second algae and macrophytes are capable of releasing the dom from biomass origins into aquatic environments the algae derived dom contains more lipid compounds while macrophyte derived dom contains more lignin and tannin compounds liu et al 2020 finally human activities can provide nutrients to facilitate the aquatic production of dom in aquatic systems and introduce anthropogenic organic pollutants such as synthetic surfactants with more chos formulas melendez et al 2016 ye et al 2019 generally the abundant phenolic compounds in drinking water sources may result in membrane fouling during the filtration process and react with disinfectants to form harmful by products zhang et al 2018a li et al 2019 thus it is important to remove these compounds in drinking water treatments lv et al 2017 section 4 4 effects of treatment processes on dom in wastewater and drinking water 4 1 traditional treatment processes 4 1 1 wastewater treatments adsorption coagulation and biological treatments the effects of various treatment processes on dom are summarized in tables 2 5 adsorption process can remove both organic and inorganic pollutants that exist in wastewater by the effects of adsorption which is widely used for reducing dom using adsorbents such as activated carbon and iron minerals halim et al 2010 singh et al 2012 mailler et al 2016 found that the removal of uv254 doc and all fluorescent components by powder activated carbon was 10 25 5 10 and 10 30 respectively chen et al 2016 reported more effective removals of fulvic acid like and humic acid like components than a protein like component by hydrocalumite chloride ca al cl ldh wang et al 2019 found that the sorption capacity of dom by four iron minerals was in the order of ferrihydrite iron sulfide hematite pyrite their ft icr ms results further showed that ferrihydrite and iron sulfide preferentially adsorbed the highly unsaturated compounds rich in oxygen therefore the removal of bulk dom by adsorption is largely related to the dom composition the efficiency of adsorption is also dependent on ph equilibrium time and the properties and dose of the adsorbent for example duan et al 2016 used a new type of acid modified attapulgite al2 so4 3 adsorbent which effectively removed humic like and fulvic like components due to the high specific surface area and adsorption sites the highest removals of doc and uv254 were 64 7 and 33 7 under optimized conditions adsorbent concentration 0 5 mol l 1 and ph 5 duan et al 2016 coagulation is another traditional process to agglomerate colloids and small particles into larger particles for removing organic matter and inorganic pollutants from wastewater which has the benefits of simple operation relatively simple design and low energy consumption teh et al 2016 the main coagulants include al2 so4 3 fecl3 polyaluminum chloride pac an et al 2017 found that al2 so4 3 was more effective to remove humic like components while fecl3 and pac were more effective for the removal of the protein like component hu et al 2016 found higher removal of refractory hydrophobic humic like components than the hydrophilic protein like fraction by coagulation which led to increased bioavailability concerning the formulas identified with ft icr ms coagulations with al or fe sulfate can preferentially remove unsaturated h c 1 0 and oxidized o c 0 4 compounds containing carboxyl groups yuan et al 2017 in addition geng et al 2018 showed a new covalently bound inorganic organic hybrid coagulant cbhyc effectively removed highly unsaturated phenolic compounds and aliphatic compounds 0 3 o c 0 8 1 0 h c 2 0 and removed almost all chos compounds these studies also indicate the importance of the characteristics of dom in the coagulation process such as the major organic components hydrophobicity saturation degree and the ranges of o c and h c a series of biological treatments have also been widely used in the wastewater treatment to remove biologically degradable dom constituents by biodegradation such as anaerobic anoxic oxic a2o process sequencing batch reactor sbr and membrane bioreactor mbr mesfioui et al 2012 a2o process is commonly used in wastewater treatment plants pan et al 2018 examined the removal efficiency of dom by the a2o process which decreased doc and uv254 values by 92 0 and 93 7 respectively the removal efficiency of fluorescence components follows the order of tyrosine like 89 58 humic like 39 83 tryptophan like 36 89 microbial humic like 12 47 fulvic like component 6 37 structural properties of individual dom molecules such as the contents of oxygen and heteroatom also have significant influences on the treatment processes yuan et al 2017 revealed that less oxidized compounds o c 0 3 were more reactive to biodegradation li et al 2015 found that the ox and nx class species with fewer oxygen atoms could be easily removed while those with more oxygen that usually represented humic substances were resistant to the a2o process wang et al 2020a found that high mw m z 500 compounds with 40 50 carbon atoms and 15 20 dbe were biodegraded into medium mw compounds with 10 20 carbon atoms and 10 dbe after a2o process which was accompanied with the removal of unsaturated hydrocarbons and lipids sbr process can provide a high flow rate through parallel devices which exhibited effective removal of protein like components fang et al 2019 the removal of doc was up to 98 6 when sbr was combined with the forward osmosis which rejected biopolymers humics and building blocks linares et al 2016 zhang et al 2018a found removals of both proteins and carbohydrates by mbr a process that combines biological treatment and membrane separation they also observed that fulvic acid like and humic acid like fluorophores were retained effectively in the system zhang et al 2019b indicated that the mbr process was more efficient in removing the n containing compounds with higher unsaturated states in coal liquefaction wastewater the removal of dom can be further enhanced by combining mbr and other processes for example zhang et al 2019a found that uf removed 2615 molecular formulas from the mbr effluent and reverse osmosis ro was effective to separate almost all the remaining organic compounds generally it is difficult to completely remove organic compounds with complex structures by biological treatments however the increase of retention time in the anaerobic unit can enable the decomposition of long chain organic compounds wang et al 2020a some s containing compounds can be degraded by the addition of sulfur oxidation bacteria eom et al 2019 the combined utilization of biological treatment and other processes can promote the removal of dom such as biological uf ro and biological advanced oxidation processes zhang et al 2019a fang et al 2019 4 1 2 drinking water treatments adsorption coagulation filtration and disinfection adsorption is a common process to remove organic matter in drinking water treatment through the adsorption process of adsorbates different molecular size charge and hydrophobicity to adsorbent variable chemical properties and surface area which effectively removes dom itself and dbps precursors as well as trace organic pollutants chow et al 2009 moona et al 2018 moona et al 2018 showed 12 23 removal of doc by granular activated carbon gac filtration which eliminated microbial humic like protein like and terrestrial humic like components by about 20 40 another study showed removals of all parafac components by 53 70 after the gac filtration vera et al 2017 hussain et al 2018 found higher removals of humic acid like and fulvic acid like fluorophores 86 and 71 by a natural clay material fuller s earth while natural sands and modified quartz sands were more effective for removing protein like fluorophores ft icr ms has also been applied for studying the adsorption behavior of different molecules for example lv et al 2018 demonstrated that molecules with a high oxidation state and high aromaticity e g oxidized black carbon polyphenol like and tannic like compounds could form ligand exchange complexes with oh groups on the surface of hematite nanocrystal adsorbent andersson et al 2020 showed selective adsorption of compounds with mid to high h c 1 0 1 7 low molecular weight and low oxidation state by gac the adsorption process can be designed in the filtration mode to improve the performance and a small part of the adsorbents can be replaced with time to achieve the optimal conditions for example gac filtration can effectively adsorb small to intermediate sized humic like components with a high oxidation state and aromaticity leading to the increase of filtration effect and the attachment of microbes for biodegradation kim et al 2014 moona et al 2018 coagulation can aggregate colloidal particles and tiny suspended substances in the drinking water which is capable of removing dom e g humic like components and decreasing the formation of dbps watson et al 2018 revealed that 72 of humic like components and 44 of protein like components were removed by alum coagulation lin et al 2020 also found higher removals of humic like and fulvic like than protein like fluorophores by coagulation with pac which reduced the formation potentials of dbps thms and haa hussain et al 2019 used ticl3 as a novel coagulant for treating low alkalinity water with high doc and showed higher removal of doc by ticl3 71 than by alum 56 under the optimal dosage moreover the highest removals of fulvic like and humic like acids by ticl3 were 50 and 66 which were higher than those by alum 14 and 64 hussain et al 2019 chen et al 2018 also showed more effective removals of humic and fulvic acid like fluorophores than aromatic proteins and soluble microbial byproduct like fluorophores by a new covalently bound hybrid coagulant which removed doc and uv254 by up to 40 and 71 meanwhile ft icr ms analysis showed that dom molecules with oxidized carbon high o c and low h c were preferentially removed during the coagulation with pac al2 so4 3 and fecl3 zhang et al 2012 lavonen et al 2015 it is noteworthy that humic substances with high o c and low h c are important precursors of dbps thus the removal of these precursors by coagulation is critical for reducing the formation of dbps lin et al 2020 zhang et al 2018b filtration is an important process to remove ions bacteria colloids and particles through sieving effects which are influenced by transmembrane pressures and the aperture size of filter media gibert et al 2017 ro uf and nanofiltration nf are the main membrane filtration processes in drinking water treatment ro has the advantages of high purification efficiency but has high energy costs vera et al 2017 showed high rejections of three humic like components 98 99 one tryptophan like component 98 and one tyrosine like component 91 by ro while uf had a negligible effect on dom uf is efficient in removing suspended particles colloids and microorganisms and is usually combined with other processes to improve the overall removal of dom for example gibert et al 2017 removed doc by 32 46 using combined magnetic ion exchange resin miex and uf which was more efficient than uf alone 5 they also found that miex retained mainly fulvic and humic acid like components while it had a poor effect on microbial by products gibert et al 2017 nf combined with coagulation can remove more than 90 of doc and uv254 which is more effective for humic like than for protein like fluorophores 83 vs 66 kohler et al 2016 nf is capable of removing both reduced and oxidized components as revealed by ft icr ms analysis with higher removal efficiency for more hydrophilic and oxidized compounds with higher nitrogen and oxygen content cortes francisco et al 2014 slow sand filtration may be less efficient in removing the bulk dom than membrane filtration but sand filtration could preferentially remove protein like components and chemical formulas containing reduced carbonwith less double bonds and oxygen h c 1 32 o c 0 43 lavonen et al 2015 membrane fouling is an important challenge for the performance of membrane filtration and the removals of dom and the monitoring of fluorescence can be used to detect the membrane fouling and membrane performance shao et al 2014 vera et al 2017 disinfection is a critical process to ensure the safety of drinking water via the typical routes of chlorination and chloramine treatment which can oxidize organic compounds and affect dom mainly in two ways mansor et al 2020 on the one hand chlorination can effectively remove fulvic and humic acid like components but has less effect on protein like components moyo et al 2019 the ft icr ms results reveal that dom molecules with low o c are more reactive toward chlorine and decrease significantly after the treatments while the fraction of high o c increases slightly zhang et al 2012 on the other hand dom in drinking water can react with disinfectants to form dbps for example yang et al 2015c found a strong correlation between the formation potential of thms and a humic like component r 0 874 while that of n nitrosodimethylamine correlated significantly with a protein like component r 0 628 wang et al 2017a revealed that dom molecules with high o c and low h c oxygen rich molecules with high unsaturation degree contributed greatly to the formation of thms and haas during chlorination ft icr ms has also been used to characterize the structure of dbps dbps are mainly in the mass range of 300 500 da with o c of 0 3 0 7 and h c of 0 7 1 4 which are mainly related to unsaturated aromatic compounds andersson et al 2019 zhang et al 2018b wang et al 2016 meanwhile huang et al 2020 showed the production of assimilable organic carbon in disinfection such as the molecules with carboxylic and alcohol functionalities and chlorinated aromatics due to oxidation and chlorine substitution on aromatic molecules overall the formation of dbps is a major challenge for disinfection and affects drinking water safety an effective strategy is to remove the precursors e g unsaturated aromatic compounds before disinfection by water treatments such as coagulation nanofiltration ozonation and electrolysis bose et al 2007 bond et al 2010 chen et al 2019 4 2 advanced treatment processes in recent years researchers have also made notable progress in developing advanced treatment processes for removing refractory dom from wastewater and drinking water such as catalytic oxidation photocatalysis and electrolysis these processes can decompose dom into small biodegradable molecules effectively through catalytic decomposition photo degradation and electrochemical reactions respectively yang et al 2017 truong et al 2019 teng et al 2020 for example teng et al 2020 found that fenton oxidation effectively removed fulvic like 87 9 90 3 and humic like 96 5 97 9 components in landfill leachate wang et al 2017b discussed the transformation of dom in landfill leachate by ozone based oxidation processes o3 h2o2 o3 uv which significantly decreased fulvic like and humic like components and effectively degraded high mw components into low mw dom headley et al 2015 studied the change of molecular composition of dom in oil sand processed water by ozonation and ultrasonication the ft icr ms analysis showed a reduction in dbe for all ox and oxs1species indicating the loss of unsaturation and aromatic structures headley et al 2015 therefore ozonation and ultrasonication can be applied as the subsequent processes of adsorption and coagulation to increase the degradability and reduce the toxicity of some organic compounds e g naphthenic acid compounds headley et al 2015 chen et al 2014 combined activated carbon supported iron oxides and ozone to effectively remove dom in heavy oil refining wastewater they found a decreasing carbon number of molecules by chain scission and transformation of initial organic pollutants into small molecules which were accompanied by increased h c value chen et al 2014 the removal of dom by fenton oxidation is affected by the dosage of h2o2 the molar ratio of h2o2 fe ii ph and oxidation time deng et al 2006 teng et al 2020 generally ozone based catalytic oxidation has higher removals of dom than ozone oxidation alone and is suitable for treating wastewater rich in high mw unsaturated and aromatic compounds headley et al 2015 wang et al 2017b teng et al 2020 there is also notable progress in the photo degradation of dom with catalysts phong and hur 2016 showed more effective removal of both protein like and humic like components by uv irradiation with two common catalysts 97 tio2 and zno than without catalyst they found that fluorescent components were more sensitive to photodegradation than doc 26 5 74 3 and uv254 60 6 84 3 and the protein like component had the highest degradation rate the ft icr ms results showed that tio2 was an efficient catalyst to promote the photodegradation of compounds with high mw aromaticity and low o c lv et al 2017 the tio2 photocatalysis can remove 52 7 82 1 of cho and 47 3 84 8 of chon molecules and completely removes chons andchos molecules lv et al 2017 in addition novel photo catalysts have been developed to target the removal of dom for example truong et al 2019 photo degraded dom using zinc bismuth oxides graphitic carbon nitride zbo cn which showed effective removal of doc and uv254 by 53 74 and 65 88 respectively under low intensity visible light irradiation the removal efficiency of fluorescence components follows the order of terrestrial humic like humic like microbial humic like truong et al 2019 xu et al 2018 developed a linbo3 photocatalytic membrane for effectively removing dom by 60 70 from secondary effluents which was enhanced by the addition of formic acid which generated carboxyl anion radicals this process mainly removed cho formulas with o c of 0 1 0 5 chon compounds with o c 0 5 and chos compounds with o c of 0 3 0 6 and h c of 1 0 1 6 xu et al 2018 photocatalytic membranes can improve the removal of dom by combining photocatalysis and filtration xu et al 2018 it is noteworthy that the presence of dom can inhibit the photocatalytic degradation of specific pollutants such as para chlorobenzoic acid through absorbing the light and quenching reactive oxygen species ros maghsoodi et al 2019 overall the photocatalysis process is dependent on the irradiance wavelengths the catalysts and the property of organic components thus different catalysts are likely to be suitable for removing different types of dom phong and hur 2016 lv et al 2017 xu et al 2018 truong et al 2019 electrolysis based on various types of materials has also been applied for wastewater and drinking water treatments for example wang et al 2018b combined a novel iron carbon micro electrolysis icme with h2o2 for treating the printing and dyeing wastewater which removed 81 8 53 8 and 70 8 of fulvic acid soluble microbial metabolites and aromatic proteins respectively chen et al 2019 combined icme with an up flow biological aerated filter ubaf to remove dom and dbp precursors from drinking water the icme removed 15 6 of doc with decreases of fluorescent components the transformation of high mw hydrophobic organic matter into low mw hydrophilic components and the enhancement of the bio degradation of dom by subsequent ubaf chen et al 2019 wang et al 2020b showed strong degradation of lipid like and cram lignin like compounds in concentrated leachate using a combination of ruo2 ti electrolysis and ozonation they also found effective removals of cho compounds by 92 5 97 0 and 98 4 in electrolysis ozonation and electrolysis ozonation respectively which were higher than those of chn 1 5 42 7 and 71 6 and chns compounds 34 4 75 5 and 77 5 wang et al 2020b a major challenge is the blockage of the reaction bed by the sludge produced in electrolysis which can be reduced by the modified micro electrolysis filter with large surface area and porous structure zhang et al 2014 generally electrolysis can effectively improve the biodegradability by removing or transforming refractory organic compounds e g high mw and hydrophobic fractions and cram lignin like compounds thus it can be used in combination with subsequent biological treatments yang et al 2017 zhang et al 2018c chen et al 2019 5 summary limitations and research perspectives in summary spectroscopic and mass spectrometry analyses reveal a lot of chemical diversity in the composition of dom in wastewater and drinking water fig 1 municipal wastewater is generally characterized by strong protein like fluorescence and contains abundant cho chos and chon formulas that are related to lipids lignins carbohydrates proteins detergents surfactants and pharmaceuticals the dom composition in industrial wastewater varies greatly depending on the industry category which contains diverse fluorescent components protein like humic like and untypical components abundant cho formulas and variable heteroatomic molecules drinking water contains mainly humic like fluorescent components and cho molecules although the protein like fluorescence and anthropogenic compounds e g chos molecules can be elevated by contamination and autochthonous production the high complexity and variability of dom composition is a critical challenge for wastewater and drinking water treatments both traditional and advanced treatment processes show variable effects on different constituents in the complex dom fig 2 adsorption and coagulation generally preferentially remove humic like fluorescent components e g by ca al cl ldh gac natural clay material and alum but sands and fecl3 show higher removals of protein like components adsorption with iron minerals and coagulation with alum and fecl3 are more effective for removing unsaturated and oxidized molecules resulting in higher h c and lower o c in contrast gac can selectively remove less oxidized compounds with mid to high h c biological treatments preferentially remove protein like fluorescent components less oxidized formulas and unsaturated hydrocarbons and lipids which increase h c and o c values ro can reject almost all organic components while uf has a limited effect on dom nf is more effective for removing humic like fluorescent components and results in higher h c and lower o c while sand filtration removes more protein like components and results in lower h c and higher o c disinfection with chlorine preferentially removes humic like fluorescent components and dom molecules with low o c advanced treatments including catalytic oxidation photocatalysis and electrolysis are effective for removing humic like fluorescent components and unsaturated aromatic formulas resulting in elevated h c and o c therefore the information on dom composition and its removal is key to optimize the treatment processes while spectroscopic and mass spectrometry analyses are both valuable tools for monitoring dom in water treatments and for system optimization the following limitations are noted fluorescence spectroscopy covers only fluorescent compounds but not all dom compounds e g polysaccharides and noncolored aliphatics although it can provide valuable information for the dom composition and the treatment performance the online monitoring of fluorescence is challenged by variable environmental conditions e g ph temperature particles and inorganic ions and inner filter effect for high concentration samples ft icr ms analysis is in part limited by the dom extraction and ionization processes in addition few studies have examined the relation between dom and acute toxicity even though the information is essential for assessing the quality and safety of wastewater and drinking water traditional treatment processes have been widely used in wastewater and drinking water while advanced treatment processes show less practical applications due to the high cost and low treatment scale although high removal efficiency of dom has been reported regarding the research perspectives we identified the followings the combined use of fluorescence spectroscopy and other techniques e g ft icr ms can provide more comprehensive information on the chemical composition of the complex dom mixture and the behavior of dom in water treatments this information is critical for optimizing the treatment processes in addition each fluorescent component may consist of many compounds and ft icr ms analysis can provide more detailed information for the compounds linked with fluorescent components fluorescence spectroscopy can be used for pre screening the samples before the expensive ft icr ms analysis testing the relationships of fluorescence with bulk parameters e g toc doc bod cod and specific pollutants can also help to expand the application of fluorescence spectroscopy the online monitoring of fluorescence is valuable for detecting the real time water quality and treatment performance and further developing tools for the correction of field conditions can help to achieve accurate quantification future studies are required to develop effective standard extraction and ionization methods for ft icr ms in particular for studying the complex and highly variable dom in wastewater and drinking water treatments in addition ft icr ms can be interpreted for understanding microbial communities and the activities through gene analysis which is important for elucidating the mechanisms underlying the removal of dom in biological treatments the chemical diversity of dom in drinking water municipal wastewater and different types of industrial wastewater highlight the potential applicability of dom tools for detecting anthropogenic pollution and identifying the source in a polluted drinking water source it is important to identify pollutants by mass spectrometry e g gc ms and lc ms for tracking the pollution and to study the fate and effects of pollutants in dwtps ft icr ms analysis of a few typical samples would provide more comprehensive information for the dom molecules fluorescence spectroscopy can be used to identify and monitor online the dom components associated with pollutants at a lower cost in routine controls although a more robust control technique should be available to ensure effective treatments and the safety of drinking water the relation between dom and acute toxicity is essential for assessing the quality and safety of wastewater and drinking water the direct effects of harmful organic compounds in dom and the indirect effects through the interaction of dom with heavy metals and organic pollutants on acute toxicity are both worth testing eem parafac and ft icr ms can provide insights into both the removal of dom from raw water and the production of dom constituents during water treatments e g soluble microbial byproducts and bio or photo degradation intermediates the results are important for revealing the pathway and mechanism of dom transformation during water treatments which would provide the basis for optimizing the treatment schemes in wwtp and dwtp future studies to combine traditional and advanced treatments are also important to achieve the best treatment effect at a low or reasonable economic cost 6 conclusion absorption spectroscopy and fluorescence eem parafac provide a series of indices for characterizing dom and ft icr ms is a powerful tool for studying dom at the molecular level both types of monitoring techniques have been widely used in studying wastewater and drinking water treatments the analysis with two advanced tools fluorescence eem parafac and ft icr ms revealed that the composition of dom is significantly different among municipal wastewater industrial wastewater and drinking water the high complexity and variability of dom composition is a critical challenge for efficient treatments the removal efficiency of dom in wastewater and drinking water treatment changes notably with both treatment processes and dom constituents the information on dom composition and its removal is key to optimize the treatment processes advanced treatment processes and novel materials are increasingly applied for enhancing the removal of dom from wastewater and drinking water thus spectroscopic analysis and ft icr ms will continue to play important roles in revealing the chemical composition of dom in representative water bodies and tracking the responses of different dom constituents to water treatments the results are critical for further optimizing the treatment

17386,with the widespread occurrence of microplastics in aquatic ecosystems having been firmly established the focus of research has shifted towards the assessments of their influence on ecosystem functions and food webs this includes interactions between microplastics and microalgae as fundamental components at the base of aquatic food webs and pivotal organisms in a wide range of ecosystem functions in this review we present the current state of knowledge on microalgae microplastic interactions and summarize the potential effect on their respective fate microplastics can and do interact with microalgae and the available literature has suggested that the epiplastic community of microalgae differs consistently from the surrounding aquatic communities however it is still not clear whether this different colonization is linked to the composition of the surface or more to the availability of a hard substrate on which organisms can attach and grow further studies are needed to understand to what extent the properties of different plastic materials and different environmental factors may affect the growth of microalgae on plastic debris biofouling may alter microplastic properties especially increasing their density consequently affecting the vertical fluxes of plastics moreover microplastics may have toxic effects on microalgae which could be physical or related to chemical interactions with plasticizers or other chemicals associated with plastics with consequences for algal growth photosynthetic activity and morphology microplastics seems to have the potential to affect not only the quality e g fatty acids and lipids composition food dilution effect but also the quantity of algal production both positively and negatively this may have consequences for energy fluxes which may propagate throughout the whole food web and alter aquatic productivity even though experimental results have indicated reciprocal impacts between plastics and microalgae it is currently difficult to predict how these impacts may manifest themselves at the ecosystem level therefore further studies are needed to address this important topic graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords plastic phytoplankton colonization cyanobacteria diatom epiplastic community 1 introduction plastic has become an inherent part of daily life and millions of tons of plastic material are manufactured globally every year due to the broad application of plastic in many different sectors and its long lasting characteristics the amount of plastic litter has increased dramatically over the last few decades in both aquatic and terrestrial environments galafassi et al 2019 the slow breakdown of plastic items produces successively smaller pieces called microplastics mps a term that is now commonly used to define particles whose larger dimension is lower than 5 mm van cauwenberghe et al 2015 agreement on this higher limit of the microplastic range 5 mm is quite consistent throughout the literature however some researchers have recently suggested different thresholds e g 1 mm hartmann et al 2019 besides the microplastics derived from the degradation of larger plastic items i e secondary mps mps can also be specifically manufactured in the micrometer size range i e primary mps for instance those used in industrial abrasives for sandblasting plastic pre production pellets nurdles or microbeads in personal care products horton et al 2017 the term plastic includes many different polymers but the most abundant classes of polymers detected in aquatic environments are polyethylene pe polypropylene pp polystyrene ps polyester pest polyamide pa and acrylic this is not surprising given the fact that these materials constitute a major proportion of global plastic production and are widely used in short life cycle products erni cassola et al 2019 different plastic polymers have different chemical and physical properties and depending on their composition density and shape can be buoyant neutrally buoyant or sink in aquatic systems cole et al 2011 in particular the density of most common plastic polymers ranges from 0 85 to 1 41 g cm3 and as this range includes materials of lower equal or higher density than sea and freshwater microplastics can be easily distributed throughout the water column the density can determine whether a particle occupies a pelagic versus benthic transport route microplastics with a density greater than that of water sink into sediments where they accumulate while those with low density float on surfaces cole et al 2011 woodall et al 2014 moreover an increase in density through biofouling by organisms can eventually result in sinking of microplastics auta et al 2017 microplastic occurrence in the marine environment has been documented in almost every open and enclosed sea habitat extending from surface water to deep sea sediments and from the equator to the polar regions peng et al 2017 recent estimates suggest that 4 85 trillion microplastic particles are floating in the global ocean eriksen et al 2014 the majority of the research about microplastics has focused on seawater environments while less than 4 of microplastic related studies concern freshwater environments li et al 2018 this limited information however has revealed that the abundance of microplastics in freshwater is comparable to that in marine environments li et al 2018 peng et al 2017 with the widespread occurrence of microplastics in aquatic ecosystems now firmly established focus has been shifting towards the assessment of their influences on ecosystem functions and food webs despite growing research efforts understanding of the ecological implications that the presence of microplastics may have on aquatic ecosystems particularly regarding lower trophic levels e g phytoplankton are still largely unknown bryant et al 2016 different studies have already reported that microplastics can and do interact with aquatic microalgae and this has impacts on their respective fates long et al 2015 yokota et al 2017 microplastic surfaces constitute suitable substrates for the formation of biofilms amaral zettler et al 2020 mccormick et al 2014 and microalgae are an important constituent of colonizing biotic communities yokota et al 2017 the growth of microalgae on plastic surfaces is important for the plastic degradation process either having potential for biodegradation or on the contrary protecting plastics from ultraviolet radiation and photo catalysis carson et al 2013 moreover microplastics could potentially be incorporated along with microalgae into hetero aggregates with associated changes in buoyance thus resulting in settling and influencing the fate and bioavailability of mps carson et al 2013 long et al 2015 at the same time microalgae may suffer toxic effects as inhabitants of pelagic areas contaminated with microplastics with consequences for their growth photosynthetic activity and changes in morphology fu et al 2019 mao et al 2018 zhao et al 2019 in addition transport via rafting of the microalgae themselves is also of concern as this community is distinct from that of the surrounding water with potential impacts such as the introduction of harmful or non native algae into new environments carson et al 2013 masó et al 2016 thus the interactions between microplastics and microalgae may also be relevant at the ecosystem level with possible implications for the productivity of aquatic ecosystems which have already been affected by other anthropogenic impacts such as climate change eutrophication and food web alterations troost et al 2018 yokota et al 2017 given the importance of microalgae and the global occurrence of microplastic fragments in aquatic systems a review on the topic is required in order to identify the potential mechanisms of interaction as well as to guide further inquiries for this reason we conducted a broad and wide ranging literature review analyzing around 80 peer reviewed papers from 1972 to 2020 most of which 67 were published from 2018 onwards indicating the growing interest for this topic we synthesize the current state of knowledge on microalgae microplastic relationships addressing the different aspects of these interactions the specific objectives are i to analyze whether some taxa of microalgae may preferentially colonize microplastic surfaces and to identify the features and extent of such colonization ii to synthesize the environmental factors affecting microplastic colonization by microalgae iii to discuss the consequences of colonization by microalgae on the fate and characteristics of microplastics iv to summarize the effects that microplastics may exert on microalgae and v to evaluate the effects of the interaction between microplastics and microalgae at the ecosystem level moreover we comment on potential future questions and research directions needed to further define the implications of the relationships between microalgae and these concerning pollutants 2 microplastic colonization 2 1 plastic as a surface for colonization there now exists a large body of evidence that microplastics are abundant and widespread in both marine and freshwater environments horton et al 2017 jiang 2018 van cauwenberghe et al 2015 and different studies have reported that mps can be colonized by a wide range of organisms biofouling carson et al 2013 reisser et al 2014 microplastics harbor a distinct biota and represent a new habitat for rafting organisms to the point that the term plastisphere was coined by zettler et al 2013 to define the diverse community of heterotrophs autotrophs predators and symbionts on the surface of plastic debris the first study on plastic colonization dated back to the beginning of the 1970 when an investigation in the sargasso sea surface revealed the presence of microalgae in particular diatoms attached to the surface of plastic carpenter and smith 1972 this early study relied primarily on microscopy but at present the application of modern molecular methods especially high throughput dna sequencing is used to increase our understanding of the diverse micro organisms inhabiting the plastisphere amaral zettler et al 2020 while heterotrophic bacteria tend to be the focus of plastisphere research the presence of both prokaryotic and eukaryotic autotrophs within the biofilm has been documented yokota et al 2017 there is a growing field of research focused on the colonization process of microplastics by microalgae but many questions are yet to be addressed carson et al 2013 it has been widely reported that the community growing on plastic debris differs consistently from the surrounding free living organisms bryant et al 2016 dussud et al 2018a kesy et al 2019 oberbeckmann et al 2014 zettler et al 2013 in general the dichotomy between particle attached pa and free living fl micro organisms has been widely documented in several studies across different aquatic biomes and thus the discrepancies among organisms attached to plastic debris and planktonic communities may be not strictly linked to the composition of the surface but more to the availability of a substrate on which organisms can attach to and grow oberbeckmann et al 2016 it is likely that many taxa use plastic opportunistically as a niche but can also attach to other substrates oberbeckmann et al 2016 however experimental studies have reported differences in the communities found on plastic surfaces compared to other substrates such as glass which is usually used as a control substrate as it is inert vosshage et al 2018 during a short term two week experiment in which plastic particles polyethylene polypropylene and polystyrene and glass beads were exposed to brackish water from a coastal bay under controlled conditions ogonowski et al 2018 found that the plastic associated communities were distinctly different from those of the non plastic substrates suggesting substrate driven selection the same result was reported for a 6 week exposure experiment in the north sea uk with polyethylene terephthalate pet bottles and glass slides as reference samples in which marked differences were reported in the community isolated from the two substrates with at least 57 divergence and where several biofilm members were detected solely on one of the surfaces suggesting a preference for plastic or glass oberbeckmann et al 2014 additional studies in the same location reported no significant difference between glass and pet attached communities oberbeckmann et al 2016 thus highlighting that this topic remains controversial vosshage et al 2018 exposed different plastic materials 28 48 mm for 49 days in a shallow highly productive lake and found a significant difference in the volume of algae and biofilm height compared to glass substrate only for polymethyl methacrylate pmma and not for polycarbonate pc several cohort studies have indicated that the colonization process can vary depending on the plastic polymer used for instance lagarde et al 2016 highlighted differences in long term colonization between high density polyethylene hdpe and polypropylene pp zettler et al 2013 reported slight differences in organism richness associated with polyethylene pe and polypropylene pp on a wide range of plastic marine debris collected at multiple locations after long residence times in the environment and li et al 2019 found significantly higher biomass on polystyrene ps than on other plastic polymers indicating an influence of polymer composition on the biofilm formation despite these research efforts a systematic examination of the colonization process occurring on different plastic polymers is still lacking indeed the term plastics include a wide variety of polymers with different chemical composition and properties even for the same type of polymer the chemical composition may vary considerably depending on the chemical additives lagarde et al 2016 as the surface chemistry of the substrate is often not established its influence on the colonization process generally can not be determined cooksey and wigglesworth cooksey 1995 differences highlighted in plastic colonization processes may be partially explained by bearing in mind that different polymers even if falling into the umbrella term plastic are materials with distinct features a fundamental role in the process of colonization of plastic substrate by microalgae is played by the extracellular polymeric substances eps which provides an attractive force maintaining cells together and attaching aggregates and cells to biotic or abiotic surfaces it has been argued that different polymers stimulate the production of eps in different quantities and or with different composition thus determining variability in the cohesiveness of biofilms and ultimately in the biomass of colonizing organisms lagarde et al 2016 it is worth mentioning that the studies reported above described experiments performed in both freshwater and marine environments however different hydrological hydrodynamic physico chemical and species compositions characterize these two systems therefore biofilm attachment on the surface of microplastics in freshwater may show different features e g biomass type and quantity of eps compared to those in the sea chen et al 2019 such that the results obtained for marine systems should be extended to freshwater environments and vice versa with caution moreover it should also be noted that the colonization experiments listed encompassed studies of different durations whose variation may influence the process and the conclusions drawn the major part of the studies was conducted over short time scales however considering that synthetic polymers can persist over long periods in natural aquatic environments incubation over longer timescales may allow for mimicking more realistic conditions kirstein et al 2018 in addition a distinction in the analysis of the different phases of biofilm development is needed as only the initial recruits have direct contact with the polymer surface in contrast later recruits are more likely to interact with existing biofilm members and the abiotic components of the surrounding environment dudek et al 2020 oberbeckmann et al 2016 therefore when the different phases of development are studied collectively only generalized insights about the plastic associated community can be obtained besides many other factors likely influence the colonization process among others the age and the time that plastic material spends in the environment play an important role aging produces alterations of the plastic surface and wrinkles rough and fractured surface textures can be observed on aged microplastics fu et al 2019 this has consequences for colonization indeed it has been reported that the surface roughness of particles is positively related to the density of attached microalgae carson et al 2013 aging processes can also vary the hydrophobicity of the different particles which may have consequences on biofouling processes as well as several articles have acknowledged that high energy surfaces hydrophilic surfaces tend to favor biofilm growth dussud et al 2018a finally environmental factors and seasonal variations which exert effects on primary producers in general may influence colonizing processes see section 2 2 2 2 environmental factors and seasonal variations as the growth and development of primary producers are dependent on several environmental factors the colonization process on plastic substrates is influenced by their variations over time furthermore biofilms are shaped to adapt to local conditions and environmental factors determine a cell s decision to form or leave a biofilm toyofuku et al 2016 several studies have shown that biogeography plays an important role in the composition of mp colonizing communities amaral zettler et al 2015 oberbeckmann et al 2014 but there is still debate among researchers as to whether substrate specific properties or environmental factors prevail in shaping microorganism assemblages on plastic materials it is not clear whether the plastic surface environment may exert a strong enough selection to drive species sorting in order to overcome other niche defining factors driven by seasonal and spatial patterns thus it is important to study which environmental factors exert the strongest selective pressure and how their synergic relationships can shape plastic colonizing communities despite inter and intra site variability there is a clear dearth of consensus among researchers that some factors with greater influence on plastic colonization can be identified among these temperature plays a role in the settlement and growth of the colonizing community as higher temperatures within the optimum range increase cell metabolism resulting in the rapid development of the attached organisms indeed seasonal differences driven by temperature variations have been observed in the plastic colonization processes oberbeckmann et al 2014 highlighted the highest and the lowest overall mean diversity of pet plastisphere communities in a marine environment in summer and winter respectively conceptually similar work has also been carried out in a freshwater lake by chen et al 2019 who studying the biofilm development on polypropylene sheets in four seasons pointed out that biofilm developed at a different rate in different seasons with the highest biofilm biomass per unit area in summer and the lowest in winter a pivotal role of salinity has also been recognized which is known to shape communities in aquatic environments dussud et al 2018b kesy et al 2019 oberbeckmann et al 2018 exposure of five types of plastic debris polyvinyl chloride polypropylene polyethylene polystyrene and polyurethane in the haihe estuary highlighted that salinity had a negative correlation with the average growth rate of the biofilm and a positive correlation with the diversity of the colonizing community li et al 2019 confirming the results reported in previous studies kesy et al 2019 oberbeckmann et al 2018 besides temperature and salinity nutrients are likely to influence plastic colonization where an increase in nutrients is usually associated with greater biodiversity on the plastic attached community li et al 2019 oberbeckmann et al 2018 different environmental parameters and their variation over time can shape and select the community which is able to colonize the plastic surface for instance photosynthetic organisms cannot be found where there is no light irradiance chen et al 2019 moreover it should be taken into account that there is a constant interplay of different environmental parameters the combinations of which affect biofilm development however the previous research has obtained mixed results in terms of the impact of environmental factors for instance no effects of geographical location or environmental factors were highlighted on the community assemblages developed on plastics sampled in the western mediterranean basin dussud et al 2018b we postulate that these contradictory results may likely be caused by different experimental designs e g polymer considered or analytical methodologies differences in temporal and spatial scale considered and the intrinsic diversity in the systems studied to the best of our knowledge factors such as hydrodynamic features physical disturbance or solar radiation have not been taken into account in the studies performed to date 2 3 microalgae taxa colonizing plastic debris bacteria usually represent the most studied organisms in the colonization process of plastic materials among them organisms belonging to the photosynthetic phylum of cyanobacteria have been widely reported as a group with the capability to colonize plastic debris bryant et al 2016 chen et al 2019 oberbeckmann et al 2014 they have been shown to dominate in many plastisphere communities table 1 and may play an important role in the ecological processes occurring in biofilms on plastic oberbeckmann et al 2014 their occurrence and importance on plastic surfaces have also been reported in freshwater systems yokota et al 2017 as colonial and filamentous cyanobacteria are able to produce cyanotoxins and are frequently the cause of harmful algal bloom hab in fresh and marine waters yokota et al 2017 their interactions with microplastics can have consequences and implications at the ecosystem level see section 5 among the most frequent taxa detected cyanobacteria of the filamentous genus phormidium are commonly found as part of plastic colonizing communities with studies attesting to their occurrence in the north atlantic debroas et al 2017 zettler et al 2013 north pacific bryant et al 2016 and north sea oberbeckmann et al 2016 2014 other marine and freshwater cyanobacteria that have been reported to colonize plastic surfaces belong to the following orders chroococcales genus microcystis oscillatoriales genus rivularia nostocales genera calothrix and scytonema pleurocapsales genus pleurocapsa and synechococcales genera synechococcus prochlorothrix and leptolyngbya bryant et al 2016 debroas et al 2017 dussud et al 2018b muthukrishnan et al 2019 due to their high ecological plasticity cyanobacteria are capable of adapting to several conditions and changes occurring in the environment leoni et al 2014b marti et al 2015 nava et al 2017 therefore their ability to colonize plastic substrates in a wide range of different environments is not surprising diatoms typically join cyanobacteria among the photosynthetic representatives that are able to colonize plastic surfaces amaral zettler et al 2020 most studies have shown that diatoms are common and omnipresent residents of the plastisphere table 1 at least on plastics that are exposed to sunlight being able to firmly attach to plastic and resist water turbulence and wave action reisser et al 2014 for instance carson et al 2013 who studied small plastic items from the surface of the north pacific gyre reported that pennate diatoms were among the most abundant organisms around one thousand individuals mm 2 the same result was highlighted for marine plastic debris collected from pelagic and benthic habitats across the mediterranean coastal waters of greece italy and spain reporting that diatoms appeared on almost 100 of the sampled plastic debris masó et al 2016 a study examining the types of organisms inhabiting the surfaces of 68 small marine plastics median size equal to 3 2 mm from inshore and offshore waters around the australian continent tropical to temperate areas reported that diatoms were the most diverse group of plastic colonizers growing both flat on the surface of plastic materials and erect being attached by mucous pads or stalks reisser et al 2014 all of these studies have employed sem analysis to identify the colonizing organisms additional studies performing dna metabarcoding on plastic communities highlighted the presence of diatoms on plastic surfaces debroas et al 2017 kettner et al 2019 oberbeckmann et al 2016 2014 despite that in some cases diatom clades did not make up more than 1 of the eukaryotic rrna genes due to their low biomass as opposed to the number of individuals compared to the other eukaryotes bryant et al 2016 a high density of diatoms is typically reported on plastic surfaces and even if their biomass contribution may be low the presence of many different species of diatoms is often recognized thus they importantly contribute to the overall biodiversity of the plastic associated community among the most recurring and abundant taxa of diatoms in marine and freshwater systems are species of the genera achnantes amphora cocconeis navicula and nitzschia lacerda et al 2019 masó et al 2016 oberbeckmann et al 2014 reisser et al 2014 zettler et al 2013 many of these are known biofilm forming taxa in aquatic environments in general diatoms are reported to be among the first recruits in the colonization of different substrata debroas et al 2017 eich et al 2015 oberbeckmann et al 2016 after the formation of a conditioning layer by bacteria surfaces are usually colonized by diatoms however it has been reported that diatoms may also directly attach to virgin surfaces khandeparker et al 2014 however it still remains unclear whether an obligate succession of organisms can be determined on the plastic surface or if it is an artifact due to the method of analysis used cooksey and wigglesworth cooksey 1995 regardless of the sequence it is generally agreed that diatoms represent a fundamental step in biofouling influencing the subsequent colonization process khandeparker et al 2014 oberbeckmann et al 2016 several studies have reported the presence of thecate and athecate dinoflagellates table 1 such as alexandrium sp ceratium sp and prorocentrum sp on plastic surface with the occurrence of harmful species kettner et al 2019 masó et al 2016 reisser et al 2014 zettler et al 2013 the presence of organisms belonging to chlorophyta cryptophyta and chrysophyta have also been sporadically reported chen et al 2019 debroas et al 2017 lacerda et al 2019 masó et al 2016 3 effects of microalgae on microplastics interactions between microalgae and plastic debris can significantly alter the properties of these polymers with consequences on their fate in aquatic environments yokota et al 2017 the different processes that have been reported in literature can be summarized in two main categories the alteration and or biodegradation of the plastic polymer and the alteration of the polymer density and sinking behavior fig 1 a different studies have reported that the biofouling processes of microplastics may significantly alter their properties and in particular their adsorption capability seems to generally be enhanced kalčíková et al 2020 for instance wang et al 2020 reported that the physical and chemical surface properties of pe microplastics were changed with the development of biofilm which resulted in different adsorption properties of microplastics for copper and tetracycline holmes et al 2014 observed that metal adsorption was considerably greater in aged pellets than new polyethylene pellets furthermore it has been observed that ions adsorbed from water onto biofilms were less intensively bound than to ion exchange polymers and thus the ions are more easily desorbed leached from the biofilm kalčíková et al 2020 kurniawan et al 2012 therefore the adhesion of microalgae on microplastic surfaces is of critical importance in the adsorption and desorption of pollutants from microplastics the capability of micro organisms to biodegrade plastic using plastic as a carbon source has been reported for numerous bacterial strains although most of the studies performed were based on the selection and testing of single strains in laboratory which is far from environmental conditions jacquin et al 2019 among primary producers the filamentous cyanobacteria of the genus phormidium are known to degrade hydrocarbons oberbeckmann et al 2016 the occurrence of species belonging to this genus on plastic surfaces has been widely documented see section 2 3 this raises an interesting possibility that phormidium in the plastisphere may be actively hydrolyzing the plastic yokota et al 2017 however as cyanobacteria are photosynthetic organisms the advantage of higher exposure to sunlight on floating plastic pieces may be the actual explanation for their enrichment on plastic debris roager and sonnenschein 2019 even if microalgae may not have a direct effect on the degradation of plastic their presence can be important in determining the presence of other hydrocarbon degrading bacteria and it has been argued that diatoms may function as an important habitat for such micro organisms dudek et al 2020 at the same time the biofouling of extensive surfaces may have an opposite effect protecting the plastic from uv radiation and thus retarding photo degradation processes andrady 2011 another important role played by microalgae concerning plastic materials is linked to their capacity to alter the density of the colonized polymer which consequently affects the vertical fluxes of plastics chen et al 2019 performed an experiment in a freshwater system and highlighted the changes in the buoyancy of polypropylene sheets squares with a side length of 5 and 10 mm following the development of microalgae biofilms it has been reported that microplastics could potentially be incorporated into hetero aggregates composed of algae and small plastic materials but this process remains little studied and thus is largely unpredictable several studies on microalgae have demonstrated significant interactions and the rapid formation of hetero aggregates when microalgae were exposed to 400 1000 μm diameter polypropylene and high density polyethylene microplastics at a concentration of 1 g l 1 lagarde et al 2016 2 mm polystyrene at 3 96 μg l 1 long et al 2017 and microbeads from cosmetic products at around 4000 microbeads l 1 möhlenkamp et al 2018 long et al 2015 performed a lab experiment to study this interaction using three types of aggregates formed from two different algae species the diatom chaetoceros neogracile the cryptophyte rhodomonas salina and a mix of them and 2 μm polystyrene microbeads the experiment highlighted that all three types of aggregates concentrated the microbeads once incorporated the microbeads impacted aggregate sinking rates reaching several hundred meters per day a high value compared to the sinking rate of free beads less than 4 mm day 1 these results support the idea that phytoplankton aggregates act as a potential mp sink however the extent to which different species form such aggregates is not the same and dissimilarities were also reported for different plastic polymers in other studies lagarde et al 2016 many factors play a role in the hetero aggregation process for instance major aggregate permeability increases the encounter chance between small particles and aggregates as the small particles are not moved away from the aggregate but can go through aggregate macropores and be caught moreover when an aggregate breaks new surfaces and macropores become available for microbeads to adhere to where a succession of fragmentation and coagulation allows microbeads to be incorporated not only at the aggregate surface or in macropores but also into the entire aggregate long et al 2015 resuspension processes can also occur where several factors of the aggregates such as size density porosity shape and stickiness play roles in determining the resuspension behavior of aggregates following settling möhlenkamp et al 2018 moreover hetero aggregates can also include inorganic material which both substantially enhance the settling velocity and determine lesser mobility once deposited in bottom layers möhlenkamp et al 2018 the studies reported have provided interesting insight about the hetero aggregation and the subsequent effects of microalgae on plastic debris but they were all performed at a lab scale and environmental conditions may widely differ from those tested for instance monospecific aggregates are unlikely to exist in nature and turbulence can quickly breaks up the hetero aggregates lagarde et al 2016 4 effects of microplastics on microalgae microalgae may experience toxic effects as inhabitants of pelagic areas contaminated with plastic debris furthermore as primary producers essential to the functioning of aquatic ecosystems casado et al 2013 small disruptions of microalgae populations may contribute to serious impacts on food webs fig 1b however the effects and toxicity of microplastics have seldom been determined in microalgae and the current experimental results offer no consensus table 2 one of the endpoints frequently measured is the effect on microalgal growth on which microplastics seem to have a negligible impact lagarde et al 2016 long et al 2017 sjollema et al 2016 even if some studies have reported effects after exposure to high concentrations of microplastics or small sized particles gambardella et al 2018 sjollema et al 2016 venâncio et al 2019 zhang et al 2017 zhao et al 2019 these findings point out two important aspects that should be taken into account the relevance of the concentration and the features of the plastic particles tested the characteristics of the microplastic used can play a fundamental role in determining the toxicity exerted besides the wide variety of polymers and additives that can be tested other features such as the size and the charge of the plastic particles may be of paramount importance in their effect on organisms the relationship among particle dimension and toxicity has been widely observed and it is generally agreed that smaller dimensions lead to higher toxicity in microalgae chae et al 2019 garrido et al 2019 very small particles may be more likely to inhibit the growth of microalgae through adsorption on the surface of the algal cell for instance inducing shading blocking algal pores or gas exchanges and embedding in microalgae cells fu et al 2019 zhang et al 2017 additionally the surface ionic charge of microplastics seems to affect their toxicity weathering and degradation processes such as photo oxidation which can lead to carbonyl group formation bellingeri et al 2019 can change the ionic charge of the microplastic surface furthermore it has been shown that detrimental effects on microalgae growth were found only when exposing micro organisms to positively charged particles while to the contrary no impacts were reported in the same experimental conditions for uncharged particles e g feng et al 2019 the effects may differ not only due to the types of polymers but also from the various responses of different microalgal species it is likely that interactions between microplastics and microalgae may vary with cell characteristics such as size and shape as algal cell walls act as barriers to particle penetration and different cell wall characteristics may consequently influence particle sorption chae et al 2019 fu et al 2019 toxic effects on microalgae may not only be physical but also related to interactions with the chemicals associated with plastics indeed mps can potentially transfer contaminants adsorbed onto their surface residual unpolymerized monomers deriving from incomplete polymerization reactions or additives which may represent a high percentage of the final plastic materials see e g hermabessiere et al 2017 maity and pramanick 2020 most additives are not covalently bound to the plastic polymer and thus they can migrate to the material surface potentially being released into the environment capolupo et al 2020 investigated the effects of plastic leachates on the microalgae raphidocelis subcapitata freshwater and skeletonema costatum marine reporting that quite all of the leachates i e benzothiazole phthalide acetophenone cobalt zinc lead inhibited algal growth however it has been hypothesized that the leaching of some additives which are usually released at low concentration may also stimulate the growth of microalgae due to a hormesis phenomenon chae et al 2019 song et al 2020 besides the effects on microalgae growth studies have found that microplastics seem to affect algal photosynthesis as both chlorophyll content fu et al 2019 prata et al 2018 zhang et al 2017 and photosynthetic efficiency mao et al 2018 zhang et al 2017 decreased under microplastic exposure moreover microplastics may induce morphological changes in microalgae mao et al 2018 modulate the energy metabolism by decreasing the oil bodies that could serve as energy sources seoane et al 2019 and may be ingested and internalized by mixotrophic algal species through phagocytosis processes long et al 2017 however many of the effects experienced by microalgae appear to be temporary with an initial period of vulnerability followed by adaptative responses leading to recovery prata et al 2019 and references therein different mechanisms of detoxification have been hypothesized to influence the recovery reported in microalgae activities such as membrane thickening reduction of surface exposure through homo aggregation and hetero aggregation mao et al 2018 prata et al 2019 with respect to the latter point it has been reported that the bioavailability of plastic particles changed during the different experiments due to adsorption to experimental containers or embedding in organic aggregates this underlines the need to quantify the bioavailability and distribution of mps in the experimental systems in order to obtain accurate values of the actual mp concentration to which the microalgae are truly exposed long et al 2017 a recent laboratory study has suggested that microplastics may also affect microalgae lipid and fatty acid composition which are important dietary components for primary consumers as a source of energy and essential nutrients guschina et al 2020 indeed the exposure of chlorella sorokiniana to polystyrene microplastics 70 μm 60 mg l resulted in the alteration of essential fatty acids major structural compounds in algal cell membranes and chloroplast galactolipids which have important functions in photosynthesis these findings raise questions about the impact of microplastics on algal productivity and the transfer of important lipid compounds through food webs thus requiring further investigation it is important to stress that the ecological relevance of laboratory observations is likely to be low as they are far from reflecting the complexity of the aquatic environment in which we must consider non equilibrium conditions large volumes lower algal cell concentrations the co existence of different microalgal species different polymers sizes doses and so on long et al 2017 sjollema et al 2016 moreover in nature mixtures of microplastic with different contaminants can also occur see e g davarpanah and guilhermino 2019 johansen et al 2019 zhu et al 2019 however studies regarding this topic are still scarce 5 ecosystem implications many of the effects obtained through lab scale experiments as discussed in the previous sections may potentially have consequences on the ecosystem functioning however it is difficult to predict how specific results obtained through laboratory experiments can manifest in real aquatic systems as microalgae are keystone organisms impacts and alterations of such communities can have substantial consequences for the whole aquatic ecosystem wright et al 2013 increasing levels of plastic pollution may not only exert pressure at the individual or population level but additionally may cause cascading secondary effects on the functioning and services of other communities and ultimately on the ecosystem as a whole kong and koelmans 2019 leoni et al 2018 one of the key mechanisms that has been claimed to be crucial is the perturbation effect that the interaction between plastics and microalgae may have on the aquatic food web there are substantial issues regarding whether microplastics affect the quality and quantity of algal production and whether this may propagate through food webs microalgae mixed with plastics may exhibit morphological changes that affect their detectability palatability and ease of handling by grazers lacerda et al 2019 yokota et al 2017 due to biofouling microplastics may become more available for interaction with animals within the water body although many species are able to discriminate between inert and edible particles the developed biofilm camouflages plastic particles thus allowing them to potentially become attractive food items to grazers such as zooplanktonic organisms vroom et al 2017 consequently biofilms may alter the interactions between microplastics and primary consumers increasing ingestion rates of flavored microplastics ingestion of microplastics aggregated with microalgae leads to the dilution of food due to the co ingestion of inert plastic together with regular food or prey kong and koelmans 2019 ecological implications are expected to be triggered especially by the responses of zooplanktonic species which represent the natural predators of algae kong and koelmans 2019 kong and koelmans 2019 applied a theoretical model to investigate the negative impacts of microplastics on food webs the research reported that reduced assimilation rates due to the ingestion of mps resulted in a lower population density of the corresponding organisms considering zooplankton decreased population density lessens the grazing pressure on phytoplankton which leads to increased population sizes of diatoms and green algae in response to the loss of zooplankton planktivorous fish feeding on zooplankton become largely limited thereby restricting the piscivorous fish population consequently benthivores fish start to dominate the fish community reducing the abundance of zoobenthos through predation this results in stronger perturbation on the sediment and increased water turbidity due to resuspension kong and koelmans 2019 despite the model being applied to shallow lakes and using high concentrations of mps 40 and 4000 particles l 1 the results provided valuable insights about how the impact of mps whose concentration is expected to increase in the near future can propagate through whole aquatic systems the decreased quality of algae ingested by zooplanktonic organisms is not the result of the dilution of food with inert particles but also by the direct effects of microplastics on algal quality recent evidence has suggested that microplastics may also affect the lipid and fatty acid composition of microalgae see section 4 which are critical regulators of the survival reproduction and population growth in invertebrates and fish as polyunsaturated fatty acids are highly retained during transfer through aquatic food webs any factors affecting their quantity and quality in phytoplankton may affect the growth reproductive capacity and fitness of aquatic invertebrates and fish guschina et al 2020 leoni et al 2014 furthermore microplastics may exert potential effects on the quantity of algal production as plastic debris provides an abundant growth matrix and better floating conditions for microalgae while exerting adverse effects i e toxicity or food dilution on phytoplankton consumers i e zooplankton it has been argued that plastic pollution can promote the multiplication of microalgae in large quantities with consequent detrimental effects for aquatic ecosystems already disturbed by eutrophication processes zhang et al 2020 for instance it has been reported that plastic surface represents a net autotrophic hot spot in the oligotrophic ocean with high density of chlorophyll a and high oxygen production bryant et al 2016 thus plastic pollution might affect ecosystem productivity with substantial consequences for those ecosystems that are characterized by oligotrophic conditions to date studies that have attempted to calculate the increase of primary productivity due to the presence of plastic debris are still missing and so quantitative data are not available to determine whether the occurrence of plastic is relevant to the perturbation of primary productivity however an opposite mechanism may be observed microplastics may exert toxic effects on microalgae see section 4 causing a decrease in phytoplankton species and eventually leading to losses in ecosystem productivity this can induce cascading impacts on biodiversity ecosystem services e g fish provisioning which are also influenced by the productivity at lower levels of the trophic chain and cultural services e g tourism and recreation evidences supporting one mechanism over the other are still missing and to the best of our knowledge field and experimental approaches regarding this topic are lacking there is no consensus even about the primary effects that microplastics may have on organisms and so scaling up results to the ecosystem level is complex and it is only possible to postulate some hypotheses about the plausible mechanisms moreover indirect effects can also occur microplastic associated bacteria have the ability to alter the nutrient cycling processes e g increasing the denitrification capability or transforming phosphorus through microbe mediated processes nutrients can be assimilated by plastic materials and then released into the surrounding water altering the nutrient concentration and thus affecting primary producers chen et al 2020 therefore microplastics seem to be able to interact with several biotic and abiotic factors creating new micro ecosystems in which both nutrients and primary producers can be concentrated and not dispersed into the pelagic environment as previously discussed the colonization of microplastics by microalgae adds additional weight to the plastic particles facilitating the sedimentation and burial of these pollutants thus microplastics can influence energy fluxes not only in the pelagic compartments but also in benthonic environments where they may negatively affect the general fitness of benthonic organisms bellasi et al 2020 another aspect that should be considered is the threat that microplastics may pose to aquatic biodiversity plastic debris offers a new colonization substrate for organisms and a durable dispersal medium for several organisms raising their dispersion capacity as plastics can be transported by winds and currents over long distances the dispersion of debris containing epiplastic organisms may cause the transport of alien species and changes in aquatic biogeographical patterns dudek et al 2020 kettner et al 2019 barnes 2002 has estimated that human litter the majority being plastic more than doubles the rafting opportunities for biota which could endanger aquatic biodiversity considering microalgae concerns have been stated regarding harmful bloom forming organisms such as some species of dinoflagellates or cyanobacteria amaral zettler et al 2020 masó et al 2016 the increasing colonization opportunities provided by the presence of microplastics in aquatic ecosystems can allow the colonization of microalgae able to produce toxins synthesized for defense from predation which can lead to harmful algal blooms habs with consequent negative impacts on aquatic ecosystem services and thus representing a pressing environmental and human health problem for instance the presence of the cyanobacterium of the genus phormidium has been widely reported on microplastic surfaces which is a cosmopolitan genus found in diverse substrates and habitats in both oligotrophic and eutrophic conditions under favorable hydrological and environmental conditions phormidium forms cohesive mats that can cover large areas and species belonging to this genus can produce a range of cyanotoxins such as the neuromuscular blocking anatoxin a atx and homoanatoxin a htx and their structural derivatives causing habs mcallister et al 2016 6 conclusion and future research recommendations different studies have reported that plastics can and do interact with microalgae which represent the base of the aquatic food web and thus play a key role in marine and freshwater ecosystems however studies investigating the relationships between plastic debris and microalgae are still scarce especially in freshwater systems therefore many aspects as described in previous sections require further research and fundamental gaps exist in the current state of knowledge regarding this subject the available literature has suggested that the epiplastic community of microalgae consistently differs from the surrounding aquatic communities however it is still not clear whether such differences in colonization are linked to the compositions of the surfaces or more to the availability of a hard substrate on which organisms can attach and grow thus further studies are required to address this question furthermore we need to better understand to what extent the properties of different plastic materials and different environmental factors which can also act synergistically may affect the growth of microalgae on plastic debris in particular field studies on microplastic colonization by microalgae are especially missing for freshwater environments therefore future studies taking as an indication the information gathered from previous studies performed in marine systems should address this topic the colonization and hetero aggregation between microplastics and microalgae lead to changes in particle buoyance thus resulting in settling and influencing the fate and bioavailability of plastics in surface waters at the same time microplastics can harm microalgae by inhibiting their growth reducing chlorophyll and photosynthesis and causing changes in morphology as reported previous research regarding the toxic effects that plastic can exert on microalgae is controversial and thus it is not clear whether these effects are of concern for microalgae the difficulty in obtaining a clear answer is linked to the several confounding factors e g microplastic dose features and size in laboratory experiments resulting in conflicting results on plastic toxicity thus future studies need to clarify the differences in effects of microplastics on primary producers due to microalgae species and the properties of plastic materials e g polymer type chemical composition weathering condition surface charge and size most of these studies have tested high concentrations of plastic particles thus not accurately reproducing the current environmental concentrations reported in studies investigating the occurrence of plastic in marine and freshwater systems however the concentrations of these pollutants are expected to increase in the near future and so testing higher concentrations can provide important insight into the future situation furthermore the transport via the rafting of the microalgae themselves is also of concern as this community is distinct from that of the surrounding water with potential impacts such as the introduction of harmful or non native algae into new environments potentially impairing local aquatic biodiversity the effects that microplastics can have on the biodiversity of microalgae with subsequent cascading effects on entire aquatic ecosystems have not yet been fully considered therefore future studies should attempt to include and evaluate this theme as highlighted in this review the largest gap in the current knowledge is our understanding of the ecosystem implications of the microplastic microalgae relationships although some attempts have been made to address this issue the effects that plastic debris can have on aquatic ecosystems which are already affected by other anthropogenic impacts such as climate change eutrophication and food web alteration remain unclear when experimental results indicate reciprocal impacts between plastics and microalgae it is difficult to predict how these impacts manifest themselves at the ecosystem level for instance the effects that microplastics have on algal photosynthesis the hormesis phenomenon linked to the leachates of additives or the alteration of microalgae lipid and fatty acid composition could trigger subsequent effects throughout the whole aquatic ecosystem further investigations are urgently needed as this theme is of pivotal importance for aquatic environments and their ecosystem services future studies should take into account the results reported from the different laboratory studies in order to prioritize research questions and test the same hypotheses in real systems the effect that microplastic microalgae interactions can have on the primary productivity of aquatic ecosystems which may be negatively or positively affected should be studied in particular quantitative estimations are needed modeling approaches can be useful to test the broad scale consequences of different scenarios of plastic pollution however it is important to validate these models and so realistic in field observations are needed to improve their performance however the results of in field studies may be difficult to interpret due to the many possible confounding factors thus a useful tool that can be used for testing the consequences of microplastic microalgae interactions for aquatic ecosystems can be represented by mesocosms including artificial ponds or enclosures in natural environments these are physical models of natural systems which allow for the controlling of experimental conditions for

17386,with the widespread occurrence of microplastics in aquatic ecosystems having been firmly established the focus of research has shifted towards the assessments of their influence on ecosystem functions and food webs this includes interactions between microplastics and microalgae as fundamental components at the base of aquatic food webs and pivotal organisms in a wide range of ecosystem functions in this review we present the current state of knowledge on microalgae microplastic interactions and summarize the potential effect on their respective fate microplastics can and do interact with microalgae and the available literature has suggested that the epiplastic community of microalgae differs consistently from the surrounding aquatic communities however it is still not clear whether this different colonization is linked to the composition of the surface or more to the availability of a hard substrate on which organisms can attach and grow further studies are needed to understand to what extent the properties of different plastic materials and different environmental factors may affect the growth of microalgae on plastic debris biofouling may alter microplastic properties especially increasing their density consequently affecting the vertical fluxes of plastics moreover microplastics may have toxic effects on microalgae which could be physical or related to chemical interactions with plasticizers or other chemicals associated with plastics with consequences for algal growth photosynthetic activity and morphology microplastics seems to have the potential to affect not only the quality e g fatty acids and lipids composition food dilution effect but also the quantity of algal production both positively and negatively this may have consequences for energy fluxes which may propagate throughout the whole food web and alter aquatic productivity even though experimental results have indicated reciprocal impacts between plastics and microalgae it is currently difficult to predict how these impacts may manifest themselves at the ecosystem level therefore further studies are needed to address this important topic graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords plastic phytoplankton colonization cyanobacteria diatom epiplastic community 1 introduction plastic has become an inherent part of daily life and millions of tons of plastic material are manufactured globally every year due to the broad application of plastic in many different sectors and its long lasting characteristics the amount of plastic litter has increased dramatically over the last few decades in both aquatic and terrestrial environments galafassi et al 2019 the slow breakdown of plastic items produces successively smaller pieces called microplastics mps a term that is now commonly used to define particles whose larger dimension is lower than 5 mm van cauwenberghe et al 2015 agreement on this higher limit of the microplastic range 5 mm is quite consistent throughout the literature however some researchers have recently suggested different thresholds e g 1 mm hartmann et al 2019 besides the microplastics derived from the degradation of larger plastic items i e secondary mps mps can also be specifically manufactured in the micrometer size range i e primary mps for instance those used in industrial abrasives for sandblasting plastic pre production pellets nurdles or microbeads in personal care products horton et al 2017 the term plastic includes many different polymers but the most abundant classes of polymers detected in aquatic environments are polyethylene pe polypropylene pp polystyrene ps polyester pest polyamide pa and acrylic this is not surprising given the fact that these materials constitute a major proportion of global plastic production and are widely used in short life cycle products erni cassola et al 2019 different plastic polymers have different chemical and physical properties and depending on their composition density and shape can be buoyant neutrally buoyant or sink in aquatic systems cole et al 2011 in particular the density of most common plastic polymers ranges from 0 85 to 1 41 g cm3 and as this range includes materials of lower equal or higher density than sea and freshwater microplastics can be easily distributed throughout the water column the density can determine whether a particle occupies a pelagic versus benthic transport route microplastics with a density greater than that of water sink into sediments where they accumulate while those with low density float on surfaces cole et al 2011 woodall et al 2014 moreover an increase in density through biofouling by organisms can eventually result in sinking of microplastics auta et al 2017 microplastic occurrence in the marine environment has been documented in almost every open and enclosed sea habitat extending from surface water to deep sea sediments and from the equator to the polar regions peng et al 2017 recent estimates suggest that 4 85 trillion microplastic particles are floating in the global ocean eriksen et al 2014 the majority of the research about microplastics has focused on seawater environments while less than 4 of microplastic related studies concern freshwater environments li et al 2018 this limited information however has revealed that the abundance of microplastics in freshwater is comparable to that in marine environments li et al 2018 peng et al 2017 with the widespread occurrence of microplastics in aquatic ecosystems now firmly established focus has been shifting towards the assessment of their influences on ecosystem functions and food webs despite growing research efforts understanding of the ecological implications that the presence of microplastics may have on aquatic ecosystems particularly regarding lower trophic levels e g phytoplankton are still largely unknown bryant et al 2016 different studies have already reported that microplastics can and do interact with aquatic microalgae and this has impacts on their respective fates long et al 2015 yokota et al 2017 microplastic surfaces constitute suitable substrates for the formation of biofilms amaral zettler et al 2020 mccormick et al 2014 and microalgae are an important constituent of colonizing biotic communities yokota et al 2017 the growth of microalgae on plastic surfaces is important for the plastic degradation process either having potential for biodegradation or on the contrary protecting plastics from ultraviolet radiation and photo catalysis carson et al 2013 moreover microplastics could potentially be incorporated along with microalgae into hetero aggregates with associated changes in buoyance thus resulting in settling and influencing the fate and bioavailability of mps carson et al 2013 long et al 2015 at the same time microalgae may suffer toxic effects as inhabitants of pelagic areas contaminated with microplastics with consequences for their growth photosynthetic activity and changes in morphology fu et al 2019 mao et al 2018 zhao et al 2019 in addition transport via rafting of the microalgae themselves is also of concern as this community is distinct from that of the surrounding water with potential impacts such as the introduction of harmful or non native algae into new environments carson et al 2013 masó et al 2016 thus the interactions between microplastics and microalgae may also be relevant at the ecosystem level with possible implications for the productivity of aquatic ecosystems which have already been affected by other anthropogenic impacts such as climate change eutrophication and food web alterations troost et al 2018 yokota et al 2017 given the importance of microalgae and the global occurrence of microplastic fragments in aquatic systems a review on the topic is required in order to identify the potential mechanisms of interaction as well as to guide further inquiries for this reason we conducted a broad and wide ranging literature review analyzing around 80 peer reviewed papers from 1972 to 2020 most of which 67 were published from 2018 onwards indicating the growing interest for this topic we synthesize the current state of knowledge on microalgae microplastic relationships addressing the different aspects of these interactions the specific objectives are i to analyze whether some taxa of microalgae may preferentially colonize microplastic surfaces and to identify the features and extent of such colonization ii to synthesize the environmental factors affecting microplastic colonization by microalgae iii to discuss the consequences of colonization by microalgae on the fate and characteristics of microplastics iv to summarize the effects that microplastics may exert on microalgae and v to evaluate the effects of the interaction between microplastics and microalgae at the ecosystem level moreover we comment on potential future questions and research directions needed to further define the implications of the relationships between microalgae and these concerning pollutants 2 microplastic colonization 2 1 plastic as a surface for colonization there now exists a large body of evidence that microplastics are abundant and widespread in both marine and freshwater environments horton et al 2017 jiang 2018 van cauwenberghe et al 2015 and different studies have reported that mps can be colonized by a wide range of organisms biofouling carson et al 2013 reisser et al 2014 microplastics harbor a distinct biota and represent a new habitat for rafting organisms to the point that the term plastisphere was coined by zettler et al 2013 to define the diverse community of heterotrophs autotrophs predators and symbionts on the surface of plastic debris the first study on plastic colonization dated back to the beginning of the 1970 when an investigation in the sargasso sea surface revealed the presence of microalgae in particular diatoms attached to the surface of plastic carpenter and smith 1972 this early study relied primarily on microscopy but at present the application of modern molecular methods especially high throughput dna sequencing is used to increase our understanding of the diverse micro organisms inhabiting the plastisphere amaral zettler et al 2020 while heterotrophic bacteria tend to be the focus of plastisphere research the presence of both prokaryotic and eukaryotic autotrophs within the biofilm has been documented yokota et al 2017 there is a growing field of research focused on the colonization process of microplastics by microalgae but many questions are yet to be addressed carson et al 2013 it has been widely reported that the community growing on plastic debris differs consistently from the surrounding free living organisms bryant et al 2016 dussud et al 2018a kesy et al 2019 oberbeckmann et al 2014 zettler et al 2013 in general the dichotomy between particle attached pa and free living fl micro organisms has been widely documented in several studies across different aquatic biomes and thus the discrepancies among organisms attached to plastic debris and planktonic communities may be not strictly linked to the composition of the surface but more to the availability of a substrate on which organisms can attach to and grow oberbeckmann et al 2016 it is likely that many taxa use plastic opportunistically as a niche but can also attach to other substrates oberbeckmann et al 2016 however experimental studies have reported differences in the communities found on plastic surfaces compared to other substrates such as glass which is usually used as a control substrate as it is inert vosshage et al 2018 during a short term two week experiment in which plastic particles polyethylene polypropylene and polystyrene and glass beads were exposed to brackish water from a coastal bay under controlled conditions ogonowski et al 2018 found that the plastic associated communities were distinctly different from those of the non plastic substrates suggesting substrate driven selection the same result was reported for a 6 week exposure experiment in the north sea uk with polyethylene terephthalate pet bottles and glass slides as reference samples in which marked differences were reported in the community isolated from the two substrates with at least 57 divergence and where several biofilm members were detected solely on one of the surfaces suggesting a preference for plastic or glass oberbeckmann et al 2014 additional studies in the same location reported no significant difference between glass and pet attached communities oberbeckmann et al 2016 thus highlighting that this topic remains controversial vosshage et al 2018 exposed different plastic materials 28 48 mm for 49 days in a shallow highly productive lake and found a significant difference in the volume of algae and biofilm height compared to glass substrate only for polymethyl methacrylate pmma and not for polycarbonate pc several cohort studies have indicated that the colonization process can vary depending on the plastic polymer used for instance lagarde et al 2016 highlighted differences in long term colonization between high density polyethylene hdpe and polypropylene pp zettler et al 2013 reported slight differences in organism richness associated with polyethylene pe and polypropylene pp on a wide range of plastic marine debris collected at multiple locations after long residence times in the environment and li et al 2019 found significantly higher biomass on polystyrene ps than on other plastic polymers indicating an influence of polymer composition on the biofilm formation despite these research efforts a systematic examination of the colonization process occurring on different plastic polymers is still lacking indeed the term plastics include a wide variety of polymers with different chemical composition and properties even for the same type of polymer the chemical composition may vary considerably depending on the chemical additives lagarde et al 2016 as the surface chemistry of the substrate is often not established its influence on the colonization process generally can not be determined cooksey and wigglesworth cooksey 1995 differences highlighted in plastic colonization processes may be partially explained by bearing in mind that different polymers even if falling into the umbrella term plastic are materials with distinct features a fundamental role in the process of colonization of plastic substrate by microalgae is played by the extracellular polymeric substances eps which provides an attractive force maintaining cells together and attaching aggregates and cells to biotic or abiotic surfaces it has been argued that different polymers stimulate the production of eps in different quantities and or with different composition thus determining variability in the cohesiveness of biofilms and ultimately in the biomass of colonizing organisms lagarde et al 2016 it is worth mentioning that the studies reported above described experiments performed in both freshwater and marine environments however different hydrological hydrodynamic physico chemical and species compositions characterize these two systems therefore biofilm attachment on the surface of microplastics in freshwater may show different features e g biomass type and quantity of eps compared to those in the sea chen et al 2019 such that the results obtained for marine systems should be extended to freshwater environments and vice versa with caution moreover it should also be noted that the colonization experiments listed encompassed studies of different durations whose variation may influence the process and the conclusions drawn the major part of the studies was conducted over short time scales however considering that synthetic polymers can persist over long periods in natural aquatic environments incubation over longer timescales may allow for mimicking more realistic conditions kirstein et al 2018 in addition a distinction in the analysis of the different phases of biofilm development is needed as only the initial recruits have direct contact with the polymer surface in contrast later recruits are more likely to interact with existing biofilm members and the abiotic components of the surrounding environment dudek et al 2020 oberbeckmann et al 2016 therefore when the different phases of development are studied collectively only generalized insights about the plastic associated community can be obtained besides many other factors likely influence the colonization process among others the age and the time that plastic material spends in the environment play an important role aging produces alterations of the plastic surface and wrinkles rough and fractured surface textures can be observed on aged microplastics fu et al 2019 this has consequences for colonization indeed it has been reported that the surface roughness of particles is positively related to the density of attached microalgae carson et al 2013 aging processes can also vary the hydrophobicity of the different particles which may have consequences on biofouling processes as well as several articles have acknowledged that high energy surfaces hydrophilic surfaces tend to favor biofilm growth dussud et al 2018a finally environmental factors and seasonal variations which exert effects on primary producers in general may influence colonizing processes see section 2 2 2 2 environmental factors and seasonal variations as the growth and development of primary producers are dependent on several environmental factors the colonization process on plastic substrates is influenced by their variations over time furthermore biofilms are shaped to adapt to local conditions and environmental factors determine a cell s decision to form or leave a biofilm toyofuku et al 2016 several studies have shown that biogeography plays an important role in the composition of mp colonizing communities amaral zettler et al 2015 oberbeckmann et al 2014 but there is still debate among researchers as to whether substrate specific properties or environmental factors prevail in shaping microorganism assemblages on plastic materials it is not clear whether the plastic surface environment may exert a strong enough selection to drive species sorting in order to overcome other niche defining factors driven by seasonal and spatial patterns thus it is important to study which environmental factors exert the strongest selective pressure and how their synergic relationships can shape plastic colonizing communities despite inter and intra site variability there is a clear dearth of consensus among researchers that some factors with greater influence on plastic colonization can be identified among these temperature plays a role in the settlement and growth of the colonizing community as higher temperatures within the optimum range increase cell metabolism resulting in the rapid development of the attached organisms indeed seasonal differences driven by temperature variations have been observed in the plastic colonization processes oberbeckmann et al 2014 highlighted the highest and the lowest overall mean diversity of pet plastisphere communities in a marine environment in summer and winter respectively conceptually similar work has also been carried out in a freshwater lake by chen et al 2019 who studying the biofilm development on polypropylene sheets in four seasons pointed out that biofilm developed at a different rate in different seasons with the highest biofilm biomass per unit area in summer and the lowest in winter a pivotal role of salinity has also been recognized which is known to shape communities in aquatic environments dussud et al 2018b kesy et al 2019 oberbeckmann et al 2018 exposure of five types of plastic debris polyvinyl chloride polypropylene polyethylene polystyrene and polyurethane in the haihe estuary highlighted that salinity had a negative correlation with the average growth rate of the biofilm and a positive correlation with the diversity of the colonizing community li et al 2019 confirming the results reported in previous studies kesy et al 2019 oberbeckmann et al 2018 besides temperature and salinity nutrients are likely to influence plastic colonization where an increase in nutrients is usually associated with greater biodiversity on the plastic attached community li et al 2019 oberbeckmann et al 2018 different environmental parameters and their variation over time can shape and select the community which is able to colonize the plastic surface for instance photosynthetic organisms cannot be found where there is no light irradiance chen et al 2019 moreover it should be taken into account that there is a constant interplay of different environmental parameters the combinations of which affect biofilm development however the previous research has obtained mixed results in terms of the impact of environmental factors for instance no effects of geographical location or environmental factors were highlighted on the community assemblages developed on plastics sampled in the western mediterranean basin dussud et al 2018b we postulate that these contradictory results may likely be caused by different experimental designs e g polymer considered or analytical methodologies differences in temporal and spatial scale considered and the intrinsic diversity in the systems studied to the best of our knowledge factors such as hydrodynamic features physical disturbance or solar radiation have not been taken into account in the studies performed to date 2 3 microalgae taxa colonizing plastic debris bacteria usually represent the most studied organisms in the colonization process of plastic materials among them organisms belonging to the photosynthetic phylum of cyanobacteria have been widely reported as a group with the capability to colonize plastic debris bryant et al 2016 chen et al 2019 oberbeckmann et al 2014 they have been shown to dominate in many plastisphere communities table 1 and may play an important role in the ecological processes occurring in biofilms on plastic oberbeckmann et al 2014 their occurrence and importance on plastic surfaces have also been reported in freshwater systems yokota et al 2017 as colonial and filamentous cyanobacteria are able to produce cyanotoxins and are frequently the cause of harmful algal bloom hab in fresh and marine waters yokota et al 2017 their interactions with microplastics can have consequences and implications at the ecosystem level see section 5 among the most frequent taxa detected cyanobacteria of the filamentous genus phormidium are commonly found as part of plastic colonizing communities with studies attesting to their occurrence in the north atlantic debroas et al 2017 zettler et al 2013 north pacific bryant et al 2016 and north sea oberbeckmann et al 2016 2014 other marine and freshwater cyanobacteria that have been reported to colonize plastic surfaces belong to the following orders chroococcales genus microcystis oscillatoriales genus rivularia nostocales genera calothrix and scytonema pleurocapsales genus pleurocapsa and synechococcales genera synechococcus prochlorothrix and leptolyngbya bryant et al 2016 debroas et al 2017 dussud et al 2018b muthukrishnan et al 2019 due to their high ecological plasticity cyanobacteria are capable of adapting to several conditions and changes occurring in the environment leoni et al 2014b marti et al 2015 nava et al 2017 therefore their ability to colonize plastic substrates in a wide range of different environments is not surprising diatoms typically join cyanobacteria among the photosynthetic representatives that are able to colonize plastic surfaces amaral zettler et al 2020 most studies have shown that diatoms are common and omnipresent residents of the plastisphere table 1 at least on plastics that are exposed to sunlight being able to firmly attach to plastic and resist water turbulence and wave action reisser et al 2014 for instance carson et al 2013 who studied small plastic items from the surface of the north pacific gyre reported that pennate diatoms were among the most abundant organisms around one thousand individuals mm 2 the same result was highlighted for marine plastic debris collected from pelagic and benthic habitats across the mediterranean coastal waters of greece italy and spain reporting that diatoms appeared on almost 100 of the sampled plastic debris masó et al 2016 a study examining the types of organisms inhabiting the surfaces of 68 small marine plastics median size equal to 3 2 mm from inshore and offshore waters around the australian continent tropical to temperate areas reported that diatoms were the most diverse group of plastic colonizers growing both flat on the surface of plastic materials and erect being attached by mucous pads or stalks reisser et al 2014 all of these studies have employed sem analysis to identify the colonizing organisms additional studies performing dna metabarcoding on plastic communities highlighted the presence of diatoms on plastic surfaces debroas et al 2017 kettner et al 2019 oberbeckmann et al 2016 2014 despite that in some cases diatom clades did not make up more than 1 of the eukaryotic rrna genes due to their low biomass as opposed to the number of individuals compared to the other eukaryotes bryant et al 2016 a high density of diatoms is typically reported on plastic surfaces and even if their biomass contribution may be low the presence of many different species of diatoms is often recognized thus they importantly contribute to the overall biodiversity of the plastic associated community among the most recurring and abundant taxa of diatoms in marine and freshwater systems are species of the genera achnantes amphora cocconeis navicula and nitzschia lacerda et al 2019 masó et al 2016 oberbeckmann et al 2014 reisser et al 2014 zettler et al 2013 many of these are known biofilm forming taxa in aquatic environments in general diatoms are reported to be among the first recruits in the colonization of different substrata debroas et al 2017 eich et al 2015 oberbeckmann et al 2016 after the formation of a conditioning layer by bacteria surfaces are usually colonized by diatoms however it has been reported that diatoms may also directly attach to virgin surfaces khandeparker et al 2014 however it still remains unclear whether an obligate succession of organisms can be determined on the plastic surface or if it is an artifact due to the method of analysis used cooksey and wigglesworth cooksey 1995 regardless of the sequence it is generally agreed that diatoms represent a fundamental step in biofouling influencing the subsequent colonization process khandeparker et al 2014 oberbeckmann et al 2016 several studies have reported the presence of thecate and athecate dinoflagellates table 1 such as alexandrium sp ceratium sp and prorocentrum sp on plastic surface with the occurrence of harmful species kettner et al 2019 masó et al 2016 reisser et al 2014 zettler et al 2013 the presence of organisms belonging to chlorophyta cryptophyta and chrysophyta have also been sporadically reported chen et al 2019 debroas et al 2017 lacerda et al 2019 masó et al 2016 3 effects of microalgae on microplastics interactions between microalgae and plastic debris can significantly alter the properties of these polymers with consequences on their fate in aquatic environments yokota et al 2017 the different processes that have been reported in literature can be summarized in two main categories the alteration and or biodegradation of the plastic polymer and the alteration of the polymer density and sinking behavior fig 1 a different studies have reported that the biofouling processes of microplastics may significantly alter their properties and in particular their adsorption capability seems to generally be enhanced kalčíková et al 2020 for instance wang et al 2020 reported that the physical and chemical surface properties of pe microplastics were changed with the development of biofilm which resulted in different adsorption properties of microplastics for copper and tetracycline holmes et al 2014 observed that metal adsorption was considerably greater in aged pellets than new polyethylene pellets furthermore it has been observed that ions adsorbed from water onto biofilms were less intensively bound than to ion exchange polymers and thus the ions are more easily desorbed leached from the biofilm kalčíková et al 2020 kurniawan et al 2012 therefore the adhesion of microalgae on microplastic surfaces is of critical importance in the adsorption and desorption of pollutants from microplastics the capability of micro organisms to biodegrade plastic using plastic as a carbon source has been reported for numerous bacterial strains although most of the studies performed were based on the selection and testing of single strains in laboratory which is far from environmental conditions jacquin et al 2019 among primary producers the filamentous cyanobacteria of the genus phormidium are known to degrade hydrocarbons oberbeckmann et al 2016 the occurrence of species belonging to this genus on plastic surfaces has been widely documented see section 2 3 this raises an interesting possibility that phormidium in the plastisphere may be actively hydrolyzing the plastic yokota et al 2017 however as cyanobacteria are photosynthetic organisms the advantage of higher exposure to sunlight on floating plastic pieces may be the actual explanation for their enrichment on plastic debris roager and sonnenschein 2019 even if microalgae may not have a direct effect on the degradation of plastic their presence can be important in determining the presence of other hydrocarbon degrading bacteria and it has been argued that diatoms may function as an important habitat for such micro organisms dudek et al 2020 at the same time the biofouling of extensive surfaces may have an opposite effect protecting the plastic from uv radiation and thus retarding photo degradation processes andrady 2011 another important role played by microalgae concerning plastic materials is linked to their capacity to alter the density of the colonized polymer which consequently affects the vertical fluxes of plastics chen et al 2019 performed an experiment in a freshwater system and highlighted the changes in the buoyancy of polypropylene sheets squares with a side length of 5 and 10 mm following the development of microalgae biofilms it has been reported that microplastics could potentially be incorporated into hetero aggregates composed of algae and small plastic materials but this process remains little studied and thus is largely unpredictable several studies on microalgae have demonstrated significant interactions and the rapid formation of hetero aggregates when microalgae were exposed to 400 1000 μm diameter polypropylene and high density polyethylene microplastics at a concentration of 1 g l 1 lagarde et al 2016 2 mm polystyrene at 3 96 μg l 1 long et al 2017 and microbeads from cosmetic products at around 4000 microbeads l 1 möhlenkamp et al 2018 long et al 2015 performed a lab experiment to study this interaction using three types of aggregates formed from two different algae species the diatom chaetoceros neogracile the cryptophyte rhodomonas salina and a mix of them and 2 μm polystyrene microbeads the experiment highlighted that all three types of aggregates concentrated the microbeads once incorporated the microbeads impacted aggregate sinking rates reaching several hundred meters per day a high value compared to the sinking rate of free beads less than 4 mm day 1 these results support the idea that phytoplankton aggregates act as a potential mp sink however the extent to which different species form such aggregates is not the same and dissimilarities were also reported for different plastic polymers in other studies lagarde et al 2016 many factors play a role in the hetero aggregation process for instance major aggregate permeability increases the encounter chance between small particles and aggregates as the small particles are not moved away from the aggregate but can go through aggregate macropores and be caught moreover when an aggregate breaks new surfaces and macropores become available for microbeads to adhere to where a succession of fragmentation and coagulation allows microbeads to be incorporated not only at the aggregate surface or in macropores but also into the entire aggregate long et al 2015 resuspension processes can also occur where several factors of the aggregates such as size density porosity shape and stickiness play roles in determining the resuspension behavior of aggregates following settling möhlenkamp et al 2018 moreover hetero aggregates can also include inorganic material which both substantially enhance the settling velocity and determine lesser mobility once deposited in bottom layers möhlenkamp et al 2018 the studies reported have provided interesting insight about the hetero aggregation and the subsequent effects of microalgae on plastic debris but they were all performed at a lab scale and environmental conditions may widely differ from those tested for instance monospecific aggregates are unlikely to exist in nature and turbulence can quickly breaks up the hetero aggregates lagarde et al 2016 4 effects of microplastics on microalgae microalgae may experience toxic effects as inhabitants of pelagic areas contaminated with plastic debris furthermore as primary producers essential to the functioning of aquatic ecosystems casado et al 2013 small disruptions of microalgae populations may contribute to serious impacts on food webs fig 1b however the effects and toxicity of microplastics have seldom been determined in microalgae and the current experimental results offer no consensus table 2 one of the endpoints frequently measured is the effect on microalgal growth on which microplastics seem to have a negligible impact lagarde et al 2016 long et al 2017 sjollema et al 2016 even if some studies have reported effects after exposure to high concentrations of microplastics or small sized particles gambardella et al 2018 sjollema et al 2016 venâncio et al 2019 zhang et al 2017 zhao et al 2019 these findings point out two important aspects that should be taken into account the relevance of the concentration and the features of the plastic particles tested the characteristics of the microplastic used can play a fundamental role in determining the toxicity exerted besides the wide variety of polymers and additives that can be tested other features such as the size and the charge of the plastic particles may be of paramount importance in their effect on organisms the relationship among particle dimension and toxicity has been widely observed and it is generally agreed that smaller dimensions lead to higher toxicity in microalgae chae et al 2019 garrido et al 2019 very small particles may be more likely to inhibit the growth of microalgae through adsorption on the surface of the algal cell for instance inducing shading blocking algal pores or gas exchanges and embedding in microalgae cells fu et al 2019 zhang et al 2017 additionally the surface ionic charge of microplastics seems to affect their toxicity weathering and degradation processes such as photo oxidation which can lead to carbonyl group formation bellingeri et al 2019 can change the ionic charge of the microplastic surface furthermore it has been shown that detrimental effects on microalgae growth were found only when exposing micro organisms to positively charged particles while to the contrary no impacts were reported in the same experimental conditions for uncharged particles e g feng et al 2019 the effects may differ not only due to the types of polymers but also from the various responses of different microalgal species it is likely that interactions between microplastics and microalgae may vary with cell characteristics such as size and shape as algal cell walls act as barriers to particle penetration and different cell wall characteristics may consequently influence particle sorption chae et al 2019 fu et al 2019 toxic effects on microalgae may not only be physical but also related to interactions with the chemicals associated with plastics indeed mps can potentially transfer contaminants adsorbed onto their surface residual unpolymerized monomers deriving from incomplete polymerization reactions or additives which may represent a high percentage of the final plastic materials see e g hermabessiere et al 2017 maity and pramanick 2020 most additives are not covalently bound to the plastic polymer and thus they can migrate to the material surface potentially being released into the environment capolupo et al 2020 investigated the effects of plastic leachates on the microalgae raphidocelis subcapitata freshwater and skeletonema costatum marine reporting that quite all of the leachates i e benzothiazole phthalide acetophenone cobalt zinc lead inhibited algal growth however it has been hypothesized that the leaching of some additives which are usually released at low concentration may also stimulate the growth of microalgae due to a hormesis phenomenon chae et al 2019 song et al 2020 besides the effects on microalgae growth studies have found that microplastics seem to affect algal photosynthesis as both chlorophyll content fu et al 2019 prata et al 2018 zhang et al 2017 and photosynthetic efficiency mao et al 2018 zhang et al 2017 decreased under microplastic exposure moreover microplastics may induce morphological changes in microalgae mao et al 2018 modulate the energy metabolism by decreasing the oil bodies that could serve as energy sources seoane et al 2019 and may be ingested and internalized by mixotrophic algal species through phagocytosis processes long et al 2017 however many of the effects experienced by microalgae appear to be temporary with an initial period of vulnerability followed by adaptative responses leading to recovery prata et al 2019 and references therein different mechanisms of detoxification have been hypothesized to influence the recovery reported in microalgae activities such as membrane thickening reduction of surface exposure through homo aggregation and hetero aggregation mao et al 2018 prata et al 2019 with respect to the latter point it has been reported that the bioavailability of plastic particles changed during the different experiments due to adsorption to experimental containers or embedding in organic aggregates this underlines the need to quantify the bioavailability and distribution of mps in the experimental systems in order to obtain accurate values of the actual mp concentration to which the microalgae are truly exposed long et al 2017 a recent laboratory study has suggested that microplastics may also affect microalgae lipid and fatty acid composition which are important dietary components for primary consumers as a source of energy and essential nutrients guschina et al 2020 indeed the exposure of chlorella sorokiniana to polystyrene microplastics 70 μm 60 mg l resulted in the alteration of essential fatty acids major structural compounds in algal cell membranes and chloroplast galactolipids which have important functions in photosynthesis these findings raise questions about the impact of microplastics on algal productivity and the transfer of important lipid compounds through food webs thus requiring further investigation it is important to stress that the ecological relevance of laboratory observations is likely to be low as they are far from reflecting the complexity of the aquatic environment in which we must consider non equilibrium conditions large volumes lower algal cell concentrations the co existence of different microalgal species different polymers sizes doses and so on long et al 2017 sjollema et al 2016 moreover in nature mixtures of microplastic with different contaminants can also occur see e g davarpanah and guilhermino 2019 johansen et al 2019 zhu et al 2019 however studies regarding this topic are still scarce 5 ecosystem implications many of the effects obtained through lab scale experiments as discussed in the previous sections may potentially have consequences on the ecosystem functioning however it is difficult to predict how specific results obtained through laboratory experiments can manifest in real aquatic systems as microalgae are keystone organisms impacts and alterations of such communities can have substantial consequences for the whole aquatic ecosystem wright et al 2013 increasing levels of plastic pollution may not only exert pressure at the individual or population level but additionally may cause cascading secondary effects on the functioning and services of other communities and ultimately on the ecosystem as a whole kong and koelmans 2019 leoni et al 2018 one of the key mechanisms that has been claimed to be crucial is the perturbation effect that the interaction between plastics and microalgae may have on the aquatic food web there are substantial issues regarding whether microplastics affect the quality and quantity of algal production and whether this may propagate through food webs microalgae mixed with plastics may exhibit morphological changes that affect their detectability palatability and ease of handling by grazers lacerda et al 2019 yokota et al 2017 due to biofouling microplastics may become more available for interaction with animals within the water body although many species are able to discriminate between inert and edible particles the developed biofilm camouflages plastic particles thus allowing them to potentially become attractive food items to grazers such as zooplanktonic organisms vroom et al 2017 consequently biofilms may alter the interactions between microplastics and primary consumers increasing ingestion rates of flavored microplastics ingestion of microplastics aggregated with microalgae leads to the dilution of food due to the co ingestion of inert plastic together with regular food or prey kong and koelmans 2019 ecological implications are expected to be triggered especially by the responses of zooplanktonic species which represent the natural predators of algae kong and koelmans 2019 kong and koelmans 2019 applied a theoretical model to investigate the negative impacts of microplastics on food webs the research reported that reduced assimilation rates due to the ingestion of mps resulted in a lower population density of the corresponding organisms considering zooplankton decreased population density lessens the grazing pressure on phytoplankton which leads to increased population sizes of diatoms and green algae in response to the loss of zooplankton planktivorous fish feeding on zooplankton become largely limited thereby restricting the piscivorous fish population consequently benthivores fish start to dominate the fish community reducing the abundance of zoobenthos through predation this results in stronger perturbation on the sediment and increased water turbidity due to resuspension kong and koelmans 2019 despite the model being applied to shallow lakes and using high concentrations of mps 40 and 4000 particles l 1 the results provided valuable insights about how the impact of mps whose concentration is expected to increase in the near future can propagate through whole aquatic systems the decreased quality of algae ingested by zooplanktonic organisms is not the result of the dilution of food with inert particles but also by the direct effects of microplastics on algal quality recent evidence has suggested that microplastics may also affect the lipid and fatty acid composition of microalgae see section 4 which are critical regulators of the survival reproduction and population growth in invertebrates and fish as polyunsaturated fatty acids are highly retained during transfer through aquatic food webs any factors affecting their quantity and quality in phytoplankton may affect the growth reproductive capacity and fitness of aquatic invertebrates and fish guschina et al 2020 leoni et al 2014 furthermore microplastics may exert potential effects on the quantity of algal production as plastic debris provides an abundant growth matrix and better floating conditions for microalgae while exerting adverse effects i e toxicity or food dilution on phytoplankton consumers i e zooplankton it has been argued that plastic pollution can promote the multiplication of microalgae in large quantities with consequent detrimental effects for aquatic ecosystems already disturbed by eutrophication processes zhang et al 2020 for instance it has been reported that plastic surface represents a net autotrophic hot spot in the oligotrophic ocean with high density of chlorophyll a and high oxygen production bryant et al 2016 thus plastic pollution might affect ecosystem productivity with substantial consequences for those ecosystems that are characterized by oligotrophic conditions to date studies that have attempted to calculate the increase of primary productivity due to the presence of plastic debris are still missing and so quantitative data are not available to determine whether the occurrence of plastic is relevant to the perturbation of primary productivity however an opposite mechanism may be observed microplastics may exert toxic effects on microalgae see section 4 causing a decrease in phytoplankton species and eventually leading to losses in ecosystem productivity this can induce cascading impacts on biodiversity ecosystem services e g fish provisioning which are also influenced by the productivity at lower levels of the trophic chain and cultural services e g tourism and recreation evidences supporting one mechanism over the other are still missing and to the best of our knowledge field and experimental approaches regarding this topic are lacking there is no consensus even about the primary effects that microplastics may have on organisms and so scaling up results to the ecosystem level is complex and it is only possible to postulate some hypotheses about the plausible mechanisms moreover indirect effects can also occur microplastic associated bacteria have the ability to alter the nutrient cycling processes e g increasing the denitrification capability or transforming phosphorus through microbe mediated processes nutrients can be assimilated by plastic materials and then released into the surrounding water altering the nutrient concentration and thus affecting primary producers chen et al 2020 therefore microplastics seem to be able to interact with several biotic and abiotic factors creating new micro ecosystems in which both nutrients and primary producers can be concentrated and not dispersed into the pelagic environment as previously discussed the colonization of microplastics by microalgae adds additional weight to the plastic particles facilitating the sedimentation and burial of these pollutants thus microplastics can influence energy fluxes not only in the pelagic compartments but also in benthonic environments where they may negatively affect the general fitness of benthonic organisms bellasi et al 2020 another aspect that should be considered is the threat that microplastics may pose to aquatic biodiversity plastic debris offers a new colonization substrate for organisms and a durable dispersal medium for several organisms raising their dispersion capacity as plastics can be transported by winds and currents over long distances the dispersion of debris containing epiplastic organisms may cause the transport of alien species and changes in aquatic biogeographical patterns dudek et al 2020 kettner et al 2019 barnes 2002 has estimated that human litter the majority being plastic more than doubles the rafting opportunities for biota which could endanger aquatic biodiversity considering microalgae concerns have been stated regarding harmful bloom forming organisms such as some species of dinoflagellates or cyanobacteria amaral zettler et al 2020 masó et al 2016 the increasing colonization opportunities provided by the presence of microplastics in aquatic ecosystems can allow the colonization of microalgae able to produce toxins synthesized for defense from predation which can lead to harmful algal blooms habs with consequent negative impacts on aquatic ecosystem services and thus representing a pressing environmental and human health problem for instance the presence of the cyanobacterium of the genus phormidium has been widely reported on microplastic surfaces which is a cosmopolitan genus found in diverse substrates and habitats in both oligotrophic and eutrophic conditions under favorable hydrological and environmental conditions phormidium forms cohesive mats that can cover large areas and species belonging to this genus can produce a range of cyanotoxins such as the neuromuscular blocking anatoxin a atx and homoanatoxin a htx and their structural derivatives causing habs mcallister et al 2016 6 conclusion and future research recommendations different studies have reported that plastics can and do interact with microalgae which represent the base of the aquatic food web and thus play a key role in marine and freshwater ecosystems however studies investigating the relationships between plastic debris and microalgae are still scarce especially in freshwater systems therefore many aspects as described in previous sections require further research and fundamental gaps exist in the current state of knowledge regarding this subject the available literature has suggested that the epiplastic community of microalgae consistently differs from the surrounding aquatic communities however it is still not clear whether such differences in colonization are linked to the compositions of the surfaces or more to the availability of a hard substrate on which organisms can attach and grow thus further studies are required to address this question furthermore we need to better understand to what extent the properties of different plastic materials and different environmental factors which can also act synergistically may affect the growth of microalgae on plastic debris in particular field studies on microplastic colonization by microalgae are especially missing for freshwater environments therefore future studies taking as an indication the information gathered from previous studies performed in marine systems should address this topic the colonization and hetero aggregation between microplastics and microalgae lead to changes in particle buoyance thus resulting in settling and influencing the fate and bioavailability of plastics in surface waters at the same time microplastics can harm microalgae by inhibiting their growth reducing chlorophyll and photosynthesis and causing changes in morphology as reported previous research regarding the toxic effects that plastic can exert on microalgae is controversial and thus it is not clear whether these effects are of concern for microalgae the difficulty in obtaining a clear answer is linked to the several confounding factors e g microplastic dose features and size in laboratory experiments resulting in conflicting results on plastic toxicity thus future studies need to clarify the differences in effects of microplastics on primary producers due to microalgae species and the properties of plastic materials e g polymer type chemical composition weathering condition surface charge and size most of these studies have tested high concentrations of plastic particles thus not accurately reproducing the current environmental concentrations reported in studies investigating the occurrence of plastic in marine and freshwater systems however the concentrations of these pollutants are expected to increase in the near future and so testing higher concentrations can provide important insight into the future situation furthermore the transport via the rafting of the microalgae themselves is also of concern as this community is distinct from that of the surrounding water with potential impacts such as the introduction of harmful or non native algae into new environments potentially impairing local aquatic biodiversity the effects that microplastics can have on the biodiversity of microalgae with subsequent cascading effects on entire aquatic ecosystems have not yet been fully considered therefore future studies should attempt to include and evaluate this theme as highlighted in this review the largest gap in the current knowledge is our understanding of the ecosystem implications of the microplastic microalgae relationships although some attempts have been made to address this issue the effects that plastic debris can have on aquatic ecosystems which are already affected by other anthropogenic impacts such as climate change eutrophication and food web alteration remain unclear when experimental results indicate reciprocal impacts between plastics and microalgae it is difficult to predict how these impacts manifest themselves at the ecosystem level for instance the effects that microplastics have on algal photosynthesis the hormesis phenomenon linked to the leachates of additives or the alteration of microalgae lipid and fatty acid composition could trigger subsequent effects throughout the whole aquatic ecosystem further investigations are urgently needed as this theme is of pivotal importance for aquatic environments and their ecosystem services future studies should take into account the results reported from the different laboratory studies in order to prioritize research questions and test the same hypotheses in real systems the effect that microplastic microalgae interactions can have on the primary productivity of aquatic ecosystems which may be negatively or positively affected should be studied in particular quantitative estimations are needed modeling approaches can be useful to test the broad scale consequences of different scenarios of plastic pollution however it is important to validate these models and so realistic in field observations are needed to improve their performance however the results of in field studies may be difficult to interpret due to the many possible confounding factors thus a useful tool that can be used for testing the consequences of microplastic microalgae interactions for aquatic ecosystems can be represented by mesocosms including artificial ponds or enclosures in natural environments these are physical models of natural systems which allow for the controlling of experimental conditions for

17387,over the past decade 3d printing or additive manufacturing am technology has seen great advancement in many aspects such as printing resolution speed and cost membranes for water treatment experienced significant breakthroughs owing to the unique benefits of additive manufacturing in particular 3d printing s high degree of freedom in various aspects such as material and prototype design

a bottleneck because there are small dead zones inherent from the mesh design itself schwinge et al 2000 researchers have started investigating new innovative spacer designs to overcome this obstacle but are often faced with difficulty in actual performance evaluations most studies could only rely on computation fluid dynamics cfd balster et al 2006 li et al 2016 liu et al 2015 schwinge et al 2000 xie et al 2014 because it is difficult to fabricate spacers with complex designs which are beyond the capabilities of conventional heat extrusion lee et al 2016b am is a great breakthrough for membrane spacers because its high degree of freedom in design enables the fabrication of complex spacer prototypes ali et al 2019 castillo et al 2019 kerdi et al 2018 siddiqui et al 2016 sreedhar et al 2018 thomas et al 2019 yanar et al 2020 these prototypes can easily be integrated into filtration cells to accurately simulate the filtration conditions within membrane modules for more accurate evaluations a critical review on these 3d printed spacers is needed to analyse their potentials and shortcomings aside from spacers am has also gradually surfaced in membrane fabrication processes conventionally fabrication of ceramic membranes is often costly due to high temperature requirements lee and li 2017 on the other hand fabrication of polymeric membranes requires precise control of many factors such as dope ambience temperature and polymer solvent anti solvent properties and concentration this is often challenging in an open environment as slight changes to these parameters can greatly affect the properties of the final membrane in search of a more cost efficient and consistent technique researchers have adopted am to fabricate membranes am is attractive because some am techniques do not necessarily rely on high temperatures to fabricate the final product the various fabrication parameters can also be better controlled in a close environment within the 3d printer to ensure consistency in fabricated prototypes heated nozzles printing bed and cooling fans are present to regulate the temperature in material extrusion printers uv laser properties i e power scanning speed hatch space can be precisely controlled in material jetting vat photopolymerization powder bed fusion printers this ensures that the model materials can be deposited cured properly according to the desired design for consistency in the fabricated products theoretically am can be a good alternative for sintering and phase inversion processes however the actual prototyping of 3d printed membranes is faced with printing resolution limitations of existing 3d printers which leads to a certain degree of confusion on the feasibility of 3d printing for the water treatment industry in addition upscaling production is also a challenge for 3d printing due to limitations such as small build volume and slow printing speed there is a need to critically review these works on 3d printed membranes not only from a performance perspective but also from an am perspective to understand why the arise of such discrepancies by classifying the works into conventional am direct and indirect and hybrid am it will be clear how hybrid am is different from conventional am and hopefully there will be more consensus of am s role in membrane fabrication for future publications it is clear that research interest in this interdisciplinary field is rapidly growing this literature aims to give a comprehensive and critical overview on the efforts of am specifically for spacers and membranes in the water treatment industry although there are many different kinds of 3d printing techniques it is important to understand why are some more suited for spacer and membrane fabrication some background information on 3d printing processes will be presented and their suitability for membrane and spacer printing will be discussed subsequently works on 3d printed spacers and membranes will be evaluated the works novelty fabrication details and its impact on their respective water treatment process will be presented by classifying how am was used in the fabrication process we can see how am has helped in the overall fabrication process and evaluate its significance especially in the fabrication of membranes hybrid am a multi step fabrication process involving the use of both am and non am processes to fabricate a prototype will be introduced here mainly to address the controversies revolving around 3d printed membranes this paper concludes with some future trends that are likely to take place with am with regards to spacer and membrane fabrication 2 overview of additive manufacturing technology in the past other terms such as additive fabrication rapid prototyping and layered manufacturing were also associated with am chua and leong 2017 this technology was officially defined as additive manufacturing in astm f2792 12a standard terminology for additive manufacturing technologies in 20 120 astm 2012 all am processes follow a standard procedure illustrated in fig 2 to fabricate the final object the whole process begins with file preparation where computer aided design cad software such as solidworks autocad rhino etc is used to draw the desired object in a 3 dimensional space the cad file is then converted into the stereolithography stl format which allows 3d printers to slice the object into cross sections for printing in the subsequent printing step building parameters such as orientation and position as well as technological parameter are finalized before the actual printing process begins when the printing process is done the final step involves post processing procedures such as removal of support materials or polishing and sanding to improve the object s surface finish chua and leong 2017 in light of the booming popularity of am some researchers have misclassified 2d printing or other layer by layer fabrication processes that do not adhere to the standard procedure illustrated in fig 2 as 3d printing perhaps a more suitable terminology for this category should be layer by layer assembly technology chua and leong 2017 or hybrid am hybrid am can be briefly described as multi step fabrication process where 3d printing is used in conjunction with other fabrication methods to achieve the final desired structure more detailed discussions on this matter will be highlighted in the subsequent section it is undeniable that the am technology has experienced huge development in all aspects over the past decade today am is capable of printing a variety of materials such as polymers bagheri saed et al 2020 balli et al 2017 depalma et al 2020 eng et al 2017 garzon hernandez et al 2020 hong et al 2020 kwak et al 2020 lee et al 2017a melchels et al 2010 mohamed et al 2015 pugalendhi et al 2020 quan et al 2020 solomon et al 2020 tumbleston et al 2015 wu et al 2020 yuan et al 2019a zabidi et al 2019 ziaee and crane 2019 metals kuo et al 2020 tan et al 2015 concretes labeaga martínez et al 2017 lim et al 2012 tay et al 2016 wu et al 2016 and biomaterials ackland et al 2017 derakhshanfar et al 2018 murphy and atala 2014 ng et al 2019 this section will focus on the different ways am can be used to fabricate prototypes and also discuss the suitability of various am techniques that can be used for membrane based water treatment 2 1 types of additive manufacturing am can be used to prototype a product in several ways the distinction between direct am indirect am and hybrid am is briefly presented in fig 3 this classification helps to better understand the significance of 3d printing in different types of am processes and aids in the discussion of 3d printing spacers and membranes in the later sections 2 1 1 conventional additive manufacturing direct am and indirect am are categorized under conventional am and have been used to fabricate prototypes since the beginnings of am do et al 2018 hernández córdova et al 2016 taboas et al 2003 the difference between direct am and indirect am is that direct am fabricates the final prototype directly from the printing step while indirect am fabricates a negative mould of the final prototype there is thus a need for an additional moulding step for indirect am to realize the final product indirect am has the benefit of greater material flexibility because materials whose properties are unsuitable for 3d printing i e low viscosity can be fabricated using moulding instead van damme et al 2020 in conventional am the file preparation stage is of utmost importance because the cad model designed should contain features that make the prototype functional in the context of spacers the cad model of spacers should have filaments that alter the flow pattern within a flow channel in the context of membranes the cad model of membranes should have microscopic pores required to perform filtration at the printing stage the printer is selected such that it has sufficient printing resolution to fabricate the prototype according to the cad model designed the quality of the print is determined by deviations of the printed prototype from the cad model lopez et al 2018 the post processing in conventional am should only involve simple support removal or polishing measures 2 1 2 hybrid additive manufacturing hybrid am is commonly associated with metal printing where two or more established manufacturing processes usually additive and subtractive processes are used together to achieve the final desired design surface finish and mechanical properties strong et al 2018 zhu et al 2013 a detailed economic study was done on hybrid am and it highlighted the potential of hybrid am to save production cost and fabrication time on the overall process manogharan et al 2016 for membrane based water treatment it is interesting to note that there were several works which adopted the concept of hybrid am to fabricate ceramic and polymeric membranes al shimmery et al 2019 hwa et al 2018 li et al 2020 lv et al 2017 mazinani et al 2019 ray et al 2020 yuan et al 2019b in this paper we define hybrid am as a fabrication process that uses am in conjunction with other established fabrication processes to make prototypes with functional features depending on the type of membrane am has been used together with processes such as phase inversion dip coating thermal curing thermal sintering and debinding to make the prototypes the main reason of adopting hybrid am instead of direct indirect am today is due to the limited printing resolution of printers most 3d printers can only fabricate features greater than several hundreds of micrometres however the pore size requirement of membranes is in the sub micrometre scale it is thus extremely challenging to directly fabricate a functional membrane solely relying on am processes 2 2 additive manufacturing techniques with the wide range of materials available to 3d printing today it is reasonable to expect a variety of 3d printing techniques suitable for different materials currently there are over 50 different technologies available tan et al 2017 but all can be classifies into 7 different categories summarised in table 1 amongst them material extrusion material jetting powder bed fusion and vat photopolymerization are more commonly used in the prototyping of polymeric spacers via conventional am the other 3 categories binder jetting sheet lamination directed energy deposition were less popular due to limitations of material compatibility comparatively more waste generated in sheet lamination and printing resolution however they can still be useful in the fabrication of membranes if a hybrid am approach is adopted 2 2 1 material extrusion material extrusion is the most common category in 3d printing it works by extruding a polymeric filament through a heated print head onto a cooler build platform for curing astm 2012 the materials are heated to its melting point and extruded layer by layer with each layer being a horizontal cross section of the final product the adjacent layers are adhered together by extruding the next layer onto the previous layer before the latter is fully cured gnanasekaran et al 2017 lee et al 2016aa mohamed et al 2015 for more complicated prototypes support materials may be required during printing sood et al 2010 the most common printing technique associated with material extrusion is fused deposition modelling fdm or filament freeform fabrication fff shown in fig 4 in general only thermoplastics are used for this method due to the limitations of the print head temperature and filament state requirement of the print material common materials used for fdm include polylactic acid pla heidari rarani et al 2019 nonato et al 2019 acrylonitrile butadiene styrene abs sezer and eren 2019 tan et al 2017 polyethylene terephthalate glycol petg ajay kumar et al 2020 durgashyam et al 2019 and others ding et al 2019 gebisa and lemu 2019 sodeifian et al 2019 fdm fff printers are quite popular for membrane based water treatment in particular for membrane feed spacer fabrication shrivastava et al 2008 current research on membrane spacers are focused on optimising the spacer layer where researchers are more interested in fabricating small quantity of prototypes instead of large scale production fdm fff is sufficient for these purposes with the added benefit of being relatively simple and cheap sood et al 2010 smaller desktop fdm fff printers are even easily available on the market however there are some downsides to fdm fff surface finish of the products are generally inconsistent and grainy which might require post processing de leon et al 2016 tan et al 2017 in addition the prototypes are usually brittle and may not have the flexibility required for the spacers to be coiled into spiral wound modules tan et al 2018 tan et al 2016 swm the printing resolution is also relatively poor in comparison to other 3d printing techniques which explains why there were only literatures using fdm fff as direct am to fabricate spacers typically have thickness of 1 mm but not membranes with sub micron pores 2 2 2 material jetting in material jetting droplets of photocurable resins are selectively deposited onto the build platform and cured using a light source astm 2012 the resins are deposited drop by drop to form each horizontal cross section layer of the final model after a layer is completed the build platform is lowered for the next layer to be deposited on the previous layer at least two types of resins are typically used concurrently in material jetting to form the prototype one or more model material is used to make the prototype while another support material provides the necessary support for the structure during the printing process these support structures can be easily removed during post processing processes by using a water jet or dissolving in appropriate solvents the polyjet printing technique is an example under the material jetting category in fig 5 the multiple jetting heads allows for more than one type of model material to be printed simultaneously and the resins are cured using a uv lamp immediately the polyjet technique has the required printing resolution to directly fabricate spacers armbruster et al 2020 tan et al 2018 tan et al 2017 yanar et al 2020 yanar et al 2018 which are flexible and can be integrated into swm they also generally have better strength and do not delaminate easily even with prolonged immersion in water siddiqui et al 2016 this is an important characteristic if the products were to be used for water treatment purposes in addition the surface finish is relatively smoother as the printing resolution is better compared to most other 3d printing techniques siddiqui et al 2016 polyjet was used as a part of hybrid am to fabricate the substrate layer of a composite membrane with pore sizes around 200 µm al shimmery et al 2019 mazinani et al 2019 however it is incapable of directly fabricating a full membrane on its own because the printing resolution is still insufficient to fabricate the selective layer with pore sizes in the sub micrometre range post processing is also necessary to remove the support structures from the printed prototype 2 2 3 powder bed fusion powder bed fusion makes use thermal energy to melt or sinter a powder bed fusing them together astm 2012 the printing process starts by first laying down a layer of powder a heated source usually a high power laser will scan designated regions on the powder bed to fuse the powders together and form the first layer the building platform is then lowered and a new layer of powder is coated on top of the previous layer the process repeats itself until the whole model is completed wang et al 2017 common printing techniques associated with powder bed fusion include selective laser sintering sls selective laser melting slm and electron beam melting ebm the setup schematics of slm and emb are similar to sls shown in fig 6 the difference is that slm uses a higher energy laser to melt the powder bed while emb uses an electron gun as the power source instead of a laser to melt the powder bed amongst the various powder bed fusion techniques sls is the most commonly used technique for spacer fabrication sreedhar et al 2018 tan et al 2016 tan et al 2017 thomas et al 2019 this is probably due to the relatively good printing resolution of the printers and flexibility of the completed prototype there were also several literatures which reported using sls for the hybrid am of microfiltration membranes by controlling the laser power hatch space yuan et al 2017 yuan et al 2020 slm and emb are not as popular because melting tends to produce rigid and inflexible structures that cannot be coiled into swm hwa et al 2017 the powder bed fusion technology stands out compared to other 3d printing techniques due to its ability to fabricate complex structures without the need of support material the support comes from parts of the powder bed which were not sintered by the energy source hyde et al 2014 the drawback of this technique is that it may require a huge amount of materials even for small prototypes this is because the area of the whole powder bed is usually fixed for the printer and it has to be fully recoated during the printing of each layer even if the prototype only takes up a small segment furthermore only about 50 of the unused powder can be recycled at the end of the process which generates considerable wastage 3d hubs the overall printing time is also relatively long because the powder bed needs to be pre heated before the printing can start papadakis et al 2018 after the printing is done more time is needed to allow the prototype to cool before it can be removed from the powder bed as well 2 2 4 vat photopolymerization vat photopolymerization makes use of photocurable liquid resins to fabricate a model where a laser or uv light source is used to cure the liquid resin during the printing process astm 2012 there are two different ways a model can be fabricated as shown in fig 7 the bottom up printing process starts by lowering the building platform into the tank such that it is one layer thickness away from the transparent bottom the projector selectively cures the first layer using an appropriate light source through the transparent bottom a peeling step is required for the bottom up approach where the cured layer detaches from the bottom of the tank the platform is then raised by a layer height and the process repeats itself until the whole model is completed leong et al 1998 the difference of the top down approach is that the light source cures the model from the top at the liquid surface instead of the bottom of the vat the peeling step between the curing of each successive layers is thus unnecessary in addition the building platform is being lower by a layer height instead of being raised after the curing of each successive layer 3d hubs some common 3d printing techniques associated with this concept include stereolithography sla digital light processing dlp and continuous liquid interface production clip and two photon polymerization 2pp sla uses a focused laser beam to trace each layer for curing eng et al 2017 melchels et al 2010 dlp speeds up the curing process by projecting the pattern of the entire layer all at once instead of scanning the pattern line by line bagheri saed et al 2020 hong et al 2020 kwak et al 2020 clip further quickens the overall printing process by reducing the transition time needed between each layer by introducing an oxygen permeable zone below the projection plane photopolymerization is inhibited between the window and the prototype this eliminates the need of a peeling step to detach the part from the bottom of the tank after every layer which significantly reduces the time required for printing tumbleston et al 2015 sla and dlp have been used to produce membrane spacers ali et al 2019 liu et al 2013 because the printing process only requires minimal amount of resin to cover the bottom on the tank if a bottom up approach is adopted this is suitable for fabricating membrane spacers since researchers mainly adopt 3d printing to fabricate small prototypes cheaper desktop scale printers are also available on the market for these purposes and the resolution of these printers are more than sufficient for membrane spacer fabrication although it is still unlikely that dlp is capable of directly fabricating membranes with pore sizes suitable for water filtration in the sub micron range it is interesting to note that dlp has been associated with 3d printed membranes used for gas separation by direct and indirect am femmer et al 2014 femmer et al 2015a femmer et al 2015b to the best of the author s knowledge 2pp is the only 3d printing technique capable of directly printing membrane pores for microfiltration purposes lee et al 2016aa perrucci et al 2018 due to its excellent printing resolution in the sub micrometre range malinauskas et al 2013 ovsianikov et al 2012 however the exceptional resolution of this printing technique comes with extremely slow printing speeds and small build volume limited to several cubic millimetres thus it has only been used for microfluidic channels up to date perrucci et al 2018 2 2 5 other categories the last three categories of 3d printing are binder jetting sheet lamination and direct energy deposition astm 2012 these three categories are discussed together because they all have intrinsic drawbacks which makes them unsuitable or less popular for polymeric membranes and spacers fabrication binder jetting as seen in fig 8 a has a similar concept as powder bed fusion the difference is that binder jetting relies on liquid binders instead of a heat source to fuse the powder particles together liquid binders such as maltodextrin or paraffin wax acts as an adhesive for the powders they are selectively deposited on the powder bed to form the respective cross sections of the prototype lv et al 2019 3d hubs this technique is not widely used for membrane spacer fabrication due to its limited selection of material and brittle properties however there were reports of hybrid am using binder jetting to fabricate ceramic membranes hwa et al 2018 these membranes were fabricated by printing a solid cylindrical green part and the pores of these membranes were later formed by post printing heat treatments from this perspective the significance of 3d printing may be ambiguous in the hybrid am process because the pore sizes cannot be controlled directly from 3d printing more detailed discussions on this matter will be brought up in the later sections of the paper sheet lamination in fig 8b fabricates prototypes by joining sheets of material together astm 2012 each sheet is a precision cut of a horizontal cross section of the final model where they are joined by physical adhesions molitch hou 2018 or various metallurgy bondings neikov 2019 selection of model material is thus limited to paper metallic neikov 2019 and some polyvinyl chloride pvc heynick and stotz 2006 sheets laminated object manufacturing lom usually generates more waste because the amount of material used is equivalent to the box that contains the sheets of material regardless of how small the prototype part is heynick and stotz 2006 the biggest drawback of this technique is that it is unable to print complicated structures since the internal parts of the object are inaccessible molitch hou 2018 all these factors coupled together make it an unsuitable technique for fabrication of both membrane and spacer lastly directed energy deposition techniques such as laser metal deposition lmd and laser engineered net shaping lens focuses an energy source onto a small region to melt and fuse materials together as they are being deposited onto the substrate melt pool astm 2012 although directed energy deposition techniques are possible for polymers it is mainly used for metal prototype fabrication gibson et al 2015 it is even referred to as metal deposition technology in many literatures in addition the surface finish and roughness is also relatively poor gibson et al 2015 which may be sufficient for membrane spacers but unsuitable for the fabrication of the fine pores of a filtration membrane 3 additive manufacturing for membrane spacers membrane spacers can be found in various membrane based processes such as microfiltration mf ultrafiltration uf nanofiltration nf reverse osmosis ro forward osmosis fo electrodialysis ed membrane distillation md and others al amshawee et al 2020 phattaranawik et al 2001 pinnau and freeman 1999 popovic and wessling 2015 schwinge et al 2004 they play two important roles within their respective modules 1 act as stabilizers to separate membranes and form feed channels 2 act as turbulence promoters to encourage mixing and minimize concentration temperature polarization effects conventionally membrane spacers have mesh like structures commonly made by extrusion and welding of low density polypropylene filaments due to their excellent flexibility and chemical stability al amshawee et al 2020 anvari et al 2020 tan et al 2016 they generally improve the mass heat transfer of the membranes and thus decrease concentration temperature polarization effects however they also increase trans module pressure loss due to greater resistance in the feed channel anvari et al 2020 gurreri et al 2016 van paassen et al 1998 to improve this trade off effect it is essential to optimise the membrane spacer layer to maximise mass heat transfer while minimizing energy consumption lee et al 2016b schwinge et al 2000 an optimised spacer design can also slow down the build up of foulants on the membrane surface kerdi et al 2019 a recent techno economic study toh et al 2020 revealed that for a constant recovery rate the total cost of desalination decreases as membrane permeance increases however further reduction in cost with greater membrane permeance is limited due to severe concentration polarization effects advanced feed spacers hypothetical spacers which could increase sherwood number by 50 and decrease fanning friction factor by 50 were able to achieve similar levels of cost reduction as conventional spacers at only half the membrane permeance value given that new membranes with higher permeance are constantly sought after research on innovative spacers are also essential to minimize the cost of operation however it is a challenge to fabricate the prototypes of innovative spacers because they often have complex designs beyond the capabilities of traditional fabrication methods as such evaluation of these spacers were mostly limited to computational fluid dynamics cfd studies balster et al 2006 li et al 2016 liu et al 2015 schwinge et al 2000 xie et al 2014 3d printing was introduced to overcome this fabrication obstacle with its high degree of design customisation prototypes of these novel spacers can be easily printed directly and verified experimentally 3 1 conventional additive manufacturing for spacers fig 9 shows a variety of 3d printed spacers which are all very different from the conventional mesh designs prototypes of these spacers were only able to be fabricated due to 3d printing kerdi et al 2018 used dlp to directly fabricate perforated spacers fig 9a the printed spacers had holes at intersection nodes 1 hole spacer and along filaments 2 hole and 3 hole spacer that generated micro jets within the feed channel to eliminate dead zones the 1 hole spacer was reported to be most efficient in increasing permeate production and it also kept the membrane surface cleanest this is attributed to the stronger micro jets through the holes that contributed to the fluctuating shear stress at the outlets to discourage foulant deposition kerdi et al 2020 also fabricated various spacers with helical filaments using dlp the 3 helical spacers proved to be the best as they generated the largest turbulence around grooves along the helical filaments and increased the downstream local velocity this spacer achieved outstanding results by increasing permeate flux up to 291 while reducing pressure loss across the channel by 65 ali et al 2020 adopted dlp as well to fabricate turbospacers where a turbine shaped rotor is installed around a central cylindrical shaft fig 9i such that it is free to rotate during the filtration processes this rotation causes fluctuations to the shear stress on the membrane surface thereby slowing down the growth of foulants the turbospacers showed promising results achieving specific flux more than 3 times higher with 2 5 times lower energy consumption compared to conventional spacers yanar et al 2020 directly fabricated honeycomb spacers which were made of numerous hexagonal shapes fig 9b using polyjet these spacers improved membrane flux by distributing the shear fully across the membrane the reverse solute flux was reduced by up to 50 while maintaining similar water flux as the commercial spacer in their fouling study they also found out that the foulant thickness was half of that of the commercial spacer ali et al 2019 used dlp to directly fabricate column type spacers where the intersecting nodes were replaced by circular columns of different diameter fig 9c water filtration results revealed that column spacers reduced trans module pressure drop by up to 3 folds and increased specific water flux by up to 2 folds biomass accumulation was also considerably lower compared to the conventional spacer in their short term biofouling test in recent years several studies castillo et al 2019 sreedhar et al 2018 thomas et al 2019 started to explore triply periodic minimal surface tpms spacers that were mathematically derived from the local area minimization principle fig 9e they successfully fabricated the spacers directly using sls the spacer s structure minimized the contact area between membrane and spacer thus avoiding any unnecessary flow restrictions and stagnant zones the spacers were tested for ro uf and md purposes and they reported flux enhancement of up to 70 compared to the conventional spacer however the trans module pressure loss was also more than 200 greater several other novel spacers are summarised in table 2 although most of the works on 3d printed spacers focused on the inherent design of the spacer there are a few papers which studied other aspects of 3d printed spacers i e spacer was kept to the conventional mesh design siddiqui et al 2016 compared several printing techniques for spacer fabrication in their study fdm did not have the required resolution to fabricate then thin spacer filaments the prototype was also brittle and unsuitable for swm purposes sla was also not suitable because the spacers were inflexible and dissolved in water over time polyjet was deemed the most suitable technique because they were able to achieve higher printing resolution at relatively low cost tan et al 2017 made a more detailed comparison on solid fdm liquid polyjet and powder form sls of 3d printing amongst them polyjet has the greatest part to model accuracy while fdm has the least accuracy owing to these random deviations in fdm prototypes the mass transfer of fdm spacers were highest probably due to greater disruptions in the pattern flow however the increased disruption also led to greater pressure loss across the flow channel the surface finish of the spacers was also important because bacteria tends to attach to rougher surface in biofouling experiments it was interesting to note that the fdm spacers had the lowest bacteria attachment affinity despite their high macroscale roughness these results were attributed to their relatively lower microscale roughness despite the superior performance of fdm polyjet and sls were still recommended by the authors for spacer fabrication over fdm because the degree of accuracy was poor for fdm they suggested that perhaps using a more accurate printing technique to fabricate deliberated randomised geometry would be a better approach in general direct 3d printing of spacers have helped researchers look into more complex spacer designs some of these spacers such as the perforated spacer helical spacer turbospacer column spacer and multi layered spacer were able to reduce energy consumption while increasing water flux others were able to improve the trade off effect by greatly increasing water flux with minimal increase in energy consumption the surface finish of the spacers also affected the performance therefore selecting a suitable printer is also important to optimise the spacer it was interesting to note that indirect am was not used in the fabrication of spacers and this could be attributed to the lack of studies on functional properties of the spacers for example there is limited information on the spacers mechanical strength and flexibility to determine if they can be rolled into swm there is also little information on the chemical stability of the spacers whether they degrade in seawater wastewater high temperature conditions essentially these properties determine if 3d printed spacers are suitable for integration into actual water treatment processes indirect am might be more common in the future when materials with better properties for the industry but are not suitable for direct 3d printing i e low viscosity needs to be used these materials could potentially be casted in 3d printed moulds to make spacers with optimised design and functionality van damme et al 2020 3 2 hybrid additive manufacturing for spacers hybrid am is also not used in spacer fabrication for the same reasons as indirect am studies for spacers are currently focused more on design optimisation rather than overall functionality hybrid am might come into play in the future when functional properties of the feed spacers are taken into consideration additional heating processes have shown potential for improving the mechanical strength of polymeric parts benwood et al 2018 another possible reason why hybrid am is not used for spacer fabrication at the moment is because the resolution of current 3d printers is already sufficient to meet the demands of spacer filaments lee et al 2016b spacer filaments typically have thickness around 1 mm which is achievable with the current 3d printing technology as such there is no need to rely on any additional fabrication processes to fabricate spacers for design optimisation purposes 4 additive manufacturing for membranes in water treatment the main function of membranes is to act as a selective barrier to separate water from pollutants there are many different types of membranes available the easiest way to classify them is by their material which is usually polymeric or ceramic other ways to classify membranes include module configuration flat sheet tubular hollow fibre spiral wound process driving force concentration pressure electrical potential or temperature gradient or pore size mf 0 1 1 µm uf 0 01 0 1 µm nf 0 001 0 01 µm and ro 0 001 µm traditional fabrication of ceramic membranes involves multiple high temperature and energy intensive sintering processes resulting in membranes with large outer diameter and low packing density lee and li 2017 this is unfavourable from an economic point of view which is why polymeric membranes are more commonly used in the industry phase inversion is most commonly used for the fabrication of polymeric membranes mulder 2000 it involves the removal of a solvent from a liquid polymer solution to form a polymeric membrane wienk et al 1996 zare and kargari 2018 zhang et al 2018 in contrast to sintering phase inversion is cheaper and faster making it more cost effective in addition phase inversion is able to produce flat sheet and hollow fibre membranes that can be easily integrated into filtration modules with high packing densities crowder and gooding 1997 however phase inversion is a complex process because there are many delicate considerations such as the properties of solvent properties of polymer temperature of anti solvent etc strathmann and kock 1977 slight alterations to these parameters can greatly affect the morphology and properties of the final membrane matsuyama et al 2001 to overcome the challenges of conventional ways to fabricate membranes researchers have explored the possibilities of 3d printing as an alternative method however the feasibility of 3d printing sub micron porous membranes i e mf membranes remains in question on one hand there are papers which stated that the resolution of 3d printers are insufficient for printing membrane pore sizes in sub micrometre range lee et al 2016b tan et al 2016 on the other hand there are papers which reported the successful fabrication of 3d printed membranes chowdhury et al 2018 perrucci et al 2018 ray et al 2020 to better understand these conflicting reports we will classify the various membranes associated with 3d printing into the 3 different types of am i e direct am indirect am hybrid am based on how 3d printing was used in the fabrication process table 3 4 1 conventional additive manufacturing for membranes in direct am all features of the membrane should be printed according to its cad model designed therefore the pore sizes of the membranes can be controlled directly by the cad model itself to the best of the author s knowledge 2pp is the only printing technology today that potentially has the resolution required to fabricate membranes directly for water filtration lee et al 2016aproposed using 2pp to directly fabricate a sub micron porous membrane fig 10 b although no prototype was fabricated they believe that 2pp has the capabilities to print the fine pores because of its excellent printing resolution in the sub micron range later perrucci et al 2018 designed a cad model of a microfluidic channel integrated with a 4 µm porous filter fig 10a the pores were accurately fabricated using 2pp and filtration results showed that it successfully rejected micrometric particles larger than 4 µm although it is not quite in the sub micrometre range it still shows that 2pp has the potential to fabricate membranes however this fabrication technique is limited to small build volume of several cubic millimetres coupled with the long printing times it may not be feasible to fabricate membranes large enough for large scale water treatment purposes various tpms devices made of polydimethylsiloxane pdms were also designed and printed using dlp for gas separation applications femmer et al 2014 femmer et al 2015b the product was claimed to be a 3d printed membrane but it is not appropriately termed as a membrane due to the large pore sizes 100 µm it should be noted that contactors are used to provide an interface and work on a different principle he et al 2020 scholes et al 2016 from membrane filtration in which selective properties are critical for the latter instead of focusing on the membrane pore size material choice and surface area are more important factors for improving the overall performance of contactors the printing resolution requirement is thus less demanding to fabricate these structures which explains why dlp printers are sufficient for the fabrication of their tpms pdms membranes nevertheless the 3d printed contactors showed 30 70 superior mass transfer compared to conventional hollow fibre membranes due to the improved flow characteristics and higher surface area of the tpms design another method of fabricating membranes is by indirect am whereby 3d printing is used to fabricate a mould to help shape the final prototype lee et al 2016a proposed that instead of directly printing the pores of the membranes a moulding method could achieve better results fig 10b he speculated that moulds with thin extruding columns could be fabricated using 2pp and subsequently used to make membranes via phase separation µ moulding vogelaar et al 2003 vogelaar et al 2005 to achieve pore sizes in the nanometre range however no prototype was fabricated and this method also faced drawbacks such as long printing times and small build volume femmer et al 2015a also fabricated pdms tpms contactors pore size 100 µm by making a sacrificial mould fig 10c these moulds were printed using dlp and they had similar improvements on mass transfer as the contactors that were printed directly by dlp in general conventional am faces many challenges in fabricating membranes for water treatment most printers do not have the required resolution to print the fine details of a membrane cad model although 2pp has a printing resolution in the submicron range no membrane was actually made with pore sizes of 1 µm mf membranes yet other drawbacks of long printing time and small build volume of 2pp also make it hard for upscale production however conventional am has definitely seen success in fabricating contactors as the prototypes showed promising results in terms of performance 4 2 hybrid additive manufacturing for membranes for hybrid am 3d printing is used in conjunction with other conventional processes to make a final functional prototype in general there are two different ways hybrid am methods used to fabricate membranes 1 printing a simple green part and relying on post printing heat treatments i e thermal curing debinding or sintering to form pores 2 printing a support layer and relying on conventional methods i e phase inversion and dip coating to make a selective layer to be assembled into a composite membrane for the first hybrid am method the membrane pore sizes can be controlled to a certain extent by varying the composition of the printing resin powder bed or manipulating the sintering laser properties ray et al 2020 fabricated a ceramic membrane using a custom developed dlp system known as solvent based slurry stereolithography 3s wang and dommati 2018 fig 10f the slurry was made of alumina as the structural component methanol as the solvent and a photopolymer resin as the binding agent to control the membrane pore size in the final prototype the size of the alumina particles in the slurry was varied larger alumina particles led to larger pore sizes because there would be larger gaps between each particle this slurry was used to print a thin rectangular solid green part that subsequently underwent a series of thermal debinding and sintering processes to form the pores in the solid structure thermal debinding removes the binding agent from the green part and thermal sintering closes the gaps between the structural component particles resulting in a thin film porous membrane with pore sizes around 8 14 nm hwa et al 2018 adopted a similar approach in fabricating a ceramic membrane instead of using dlp binder jetting was employed to print a 3d cylindrical solid using kankara clay as the structural component and maltodextrin as the binder solution fig 10g the green part was then sintered in a high temperature furnace to form the pores around 3 µm within the solid the resulting membrane was able to remove up to 97 8 of total organic carbon and 53 9 total suspended solids similar results were observed when the particle size of the kankara clay used was varied larger kankara clay led to larger pore sizes sls was also used to sinter modified polyamide powders into a thin film of membranes yuan et al 2017 yuan et al 2020 the incomplete powder coalescence during the sintering process forms pores in the membranes the pore size can be controlled to a certain extent by changing various parameters of the laser such as power hatch space and scanning speed by coating commercially available pa2200 powder with a layer of candle soot the resulting membranes exhibited superoleophobic and hydrophobic properties in water they had mean pore sizes from 9 8 14 5 µm and were able to achieve oil water separation greater than 99 these membranes also exhibited great chemical and mechanical stability it is evident that although dlp binder jetting and sls do not have the inherent resolution to print membrane pores directly or indirectly they can still achieve a good prototype membrane with the aid of appropriate heat treatments that being said there are some fundamental concerns with these hybrid am membranes which were not sufficiently addressed most publications focused on the performance aspect of the membrane but less attention was paid to the 3d printing aspect the pore size of the membranes cannot be directly controlled from the 3d printing cad model which makes it hard to evaluate the quality of print because the final prototype has important features which are not present in the original cad model lopez et al 2018 furthermore it was noticed that am was used to only print simple rectangular or circular thin films as green parts and some might question the significance and need for am in the overall fabrication process the unique advantage of am is the great freedom in design but it cannot be fully utilized here for the fabrication of membranes due to the limitations of 3d printers perhaps a more efficient way to make these membranes using the heat treatment concept is to explore simpler alternatives such as moulding or casting to form the simple green parts for the second hybrid am method the pore sizes of the support layer is directly controlled by the cad model design 3d printing can be used to fabricate the support layer because it is usually very porous with pore sizes up to several hundreds of micrometres al shimmery et al 2019 and mazinani et al 2019 designed and printed a layer of wavy support with pore sizes around 200 µm using polyjet fig 10e the selective polyethersulfone pes layer was fabricated separately using conventional phase inversion method and they were adhered together using vacuum pressure followed by pure water filtration it was found that the wavy pattern on the support structure significantly increased the water permeate up to 30 yuan et al 2019b also fabricated another composite membrane using a similar concept he used sls to print a support layer made of polyamide and subsequently coated it with zeolitic imidazolate framework zif l crystals and pdms to achieve a super hydrophobic and oleophobic membrane when subjected to oil water separation tests these membranes achieve excellent oil rejection rate greater than 99 while maintaining a relatively high flux the downside with membranes fabricated using the second type of hybrid am is that am is not used to entirely replace the conventional ways of making membrane it was noticed that these membranes still have to rely on phase inversion or dip coating to fabricate the selective layer of the membrane due to the limitations of the 3d printer in addition some membranes lack long term performance tests these tests are important because the membranes generally involve an assembly step where a selective layer is combined with the 3d printed support layer the interfacial bonding between the layers might deteriorate over time and delamination or leeching problems can only be observed if the test duration is longer to summarize hybrid am is more suitable for making membranes with the current printing resolution of most 3d printers the prototypes generally have great performance in terms of flux or rejection rate however there are several issues such as the significance of 3d printing print quality and long term performance test which were not sufficiently discussed in published papers yet it is also interesting to note that 3d printing has only been associated with pressure driven and concentration gradient driven membranes am both conventional and hybrid has not been employed to fabricate membranes for ed or md yet 5 future trends of additive manufacturing 5 1 short term shift of focus in the overall additive manufacturing process the focus of 3d printing has always been placed on conventional am where functional prototypes were fabricated by designing and printing according to a cad model designed this is observed in the fabrication of spacers section 3 where cad models of innovative spacers are loaded into the printer to be printed accordingly it can be said that the 3d printing technology today is capable of printing spacers with of various designs easily as long as there is an available cad model however when it comes to fabrication of membranes section 4 the fabrication procedure is not as simple due to low printing resolution of 3d printers the fine details of a membrane cad model with sub micrometre pore sizes cannot be easily printed directly even with 2pp which has sufficient resolution there are other process limitations such as build size and printing speed which makes it challenging to print larger membranes to make functional membranes we can see that some researchers have already started shifting their focus onto hybrid am hybrid am makes use of other conventional processes in conjunction with 3d printing to overcome the various limitations of 3d printers the microscopic pores in the membranes are often formed by the other processes which were used together with 3d printing it is evident that 3d printing is evolving from a single standalone process i e conventional am into a multi integrated process i e hybrid am it is becoming part of a bigger fabrication system whereby parts are prepared separately and assembled to form a functional product this concept is already widely seen in the biomedical lee et al 2019b lee et al 2015 lei et al 2020 naghieh et al 2017 rajzer et al 2018 and electric field espalin et al 2014 lewis and ahn 2015 macdonald et al 2014 shemelya et al 2014 but not as common in the water treatment field as the focus shifts from conventional am to hybrid am in membrane based water treatment it is expected that future studies regarding 3d printing in this field will have a different direction for spacers the potential of hybrid am to improve the properties of the 3d printed spacer can be explored research to improving their mechanical strength or even chemical stability in saline or wastewater will make 3d printing more feasible for industry usage for membranes some fundamentals regarding 3d printing in hybrid am should be addressed first the significance of am in the overall process and a criterion to determine the quality of 3d print should be established after that more focus can be placed on better integrating various processes with 3d printing to make the overall fabrication system more comprehensive and effective currently there are still some issues with the hybrid am process which needs to be addressed such as the material compatibility between various processes interconnectivity transition between the different processes interfacial bonding etc 5 2 mid term from prototyping to manufacturing today most 3d printing studies in the water treatment industry are still on small lab scale experiments amongst all the publications on spacers and membranes today there were only several reporting on the commercial integration of 3d printed spacers or membranes into an actual water treatment system nanosun 2018 nunes et al 2020 this is due to various challenges faced by am which can be broadly classified under upscaling challenges and material challenges to make 3d printing feasible in the water treatment industry these limitations needs to first be addressed ngo et al 2018 3d printing is capable of fabricating highly customizable products but there are many drawbacks within the process that make it unsuitable for large scale production one of the most obvious problems that 3d printing faces is the limitation of build size in the research of 3d printed spacers and membranes most prototypes have dimensions of less than 30 cm however commercial swm would require dimensions up to 1 m which is way beyond the build size of most 3d printers as seen in table 1 another concern is the relatively slow printing speed of 3d printers compared to conventional fabrication methods conventional heat extrusion of thermoplastics in industries can produce cross sections of 1000 cm2 at a speed up to 640 m h tempelman et al 2014 even the fastest industrial 3d printer today hp pales greatly in comparison achieving only a mere 0 05 m h printing speed not to mention when larger and more complex parts are printed in great quantity the time required for printing may be further increased ngo et al 2018 pereira et al 2019 tofail et al 2018 processing power requirement might also be an issue during upscaling as more details and complexity are added to the cad model the computational cost greatly increases to fabricate membranes with microscopic pores at a scale large enough for industrial use high performance computing platforms will be required to process the cad files this could well be a practical problem in the future even with improvements to high resolution printing technologies such as 2pp essentially these factors result in diseconomies of scale and makes it challenging for upscale production using 3d printing despite that it is evident that there are attempts made to overcome these obstacles lee et al 2017b suggested that the speed of 3d printers are limited by two factors reset time between layers treset and image time per layer timage treset is associated with the transition time between subsequent layers includes platform movement powder recoating computer processing and model support material deposition it can be reduced with technological breakthroughs such as the development of clip tumbleston et al 2015 to eliminate the peeling step in vat photopolymerization processes this drastically increased the printing speed and it took only 6 5 mins to print a prototype that would normally take sla 11 5 h to complete the fastfff system go and hart 2017 also greatly improved the printing speed in material extrusion processes by using a nut feed filament drive and laser assisted heaters they achieved building rates 10 times faster than commercially available desktop fdm printers the most recent advancement of tomographic am loterie et al 2020 is also worth mentioning here due to its innovative way of improving the vat photopolymerization processes instead of projecting the cross sections of a model layer by layer into the resin tank tomographic am makes use of a multi beam system to simultaneously project the entire 3d volume into a tank of transparent resin this further reduced the printing time to a matter of seconds timage is associated with energy required to solidify each layer and can be reduced using printers with higher energy outputs bigrep cosine blb industries these printers are also generally larger which can help overcome the limitation of build size it might even be possible to explore a printing while moving concept adopted in concrete printing tiryaki et al 2018 to further increase the build size of 3d printers if successful it will definitely be a huge step towards upscaling of 3d printing all these works to improve the 3d printing technology are indications where existing challenges are slowly being addressed with continuing efforts it is optimistic that 3d printing will be feasible for upscaling in the future aside from upscaling there are also concerns from the 3d printing material aspect previously in the context of lab research more emphasis was placed on the physical features of the end product i e spacer design and pore size however adaptation for industrial usage would require more considerations on the functionality of the product in particular the environment which the product is being used needs to be considered when choosing the material so that they will have suitable properties to be integrated into industrial water treatment systems later for example membranes fabricated by 3d printing needs to have certain flexibility for it to be coiled and integrated into a swm composite membranes fabricated by 3d printing al shimmery et al 2019 mazinani et al 2019 for lab scale tests had rigid support layers which did not have the required flexibility it is also important that the products have certain chemical stability to not degrade in their environment i e saline water high temperature high pressure pla heidari rarani et al 2019 nonato et al 2019 which is a common material used for 3d printing is thus unsuitable for the fabrication of membranes and spacers yanar et al 2018 for industrial purposes because they would degrade in water over long periods of time toxicity of the 3d printed parts is also a concern especially if used in water treatment studies suggests that vat photopolymerization printing methods tend to have higher degree of toxicity due to the photopolymers used in the printing process macdonald et al 2016 mesbah oskui et al 2016 other possible hazards include emission of ultrafine particles from fdm printers azimi et al 2016 house et al 2017 stephens et al 2013 which are linked to respiratory diseases a possible way to tackle all these problems is to expand the range of material available for 3d printing in particular materials like polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf polytetrafluoroethylene ptfe polyethersulfone pes and several others have proven to be suitable for water treatment purposes some of these materials such as pvdf are gradually being adopted for the printing of industrial membranes nanosun 2018 perhaps there will be interest in commercialising other suitable materials for membrane and spacer fabrication in the future as well 5 3 long term 4d printed membranes and spacers four dimensional 4d printing is a relatively new concept especially in the water treatment industry it is essentially the use of 3d printing to fabricate prototypes using smart materials that give some form of response under certain stimulus hence the fourth dimension lee et al 2017a lee et al 2019a momeni et al 2017 pei and loh 2018 these smart materials unlock various capabilities such as self assembly multi functionality and self repair momeni et al 2017 pei and loh 2018 some of the stimuli which have been studied to date include water heat light electricity or magnetism and they usually feedback with physical responses such as bending folding expansion swelling or changes to surface topography bakarich et al 2015 caputo et al 2018 ge et al 2014 goo et al 2020 grinberg et al 2019 kim et al 2018 kuksenok and balazs 2016 lee et al 2017a lee et al 2019a momeni et al 2017 sydney gladman et al 2016 tibbits 2014 in general 4d printing can be classified into 2 broad categories which are shape shifting and shape memory prototypes momeni et al 2017 pei and loh 2018 zhou and sheiko 2016 fig 11 shape shifting prototypes are able to give an immediate response when a stimulus is applied and they will revert back to their original form when the stimulus is removed shape memory prototypes are further classified into 2 sub categories namely one way and two way one way shape memory prototypes are able to deform in a programming stage i e external force and kept in a temporary shape until a stimulus is applied in the recovery stage to revert the prototype back to its original shape two way shape memory prototypes rely on two different kinds of stimulus to deform into a permanent shape and revert back into its original shape respectively all this is possible by carefully selecting appropriate materials which swells under different conditions hence the name smart materials today some challenges which are associated with 4d printing include their printability degree of response reversibility and repeatability khoo et al 2015 lee et al 2017a lee et al 2019a momeni et al 2017 pei and loh 2018 the most prominent usage of 4d printing is in the biomedical industry where there were attempts of printing tissue cells jamal et al 2013 mutlu et al 2015 villar et al 2013 cardiovascular stents ames et al 2009 anand et al 2009 ge et al 2016 yakacki et al 2007 yakacki et al 2008 zarek et al 2017 scaffolds an et al 2015 gao et al 2016 irvine and venkatraman 2016 miao et al 2016 wei et al 2017 etc carbonell and braunschweig 2017 malachowski et al 2014 to the best of the author s knowledge there are no studies yet on 4d printed membranes or spacers for water treatment application yet but it is possible to discuss their potential here from the membrane spacer perspective many studies today focus on optimising the flow within the channel to generate shear forces that discourage the deposition of foulants with 4d printing it is possible to make dynamic spacers that introduce direct movement within the flow channel small vibrations can be induced using an alternating electric magnetic field if the spacers are made of piezoelectric ferromagnetic materials some preliminary studies already suggest that vibrations could reduce the rate of membrane fouling li et al 2016 or even become a self cleaning mechanism for the membrane if the vibrations are strong enough from the membrane perspective 4d printing could have the potential to fabricate smart membranes where their properties may change under different stimuli making use of the swelling properties of the smart materials it is possible that physical properties such as pore size or surface roughness can be varied under different stimuli to optimise the overall filtration process tijing et al 2020 future studies may focus on different stimuli such as ph or foulant concentration or other smart materials that give different responses such as surface charge banpurkar et al 2017 florczak 2017 sun et al 2019 or porosity kashyap et al 2018 can also be of interest in the water treatment field 6 conclusion the basic concept of 3d printing is a layer by layer fabrication technique which follows a standard 3 step procedure file preparation printing and post processing 3d printing can be used in 3 different ways to fabricate a prototype direct am indirect am and hybrid am direct and indirect am are conventional am methods which rely heavily on the cad model and printer to make a functional prototype while hybrid am uses 3d printing in conjunction with other established non am fabrication processes to make a functional prototype the various 3d printing techniques can be categorised into 7 different categories based on the way materials are deposited and cured amongst them sheet lamination and directed energy deposition have not been reported for the fabrication of membranes and spacers at all due to printing resolution and material limitations the other 5 categories material extrusion material jetting powder bed fusion vat photopolymerization binder jetting have been used to fabricate membrane and spacer prototypes by conventional am or hybrid am however there were still some differences noticed in the printing process for spacers and membranes most spacers were 3d printed directly and focus was placed more on cad model design and printing on the other hand most membranes were fabricated using a hybrid am approach where 3d printing is only part of the overall fabrication process and focus was placed more on the other processes instead of am to address the statement whether is it feasible to fabricate membranes using 3d printing the authors believe it depends on the type of 3d printing in discussion it is hard to fabricate mf membranes directly indirectly 0 1 1 µm pore size if one were to solely rely on am technology however by introducing a second process to be used in conjunction with am hybrid am can greatly increase its overall feasibility having said that it raises the question of am s significance in the overall fabrication process using hybrid am since essential features of membranes i e membrane pores cannot be directly controlled by the 3d printing process in our opinion 3d printing seems to be playing only a minor role in hybrid am for membranes the unique advantages of 3d printing cannot be fully utilised for membrane fabrication and we think that hybrid am for membranes at this stage is just a workaround for conventional 3d printing due to current technology limitations for membranes beyond uf range 0 1 µm pore size it can be said to be impossible to make with the 3d printing technology available today as the water treatment industry continues to grow in the future it is expected that the focus will continue to shift from conventional am to hybrid am with more emphasis placed on the 3d printing aspect 3d printing will also slowly move beyond the prototyping stage into the manufacturing stage for industries more emphasis will be placed on overcoming the upscaling and material limitations to manufacture larger and functional niche parts which are economical and practical future advancement in am technology could potentially open up other possibilities such as 4d printing for smart spacers and membranes declaration of competing

17387,over the past decade 3d printing or additive manufacturing am technology has seen great advancement in many aspects such as printing resolution speed and cost membranes for water treatment experienced significant breakthroughs owing to the unique benefits of additive manufacturing in particular 3d printing s high degree of freedom in various aspects such as material and prototype design has helped to fabricate innovative spacers and membranes however there were conflicting reports on the feasibility of 3d printing especially for membranes some research groups stated that technology limitations today made it impossible to 3d print membranes but others showed that it was possible by successfully fabricating prototypes this paper will provide a critical and comprehensive discussion on 3d printing specifically for spacers and membranes various 3d printing techniques will be introduced and their suitability for membrane and spacer fabrication will be discussed it will be followed by a review of past studies associated with 3d printed spacers and membranes a new category of additive manufacturing in the membrane water industry will be introduced here known as hybrid additive manufacturing to address the controversies of 3d printing for membrane as am technology continues to advance its possibilities in the water treatment is limitless some insightful future trends will be provided at the end of the paper graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords hybrid additive manufacturing 3d printing water treatment membranes spacers 1 introduction additive manufacturing am also known as 3d printing is a layer by layer fabrication process capable of building three dimensional freeform objects easily chua and leong 2017 lee et al 2016b ng et al 2019 ngo et al 2018 the first research on am started in 1981 kodama 1981 involving photopolymers over the past few decades this technology has experienced extensive improvements in terms of the printing technique and materials compatibility matias and rao 2015 today various 3d printing techniques such as stereolithography sla eng et al 2017 melchels et al 2010 digital light processing dlp bagheri saed et al 2020

tay et al 2016 wu et al 2016 and aerospace and defence grady et al 2015 kellner 2014 kumar and nair 2017 have seen innovative breakthroughs in their respective fields amongst them the water treatment industry balogun et al 2019 dommati et al 2019 lee et al 2016b low et al 2017 tijing et al 2020 has also reaped benefits off the prospects of 3d printing over the past decade the number of publications associating am with water treatment has increased considerably as seen in fig 1 according to web of science it started with 1 publication in 2011 and has increased to over 30 in 2019 up to the first half of 2020 there is a total of 117 publications with about 27 focusing on 3d printed spacers and 25 focusing on 3d printed membranes the remaining studies mainly involve 3d printed water quality sensors chemical delivery systems pollutant absorbents electrical cathodes etc am has been used to fabricate membrane spacers in many recent studies conventional membrane spacers have simple mesh designs which are fabricated by heat extrusion methods although there were attempts to optimise conventional spacers da costa et al 1993 1994 liu et al 2017 schwinge et al 2004 it has hit a bottleneck because there are small dead zones inherent from the mesh design itself schwinge et al 2000 researchers have started investigating new innovative spacer designs to overcome this obstacle but are often faced with difficulty in actual performance evaluations most studies could only rely on computation fluid dynamics cfd balster et al 2006 li et al 2016 liu et al 2015 schwinge et al 2000 xie et al 2014 because it is difficult to fabricate spacers with complex designs which are beyond the capabilities of conventional heat extrusion lee et al 2016b am is a great breakthrough for membrane spacers because its high degree of freedom in design enables the fabrication of complex spacer prototypes ali et al 2019 castillo et al 2019 kerdi et al 2018 siddiqui et al 2016 sreedhar et al 2018 thomas et al 2019 yanar et al 2020 these prototypes can easily be integrated into filtration cells to accurately simulate the filtration conditions within membrane modules for more accurate evaluations a critical review on these 3d printed spacers is needed to analyse their potentials and shortcomings aside from spacers am has also gradually surfaced in membrane fabrication processes conventionally fabrication of ceramic membranes is often costly due to high temperature requirements lee and li 2017 on the other hand fabrication of polymeric membranes requires precise control of many factors such as dope ambience temperature and polymer solvent anti solvent properties and concentration this is often challenging in an open environment as slight changes to these parameters can greatly affect the properties of the final membrane in search of a more cost efficient and consistent technique researchers have adopted am to fabricate membranes am is attractive because some am techniques do not necessarily rely on high temperatures to fabricate the final product the various fabrication parameters can also be better controlled in a close environment within the 3d printer to ensure consistency in fabricated prototypes heated nozzles printing bed and cooling fans are present to regulate the temperature in material extrusion printers uv laser properties i e power scanning speed hatch space can be precisely controlled in material jetting vat photopolymerization powder bed fusion printers this ensures that the model materials can be deposited cured properly according to the desired design for consistency in the fabricated products theoretically am can be a good alternative for sintering and phase inversion processes however the actual prototyping of 3d printed membranes is faced with printing resolution limitations of existing 3d printers which leads to a certain degree of confusion on the feasibility of 3d printing for the water treatment industry in addition upscaling production is also a challenge for 3d printing due to limitations such as small build volume and slow printing speed there is a need to critically review these works on 3d printed membranes not only from a performance perspective but also from an am perspective to understand why the arise of such discrepancies by classifying the works into conventional am direct and indirect and hybrid am it will be clear how hybrid am is different from conventional am and hopefully there will be more consensus of am s role in membrane fabrication for future publications it is clear that research interest in this interdisciplinary field is rapidly growing this literature aims to give a comprehensive and critical overview on the efforts of am specifically for spacers and membranes in the water treatment industry although there are many different kinds of 3d printing techniques it is important to understand why are some more suited for spacer and membrane fabrication some background information on 3d printing processes will be presented and their suitability for membrane and spacer printing will be discussed subsequently works on 3d printed spacers and membranes will be evaluated the works novelty fabrication details and its impact on their respective water treatment process will be presented by classifying how am was used in the fabrication process we can see how am has helped in the overall fabrication process and evaluate its significance especially in the fabrication of membranes hybrid am a multi step fabrication process involving the use of both am and non am processes to fabricate a prototype will be introduced here mainly to address the controversies revolving around 3d printed membranes this paper concludes with some future trends that are likely to take place with am with regards to spacer and membrane fabrication 2 overview of additive manufacturing technology in the past other terms such as additive fabrication rapid prototyping and layered manufacturing were also associated with am chua and leong 2017 this technology was officially defined as additive manufacturing in astm f2792 12a standard terminology for additive manufacturing technologies in 20 120 astm 2012 all am processes follow a standard procedure illustrated in fig 2 to fabricate the final object the whole process begins with file preparation where computer aided design cad software such as solidworks autocad rhino etc is used to draw the desired object in a 3 dimensional space the cad file is then converted into the stereolithography stl format which allows 3d printers to slice the object into cross sections for printing in the subsequent printing step building parameters such as orientation and position as well as technological parameter are finalized before the actual printing process begins when the printing process is done the final step involves post processing procedures such as removal of support materials or polishing and sanding to improve the object s surface finish chua and leong 2017 in light of the booming popularity of am some researchers have misclassified 2d printing or other layer by layer fabrication processes that do not adhere to the standard procedure illustrated in fig 2 as 3d printing perhaps a more suitable terminology for this category should be layer by layer assembly technology chua and leong 2017 or hybrid am hybrid am can be briefly described as multi step fabrication process where 3d printing is used in conjunction with other fabrication methods to achieve the final desired structure more detailed discussions on this matter will be highlighted in the subsequent section it is undeniable that the am technology has experienced huge development in all aspects over the past decade today am is capable of printing a variety of materials such as polymers bagheri saed et al 2020 balli et al 2017 depalma et al 2020 eng et al 2017 garzon hernandez et al 2020 hong et al 2020 kwak et al 2020 lee et al 2017a melchels et al 2010 mohamed et al 2015 pugalendhi et al 2020 quan et al 2020 solomon et al 2020 tumbleston et al 2015 wu et al 2020 yuan et al 2019a zabidi et al 2019 ziaee and crane 2019 metals kuo et al 2020 tan et al 2015 concretes labeaga martínez et al 2017 lim et al 2012 tay et al 2016 wu et al 2016 and biomaterials ackland et al 2017 derakhshanfar et al 2018 murphy and atala 2014 ng et al 2019 this section will focus on the different ways am can be used to fabricate prototypes and also discuss the suitability of various am techniques that can be used for membrane based water treatment 2 1 types of additive manufacturing am can be used to prototype a product in several ways the distinction between direct am indirect am and hybrid am is briefly presented in fig 3 this classification helps to better understand the significance of 3d printing in different types of am processes and aids in the discussion of 3d printing spacers and membranes in the later sections 2 1 1 conventional additive manufacturing direct am and indirect am are categorized under conventional am and have been used to fabricate prototypes since the beginnings of am do et al 2018 hernández córdova et al 2016 taboas et al 2003 the difference between direct am and indirect am is that direct am fabricates the final prototype directly from the printing step while indirect am fabricates a negative mould of the final prototype there is thus a need for an additional moulding step for indirect am to realize the final product indirect am has the benefit of greater material flexibility because materials whose properties are unsuitable for 3d printing i e low viscosity can be fabricated using moulding instead van damme et al 2020 in conventional am the file preparation stage is of utmost importance because the cad model designed should contain features that make the prototype functional in the context of spacers the cad model of spacers should have filaments that alter the flow pattern within a flow channel in the context of membranes the cad model of membranes should have microscopic pores required to perform filtration at the printing stage the printer is selected such that it has sufficient printing resolution to fabricate the prototype according to the cad model designed the quality of the print is determined by deviations of the printed prototype from the cad model lopez et al 2018 the post processing in conventional am should only involve simple support removal or polishing measures 2 1 2 hybrid additive manufacturing hybrid am is commonly associated with metal printing where two or more established manufacturing processes usually additive and subtractive processes are used together to achieve the final desired design surface finish and mechanical properties strong et al 2018 zhu et al 2013 a detailed economic study was done on hybrid am and it highlighted the potential of hybrid am to save production cost and fabrication time on the overall process manogharan et al 2016 for membrane based water treatment it is interesting to note that there were several works which adopted the concept of hybrid am to fabricate ceramic and polymeric membranes al shimmery et al 2019 hwa et al 2018 li et al 2020 lv et al 2017 mazinani et al 2019 ray et al 2020 yuan et al 2019b in this paper we define hybrid am as a fabrication process that uses am in conjunction with other established fabrication processes to make prototypes with functional features depending on the type of membrane am has been used together with processes such as phase inversion dip coating thermal curing thermal sintering and debinding to make the prototypes the main reason of adopting hybrid am instead of direct indirect am today is due to the limited printing resolution of printers most 3d printers can only fabricate features greater than several hundreds of micrometres however the pore size requirement of membranes is in the sub micrometre scale it is thus extremely challenging to directly fabricate a functional membrane solely relying on am processes 2 2 additive manufacturing techniques with the wide range of materials available to 3d printing today it is reasonable to expect a variety of 3d printing techniques suitable for different materials currently there are over 50 different technologies available tan et al 2017 but all can be classifies into 7 different categories summarised in table 1 amongst them material extrusion material jetting powder bed fusion and vat photopolymerization are more commonly used in the prototyping of polymeric spacers via conventional am the other 3 categories binder jetting sheet lamination directed energy deposition were less popular due to limitations of material compatibility comparatively more waste generated in sheet lamination and printing resolution however they can still be useful in the fabrication of membranes if a hybrid am approach is adopted 2 2 1 material extrusion material extrusion is the most common category in 3d printing it works by extruding a polymeric filament through a heated print head onto a cooler build platform for curing astm 2012 the materials are heated to its melting point and extruded layer by layer with each layer being a horizontal cross section of the final product the adjacent layers are adhered together by extruding the next layer onto the previous layer before the latter is fully cured gnanasekaran et al 2017 lee et al 2016aa mohamed et al 2015 for more complicated prototypes support materials may be required during printing sood et al 2010 the most common printing technique associated with material extrusion is fused deposition modelling fdm or filament freeform fabrication fff shown in fig 4 in general only thermoplastics are used for this method due to the limitations of the print head temperature and filament state requirement of the print material common materials used for fdm include polylactic acid pla heidari rarani et al 2019 nonato et al 2019 acrylonitrile butadiene styrene abs sezer and eren 2019 tan et al 2017 polyethylene terephthalate glycol petg ajay kumar et al 2020 durgashyam et al 2019 and others ding et al 2019 gebisa and lemu 2019 sodeifian et al 2019 fdm fff printers are quite popular for membrane based water treatment in particular for membrane feed spacer fabrication shrivastava et al 2008 current research on membrane spacers are focused on optimising the spacer layer where researchers are more interested in fabricating small quantity of prototypes instead of large scale production fdm fff is sufficient for these purposes with the added benefit of being relatively simple and cheap sood et al 2010 smaller desktop fdm fff printers are even easily available on the market however there are some downsides to fdm fff surface finish of the products are generally inconsistent and grainy which might require post processing de leon et al 2016 tan et al 2017 in addition the prototypes are usually brittle and may not have the flexibility required for the spacers to be coiled into spiral wound modules tan et al 2018 tan et al 2016 swm the printing resolution is also relatively poor in comparison to other 3d printing techniques which explains why there were only literatures using fdm fff as direct am to fabricate spacers typically have thickness of 1 mm but not membranes with sub micron pores 2 2 2 material jetting in material jetting droplets of photocurable resins are selectively deposited onto the build platform and cured using a light source astm 2012 the resins are deposited drop by drop to form each horizontal cross section layer of the final model after a layer is completed the build platform is lowered for the next layer to be deposited on the previous layer at least two types of resins are typically used concurrently in material jetting to form the prototype one or more model material is used to make the prototype while another support material provides the necessary support for the structure during the printing process these support structures can be easily removed during post processing processes by using a water jet or dissolving in appropriate solvents the polyjet printing technique is an example under the material jetting category in fig 5 the multiple jetting heads allows for more than one type of model material to be printed simultaneously and the resins are cured using a uv lamp immediately the polyjet technique has the required printing resolution to directly fabricate spacers armbruster et al 2020 tan et al 2018 tan et al 2017 yanar et al 2020 yanar et al 2018 which are flexible and can be integrated into swm they also generally have better strength and do not delaminate easily even with prolonged immersion in water siddiqui et al 2016 this is an important characteristic if the products were to be used for water treatment purposes in addition the surface finish is relatively smoother as the printing resolution is better compared to most other 3d printing techniques siddiqui et al 2016 polyjet was used as a part of hybrid am to fabricate the substrate layer of a composite membrane with pore sizes around 200 µm al shimmery et al 2019 mazinani et al 2019 however it is incapable of directly fabricating a full membrane on its own because the printing resolution is still insufficient to fabricate the selective layer with pore sizes in the sub micrometre range post processing is also necessary to remove the support structures from the printed prototype 2 2 3 powder bed fusion powder bed fusion makes use thermal energy to melt or sinter a powder bed fusing them together astm 2012 the printing process starts by first laying down a layer of powder a heated source usually a high power laser will scan designated regions on the powder bed to fuse the powders together and form the first layer the building platform is then lowered and a new layer of powder is coated on top of the previous layer the process repeats itself until the whole model is completed wang et al 2017 common printing techniques associated with powder bed fusion include selective laser sintering sls selective laser melting slm and electron beam melting ebm the setup schematics of slm and emb are similar to sls shown in fig 6 the difference is that slm uses a higher energy laser to melt the powder bed while emb uses an electron gun as the power source instead of a laser to melt the powder bed amongst the various powder bed fusion techniques sls is the most commonly used technique for spacer fabrication sreedhar et al 2018 tan et al 2016 tan et al 2017 thomas et al 2019 this is probably due to the relatively good printing resolution of the printers and flexibility of the completed prototype there were also several literatures which reported using sls for the hybrid am of microfiltration membranes by controlling the laser power hatch space yuan et al 2017 yuan et al 2020 slm and emb are not as popular because melting tends to produce rigid and inflexible structures that cannot be coiled into swm hwa et al 2017 the powder bed fusion technology stands out compared to other 3d printing techniques due to its ability to fabricate complex structures without the need of support material the support comes from parts of the powder bed which were not sintered by the energy source hyde et al 2014 the drawback of this technique is that it may require a huge amount of materials even for small prototypes this is because the area of the whole powder bed is usually fixed for the printer and it has to be fully recoated during the printing of each layer even if the prototype only takes up a small segment furthermore only about 50 of the unused powder can be recycled at the end of the process which generates considerable wastage 3d hubs the overall printing time is also relatively long because the powder bed needs to be pre heated before the printing can start papadakis et al 2018 after the printing is done more time is needed to allow the prototype to cool before it can be removed from the powder bed as well 2 2 4 vat photopolymerization vat photopolymerization makes use of photocurable liquid resins to fabricate a model where a laser or uv light source is used to cure the liquid resin during the printing process astm 2012 there are two different ways a model can be fabricated as shown in fig 7 the bottom up printing process starts by lowering the building platform into the tank such that it is one layer thickness away from the transparent bottom the projector selectively cures the first layer using an appropriate light source through the transparent bottom a peeling step is required for the bottom up approach where the cured layer detaches from the bottom of the tank the platform is then raised by a layer height and the process repeats itself until the whole model is completed leong et al 1998 the difference of the top down approach is that the light source cures the model from the top at the liquid surface instead of the bottom of the vat the peeling step between the curing of each successive layers is thus unnecessary in addition the building platform is being lower by a layer height instead of being raised after the curing of each successive layer 3d hubs some common 3d printing techniques associated with this concept include stereolithography sla digital light processing dlp and continuous liquid interface production clip and two photon polymerization 2pp sla uses a focused laser beam to trace each layer for curing eng et al 2017 melchels et al 2010 dlp speeds up the curing process by projecting the pattern of the entire layer all at once instead of scanning the pattern line by line bagheri saed et al 2020 hong et al 2020 kwak et al 2020 clip further quickens the overall printing process by reducing the transition time needed between each layer by introducing an oxygen permeable zone below the projection plane photopolymerization is inhibited between the window and the prototype this eliminates the need of a peeling step to detach the part from the bottom of the tank after every layer which significantly reduces the time required for printing tumbleston et al 2015 sla and dlp have been used to produce membrane spacers ali et al 2019 liu et al 2013 because the printing process only requires minimal amount of resin to cover the bottom on the tank if a bottom up approach is adopted this is suitable for fabricating membrane spacers since researchers mainly adopt 3d printing to fabricate small prototypes cheaper desktop scale printers are also available on the market for these purposes and the resolution of these printers are more than sufficient for membrane spacer fabrication although it is still unlikely that dlp is capable of directly fabricating membranes with pore sizes suitable for water filtration in the sub micron range it is interesting to note that dlp has been associated with 3d printed membranes used for gas separation by direct and indirect am femmer et al 2014 femmer et al 2015a femmer et al 2015b to the best of the author s knowledge 2pp is the only 3d printing technique capable of directly printing membrane pores for microfiltration purposes lee et al 2016aa perrucci et al 2018 due to its excellent printing resolution in the sub micrometre range malinauskas et al 2013 ovsianikov et al 2012 however the exceptional resolution of this printing technique comes with extremely slow printing speeds and small build volume limited to several cubic millimetres thus it has only been used for microfluidic channels up to date perrucci et al 2018 2 2 5 other categories the last three categories of 3d printing are binder jetting sheet lamination and direct energy deposition astm 2012 these three categories are discussed together because they all have intrinsic drawbacks which makes them unsuitable or less popular for polymeric membranes and spacers fabrication binder jetting as seen in fig 8 a has a similar concept as powder bed fusion the difference is that binder jetting relies on liquid binders instead of a heat source to fuse the powder particles together liquid binders such as maltodextrin or paraffin wax acts as an adhesive for the powders they are selectively deposited on the powder bed to form the respective cross sections of the prototype lv et al 2019 3d hubs this technique is not widely used for membrane spacer fabrication due to its limited selection of material and brittle properties however there were reports of hybrid am using binder jetting to fabricate ceramic membranes hwa et al 2018 these membranes were fabricated by printing a solid cylindrical green part and the pores of these membranes were later formed by post printing heat treatments from this perspective the significance of 3d printing may be ambiguous in the hybrid am process because the pore sizes cannot be controlled directly from 3d printing more detailed discussions on this matter will be brought up in the later sections of the paper sheet lamination in fig 8b fabricates prototypes by joining sheets of material together astm 2012 each sheet is a precision cut of a horizontal cross section of the final model where they are joined by physical adhesions molitch hou 2018 or various metallurgy bondings neikov 2019 selection of model material is thus limited to paper metallic neikov 2019 and some polyvinyl chloride pvc heynick and stotz 2006 sheets laminated object manufacturing lom usually generates more waste because the amount of material used is equivalent to the box that contains the sheets of material regardless of how small the prototype part is heynick and stotz 2006 the biggest drawback of this technique is that it is unable to print complicated structures since the internal parts of the object are inaccessible molitch hou 2018 all these factors coupled together make it an unsuitable technique for fabrication of both membrane and spacer lastly directed energy deposition techniques such as laser metal deposition lmd and laser engineered net shaping lens focuses an energy source onto a small region to melt and fuse materials together as they are being deposited onto the substrate melt pool astm 2012 although directed energy deposition techniques are possible for polymers it is mainly used for metal prototype fabrication gibson et al 2015 it is even referred to as metal deposition technology in many literatures in addition the surface finish and roughness is also relatively poor gibson et al 2015 which may be sufficient for membrane spacers but unsuitable for the fabrication of the fine pores of a filtration membrane 3 additive manufacturing for membrane spacers membrane spacers can be found in various membrane based processes such as microfiltration mf ultrafiltration uf nanofiltration nf reverse osmosis ro forward osmosis fo electrodialysis ed membrane distillation md and others al amshawee et al 2020 phattaranawik et al 2001 pinnau and freeman 1999 popovic and wessling 2015 schwinge et al 2004 they play two important roles within their respective modules 1 act as stabilizers to separate membranes and form feed channels 2 act as turbulence promoters to encourage mixing and minimize concentration temperature polarization effects conventionally membrane spacers have mesh like structures commonly made by extrusion and welding of low density polypropylene filaments due to their excellent flexibility and chemical stability al amshawee et al 2020 anvari et al 2020 tan et al 2016 they generally improve the mass heat transfer of the membranes and thus decrease concentration temperature polarization effects however they also increase trans module pressure loss due to greater resistance in the feed channel anvari et al 2020 gurreri et al 2016 van paassen et al 1998 to improve this trade off effect it is essential to optimise the membrane spacer layer to maximise mass heat transfer while minimizing energy consumption lee et al 2016b schwinge et al 2000 an optimised spacer design can also slow down the build up of foulants on the membrane surface kerdi et al 2019 a recent techno economic study toh et al 2020 revealed that for a constant recovery rate the total cost of desalination decreases as membrane permeance increases however further reduction in cost with greater membrane permeance is limited due to severe concentration polarization effects advanced feed spacers hypothetical spacers which could increase sherwood number by 50 and decrease fanning friction factor by 50 were able to achieve similar levels of cost reduction as conventional spacers at only half the membrane permeance value given that new membranes with higher permeance are constantly sought after research on innovative spacers are also essential to minimize the cost of operation however it is a challenge to fabricate the prototypes of innovative spacers because they often have complex designs beyond the capabilities of traditional fabrication methods as such evaluation of these spacers were mostly limited to computational fluid dynamics cfd studies balster et al 2006 li et al 2016 liu et al 2015 schwinge et al 2000 xie et al 2014 3d printing was introduced to overcome this fabrication obstacle with its high degree of design customisation prototypes of these novel spacers can be easily printed directly and verified experimentally 3 1 conventional additive manufacturing for spacers fig 9 shows a variety of 3d printed spacers which are all very different from the conventional mesh designs prototypes of these spacers were only able to be fabricated due to 3d printing kerdi et al 2018 used dlp to directly fabricate perforated spacers fig 9a the printed spacers had holes at intersection nodes 1 hole spacer and along filaments 2 hole and 3 hole spacer that generated micro jets within the feed channel to eliminate dead zones the 1 hole spacer was reported to be most efficient in increasing permeate production and it also kept the membrane surface cleanest this is attributed to the stronger micro jets through the holes that contributed to the fluctuating shear stress at the outlets to discourage foulant deposition kerdi et al 2020 also fabricated various spacers with helical filaments using dlp the 3 helical spacers proved to be the best as they generated the largest turbulence around grooves along the helical filaments and increased the downstream local velocity this spacer achieved outstanding results by increasing permeate flux up to 291 while reducing pressure loss across the channel by 65 ali et al 2020 adopted dlp as well to fabricate turbospacers where a turbine shaped rotor is installed around a central cylindrical shaft fig 9i such that it is free to rotate during the filtration processes this rotation causes fluctuations to the shear stress on the membrane surface thereby slowing down the growth of foulants the turbospacers showed promising results achieving specific flux more than 3 times higher with 2 5 times lower energy consumption compared to conventional spacers yanar et al 2020 directly fabricated honeycomb spacers which were made of numerous hexagonal shapes fig 9b using polyjet these spacers improved membrane flux by distributing the shear fully across the membrane the reverse solute flux was reduced by up to 50 while maintaining similar water flux as the commercial spacer in their fouling study they also found out that the foulant thickness was half of that of the commercial spacer ali et al 2019 used dlp to directly fabricate column type spacers where the intersecting nodes were replaced by circular columns of different diameter fig 9c water filtration results revealed that column spacers reduced trans module pressure drop by up to 3 folds and increased specific water flux by up to 2 folds biomass accumulation was also considerably lower compared to the conventional spacer in their short term biofouling test in recent years several studies castillo et al 2019 sreedhar et al 2018 thomas et al 2019 started to explore triply periodic minimal surface tpms spacers that were mathematically derived from the local area minimization principle fig 9e they successfully fabricated the spacers directly using sls the spacer s structure minimized the contact area between membrane and spacer thus avoiding any unnecessary flow restrictions and stagnant zones the spacers were tested for ro uf and md purposes and they reported flux enhancement of up to 70 compared to the conventional spacer however the trans module pressure loss was also more than 200 greater several other novel spacers are summarised in table 2 although most of the works on 3d printed spacers focused on the inherent design of the spacer there are a few papers which studied other aspects of 3d printed spacers i e spacer was kept to the conventional mesh design siddiqui et al 2016 compared several printing techniques for spacer fabrication in their study fdm did not have the required resolution to fabricate then thin spacer filaments the prototype was also brittle and unsuitable for swm purposes sla was also not suitable because the spacers were inflexible and dissolved in water over time polyjet was deemed the most suitable technique because they were able to achieve higher printing resolution at relatively low cost tan et al 2017 made a more detailed comparison on solid fdm liquid polyjet and powder form sls of 3d printing amongst them polyjet has the greatest part to model accuracy while fdm has the least accuracy owing to these random deviations in fdm prototypes the mass transfer of fdm spacers were highest probably due to greater disruptions in the pattern flow however the increased disruption also led to greater pressure loss across the flow channel the surface finish of the spacers was also important because bacteria tends to attach to rougher surface in biofouling experiments it was interesting to note that the fdm spacers had the lowest bacteria attachment affinity despite their high macroscale roughness these results were attributed to their relatively lower microscale roughness despite the superior performance of fdm polyjet and sls were still recommended by the authors for spacer fabrication over fdm because the degree of accuracy was poor for fdm they suggested that perhaps using a more accurate printing technique to fabricate deliberated randomised geometry would be a better approach in general direct 3d printing of spacers have helped researchers look into more complex spacer designs some of these spacers such as the perforated spacer helical spacer turbospacer column spacer and multi layered spacer were able to reduce energy consumption while increasing water flux others were able to improve the trade off effect by greatly increasing water flux with minimal increase in energy consumption the surface finish of the spacers also affected the performance therefore selecting a suitable printer is also important to optimise the spacer it was interesting to note that indirect am was not used in the fabrication of spacers and this could be attributed to the lack of studies on functional properties of the spacers for example there is limited information on the spacers mechanical strength and flexibility to determine if they can be rolled into swm there is also little information on the chemical stability of the spacers whether they degrade in seawater wastewater high temperature conditions essentially these properties determine if 3d printed spacers are suitable for integration into actual water treatment processes indirect am might be more common in the future when materials with better properties for the industry but are not suitable for direct 3d printing i e low viscosity needs to be used these materials could potentially be casted in 3d printed moulds to make spacers with optimised design and functionality van damme et al 2020 3 2 hybrid additive manufacturing for spacers hybrid am is also not used in spacer fabrication for the same reasons as indirect am studies for spacers are currently focused more on design optimisation rather than overall functionality hybrid am might come into play in the future when functional properties of the feed spacers are taken into consideration additional heating processes have shown potential for improving the mechanical strength of polymeric parts benwood et al 2018 another possible reason why hybrid am is not used for spacer fabrication at the moment is because the resolution of current 3d printers is already sufficient to meet the demands of spacer filaments lee et al 2016b spacer filaments typically have thickness around 1 mm which is achievable with the current 3d printing technology as such there is no need to rely on any additional fabrication processes to fabricate spacers for design optimisation purposes 4 additive manufacturing for membranes in water treatment the main function of membranes is to act as a selective barrier to separate water from pollutants there are many different types of membranes available the easiest way to classify them is by their material which is usually polymeric or ceramic other ways to classify membranes include module configuration flat sheet tubular hollow fibre spiral wound process driving force concentration pressure electrical potential or temperature gradient or pore size mf 0 1 1 µm uf 0 01 0 1 µm nf 0 001 0 01 µm and ro 0 001 µm traditional fabrication of ceramic membranes involves multiple high temperature and energy intensive sintering processes resulting in membranes with large outer diameter and low packing density lee and li 2017 this is unfavourable from an economic point of view which is why polymeric membranes are more commonly used in the industry phase inversion is most commonly used for the fabrication of polymeric membranes mulder 2000 it involves the removal of a solvent from a liquid polymer solution to form a polymeric membrane wienk et al 1996 zare and kargari 2018 zhang et al 2018 in contrast to sintering phase inversion is cheaper and faster making it more cost effective in addition phase inversion is able to produce flat sheet and hollow fibre membranes that can be easily integrated into filtration modules with high packing densities crowder and gooding 1997 however phase inversion is a complex process because there are many delicate considerations such as the properties of solvent properties of polymer temperature of anti solvent etc strathmann and kock 1977 slight alterations to these parameters can greatly affect the morphology and properties of the final membrane matsuyama et al 2001 to overcome the challenges of conventional ways to fabricate membranes researchers have explored the possibilities of 3d printing as an alternative method however the feasibility of 3d printing sub micron porous membranes i e mf membranes remains in question on one hand there are papers which stated that the resolution of 3d printers are insufficient for printing membrane pore sizes in sub micrometre range lee et al 2016b tan et al 2016 on the other hand there are papers which reported the successful fabrication of 3d printed membranes chowdhury et al 2018 perrucci et al 2018 ray et al 2020 to better understand these conflicting reports we will classify the various membranes associated with 3d printing into the 3 different types of am i e direct am indirect am hybrid am based on how 3d printing was used in the fabrication process table 3 4 1 conventional additive manufacturing for membranes in direct am all features of the membrane should be printed according to its cad model designed therefore the pore sizes of the membranes can be controlled directly by the cad model itself to the best of the author s knowledge 2pp is the only printing technology today that potentially has the resolution required to fabricate membranes directly for water filtration lee et al 2016aproposed using 2pp to directly fabricate a sub micron porous membrane fig 10 b although no prototype was fabricated they believe that 2pp has the capabilities to print the fine pores because of its excellent printing resolution in the sub micron range later perrucci et al 2018 designed a cad model of a microfluidic channel integrated with a 4 µm porous filter fig 10a the pores were accurately fabricated using 2pp and filtration results showed that it successfully rejected micrometric particles larger than 4 µm although it is not quite in the sub micrometre range it still shows that 2pp has the potential to fabricate membranes however this fabrication technique is limited to small build volume of several cubic millimetres coupled with the long printing times it may not be feasible to fabricate membranes large enough for large scale water treatment purposes various tpms devices made of polydimethylsiloxane pdms were also designed and printed using dlp for gas separation applications femmer et al 2014 femmer et al 2015b the product was claimed to be a 3d printed membrane but it is not appropriately termed as a membrane due to the large pore sizes 100 µm it should be noted that contactors are used to provide an interface and work on a different principle he et al 2020 scholes et al 2016 from membrane filtration in which selective properties are critical for the latter instead of focusing on the membrane pore size material choice and surface area are more important factors for improving the overall performance of contactors the printing resolution requirement is thus less demanding to fabricate these structures which explains why dlp printers are sufficient for the fabrication of their tpms pdms membranes nevertheless the 3d printed contactors showed 30 70 superior mass transfer compared to conventional hollow fibre membranes due to the improved flow characteristics and higher surface area of the tpms design another method of fabricating membranes is by indirect am whereby 3d printing is used to fabricate a mould to help shape the final prototype lee et al 2016a proposed that instead of directly printing the pores of the membranes a moulding method could achieve better results fig 10b he speculated that moulds with thin extruding columns could be fabricated using 2pp and subsequently used to make membranes via phase separation µ moulding vogelaar et al 2003 vogelaar et al 2005 to achieve pore sizes in the nanometre range however no prototype was fabricated and this method also faced drawbacks such as long printing times and small build volume femmer et al 2015a also fabricated pdms tpms contactors pore size 100 µm by making a sacrificial mould fig 10c these moulds were printed using dlp and they had similar improvements on mass transfer as the contactors that were printed directly by dlp in general conventional am faces many challenges in fabricating membranes for water treatment most printers do not have the required resolution to print the fine details of a membrane cad model although 2pp has a printing resolution in the submicron range no membrane was actually made with pore sizes of 1 µm mf membranes yet other drawbacks of long printing time and small build volume of 2pp also make it hard for upscale production however conventional am has definitely seen success in fabricating contactors as the prototypes showed promising results in terms of performance 4 2 hybrid additive manufacturing for membranes for hybrid am 3d printing is used in conjunction with other conventional processes to make a final functional prototype in general there are two different ways hybrid am methods used to fabricate membranes 1 printing a simple green part and relying on post printing heat treatments i e thermal curing debinding or sintering to form pores 2 printing a support layer and relying on conventional methods i e phase inversion and dip coating to make a selective layer to be assembled into a composite membrane for the first hybrid am method the membrane pore sizes can be controlled to a certain extent by varying the composition of the printing resin powder bed or manipulating the sintering laser properties ray et al 2020 fabricated a ceramic membrane using a custom developed dlp system known as solvent based slurry stereolithography 3s wang and dommati 2018 fig 10f the slurry was made of alumina as the structural component methanol as the solvent and a photopolymer resin as the binding agent to control the membrane pore size in the final prototype the size of the alumina particles in the slurry was varied larger alumina particles led to larger pore sizes because there would be larger gaps between each particle this slurry was used to print a thin rectangular solid green part that subsequently underwent a series of thermal debinding and sintering processes to form the pores in the solid structure thermal debinding removes the binding agent from the green part and thermal sintering closes the gaps between the structural component particles resulting in a thin film porous membrane with pore sizes around 8 14 nm hwa et al 2018 adopted a similar approach in fabricating a ceramic membrane instead of using dlp binder jetting was employed to print a 3d cylindrical solid using kankara clay as the structural component and maltodextrin as the binder solution fig 10g the green part was then sintered in a high temperature furnace to form the pores around 3 µm within the solid the resulting membrane was able to remove up to 97 8 of total organic carbon and 53 9 total suspended solids similar results were observed when the particle size of the kankara clay used was varied larger kankara clay led to larger pore sizes sls was also used to sinter modified polyamide powders into a thin film of membranes yuan et al 2017 yuan et al 2020 the incomplete powder coalescence during the sintering process forms pores in the membranes the pore size can be controlled to a certain extent by changing various parameters of the laser such as power hatch space and scanning speed by coating commercially available pa2200 powder with a layer of candle soot the resulting membranes exhibited superoleophobic and hydrophobic properties in water they had mean pore sizes from 9 8 14 5 µm and were able to achieve oil water separation greater than 99 these membranes also exhibited great chemical and mechanical stability it is evident that although dlp binder jetting and sls do not have the inherent resolution to print membrane pores directly or indirectly they can still achieve a good prototype membrane with the aid of appropriate heat treatments that being said there are some fundamental concerns with these hybrid am membranes which were not sufficiently addressed most publications focused on the performance aspect of the membrane but less attention was paid to the 3d printing aspect the pore size of the membranes cannot be directly controlled from the 3d printing cad model which makes it hard to evaluate the quality of print because the final prototype has important features which are not present in the original cad model lopez et al 2018 furthermore it was noticed that am was used to only print simple rectangular or circular thin films as green parts and some might question the significance and need for am in the overall fabrication process the unique advantage of am is the great freedom in design but it cannot be fully utilized here for the fabrication of membranes due to the limitations of 3d printers perhaps a more efficient way to make these membranes using the heat treatment concept is to explore simpler alternatives such as moulding or casting to form the simple green parts for the second hybrid am method the pore sizes of the support layer is directly controlled by the cad model design 3d printing can be used to fabricate the support layer because it is usually very porous with pore sizes up to several hundreds of micrometres al shimmery et al 2019 and mazinani et al 2019 designed and printed a layer of wavy support with pore sizes around 200 µm using polyjet fig 10e the selective polyethersulfone pes layer was fabricated separately using conventional phase inversion method and they were adhered together using vacuum pressure followed by pure water filtration it was found that the wavy pattern on the support structure significantly increased the water permeate up to 30 yuan et al 2019b also fabricated another composite membrane using a similar concept he used sls to print a support layer made of polyamide and subsequently coated it with zeolitic imidazolate framework zif l crystals and pdms to achieve a super hydrophobic and oleophobic membrane when subjected to oil water separation tests these membranes achieve excellent oil rejection rate greater than 99 while maintaining a relatively high flux the downside with membranes fabricated using the second type of hybrid am is that am is not used to entirely replace the conventional ways of making membrane it was noticed that these membranes still have to rely on phase inversion or dip coating to fabricate the selective layer of the membrane due to the limitations of the 3d printer in addition some membranes lack long term performance tests these tests are important because the membranes generally involve an assembly step where a selective layer is combined with the 3d printed support layer the interfacial bonding between the layers might deteriorate over time and delamination or leeching problems can only be observed if the test duration is longer to summarize hybrid am is more suitable for making membranes with the current printing resolution of most 3d printers the prototypes generally have great performance in terms of flux or rejection rate however there are several issues such as the significance of 3d printing print quality and long term performance test which were not sufficiently discussed in published papers yet it is also interesting to note that 3d printing has only been associated with pressure driven and concentration gradient driven membranes am both conventional and hybrid has not been employed to fabricate membranes for ed or md yet 5 future trends of additive manufacturing 5 1 short term shift of focus in the overall additive manufacturing process the focus of 3d printing has always been placed on conventional am where functional prototypes were fabricated by designing and printing according to a cad model designed this is observed in the fabrication of spacers section 3 where cad models of innovative spacers are loaded into the printer to be printed accordingly it can be said that the 3d printing technology today is capable of printing spacers with of various designs easily as long as there is an available cad model however when it comes to fabrication of membranes section 4 the fabrication procedure is not as simple due to low printing resolution of 3d printers the fine details of a membrane cad model with sub micrometre pore sizes cannot be easily printed directly even with 2pp which has sufficient resolution there are other process limitations such as build size and printing speed which makes it challenging to print larger membranes to make functional membranes we can see that some researchers have already started shifting their focus onto hybrid am hybrid am makes use of other conventional processes in conjunction with 3d printing to overcome the various limitations of 3d printers the microscopic pores in the membranes are often formed by the other processes which were used together with 3d printing it is evident that 3d printing is evolving from a single standalone process i e conventional am into a multi integrated process i e hybrid am it is becoming part of a bigger fabrication system whereby parts are prepared separately and assembled to form a functional product this concept is already widely seen in the biomedical lee et al 2019b lee et al 2015 lei et al 2020 naghieh et al 2017 rajzer et al 2018 and electric field espalin et al 2014 lewis and ahn 2015 macdonald et al 2014 shemelya et al 2014 but not as common in the water treatment field as the focus shifts from conventional am to hybrid am in membrane based water treatment it is expected that future studies regarding 3d printing in this field will have a different direction for spacers the potential of hybrid am to improve the properties of the 3d printed spacer can be explored research to improving their mechanical strength or even chemical stability in saline or wastewater will make 3d printing more feasible for industry usage for membranes some fundamentals regarding 3d printing in hybrid am should be addressed first the significance of am in the overall process and a criterion to determine the quality of 3d print should be established after that more focus can be placed on better integrating various processes with 3d printing to make the overall fabrication system more comprehensive and effective currently there are still some issues with the hybrid am process which needs to be addressed such as the material compatibility between various processes interconnectivity transition between the different processes interfacial bonding etc 5 2 mid term from prototyping to manufacturing today most 3d printing studies in the water treatment industry are still on small lab scale experiments amongst all the publications on spacers and membranes today there were only several reporting on the commercial integration of 3d printed spacers or membranes into an actual water treatment system nanosun 2018 nunes et al 2020 this is due to various challenges faced by am which can be broadly classified under upscaling challenges and material challenges to make 3d printing feasible in the water treatment industry these limitations needs to first be addressed ngo et al 2018 3d printing is capable of fabricating highly customizable products but there are many drawbacks within the process that make it unsuitable for large scale production one of the most obvious problems that 3d printing faces is the limitation of build size in the research of 3d printed spacers and membranes most prototypes have dimensions of less than 30 cm however commercial swm would require dimensions up to 1 m which is way beyond the build size of most 3d printers as seen in table 1 another concern is the relatively slow printing speed of 3d printers compared to conventional fabrication methods conventional heat extrusion of thermoplastics in industries can produce cross sections of 1000 cm2 at a speed up to 640 m h tempelman et al 2014 even the fastest industrial 3d printer today hp pales greatly in comparison achieving only a mere 0 05 m h printing speed not to mention when larger and more complex parts are printed in great quantity the time required for printing may be further increased ngo et al 2018 pereira et al 2019 tofail et al 2018 processing power requirement might also be an issue during upscaling as more details and complexity are added to the cad model the computational cost greatly increases to fabricate membranes with microscopic pores at a scale large enough for industrial use high performance computing platforms will be required to process the cad files this could well be a practical problem in the future even with improvements to high resolution printing technologies such as 2pp essentially these factors result in diseconomies of scale and makes it challenging for upscale production using 3d printing despite that it is evident that there are attempts made to overcome these obstacles lee et al 2017b suggested that the speed of 3d printers are limited by two factors reset time between layers treset and image time per layer timage treset is associated with the transition time between subsequent layers includes platform movement powder recoating computer processing and model support material deposition it can be reduced with technological breakthroughs such as the development of clip tumbleston et al 2015 to eliminate the peeling step in vat photopolymerization processes this drastically increased the printing speed and it took only 6 5 mins to print a prototype that would normally take sla 11 5 h to complete the fastfff system go and hart 2017 also greatly improved the printing speed in material extrusion processes by using a nut feed filament drive and laser assisted heaters they achieved building rates 10 times faster than commercially available desktop fdm printers the most recent advancement of tomographic am loterie et al 2020 is also worth mentioning here due to its innovative way of improving the vat photopolymerization processes instead of projecting the cross sections of a model layer by layer into the resin tank tomographic am makes use of a multi beam system to simultaneously project the entire 3d volume into a tank of transparent resin this further reduced the printing time to a matter of seconds timage is associated with energy required to solidify each layer and can be reduced using printers with higher energy outputs bigrep cosine blb industries these printers are also generally larger which can help overcome the limitation of build size it might even be possible to explore a printing while moving concept adopted in concrete printing tiryaki et al 2018 to further increase the build size of 3d printers if successful it will definitely be a huge step towards upscaling of 3d printing all these works to improve the 3d printing technology are indications where existing challenges are slowly being addressed with continuing efforts it is optimistic that 3d printing will be feasible for upscaling in the future aside from upscaling there are also concerns from the 3d printing material aspect previously in the context of lab research more emphasis was placed on the physical features of the end product i e spacer design and pore size however adaptation for industrial usage would require more considerations on the functionality of the product in particular the environment which the product is being used needs to be considered when choosing the material so that they will have suitable properties to be integrated into industrial water treatment systems later for example membranes fabricated by 3d printing needs to have certain flexibility for it to be coiled and integrated into a swm composite membranes fabricated by 3d printing al shimmery et al 2019 mazinani et al 2019 for lab scale tests had rigid support layers which did not have the required flexibility it is also important that the products have certain chemical stability to not degrade in their environment i e saline water high temperature high pressure pla heidari rarani et al 2019 nonato et al 2019 which is a common material used for 3d printing is thus unsuitable for the fabrication of membranes and spacers yanar et al 2018 for industrial purposes because they would degrade in water over long periods of time toxicity of the 3d printed parts is also a concern especially if used in water treatment studies suggests that vat photopolymerization printing methods tend to have higher degree of toxicity due to the photopolymers used in the printing process macdonald et al 2016 mesbah oskui et al 2016 other possible hazards include emission of ultrafine particles from fdm printers azimi et al 2016 house et al 2017 stephens et al 2013 which are linked to respiratory diseases a possible way to tackle all these problems is to expand the range of material available for 3d printing in particular materials like polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf polytetrafluoroethylene ptfe polyethersulfone pes and several others have proven to be suitable for water treatment purposes some of these materials such as pvdf are gradually being adopted for the printing of industrial membranes nanosun 2018 perhaps there will be interest in commercialising other suitable materials for membrane and spacer fabrication in the future as well 5 3 long term 4d printed membranes and spacers four dimensional 4d printing is a relatively new concept especially in the water treatment industry it is essentially the use of 3d printing to fabricate prototypes using smart materials that give some form of response under certain stimulus hence the fourth dimension lee et al 2017a lee et al 2019a momeni et al 2017 pei and loh 2018 these smart materials unlock various capabilities such as self assembly multi functionality and self repair momeni et al 2017 pei and loh 2018 some of the stimuli which have been studied to date include water heat light electricity or magnetism and they usually feedback with physical responses such as bending folding expansion swelling or changes to surface topography bakarich et al 2015 caputo et al 2018 ge et al 2014 goo et al 2020 grinberg et al 2019 kim et al 2018 kuksenok and balazs 2016 lee et al 2017a lee et al 2019a momeni et al 2017 sydney gladman et al 2016 tibbits 2014 in general 4d printing can be classified into 2 broad categories which are shape shifting and shape memory prototypes momeni et al 2017 pei and loh 2018 zhou and sheiko 2016 fig 11 shape shifting prototypes are able to give an immediate response when a stimulus is applied and they will revert back to their original form when the stimulus is removed shape memory prototypes are further classified into 2 sub categories namely one way and two way one way shape memory prototypes are able to deform in a programming stage i e external force and kept in a temporary shape until a stimulus is applied in the recovery stage to revert the prototype back to its original shape two way shape memory prototypes rely on two different kinds of stimulus to deform into a permanent shape and revert back into its original shape respectively all this is possible by carefully selecting appropriate materials which swells under different conditions hence the name smart materials today some challenges which are associated with 4d printing include their printability degree of response reversibility and repeatability khoo et al 2015 lee et al 2017a lee et al 2019a momeni et al 2017 pei and loh 2018 the most prominent usage of 4d printing is in the biomedical industry where there were attempts of printing tissue cells jamal et al 2013 mutlu et al 2015 villar et al 2013 cardiovascular stents ames et al 2009 anand et al 2009 ge et al 2016 yakacki et al 2007 yakacki et al 2008 zarek et al 2017 scaffolds an et al 2015 gao et al 2016 irvine and venkatraman 2016 miao et al 2016 wei et al 2017 etc carbonell and braunschweig 2017 malachowski et al 2014 to the best of the author s knowledge there are no studies yet on 4d printed membranes or spacers for water treatment application yet but it is possible to discuss their potential here from the membrane spacer perspective many studies today focus on optimising the flow within the channel to generate shear forces that discourage the deposition of foulants with 4d printing it is possible to make dynamic spacers that introduce direct movement within the flow channel small vibrations can be induced using an alternating electric magnetic field if the spacers are made of piezoelectric ferromagnetic materials some preliminary studies already suggest that vibrations could reduce the rate of membrane fouling li et al 2016 or even become a self cleaning mechanism for the membrane if the vibrations are strong enough from the membrane perspective 4d printing could have the potential to fabricate smart membranes where their properties may change under different stimuli making use of the swelling properties of the smart materials it is possible that physical properties such as pore size or surface roughness can be varied under different stimuli to optimise the overall filtration process tijing et al 2020 future studies may focus on different stimuli such as ph or foulant concentration or other smart materials that give different responses such as surface charge banpurkar et al 2017 florczak 2017 sun et al 2019 or porosity kashyap et al 2018 can also be of interest in the water treatment field 6 conclusion the basic concept of 3d printing is a layer by layer fabrication technique which follows a standard 3 step procedure file preparation printing and post processing 3d printing can be used in 3 different ways to fabricate a prototype direct am indirect am and hybrid am direct and indirect am are conventional am methods which rely heavily on the cad model and printer to make a functional prototype while hybrid am uses 3d printing in conjunction with other established non am fabrication processes to make a functional prototype the various 3d printing techniques can be categorised into 7 different categories based on the way materials are deposited and cured amongst them sheet lamination and directed energy deposition have not been reported for the fabrication of membranes and spacers at all due to printing resolution and material limitations the other 5 categories material extrusion material jetting powder bed fusion vat photopolymerization binder jetting have been used to fabricate membrane and spacer prototypes by conventional am or hybrid am however there were still some differences noticed in the printing process for spacers and membranes most spacers were 3d printed directly and focus was placed more on cad model design and printing on the other hand most membranes were fabricated using a hybrid am approach where 3d printing is only part of the overall fabrication process and focus was placed more on the other processes instead of am to address the statement whether is it feasible to fabricate membranes using 3d printing the authors believe it depends on the type of 3d printing in discussion it is hard to fabricate mf membranes directly indirectly 0 1 1 µm pore size if one were to solely rely on am technology however by introducing a second process to be used in conjunction with am hybrid am can greatly increase its overall feasibility having said that it raises the question of am s significance in the overall fabrication process using hybrid am since essential features of membranes i e membrane pores cannot be directly controlled by the 3d printing process in our opinion 3d printing seems to be playing only a minor role in hybrid am for membranes the unique advantages of 3d printing cannot be fully utilised for membrane fabrication and we think that hybrid am for membranes at this stage is just a workaround for conventional 3d printing due to current technology limitations for membranes beyond uf range 0 1 µm pore size it can be said to be impossible to make with the 3d printing technology available today as the water treatment industry continues to grow in the future it is expected that the focus will continue to shift from conventional am to hybrid am with more emphasis placed on the 3d printing aspect 3d printing will also slowly move beyond the prototyping stage into the manufacturing stage for industries more emphasis will be placed on overcoming the upscaling and material limitations to manufacture larger and functional niche parts which are economical and practical future advancement in am technology could potentially open up other possibilities such as 4d printing for smart spacers and membranes declaration of competing

17388,the increasing pressure on the global water supply calls for more advanced solutions with higher efficiency and better sustainability leading to the promptly developing water reclamation and reuse schemes including treatment technologies and risk management strategies where microbial safety is becoming a crucial aspect in the interest of public health backed up by the development of membrane technology membrane bioreactors mbr have received substantial attention for their superiority over conventional treatment methods in many ways and are considered promising in the water reclamation realm this review paper provides an overview of the efforts made to manage and control the potential waterborne viral disease risks raised by the use of effluent from mbr treatment processes including the mechanisms involved in the virus removal process and the attempts to model the dynamics of the removal process in principle generalized and integrated virus removal models that provide insight into real time monitoring are urgently needed for advanced real time control purpose future studies of approaches that can well handle the inherent uncertainty and nonlinearity of the

sensor approach process driven modeling data driven modeling 1 introduction access to sufficient and safe water resources plays a central role in the prosperity and development of human society as the world population and economy continuously grow it is estimated that the global demand for water will increase by nearly one third by 2050 un water 2019 keeping up with this rapid growth in demand cost effectively and sustainably is considered one of the biggest challenges faced by water authorities around the globe converting wastewater into water that can be reused for certain purposes often referred to as water reclamation and reuse is a well established approach to mitigating the tension between limited resources and ever growing demand sun et al 2016 wu 2019 this approach also provides a dependable and stable water supply under unfavorable weather conditions angelakis et al 2018 the act of sewage treatment and reuse can be traced back to the very early stages of human history due to its environmental and ecological significance an early practice of prehistoric civilizations is directly applying untreated domestic wastewater to irrigation angelakis and snyder 2015 jaramillo and restrepo 2017 since then the development of related technologies and the establishment of regulations have continued unabated as new advancements in the treatment process and materials emerge the cost efficiency treatment capability and effluent quality of modern wastewater treatment plants wwtps have all been steadily increasing in recent decades diemer 2007 estimated that the usage of recycled wastewater in the u s will grow by 15 per year in terms of volume despite the long history of water reclamation angelakis and snyder 2015 only with the rapid development of modern science in recent centuries particularly in epidemiology and microbiology have the latent health risks and the importance of proper sanitation strategy in this practice been discussed and investigated duong and saphores 2015 jaramillo and restrepo 2017 leading to the increasing concern from the public and authorities smith et al 2018 vuppaladadiyam et al 2019 as a result beginning in the mid nineteenth century the construction of modern sewage systems aimed at the effective separation and proper treatment of wastewater to protect the public from being infected by waterborne pathogens and provide efficient waste disposal lofrano and brown 2010 owing to the influence of human activity both municipal and industrial wastewater may contain a variety of pathogenic microbes and other substances including metals pharmaceuticals and personal care products that could directly harm human health or lead to acute and chronic illness if not reduced to safe levels via treatment and distribution processes chen et al 2013a 2013b dodgen and zheng 2016 oteng peprah et al 2018 qadir et al 2013 2010 in particular waterborne enteric viruses present in reclaimed wastewater with fecal oral transmission routes are considered a primary health concern globally since they can cause several acute illnesses such as gastroenteritis and hepatitis gibson 2014 shakir et al 2017 in municipal wastewater the primary origin of enteric viruses is the shedding from infected individuals the shedding rate of norovirus particles has been demonstrated to reach up to 1010 per gram of feces teunis et al 2015 also compared to other pathogens such as protozoa and bacteria waterborne enteric viruses are more resistant to environmental factors and treatment processes due to their unique physical and biological characteristics despite not being able to reproduce in the environment without a host fox and stuckey 2015 moazeni et al 2017 sano et al 2016 prado et al 2019 investigated the enteric virus removal of three conventional activated sludge process wastewater treatment plants wwtps the recorded log reduction value lrv ranged from 0 37 to 2 36 without tertiary treatment methods which leads to a high occurrence of human enteric viruses in receiving water montazeri et al 2015 qiu et al 2015 furthermore the low infectious dose of enteric viruses means that a small amount of intake can lead to infection prevost et al 2016 qiu et al 2015 several potential human exposure pathways have been proposed consumption of shellfish grown in the contaminated aquatic environment and food crops irrigated by wastewater or fertilized by sludge the ingestion of contaminated drinking water and recreational water and farmworker exposure including aerosol inhalation and direct intake of reclaimed irrigation water dickin et al 2016 ito et al 2017 a dilemma is therefore faced by the stakeholders including academicians municipal authorities and environmental agencies there is an urgent need to utilize and manage water resources more efficiently and sustainably via water reclamation however the progress in meeting this need has been hindered by various factors including the inefficient virus removal of conventional wwtps the inability to effectively control the treatment and distribution process the lack of understanding of the underlying health risks and the rising concerns about public health gibson 2014 okoh et al 2010 historically the safety of reclaimed water had been managed by setting restrictions on its use based on the intensity of human exposure in certain activities and the quality levels of treated wastewater commonly monitored parameters include biological oxygen demand bod total suspended solids tss and bacterial indicators jeong et al 2016 us environmental protection agency 2012 however in terms of the virological quality of water these conventionally monitored chemical and bacterial parameters fail as reliable indicators of the prevalence of enteric viruses das et al 2020 hot et al 2003 jurzik et al 2010 pang et al 2019 thus direct detection of virus is the preferred solution molecular techniques notably quantitative polymerase chain reaction qpcr provide an alternative solution for detection and quantification of the virus content in water samples and are gaining popularity in recent years largely due to not only the high sensitivity specificity and shortened detection time typically within hours compared to the culture based methods but also the capability of detecting viruses that are currently non culturable in vitro coudray meunier et al 2015 haramoto et al 2018 miura et al 2015 prevost et al 2016 sano et al 2016 however the requirements for laboratory apparatus and trained personnel make a routinely performed detection infeasible for many wwtps randazzo et al 2019 especially those in the regions with limited resources where the implementation of sanitation management could be impeded also molecular detection methods often suffer from not being able to differentiate infectious virus particles from non infectious ones making such methods insensitive to the potential inactivation effect on virus particles brought about by treatment processes hassard et al 2017 randazzo et al 2019 the uncertainty surrounding the virological quality of reclaimed water has resulted in considerable hinderance to certain wastewater reuse practices one of the most strictly regulated use is food crop irrigation in the u s regulations regarding the use of reclaimed water on food crops vary among different states some states prohibit this act indiscriminately whereas others allow reclaimed water to be used only if some requirements are met for instance the states of florida nevada and virginia require that the reclaimed water must not directly contact the edible parts of the crop unless the crop will be peeled or thermally processed before being consumed us environmental protection agency 2012 in california although the practice of spraying reclaimed water onto edible parts of salad crops and strawberries has been successfully performed for over 40 years with no reports of human illness as a result parsons et al 2010 the title 22 regulations specify that the highest quality standards apply to the reclaimed water that would contact the edible parts of the crop cdph 2016 introducing advanced treatment methods to further reduce the pathogen content in effluent is an indispensable step in promoting the use of reclaimed water historically due to the inefficient virus removal of conventional wwtps tertiary treatments have commonly been employed for disinfection usually in the form of the addition of chemical disinfectants such as chlorine and ozone or the use of uv mbonimpa et al 2018 although these methods are capable of effectively bringing down pathogen concentration in the effluent and preventing the transmission of waterborne diseases they are subject to certain derivative issues e g the generation of disinfection by products dbps that possess genotoxicity and carcinogenicity li and mitch 2018 richardson et al 2007 high operating costs collivignarelli et al 2018 and the concern over the potential increase in antibiotic resistance li et al 2016 rizzo et al 2013 in the last fifty years powered by the rapid development of materials science and engineering the use of membrane in the realm of water treatment has become increasingly popular with one successful example being the membrane bioreactor mbr which comes in two forms aerobic membrane bioreactor aembr and anaerobic membrane bioreactor anmbr wang et al 2017 firstly commercialized in the early 1970s the application of mbr technology in municipal and industrial wastewater treatment has rapidly expanded with an average global market growth of over 10 since the turn of the millennium santos et al 2011 as the result of more stringent environmental regulations as well as the various advantages mbr provides compared to conventional treatment processes including high effluent quality reduced environmental footprint and nutrient recovery in the case of anmbr readers interested in more information on the mbr technology are referred to the extensive reviews previously published cecconet et al 2019 krzeminski et al 2017 lei et al 2018 lin et al 2013 ma et al 2018 xiao et al 2019 the core feature that distinguishes mbr from conventional biological wastewater treatment processes is the utilization of a membrane that enables highly efficient sludge separation which in the perspective of water safety can also serve as a barrier against waterborne pathogens francy et al 2012 harb and hong 2017 in addition to size exclusion which effectively rejects pathogens larger than the membrane pore size notably pathogenic bacteria and protozoa and aggregated virus particles baek and pagilla 2012 cecconet et al 2019 gentile et al 2018 judd 2016 the presence of biosolids also enables effective virus removal from the standpoint of water resource management the high effluent quality and pathogen removal capability of mbr systems can open up new possibilities by expanding the scale of existing reclaimed wastewater use peña et al 2019 better pathogen removal efficiency means the disinfectant dose required to meet the microbiological quality standard can be reduced leading to lower health and ecosystem concerns resulted from disinfection by products baek and pagilla 2012 purnell et al 2016 santasmasas et al 2013 together with the advantage of stable operation harb and hong 2017 xiao et al 2019 once the mbr systems are proven to be capable of continuously delivering decent virus removal performance the effluent can be used for purposes currently restricted for reclaimed water wu and kim 2020 the usability would surpass that of most current wastewater reclamation systems while being economically viable significantly relieving the stress on the natural freshwater supply chen et al 2013a de luca et al 2013 our current work focuses on the efforts dedicated to establishing a mathematical model for the virus removal process in mbr systems as the real time monitoring of virus removal performance via the soft sensor approach is of great interest as a critical part of advanced water safety management scheme firstly studies on virus removal performance of mbr systems and the contributing mechanisms are discussed to help readers get a grasp on the microbiological safety factor of mbr technology as well as to provide information on which factors contribute more significantly and thus should be looked for during model development secondly we review the historical and recent attempts to develop a mathematical model that connects easy to measure variables with virus removal efficiency via either conventional process driven approach based on the physicochemical and biological relationship and equations or novel data driven modeling techniques 2 membrane bioreactors at virus removal performance and mechanisms in recent years a number of studies have focused on the overall performance and contributing factors of the virus removal in mbr systems table 1 lists some recent studies that have covered a wide range of reactor scales configurations and object viruses generally speaking the mechanisms proposed based on experimental results whether in aembr or anmbr systems can be classified into three major categories the rejection and adsorption effect of the backwashed membrane the adsorption of virus particles to biomass and the decay and inactivation occurred in the mixed liquor phase fig 1 2 1 mechanisms involved in mbr virus removal 2 1 1 the role of membrane three mechanisms are directly related to virus reduction by the membrane alone size exclusion adsorption and electrostatic repulsion elhadidy et al 2013 gentile et al 2018 the principle behind size exclusion is rather intuitive particles larger than the membrane pores get either rejected by the membrane or stuck in the pore channel the larger the pores are the easier the virus particles can pass through the membrane the removal efficiency can therefore be significantly enhanced by choosing the membrane with a pore size close or smaller to the size of target virus lv et al 2006 reported that under the same operating condition using t4 phage average size 107 9 12 9 nm as the target a 0 22 μm membrane provided only 1 7 log removal whereas a 0 1 μm membrane reached a much higher removal of 5 8 logs when the diameter of the pathogen particles is at the same level as the nominal membrane pore size or less other mechanisms such as mechanical sieving and the aggregation of virus particles start to take effect and facilitate this process as reported by da silva et al 2011 and samandoulgou et al 2015 the aggregation of norovirus gi and gii particles is affected by ph and ionic strength and the size of aggregates may greatly exceed the membrane pore size under certain circumstances chaudhry et al 2015b reported a high removal rate by backwashed membrane with a 0 04 μm nominal pore size which is in line with the diameter of many enteric viruses however it is worth mentioning that anmbr plants tend to use membranes with a pore size ranging from 0 1 to 0 4 μm to increase the flux and reduce the operation cost brought by membrane fouling hai et al 2014 and under this circumstance the membrane itself may only provide limited removal capability when dealing with viruses small in size the adsorption of virus particles onto the membrane surface is mainly governed by hydrophobic and electrostatic effects while non specific interactions are of secondary importance gentile et al 2018 matsushita et al 2013 miura et al 2015 tufenkji 2007 madaeni 1997 studied the removal of poliovirus by a 0 2 μm mf membrane and concluded that the physicochemical characteristics of the virus particle and membrane material and the ratio of the pore diameter to virus particle diameter are the important influencing factors in the adsorption of viruses into the membrane the preferable condition for adsorption is when the two components have opposite charges or only a small amount of charges and generally low ph level can facilitate this process kosiol et al 2019 sidhu et al 2015 tanneru and chellam 2012 electrostatic repulsion works in a way different from membrane adsorption when the membrane material and virus particles share the same type of charge electrostatic repulsion would push the virus particles away from the membrane surface contributing to virus retention elhadidy et al 2013 gentile et al 2018 also in contrast to membrane adsorption the effect of electrostatic repulsion is more pronounced under increased ph level jeong et al 2017 van voorthuizen et al 2001 the other vital contributing factor hydrophobic effect works by minimizing the area of contact between water molecules and virus particles and between water and membrane surface thus increasing the potential of viruses to adsorb onto the membrane armanious et al 2016 the magnitude of this effect leans on a variety of factors including ionic strength virus surface characteristics and membrane material hai et al 2014 matsushita et al 2013 van voorthuizen et al 2001 xagoraraki et al 2014 it is also worth pointing out that the size of pores on the membrane is not consistent during the production and operation there might be abnormal pores on the membrane and these pores may lead to unexpected virus passage or decreased filtration performance thus the membrane pore distribution is also a factor to be considered in membrane size exclusion fane et al 2015 hirani et al 2010 the log normal distribution is widely applied to describe the membrane pore distribution giglia et al 2015 zydney et al 1994 based on that duek et al 2012 investigated the actual pore size distribution on several uf membranes and reported that it does have a significant effect on the virus rejection property in the study virus retention is more accurately predicted by the absolute pore size d 100 than by d 50 and d 90 indicating that abnormally large pores contribute more to virus passage through uf membrane a similar result was reported by kosiol et al 2017 who found that d 99 values of a number of membranes showed a correlation with lrvs of bacteriophage 2 1 2 effect of biomass adsorption as the biomass in the reactor grows both the suspended solids and the gel cake layer attached to the membrane surface develop it has been well acknowledged that the adsorption of virus particles to the biomass is a critical contributor to the virus removal in a number of ways chaudhry et al 2015a fox and stuckey 2015 huang et al 2012 lu et al 2013 madaeni et al 1995 wu et al 2010 yin et al 2016 zheng and liu 2006 firstly the adsorption of phage or enteric virus particles to the mixed liquor suspended solids mlss which consist of bacteria and organic compounds that are larger than the membrane pores makes their passage harder for instance shang et al 2005 reported a 0 8 log ms 2 phage removal by adsorption to the suspended biomass alone in a bench scale aembr and in the study of miura et al 2018 an 1 5 log removal of norovirus gi was achieved after 60 min of mixing with the mlss in a similar manner hirani et al 2010 recorded a higher removal rate of indigenous ms 2 coliphage compared to seeded ms 2 coliphage in several aembr systems and attributed it to the higher degree of particle association of indigenous coliphage mlss concentration and virus characteristics have been reported to be the main influencing factors wu et al 2010 found that the fraction of adsorbed somatic coliphage went up from 65 to 92 as mlss concentration increased from 1 6 g l to 9 6 g l in their aembr in the study of chaudhry et al 2015a three bacteriophages ms 2 phix174 and fr were fed into a bench scale aembr and a significant difference in their attachment to the mixed liquor biomass was observed while only 0 2 log10 removal can be attributed to suspended biomass attachment for ms 2 phix174 and fr showed much higher removal 1 2 and 3 0 log10 since the three bacteriophages have similar zeta potentials the difference in surface composition of the phages was assumed to be the cause secondly the biofilm attached to the membrane surface also plays a pivotal role in the removal process by adsorbing onto the inside of membrane pores or block the pores the decreased effective pore size and the reduced number of available pores raise the membrane resistance thereby making the passage of virus particles more difficult noshadi et al 2013 in addition the accumulation of gel and cake layers on the membrane surface provides extra adsorption spots as these layers are made up of soluble microbial products and extracellular polymeric substances that can potentially adsorb and trap virus particles sutherland et al 2004 also the presence of proteins in the mixed liquor inhibits the adsorption of the viruses on the membrane due to the competition between proteins and virus particles for adsorption sites madaeni 1997 in mbr systems where proteins make up a significant proportion of the extracellular polymeric substances epss and soluble microbial products smps sheng et al 2010 the inhibition caused by proteins can be a crucial factor furthermore the high concentration of suspended biomass may lead to a high excretion rate of epss and smps however the interaction between them and viruses has not been explained clearly yet miura et al 2015 ueda and horan 2000 investigated the effect of biofilm growth on virus removal performance and they found that the removal efficiency improved notably as the biofilm attached to the membrane surface grew and increased the filtration resistance a 2 1 log removal was achieved by 21 day biofilm whereas 9 hr biofilm achieved only a 0 3 log removal it is worth mentioning that membrane fouling despite the contribution to virus rejection is considered detrimental by the reactor operators because it leads to a decline in permeate flux and an alteration of the reactor hydrological characteristics bagheri et al 2019 nguyen et al 2012 eventually resulting in decreased throughput and higher operating costs xiao et al 2019 commonly employed fouling control strategies include membrane backwash gas sparging and chemical cleaning iorhemen et al 2016 melin et al 2006 also in recent years the addition of activated carbon in the reactor has received a considerable amount of attention for being both effective and financially economical yang et al 2019 fox and stuckey 2015 investigated the effect of gas sparging rate on phage removal in anmbr and found that ms 2 rejection increased with the elevated sparging intensity after a 10 day operation at a low sparging rate since high gas scouring relieves fouling the result may seem counterintuitive the authors suggested that it can be attributed to the reduced concentration polarization at the membrane surface resulted from intense gas sparging similar findings have been reported by cui et al 2003 and madaeni et al 1995 who concluded that increasing stirring and gas sparging can have a negative impact on the membrane permeability for particles like protein and virus simply put if the virus particles are seen as a solute a layer of high concentration will gradually build up in the vicinity of membrane surface during the filtration process resulting in an increased concentration of virus particles in the effluent when the gas sparging or stirring rate is increased this layer can get disrupted leading to a lower concentration of virus particles in the effluent this too suggests that the virus removal process is highly complicated with multiple mechanisms working simultaneously but nevertheless the role of biofilm has been well established casabuena et al 2019 chaudhry et al 2015a shirasaki et al 2008 finding a delicate balance between virus particle rejection performance and membrane permeability will be a vital task for reactor operators and requires a more comprehensive interpretation of the dynamics in the reactor huang et al 2012 2 1 3 decay and inactivation the major mechanisms responsible for the effect of mixed liquor on virus decay and inactivation are likely to be the predation by other microorganisms and enzymatic breakdown chaudhry et al 2015a hao et al 2010 for aembr wu et al 2010 found that the somatic coliphage decay was significantly accelerated in the presence of activated sludge compared to the spontaneous decay in the influent wastewater which took about 10 days to achieve 0 72 log10 removal likewise fox and stuckey 2015 reported that phage concentration in the anmbr mixed liquor phase decreased by about 2 log10 over the experiment period of two weeks which is faster than the expected washout rate under the same hydraulic condition suggesting that the anaerobic condition inside the reactor may facilitate the process of virus inactivation although conceptually all virus particles rejected by membrane and attached biofilm are subject to biodegradation considering the dominating contribution of membrane biofilm rejection and the typical hydraulic retention time hrt of several hours to days in mbr systems the effect of biodegradation on effluent virus concentration may not be so pronounced 2 2 perspectives on mbr virus removal studies compared to the number of studies dedicated to aembr virus removal performance in the case of anmbr as a relatively new but thriving technology only a few reports are currently available covering a limited range of configurations and operating conditions nevertheless the existing studies have revealed that anmbr and aembr have many things in common when it comes to virus removal including the overall efficiency and the responsible mechanisms although some differences are likely to exist due to their respective kinetics the good thing is with the potential of anmbr being further recognized more anmbr plants are being built or planned in various configurations for research and development needs and we can expect more studies on the topic of virus removal capability to be conducted in the near future because the safety aspects associated with this technology need to be thoroughly discussed and will play a central role in ameliorating public perception in the future still some vital information can be extracted from these past studies the reported virus removal efficiencies are highly system dependent and it makes parallel comparison very difficult if not impossible at all this is resulted from the diversity in reactor configurations e g plant scale membrane material and pore size hydraulic and solids retention time and in the sources and characteristics of the wastewater hai et al 2014 sano et al 2016 sometimes conclusions from different studies may even conflict for instance chaudhry et al 2015b reported that a 3 1 log10 reduction of norovirus gii was achieved solely by the backwashed membrane making it the greatest contributor in the total removal whereas fox and stuckey 2015 and ueda and horan 2000 both pointed out that the membrane provided only relatively poor phage rejection in their studies although the discrepancy likely comes from the different pore sizes used 0 04 μm vs 0 4 μm since the relative size of particles compared to membrane pores matters greatly in size exclusion another example is the study conducted by farahbakhsh and smith 2004 in which the adsorption onto the membrane surface or in membrane pores governed the coliphage removal when the membrane was pristine but as the membrane gradually got fouled the governing factor shifted to the interception by the cake layer this discrepancy can also be observed when the relative contribution of each mechanism is calculated and sorted but the order varies between studies lu et al 2013 shang et al 2005 all these indicate that the current understanding of the intricate process is still far from sufficient and further research will need to view from a wider angle as multiple highly coupled components are involved with a wide selection of influencing factors langlet et al 2009 miura et al 2018 xiao et al 2019 especially during the development of biofilm from previous studies we conclude that the primary contribution comes from the adsorption to suspended biomass and membrane retention either by the membrane itself or the biofilm attached since the physical properties of membrane stay stable while the biomass growth is a highly active process we speculate that to be more suited for the task the model should keep a close eye on the biological kinetics and how it proceeds to impact the physical processes 3 efforts on modeling virus removal in mbr 3 1 principles of regulatory frameworks to better instruct and optimize the planning and operation of the water sanitation and supply system for the mitigation of embedded health risks a systematic and holistic view of the whole picture is critical qadir et al 2010 world health organization 2017 this requirement has given birth to regulatory frameworks for risk evaluation and solution formation if adopted and conducted properly a scientific and detailed framework can help system planners efficiently analyze and evaluate the status quo tease out the problems and set appropriate goals design a thorough and reasonable methodology for forming a solution and avoid omitting any critical element roeger and tavares 2018 three water related guidelines formed by the world health organization water safety plans wsp sanitation safety planning ssp and safe use of wastewater excreta and greywater davison et al 2005 world health organization 2015 2006 provide in depth notions on the topic of improving water safety and promoting water reuse in a scientific manner the water safety plans is dedicated to managing drinking water quality and protecting public health from the risks in the drinking water supply the safe use of wastewater excreta and greywater and the sanitation safety planning focus on maximizing the public health benefits of wastewater reuse and sanitation interventions notwithstanding the different specific application scenarios they all provide valuable insight into the overall workflow aspects to consider and critical steps to follow as preventive managing approaches these guidelines highlight the importance of early risk identification and effective operational monitoring rather than end product inspection to ensure the cost efficiency of the system and a short response time critical for time sensitive fields like public health management the operational monitoring involves setting operational limits within which the predetermined health target can be achieved and a proper monitoring strategy that ensures the operation of the system falls within the acceptable limits as an example according to the safe use of wastewater excreta and greywater a 6 log10 rotavirus reduction is required for unrestricted lettuce irrigation effective monitoring of the treatment process should provide the information for ensuring the proper functioning of the treatment process complying with the water quality regulations and spotting system malfunction or failure in time bourgeois et al 2001 haimi et al 2013 the principles of these frameworks are largely based upon the concept of haccp hazard analysis and critical control points a preventive risk management and process control framework with proven effectiveness tsitsifli and tsoukalas 2019 3 2 hazard analysis and critical control points haccp and soft sensor approach originally developed to ensure food safety in the u s space program haccp provides an approach to proactively avoiding potential hazards that occur during the production stage by emphasizing monitoring and controlling several critical control points ccps rather than doing end product inspection which can be extremely costly in time material and labor especially under large scale industrial production hulebak and schlosser 2002 after its successful application in the food industry the concept of haccp was introduced to the water treatment and supply field with early studies mainly focusing on its applicability to drinking water safety dewettinck et al 2001 havelaar 1994 later the haccp approach was discussed in the context of wastewater and sludge treatment with essential adaptations so that the target is to ensure the effectiveness of the treatment process and the reduction of pathogens to meet the required criteria dewettinck et al 2001 westrell et al 2004 to this date haccp based water safety plans have been established by agencies worldwide roeger and tavares 2018 tsoukalas and tsitsifli 2018 being included in who guidelines also gave a good push to the broader adoption of the haccp concept in principle the pivotal idea of haccp is that the status of the selected ccps should be put under real time monitoring tsoukalas and tsitsifli 2018 in the case of water reclamation virus removal efficiency can be used as a critical control point as suggested by the concept of multi barrier system and who guidelines sano et al 2016 world health organization 2006 however although molecular methods like qpcr have drastically reduced the detection time from days by culture based assay to the scale of hours haramoto et al 2018 such methods still cannot meet the level of response time required in the haccp concept the use of soft sensors an indirect approach has hence been suggested as an alternative solution if the virus removal performance can be predicted by a model in which the input variables are given by either reliable on line sensors or other relatively simple analytical methods for which frequent routine checks can be performed the virus removal performance would be essentially under real time monitoring methods based on the soft sensor approach have been well recognized and applied in industrial processes including wastewater treatment the basis of which is establishing a functional relationship between the target variable and other variables that can be readily measured han et al 2018 souza et al 2016 yusuf et al 2019 depending on the internal model structure a soft sensor could be based on a process driven mechanistic model a data driven black box model or a hybrid model consisting of both haimi et al 2013 james et al 2000 3 3 previous models of biological water treatment processes driven by the need to design operate and optimize wwtps systematically and scientifically the modeling of biological water treatment processes has long been of great interest to researchers ng and kim 2007 robles et al 2018 the majority of the proposed models are mechanistic models expressed by numerical and analytical equations to provide information about the composition and structure of the system the dynamics of each component and the interactions connecting the components henze et al 2015 an early dynamic model considered only two state variables degradation of the substrate and first order biomass formation mckinney 1962 but thanks to the growing understanding of the complicated process an increased number of state variables began to appear in later models including the now widely applied asm model family which has been under continuous development since the 1980s fenu et al 2010 henze et al 2000 naessens et al 2012 wintgens et al 2003 although asm models were originally designed for activated sludge process they have been applied to the mbr systems in recent years to describe the biomass kinetics with some adjustments made to accommodate the unique configuration of mbr bis et al 2019 mannina et al 2018 naessens et al 2012 such as the addition of the fate of soluble microbial products smp that play a critical role in membrane fouling the high mixed liquor concentration and solids retention time and gas sparging for membrane pressure relaxation since in anmbr the biological processes occur under the fundamentally different anaerobic condition the models simulating them would have to be based on the kinetics of the anaerobic digestion process the modeling of anaerobic process is considered a mature and well established field after years of research one widely accepted and discussed model is the iwa adm1 developed by batstone et al 2002 batstone et al 2015 robles et al 2018 briefly the models mentioned above share the same basic structure the mass balance equations of components included in the system either the influent composition or biomass in the reactor the mass balance equations describe the inflow outflow reaction and accumulation dynamics of substances in the reactor biomass kinetics define the substrate transformation process and physicochemical components construct the overall environment including the interaction between different phases and ionic behavior in practice simplification is an inevitable step in modeling sulaiman et al 2010 for example 10 assumptions were made in asm1 by the task group mainly about fixing environmental conditions and related coefficients by assuming a stable operation period henze et al 2000 proper simplification could reduce the complexity of the modeling task and make the model more tractable turkdogan aydinol and yetilmezsoy 2010 yet the assumptions are subject to system errors and failures and may lead to uncertainty chan and huang 2003 the decision of what simplification should be made depends on the trade off between accuracy and simplicity and the focus of the model as membrane plays a central part in mbr systems the physical process of membrane filtration should also be featured in a model dedicated to mbr systems naessens et al 2012 in their extensive review of anmbr modeling robles et al 2018 introduced several candidate models including pore blocking law models resistance in series models and critical flux models among these mechanistic models resistance in series models developed from darcy s law of filtration take into account the simultaneous and combined effects of multiple fouling mechanisms and thereby better mimic the reality than single fouling factor in mbr systems the filtration dynamics is under the influence of a variety of elements the buildup of the cake layer particle size distribution and hydrodynamics in the tank and the operational factors including the aeration intensity and cross flow velocity for virus removal modeling neither of the two models can be individually applied because biological and physicochemical factors are jointly involved an integrated model that connects the two fields would be needed although both the biomass kinetic models and membrane filtration models are well established in their own right they are fundamentally different in terms of basic principles which adds considerable difficulty to integrating the two components into an unified mathematical model some attempts have been reported in recent years such as the aembr model developed by mannina et al 2011 and the anmbr model developed by charfi et al 2017 both models have fixed issues left by previous studies and lead to impressive tmp prediction performance r2 0 9 in the anmbr model and 0 99 in the aembr model nevertheless the complexity of the integrated models raises new concerns about the applicability due to the time and computational power required for fine tuning and validation ferrero et al 2012 for the aembr model 45 parameters and 9 state variables were used to carry out the model calibration and similarly a total of 53 parameters and variables are featured in the anmbr model 3 4 process driven models aimed at virus removal for the better interpretation and more accurate prediction of the virus removal performance during wastewater treatment researchers have long been interested in establishing models based on the understanding of the underlying mechanisms and kinetics here we define a model as process driven if it is constructed upon the understanding of the physicochemical and biological processes involved kim et al 1995 developed a simplified model based on amount balance equations to describe the virus transferring dynamics in the activated sludge basin the core equation is 1 v x 0 v x l v x e v x i where v is the volume of the basin x 0 is the initial virus concentration in the basin the mixed liquor in the activated sludge basin is divided into three parts the liquid phase the peripheral and the inner region of the sludge flocs xl xe and xi in eq 1 stand for the virus concentration in these three parts respectively virus particles in the liquid phase are assumed to have a reversible adsorption balance with the floc peripheral region the floc inner region then encompasses the adsorbed virus particles into the inner part of the flocs also the impact of predation is taken into consideration because the floc inner region is assumed to contain the protozoa and metazoan that uptake the viruses that are either dispersed in the liquid phase or adsorbed to the floc each virus transfer mechanism has an independent rate constant k the values of k are assumed to be proportional to mlss concentration and the amount balance is built upon the first order equations describing the inflow and outflow of the compartments despite having established a dynamic balance of the virus behaviors in the mixed liquor as the effect of environmental factors and the virus transfer mechanisms are overly simplified this model still lacks some crucial features including being able to respond to constantly changing reactor status and influent characteristics and regarding the kinetics of adsorption of virus particles adsorption onto suspended solids xing et al 2019 used kaolinite and fiberglass as examples of colloidal particles present in the aquatic environment and evaluated the adsorption property of ms 2 phage the adsorption kinetics can be well described by the lagergren pseudo first order model 2 d q d t k q e q 3 d c d t k c c e in the equations c is the concentration of unbound ms 2 phage in the bulk liquid phase at time t and ce is the equilibrium concentration similarly q is the concentration of bound ms 2 phage at time t with qe being the equilibrium concentration k and k are the observed pseudo first order rate constants in the solid and liquid phases respectively despite having stated that the rate constants increased with increased kaolinite concentration the authors did not integrate this relationship into the final model since a clear correlation between the two parameters was not found similarly in another virus adsorption kinetic analysis conducted by grant et al 1993 the reversible adsorption behavior of virus particles onto the solid surface was also described by the pseudo first order model using the following equation 4 1 v d ε d t k f q w n f k b w n s where nf and ns indicate the number of virus particles in fluid and surface respectively and kf and kb are pseudo first order rate constants for virus adsorption and desorption ɛ is the number of virus particles transferred from the liquid phase to the solids surface q represents the maximum adsorption capability per unit weight of the solid material and w is the mass of suspended solids in the system considering the adsorption media employed in these studies were stable solid materials the use of fixed rate constants despite not being ideal makes perfect sense however in a real world context the biomass in reactor is a highly dynamic complex that is sensitive to the fluctuation of operational status and influent characteristics ng and kim 2007 robles et al 2018 its composition and bioactivity actively vary over time altering the adsorption behavior and kinetic parameters using fixed constants may not capture these dynamics and may eventually lead to insensitivity to the environmental changes likewise the first order kinetic model was also applied to the virus inactivation process under various conditions with the following equations chaudhry et al 2015a sigstam et al 2013 wu et al 2010 5 d c d t k d c 6 c c 0 exp k d t where kd c 0 and c stand for the inactivation rate coefficients h 1 the initial concentration of somatic coliphage in influent wastewater and the somatic coliphage concentration at time t pfu ml 1 respectively in the aquatic environment the virus inactivation rate is closely related to temperature since the log10 inactivation rate has been found to hold a linear relationship with temperature yates et al 1987 but it was not included in this model regarding the effect of membrane filtration on virus removal performance elhadidy et al 2013 introduced a model for uf membrane bacteriophage rejection based on a protein rejection model developed by mehta and zydney 2005 in the following equations log removal is calculated from eq 7 by s 0 the sieving coefficient s 0 is expressed as the ratio of the virus concentration in filtrate to that in the feed water as expressed in eq 8 s 0 is related to sa r the convective transport coefficient of spherical solutes r the membrane pore radius and f r a log normal probability distribution that describes the membrane pore size distribution as in eq 9 zydney et al 1994 sa r is derived using eq 10 where λ d p a r t i c l e d p o r e dparticle and dpore stand for the diameters of the particle and the pore respectively the calculation method of hydrodynamic coefficients ks and kt in eq 10 was described in bungay and brenner 1973 7 log removal l o g 10 s 0 8 s 0 c f i l t r a t e c f e e d 0 s a r f r r 4 d r 0 f r r 4 d r 9 f r r μ σ 1 r σ 2 π e ln r μ 2 2 σ 2 r 0 10 s a r 0 0 r a 1 λ 2 2 1 λ 2 k s 2 k t a r 1 r the assumptions made for the model include the absence of concentration polarization and the effect of short range intermolecular forces uniform virus concentration inside the pore and in the permeate and due to the properties of uf membrane the exclusion of virus transport routes other than convective transport on one hand this study made a valuable point in establishing a baseline prediction model for membrane virus removal but on the other hand the authors also mentioned that under different ph settings the removal of ms 2 coliphage observed in experiment contradicted the model prediction indicating that electrostatic repulsion despite not being included in the model has an important role in membrane rejection of ms 2 coliphage another simple virus filtration model developed by rathore et al 2014 assumes virus particles are colloidal particles without any specific interaction darcy s law is used to calculate membrane flux and the concentration of virus particles in the permeate is given by the following equation 11 c p k i c m p 12 k i 6 83 19 384 λ 12 518 λ 2 where cp is the permeate virus concentration ki is a coefficient related to the hindrance of pore walls given by eq 12 using λ and cmp is the virus concentration inside the pore mouth which can be calculated by the equations below 13 c m p φ c s 14 φ 1 λ 2 15 c s c b exp j v d δ where φ is the ratio of virus concentration inside the pores to the virus concentration at the pore mouth and the value is determined by the value of λ via eq 14 cs is the virus concentration at the surface of the membrane which can be calculated by eq 15 where cb is the bulk virus concentration jv is the permeate flux d is a coefficient for apparent diffusion of virus particles and δ is the thickness of the concentration polarization cp layer formed by the rejected virus particles on the membrane surface which can be given by the equation below 16 δ a t b where a and b are both constants and t is the time of filtration this equation indicates that as the filtration proceeds the cp layer would grow thicker wu et al 2010 took a deep look into the removal process of somatic coliphages in a bench scale mbr system and analyzed the contribution of each major mechanism both physical and biological processes were considered and fitted with mathematical models although it is worth pointing out that this model is only partially process driven because some relationships and coefficients are obtained via regression methods the model starts with the mechanical sieving by the pristine membrane a linear relationship between the log removal and λ was reported eq 17 shows the equation 17 log removal 5 06 d p a r t i c l e d p o r e 0 03 the decay and inactivation either spontaneous or enhanced by activated sludge of somatic coliphage fitted well with the first order kinetic model of eqs 5 and 6 as for the coefficient kd the authors found the observed kd value of sewage was higher than that of natural water and attributed it to the increased number of bacteria in sewage however the impact of water type was not packed into the model because how environmental factors quantitatively affect the decay rate coefficient remains unclear the adsorption of coliphage particles by activated sludge was fitted by the freundlich isotherm equation shown in eq 18 18 l o g 10 q l o g 10 k a 1 n l o g 10 c e in this equation ce and q are the adsorption equilibrium somatic coliphage concentration and the adsorptive capacity at certain ce respectively and n and ka are constants the authors also mentioned that the removal contributed by the fouled membrane is positively correlated with fouling degree yet a mathematical model was not proposed whereas the process driven models listed provide great reference value in many ways including evaluating and simulating individual mechanisms in the removal process their applicability to real mbr systems still needs further validation before they can be useful in practical applications the major obstacle is the model complexity when facing a process as complex as the virus removal in mbr systems if all the contributing factors in both the biological and physical processes are integrated into an exhaustive and generalized mechanistic model not only the number of active variables may outreach the scope of practical experiments design and routine monitoring haimi et al 2013 le clech et al 2006 but the coordination and balance of components involved in the complex system would also significantly increase the amount of work and computational power needed moreover the current understanding of the process is still far from adequate the effect of some parameters on certain processes such as membrane fouling has yet to be clarified and some processes may not even be able to be described by a mathematical model bis et al 2019 ferrero et al 2012 madaeni and kurdian 2011 naessens et al 2012 bagheri et al 2019 listed 28 parameters as important factors associated with membrane fouling but they also stated that available information is not enough to infer the relative importance of those parameters similarly the membrane fouling model developed by li and wang 2006 takes into account the uneven distribution of aeration turbulence and the different rates of cake layer accumulation that follows the final model consists of a large number of equations with 49 functioning parameters and coefficients but even that several assumptions such as the absence of biomass properties variability and the effect of floc size on membrane fouling were still made for simplicity the simulation result shows that although the prediction of the general trend can be obtained the fitness between the simulated result and experimental data was not satisfactory further demonstrating the degree of complexity and nonlinearity of the membrane fouling process the operating condition is generally set to be stable which not only has limited tolarence for fluctuation but also attenuates the potential effect of environmental factors that could alter the biomass behavior and the membrane physicochemical properties such as ph conductivity and chemical composition making the model insensitive to the dynamic operating condition 3 5 data driven and hybrid virus removal modeling efforts since the virus removal process has not yet been clearly described by mathematical formulas due to its complexity ferrero et al 2012 hwang et al 2009 li and wang 2006 a chance for data driven modeling approach may exist generally a model can be classified as data driven if the link between input and output variables is established via statistical methods using existing dataset circumventing the need for studying the actual mechanisms due to this feature some data driven models are referred to as black box model because the inner structure can be too obscure for further interpretation fig 2 shows the typical workflow of designing and operating a data driven soft sensor model considering the critical role of membrane filtration in the virus removal process the efficiency of virus removal may be inferred from certain process indicators reflecting the membrane permeability which can easily be put under real time monitoring existing studies have supported such an idea shang et al 2005 and wu et al 2010 both stated that when other operational conditions remain unchanged transmembrane pressure tmp a common measure of membrane fouling degree could be used as an indicator for virus rejection and the latter study reported a significant positive correlation r 0 693 p 0 006 between the somatic coliphage rejection and tmp a similar correlation between tmp and virus removal r 2 ranges from 0 63 to 0 94 was also highlighted in the study of yin et al 2016 where human adenovirus was used as the model virus but the authors acknowledged that the quantitative relationship may be system dependent and is hence challenging to establish however as pointed out by fox and stuckey 2015 it is also indispensable to find a way to incorporate other factors as well since the virus removal is not entirely dependent on tmp led by the increasing demand for online process monitoring and the inherent inadequacies of mechanistic models the approach of data driven modeling is gaining interest among researchers in various fields and researchers working on water related topics are no exception dürrenmatt and gujer 2012 han et al 2018 yin et al 2014 the main appealing aspect of data driven models is that the connection between input and output variables is derived from available dataset by designated algorithms without the need for an understanding of underlying mechanisms which could be either beyond current knowledge base or mathematically unsolvable madaeni and kurdian 2011 nadiri et al 2018 in addition data driven models allow better handling of the uncertainty and nonlinearity by comparison yusuf et al 2019 this is especially intriguing when modeling a sophisticated process such as membrane fouling which is closely related to the virus removal performance during the filtration process the data driven modeling approach has seen a handful of successful applications with regard to mbr systems with a special interest in automation and membrane fouling control bagheri et al 2019 yusuf et al 2019 in the review paper of naessens et al 2012 several data driven modeling methods already applied to mbr systems for different purposes are introduced generally two types of methods can be considered to be data driven machine learning methods and multivariate statistics machine learning techniques covered here include artificial neural network ann and adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system anfis while principal component analysis pca and partial least squares pls are discussed under the category of multivariate statistics in essence machine learning methods stand out in establishing nonlinear input output relationships without prior knowledge while the power of multivariate statistics lies in capturing the hidden relationship between inputs and output and finding the variables mostly correlated with the desired output the two types of methods are often used together to offer better performance for instance the structure of ann and anfis can be optimized by using pca to reduce the dimensionality of data bagheri et al 2019 dürrenmatt and gujer 2012 han et al 2018 wan et al 2011 the power of these methods has been demonstrated in many cases one example is the study conducted by liu and kim 2008 in which a comparison between an ann model and single blocking law in tmp prediction was performed while the ann model took only three variables as input its accuracy surpassed the single blocking law over the complete experimental period with all the progress having been made though examples directly related to applying data driven modeling techniques to virus removal in mbr systems remain scarce in literature and the potential of such techniques is yet to be fully acknowledged the closest example is the study of madaeni and kurdian 2011 in which virus removal by microfiltration membrane was predicted by a fuzzy inference system notwithstanding a decent agreement was reached among the predicted and experimental data rmse 15 81 the highly simplified filtration module design means there is still a long way to go before such a method could be employed for practical use despite the competitive performance data driven models still suffer from some restrictions in practical applications first of all by nature such models need to be fed a large dataset to properly tune the internal parameters baker et al 2018 which means when the availability of experimental data is less than ideal the model may underperform haimi et al 2013 secondly since the understanding of the underlying process mechanisms is bypassed and the models are dedicated to existing data the opaqueness of black box models make them less easy to interpret when the interaction between process variables needs to be analyzed dürrenmatt and gujer 2012 thürlimann et al 2018 these drawbacks have raised the discussion among researchers about the potential of hybrid methods essentially the objective is the convergence of mechanistic understanding of the process being modeled and the overwhelming superiority of data driven models in learning from data and handling nonlinearity and uncertainty conceptually in a properly built hybrid model the mechanistic part and statistical part should complement each other which means the resultant model can diminish the demand for training data and offer better extrapolation potential despite there has not been a study on applying hybrid model to virus removal in mbr systems some efforts have been made for related topics such as membrane permeability prediction hwang et al 2009 developed a hybrid model for membrane filtration performance forecasting the model consists of a filtration model and an ann model two variables obtained from the physical model are fed into the ann model as input variables while the output is tmp predicted by 6 inputs in total another example of hybrid tmp prediction model can be found in the study of chew et al 2017 but in this model the order is reversed the ann model was used to predict the specific cake resistance α a coefficient that both fluctuates with the characteristics of feed water and requires extensive works to determine via experimental method the predicted value of α is then used in a first principle model which gives tmp as output by replacing the actual experiment with ann model prediction the model enabled rapid estimation and provided good agreement between experimental and predicted results 3 6 preferred features of future model from the viewpoint of maximizing the model capability and robustness several merits would be of particular interest when conceiving and designing a pioneering model firstly the model should be equipped with the ability to accurately grasp and approximate the intricate interactions between a large set of input and output parameters while being tolerant to data noise and fluctuation in addition it should have the capability to learn from the available data and adjust itself accordingly to go beyond the scope of the current understanding of the virus removal process thirdly as suggested by the concept of haccp risk factors should be monitored in real time and time consuming variable measurements should be avoided therefore if possible the model should take only easy to measure parameters or online sensor signals as inputs to guarantee a short response time which serves as the cornerstone for real time risk process control last but not least the model should be flexible enough to allow easily extrapolation to the various conditions the reactor may encounter due to the wide range of reactor configurations and wastewater characteristics the coefficients obtained from one reactor and one set of operational conditions might result in significant deviation when applied to others so the ability to adapt to new configurations and operational conditions would be critical for model usability 4 conclusion to ensure the safe use of the reclaimed water from mbr systems one crucial mission is to analyze and control the health risks of such systems particularly the viral infection and disease risks due to the high survivability and infectivity of enteric viruses in addition to virus removal experiments as end product inspection a mathematical prediction model based on the concept of soft sensor needs to be developed for advanced risk management schemes however the high degree of complexity nonlinearity and uncertainty of the mbr based wastewater treatment process makes establishing such a model an arduous task to the best of our knowledge there is no virus removal performance prediction model currently in existence that can fulfill all the requirements for a practical and robust soft sensor model future studies on the understanding and integration of physical and biological virus removal mechanisms and their joint impact on the final performance would be of great importance also the application of burgeoning data driven models and hybrid modeling approaches has been proven to be a promising direction in the water reclamation

sensor approach process driven modeling data driven modeling 1 introduction access to sufficient and safe water resources plays a central role in the prosperity and development of human society as the world population and economy continuously grow it is estimated that the global demand for water will increase by nearly one third by 2050 un water 2019 keeping up with this rapid growth in demand cost effectively and sustainably is considered one of the biggest challenges faced by water authorities around the globe converting wastewater into water that can be reused for certain purposes often referred to as water reclamation and reuse is a well established approach to mitigating the tension between limited resources and ever growing demand sun et al 2016 wu 2019 this approach also provides a dependable and stable water supply under unfavorable weather conditions angelakis et al 2018 the act of sewage treatment and reuse can be traced back to the very early stages of human history due to its environmental and ecological significance an early practice of prehistoric civilizations is directly applying untreated domestic wastewater to irrigation angelakis and snyder 2015 jaramillo and restrepo 2017 since then the development of related technologies and the establishment of regulations have continued unabated as new advancements in the treatment process and materials emerge the cost efficiency treatment capability and effluent quality of modern wastewater treatment plants wwtps have all been steadily increasing in recent decades diemer 2007 estimated that the usage of recycled wastewater in the u s will grow by 15 per year in terms of volume despite the long history of water reclamation angelakis and snyder 2015 only with the rapid development of modern science in recent centuries particularly in epidemiology and microbiology have the latent health risks and the importance of proper sanitation strategy in this practice been discussed and investigated duong and saphores 2015 jaramillo and restrepo 2017 leading to the increasing concern from the public and authorities smith et al 2018 vuppaladadiyam et al 2019 as a result beginning in the mid nineteenth century the construction of modern sewage systems aimed at the effective separation and proper treatment of wastewater to protect the public from being infected by waterborne pathogens and provide efficient waste disposal lofrano and brown 2010 owing to the influence of human activity both municipal and industrial wastewater may contain a variety of pathogenic microbes and other substances including metals pharmaceuticals and personal care products that could directly harm human health or lead to acute and chronic illness if not reduced to safe levels via treatment and distribution processes chen et al 2013a 2013b dodgen and zheng 2016 oteng peprah et al 2018 qadir et al 2013 2010 in particular waterborne enteric viruses present in reclaimed wastewater with fecal oral transmission routes are considered a primary health concern globally since they can cause several acute illnesses such as gastroenteritis and hepatitis gibson 2014 shakir et al 2017 in municipal wastewater the primary origin of enteric viruses is the shedding from infected individuals the shedding rate of norovirus particles has been demonstrated to reach up to 1010 per gram of feces teunis et al 2015 also compared to other pathogens such as protozoa and bacteria waterborne enteric viruses are more resistant to environmental factors and treatment processes due to their unique physical and biological characteristics despite not being able to reproduce in the environment without a host fox and stuckey 2015 moazeni et al 2017 sano et al 2016 prado et al 2019 investigated the enteric virus removal of three conventional activated sludge process wastewater treatment plants wwtps the recorded log reduction value lrv ranged from 0 37 to 2 36 without tertiary treatment methods which leads to a high occurrence of human enteric viruses in receiving water montazeri et al 2015 qiu et al 2015 furthermore the low infectious dose of enteric viruses means that a small amount of intake can lead to infection prevost et al 2016 qiu et al 2015 several potential human exposure pathways have been proposed consumption of shellfish grown in the contaminated aquatic environment and food crops irrigated by wastewater or fertilized by sludge the ingestion of contaminated drinking water and recreational water and farmworker exposure including aerosol inhalation and direct intake of reclaimed irrigation water dickin et al 2016 ito et al 2017 a dilemma is therefore faced by the stakeholders including academicians municipal authorities and environmental agencies there is an urgent need to utilize and manage water resources more efficiently and sustainably via water reclamation however the progress in meeting this need has been hindered by various factors including the inefficient virus removal of conventional wwtps the inability to effectively control the treatment and distribution process the lack of understanding of the underlying health risks and the rising concerns about public health gibson 2014 okoh et al 2010 historically the safety of reclaimed water had been managed by setting restrictions on its use based on the intensity of human exposure in certain activities and the quality levels of treated wastewater commonly monitored parameters include biological oxygen demand bod total suspended solids tss and bacterial indicators jeong et al 2016 us environmental protection agency 2012 however in terms of the virological quality of water these conventionally monitored chemical and bacterial parameters fail as reliable indicators of the prevalence of enteric viruses das et al 2020 hot et al 2003 jurzik et al 2010 pang et al 2019 thus direct detection of virus is the preferred solution molecular techniques notably quantitative polymerase chain reaction qpcr provide an alternative solution for detection and quantification of the virus content in water samples and are gaining popularity in recent years largely due to not only the high sensitivity specificity and shortened detection time typically within hours compared to the culture based methods but also the capability of detecting viruses that are currently non culturable in vitro coudray meunier et al 2015 haramoto et al 2018 miura et al 2015 prevost et al 2016 sano et al 2016 however the requirements for laboratory apparatus and trained personnel make a routinely performed detection infeasible for many wwtps randazzo et al 2019 especially those in the regions with limited resources where the implementation of sanitation management could be impeded also molecular detection methods often suffer from not being able to differentiate infectious virus particles from non infectious ones making such methods insensitive to the potential inactivation effect on virus particles brought about by treatment processes hassard et al 2017 randazzo et al 2019 the uncertainty surrounding the virological quality of reclaimed water has resulted in considerable hinderance to certain wastewater reuse practices one of the most strictly regulated use is food crop irrigation in the u s regulations regarding the use of reclaimed water on food crops vary among different states some states prohibit this act indiscriminately whereas others allow reclaimed water to be used only if some requirements are met for instance the states of florida nevada and virginia require that the reclaimed water must not directly contact the edible parts of the crop unless the crop will be peeled or thermally processed before being consumed us environmental protection agency 2012 in california although the practice of spraying reclaimed water onto edible parts of salad crops and strawberries has been successfully performed for over 40 years with no reports of human illness as a result parsons et al 2010 the title 22 regulations specify that the highest quality standards apply to the reclaimed water that would contact the edible parts of the crop cdph 2016 introducing advanced treatment methods to further reduce the pathogen content in effluent is an indispensable step in promoting the use of reclaimed water historically due to the inefficient virus removal of conventional wwtps tertiary treatments have commonly been employed for disinfection usually in the form of the addition of chemical disinfectants such as chlorine and ozone or the use of uv mbonimpa et al 2018 although these methods are capable of effectively bringing down pathogen concentration in the effluent and preventing the transmission of waterborne diseases they are subject to certain derivative issues e g the generation of disinfection by products dbps that possess genotoxicity and carcinogenicity li and mitch 2018 richardson et al 2007 high operating costs collivignarelli et al 2018 and the concern over the potential increase in antibiotic resistance li et al 2016 rizzo et al 2013 in the last fifty years powered by the rapid development of materials science and engineering the use of membrane in the realm of water treatment has become increasingly popular with one successful example being the membrane bioreactor mbr which comes in two forms aerobic membrane bioreactor aembr and anaerobic membrane bioreactor anmbr wang et al 2017 firstly commercialized in the early 1970s the application of mbr technology in municipal and industrial wastewater treatment has rapidly expanded with an average global market growth of over 10 since the turn of the millennium santos et al 2011 as the result of more stringent environmental regulations as well as the various advantages mbr provides compared to conventional treatment processes including high effluent quality reduced environmental footprint and nutrient recovery in the case of anmbr readers interested in more information on the mbr technology are referred to the extensive reviews previously published cecconet et al 2019 krzeminski et al 2017 lei et al 2018 lin et al 2013 ma et al 2018 xiao et al 2019 the core feature that distinguishes mbr from conventional biological wastewater treatment processes is the utilization of a membrane that enables highly efficient sludge separation which in the perspective of water safety can also serve as a barrier against waterborne pathogens francy et al 2012 harb and hong 2017 in addition to size exclusion which effectively rejects pathogens larger than the membrane pore size notably pathogenic bacteria and protozoa and aggregated virus particles baek and pagilla 2012 cecconet et al 2019 gentile et al 2018 judd 2016 the presence of biosolids also enables effective virus removal from the standpoint of water resource management the high effluent quality and pathogen removal capability of mbr systems can open up new possibilities by expanding the scale of existing reclaimed wastewater use peña et al 2019 better pathogen removal efficiency means the disinfectant dose required to meet the microbiological quality standard can be reduced leading to lower health and ecosystem concerns resulted from disinfection by products baek and pagilla 2012 purnell et al 2016 santasmasas et al 2013 together with the advantage of stable operation harb and hong 2017 xiao et al 2019 once the mbr systems are proven to be capable of continuously delivering decent virus removal performance the effluent can be used for purposes currently restricted for reclaimed water wu and kim 2020 the usability would surpass that of most current wastewater reclamation systems while being economically viable significantly relieving the stress on the natural freshwater supply chen et al 2013a de luca et al 2013 our current work focuses on the efforts dedicated to establishing a mathematical model for the virus removal process in mbr systems as the real time monitoring of virus removal performance via the soft sensor approach is of great interest as a critical part of advanced water safety management scheme firstly studies on virus removal performance of mbr systems and the contributing mechanisms are discussed to help readers get a grasp on the microbiological safety factor of mbr technology as well as to provide information on which factors contribute more significantly and thus should be looked for during model development secondly we review the historical and recent attempts to develop a mathematical model that connects easy to measure variables with virus removal efficiency via either conventional process driven approach based on the physicochemical and biological relationship and equations or novel data driven modeling techniques 2 membrane bioreactors at virus removal performance and mechanisms in recent years a number of studies have focused on the overall performance and contributing factors of the virus removal in mbr systems table 1 lists some recent studies that have covered a wide range of reactor scales configurations and object viruses generally speaking the mechanisms proposed based on experimental results whether in aembr or anmbr systems can be classified into three major categories the rejection and adsorption effect of the backwashed membrane the adsorption of virus particles to biomass and the decay and inactivation occurred in the mixed liquor phase fig 1 2 1 mechanisms involved in mbr virus removal 2 1 1 the role of membrane three mechanisms are directly related to virus reduction by the membrane alone size exclusion adsorption and electrostatic repulsion elhadidy et al 2013 gentile et al 2018 the principle behind size exclusion is rather intuitive particles larger than the membrane pores get either rejected by the membrane or stuck in the pore channel the larger the pores are the easier the virus particles can pass through the membrane the removal efficiency can therefore be significantly enhanced by choosing the membrane with a pore size close or smaller to the size of target virus lv et al 2006 reported that under the same operating condition using t4 phage average size 107 9 12 9 nm as the target a 0 22 μm membrane provided only 1 7 log removal whereas a 0 1 μm membrane reached a much higher removal of 5 8 logs when the diameter of the pathogen particles is at the same level as the nominal membrane pore size or less other mechanisms such as mechanical sieving and the aggregation of virus particles start to take effect and facilitate this process as reported by da silva et al 2011 and samandoulgou et al 2015 the aggregation of norovirus gi and gii particles is affected by ph and ionic strength and the size of aggregates may greatly exceed the membrane pore size under certain circumstances chaudhry et al 2015b reported a high removal rate by backwashed membrane with a 0 04 μm nominal pore size which is in line with the diameter of many enteric viruses however it is worth mentioning that anmbr plants tend to use membranes with a pore size ranging from 0 1 to 0 4 μm to increase the flux and reduce the operation cost brought by membrane fouling hai et al 2014 and under this circumstance the membrane itself may only provide limited removal capability when dealing with viruses small in size the adsorption of virus particles onto the membrane surface is mainly governed by hydrophobic and electrostatic effects while non specific interactions are of secondary importance gentile et al 2018 matsushita et al 2013 miura et al 2015 tufenkji 2007 madaeni 1997 studied the removal of poliovirus by a 0 2 μm mf membrane and concluded that the physicochemical characteristics of the virus particle and membrane material and the ratio of the pore diameter to virus particle diameter are the important influencing factors in the adsorption of viruses into the membrane the preferable condition for adsorption is when the two components have opposite charges or only a small amount of charges and generally low ph level can facilitate this process kosiol et al 2019 sidhu et al 2015 tanneru and chellam 2012 electrostatic repulsion works in a way different from membrane adsorption when the membrane material and virus particles share the same type of charge electrostatic repulsion would push the virus particles away from the membrane surface contributing to virus retention elhadidy et al 2013 gentile et al 2018 also in contrast to membrane adsorption the effect of electrostatic repulsion is more pronounced under increased ph level jeong et al 2017 van voorthuizen et al 2001 the other vital contributing factor hydrophobic effect works by minimizing the area of contact between water molecules and virus particles and between water and membrane surface thus increasing the potential of viruses to adsorb onto the membrane armanious et al 2016 the magnitude of this effect leans on a variety of factors including ionic strength virus surface characteristics and membrane material hai et al 2014 matsushita et al 2013 van voorthuizen et al 2001 xagoraraki et al 2014 it is also worth pointing out that the size of pores on the membrane is not consistent during the production and operation there might be abnormal pores on the membrane and these pores may lead to unexpected virus passage or decreased filtration performance thus the membrane pore distribution is also a factor to be considered in membrane size exclusion fane et al 2015 hirani et al 2010 the log normal distribution is widely applied to describe the membrane pore distribution giglia et al 2015 zydney et al 1994 based on that duek et al 2012 investigated the actual pore size distribution on several uf membranes and reported that it does have a significant effect on the virus rejection property in the study virus retention is more accurately predicted by the absolute pore size d 100 than by d 50 and d 90 indicating that abnormally large pores contribute more to virus passage through uf membrane a similar result was reported by kosiol et al 2017 who found that d 99 values of a number of membranes showed a correlation with lrvs of bacteriophage 2 1 2 effect of biomass adsorption as the biomass in the reactor grows both the suspended solids and the gel cake layer attached to the membrane surface develop it has been well acknowledged that the adsorption of virus particles to the biomass is a critical contributor to the virus removal in a number of ways chaudhry et al 2015a fox and stuckey 2015 huang et al 2012 lu et al 2013 madaeni et al 1995 wu et al 2010 yin et al 2016 zheng and liu 2006 firstly the adsorption of phage or enteric virus particles to the mixed liquor suspended solids mlss which consist of bacteria and organic compounds that are larger than the membrane pores makes their passage harder for instance shang et al 2005 reported a 0 8 log ms 2 phage removal by adsorption to the suspended biomass alone in a bench scale aembr and in the study of miura et al 2018 an 1 5 log removal of norovirus gi was achieved after 60 min of mixing with the mlss in a similar manner hirani et al 2010 recorded a higher removal rate of indigenous ms 2 coliphage compared to seeded ms 2 coliphage in several aembr systems and attributed it to the higher degree of particle association of indigenous coliphage mlss concentration and virus characteristics have been reported to be the main influencing factors wu et al 2010 found that the fraction of adsorbed somatic coliphage went up from 65 to 92 as mlss concentration increased from 1 6 g l to 9 6 g l in their aembr in the study of chaudhry et al 2015a three bacteriophages ms 2 phix174 and fr were fed into a bench scale aembr and a significant difference in their attachment to the mixed liquor biomass was observed while only 0 2 log10 removal can be attributed to suspended biomass attachment for ms 2 phix174 and fr showed much higher removal 1 2 and 3 0 log10 since the three bacteriophages have similar zeta potentials the difference in surface composition of the phages was assumed to be the cause secondly the biofilm attached to the membrane surface also plays a pivotal role in the removal process by adsorbing onto the inside of membrane pores or block the pores the decreased effective pore size and the reduced number of available pores raise the membrane resistance thereby making the passage of virus particles more difficult noshadi et al 2013 in addition the accumulation of gel and cake layers on the membrane surface provides extra adsorption spots as these layers are made up of soluble microbial products and extracellular polymeric substances that can potentially adsorb and trap virus particles sutherland et al 2004 also the presence of proteins in the mixed liquor inhibits the adsorption of the viruses on the membrane due to the competition between proteins and virus particles for adsorption sites madaeni 1997 in mbr systems where proteins make up a significant proportion of the extracellular polymeric substances epss and soluble microbial products smps sheng et al 2010 the inhibition caused by proteins can be a crucial factor furthermore the high concentration of suspended biomass may lead to a high excretion rate of epss and smps however the interaction between them and viruses has not been explained clearly yet miura et al 2015 ueda and horan 2000 investigated the effect of biofilm growth on virus removal performance and they found that the removal efficiency improved notably as the biofilm attached to the membrane surface grew and increased the filtration resistance a 2 1 log removal was achieved by 21 day biofilm whereas 9 hr biofilm achieved only a 0 3 log removal it is worth mentioning that membrane fouling despite the contribution to virus rejection is considered detrimental by the reactor operators because it leads to a decline in permeate flux and an alteration of the reactor hydrological characteristics bagheri et al 2019 nguyen et al 2012 eventually resulting in decreased throughput and higher operating costs xiao et al 2019 commonly employed fouling control strategies include membrane backwash gas sparging and chemical cleaning iorhemen et al 2016 melin et al 2006 also in recent years the addition of activated carbon in the reactor has received a considerable amount of attention for being both effective and financially economical yang et al 2019 fox and stuckey 2015 investigated the effect of gas sparging rate on phage removal in anmbr and found that ms 2 rejection increased with the elevated sparging intensity after a 10 day operation at a low sparging rate since high gas scouring relieves fouling the result may seem counterintuitive the authors suggested that it can be attributed to the reduced concentration polarization at the membrane surface resulted from intense gas sparging similar findings have been reported by cui et al 2003 and madaeni et al 1995 who concluded that increasing stirring and gas sparging can have a negative impact on the membrane permeability for particles like protein and virus simply put if the virus particles are seen as a solute a layer of high concentration will gradually build up in the vicinity of membrane surface during the filtration process resulting in an increased concentration of virus particles in the effluent when the gas sparging or stirring rate is increased this layer can get disrupted leading to a lower concentration of virus particles in the effluent this too suggests that the virus removal process is highly complicated with multiple mechanisms working simultaneously but nevertheless the role of biofilm has been well established casabuena et al 2019 chaudhry et al 2015a shirasaki et al 2008 finding a delicate balance between virus particle rejection performance and membrane permeability will be a vital task for reactor operators and requires a more comprehensive interpretation of the dynamics in the reactor huang et al 2012 2 1 3 decay and inactivation the major mechanisms responsible for the effect of mixed liquor on virus decay and inactivation are likely to be the predation by other microorganisms and enzymatic breakdown chaudhry et al 2015a hao et al 2010 for aembr wu et al 2010 found that the somatic coliphage decay was significantly accelerated in the presence of activated sludge compared to the spontaneous decay in the influent wastewater which took about 10 days to achieve 0 72 log10 removal likewise fox and stuckey 2015 reported that phage concentration in the anmbr mixed liquor phase decreased by about 2 log10 over the experiment period of two weeks which is faster than the expected washout rate under the same hydraulic condition suggesting that the anaerobic condition inside the reactor may facilitate the process of virus inactivation although conceptually all virus particles rejected by membrane and attached biofilm are subject to biodegradation considering the dominating contribution of membrane biofilm rejection and the typical hydraulic retention time hrt of several hours to days in mbr systems the effect of biodegradation on effluent virus concentration may not be so pronounced 2 2 perspectives on mbr virus removal studies compared to the number of studies dedicated to aembr virus removal performance in the case of anmbr as a relatively new but thriving technology only a few reports are currently available covering a limited range of configurations and operating conditions nevertheless the existing studies have revealed that anmbr and aembr have many things in common when it comes to virus removal including the overall efficiency and the responsible mechanisms although some differences are likely to exist due to their respective kinetics the good thing is with the potential of anmbr being further recognized more anmbr plants are being built or planned in various configurations for research and development needs and we can expect more studies on the topic of virus removal capability to be conducted in the near future because the safety aspects associated with this technology need to be thoroughly discussed and will play a central role in ameliorating public perception in the future still some vital information can be extracted from these past studies the reported virus removal efficiencies are highly system dependent and it makes parallel comparison very difficult if not impossible at all this is resulted from the diversity in reactor configurations e g plant scale membrane material and pore size hydraulic and solids retention time and in the sources and characteristics of the wastewater hai et al 2014 sano et al 2016 sometimes conclusions from different studies may even conflict for instance chaudhry et al 2015b reported that a 3 1 log10 reduction of norovirus gii was achieved solely by the backwashed membrane making it the greatest contributor in the total removal whereas fox and stuckey 2015 and ueda and horan 2000 both pointed out that the membrane provided only relatively poor phage rejection in their studies although the discrepancy likely comes from the different pore sizes used 0 04 μm vs 0 4 μm since the relative size of particles compared to membrane pores matters greatly in size exclusion another example is the study conducted by farahbakhsh and smith 2004 in which the adsorption onto the membrane surface or in membrane pores governed the coliphage removal when the membrane was pristine but as the membrane gradually got fouled the governing factor shifted to the interception by the cake layer this discrepancy can also be observed when the relative contribution of each mechanism is calculated and sorted but the order varies between studies lu et al 2013 shang et al 2005 all these indicate that the current understanding of the intricate process is still far from sufficient and further research will need to view from a wider angle as multiple highly coupled components are involved with a wide selection of influencing factors langlet et al 2009 miura et al 2018 xiao et al 2019 especially during the development of biofilm from previous studies we conclude that the primary contribution comes from the adsorption to suspended biomass and membrane retention either by the membrane itself or the biofilm attached since the physical properties of membrane stay stable while the biomass growth is a highly active process we speculate that to be more suited for the task the model should keep a close eye on the biological kinetics and how it proceeds to impact the physical processes 3 efforts on modeling virus removal in mbr 3 1 principles of regulatory frameworks to better instruct and optimize the planning and operation of the water sanitation and supply system for the mitigation of embedded health risks a systematic and holistic view of the whole picture is critical qadir et al 2010 world health organization 2017 this requirement has given birth to regulatory frameworks for risk evaluation and solution formation if adopted and conducted properly a scientific and detailed framework can help system planners efficiently analyze and evaluate the status quo tease out the problems and set appropriate goals design a thorough and reasonable methodology for forming a solution and avoid omitting any critical element roeger and tavares 2018 three water related guidelines formed by the world health organization water safety plans wsp sanitation safety planning ssp and safe use of wastewater excreta and greywater davison et al 2005 world health organization 2015 2006 provide in depth notions on the topic of improving water safety and promoting water reuse in a scientific manner the water safety plans is dedicated to managing drinking water quality and protecting public health from the risks in the drinking water supply the safe use of wastewater excreta and greywater and the sanitation safety planning focus on maximizing the public health benefits of wastewater reuse and sanitation interventions notwithstanding the different specific application scenarios they all provide valuable insight into the overall workflow aspects to consider and critical steps to follow as preventive managing approaches these guidelines highlight the importance of early risk identification and effective operational monitoring rather than end product inspection to ensure the cost efficiency of the system and a short response time critical for time sensitive fields like public health management the operational monitoring involves setting operational limits within which the predetermined health target can be achieved and a proper monitoring strategy that ensures the operation of the system falls within the acceptable limits as an example according to the safe use of wastewater excreta and greywater a 6 log10 rotavirus reduction is required for unrestricted lettuce irrigation effective monitoring of the treatment process should provide the information for ensuring the proper functioning of the treatment process complying with the water quality regulations and spotting system malfunction or failure in time bourgeois et al 2001 haimi et al 2013 the principles of these frameworks are largely based upon the concept of haccp hazard analysis and critical control points a preventive risk management and process control framework with proven effectiveness tsitsifli and tsoukalas 2019 3 2 hazard analysis and critical control points haccp and soft sensor approach originally developed to ensure food safety in the u s space program haccp provides an approach to proactively avoiding potential hazards that occur during the production stage by emphasizing monitoring and controlling several critical control points ccps rather than doing end product inspection which can be extremely costly in time material and labor especially under large scale industrial production hulebak and schlosser 2002 after its successful application in the food industry the concept of haccp was introduced to the water treatment and supply field with early studies mainly focusing on its applicability to drinking water safety dewettinck et al 2001 havelaar 1994 later the haccp approach was discussed in the context of wastewater and sludge treatment with essential adaptations so that the target is to ensure the effectiveness of the treatment process and the reduction of pathogens to meet the required criteria dewettinck et al 2001 westrell et al 2004 to this date haccp based water safety plans have been established by agencies worldwide roeger and tavares 2018 tsoukalas and tsitsifli 2018 being included in who guidelines also gave a good push to the broader adoption of the haccp concept in principle the pivotal idea of haccp is that the status of the selected ccps should be put under real time monitoring tsoukalas and tsitsifli 2018 in the case of water reclamation virus removal efficiency can be used as a critical control point as suggested by the concept of multi barrier system and who guidelines sano et al 2016 world health organization 2006 however although molecular methods like qpcr have drastically reduced the detection time from days by culture based assay to the scale of hours haramoto et al 2018 such methods still cannot meet the level of response time required in the haccp concept the use of soft sensors an indirect approach has hence been suggested as an alternative solution if the virus removal performance can be predicted by a model in which the input variables are given by either reliable on line sensors or other relatively simple analytical methods for which frequent routine checks can be performed the virus removal performance would be essentially under real time monitoring methods based on the soft sensor approach have been well recognized and applied in industrial processes including wastewater treatment the basis of which is establishing a functional relationship between the target variable and other variables that can be readily measured han et al 2018 souza et al 2016 yusuf et al 2019 depending on the internal model structure a soft sensor could be based on a process driven mechanistic model a data driven black box model or a hybrid model consisting of both haimi et al 2013 james et al 2000 3 3 previous models of biological water treatment processes driven by the need to design operate and optimize wwtps systematically and scientifically the modeling of biological water treatment processes has long been of great interest to researchers ng and kim 2007 robles et al 2018 the majority of the proposed models are mechanistic models expressed by numerical and analytical equations to provide information about the composition and structure of the system the dynamics of each component and the interactions connecting the components henze et al 2015 an early dynamic model considered only two state variables degradation of the substrate and first order biomass formation mckinney 1962 but thanks to the growing understanding of the complicated process an increased number of state variables began to appear in later models including the now widely applied asm model family which has been under continuous development since the 1980s fenu et al 2010 henze et al 2000 naessens et al 2012 wintgens et al 2003 although asm models were originally designed for activated sludge process they have been applied to the mbr systems in recent years to describe the biomass kinetics with some adjustments made to accommodate the unique configuration of mbr bis et al 2019 mannina et al 2018 naessens et al 2012 such as the addition of the fate of soluble microbial products smp that play a critical role in membrane fouling the high mixed liquor concentration and solids retention time and gas sparging for membrane pressure relaxation since in anmbr the biological processes occur under the fundamentally different anaerobic condition the models simulating them would have to be based on the kinetics of the anaerobic digestion process the modeling of anaerobic process is considered a mature and well established field after years of research one widely accepted and discussed model is the iwa adm1 developed by batstone et al 2002 batstone et al 2015 robles et al 2018 briefly the models mentioned above share the same basic structure the mass balance equations of components included in the system either the influent composition or biomass in the reactor the mass balance equations describe the inflow outflow reaction and accumulation dynamics of substances in the reactor biomass kinetics define the substrate transformation process and physicochemical components construct the overall environment including the interaction between different phases and ionic behavior in practice simplification is an inevitable step in modeling sulaiman et al 2010 for example 10 assumptions were made in asm1 by the task group mainly about fixing environmental conditions and related coefficients by assuming a stable operation period henze et al 2000 proper simplification could reduce the complexity of the modeling task and make the model more tractable turkdogan aydinol and yetilmezsoy 2010 yet the assumptions are subject to system errors and failures and may lead to uncertainty chan and huang 2003 the decision of what simplification should be made depends on the trade off between accuracy and simplicity and the focus of the model as membrane plays a central part in mbr systems the physical process of membrane filtration should also be featured in a model dedicated to mbr systems naessens et al 2012 in their extensive review of anmbr modeling robles et al 2018 introduced several candidate models including pore blocking law models resistance in series models and critical flux models among these mechanistic models resistance in series models developed from darcy s law of filtration take into account the simultaneous and combined effects of multiple fouling mechanisms and thereby better mimic the reality than single fouling factor in mbr systems the filtration dynamics is under the influence of a variety of elements the buildup of the cake layer particle size distribution and hydrodynamics in the tank and the operational factors including the aeration intensity and cross flow velocity for virus removal modeling neither of the two models can be individually applied because biological and physicochemical factors are jointly involved an integrated model that connects the two fields would be needed although both the biomass kinetic models and membrane filtration models are well established in their own right they are fundamentally different in terms of basic principles which adds considerable difficulty to integrating the two components into an unified mathematical model some attempts have been reported in recent years such as the aembr model developed by mannina et al 2011 and the anmbr model developed by charfi et al 2017 both models have fixed issues left by previous studies and lead to impressive tmp prediction performance r2 0 9 in the anmbr model and 0 99 in the aembr model nevertheless the complexity of the integrated models raises new concerns about the applicability due to the time and computational power required for fine tuning and validation ferrero et al 2012 for the aembr model 45 parameters and 9 state variables were used to carry out the model calibration and similarly a total of 53 parameters and variables are featured in the anmbr model 3 4 process driven models aimed at virus removal for the better interpretation and more accurate prediction of the virus removal performance during wastewater treatment researchers have long been interested in establishing models based on the understanding of the underlying mechanisms and kinetics here we define a model as process driven if it is constructed upon the understanding of the physicochemical and biological processes involved kim et al 1995 developed a simplified model based on amount balance equations to describe the virus transferring dynamics in the activated sludge basin the core equation is 1 v x 0 v x l v x e v x i where v is the volume of the basin x 0 is the initial virus concentration in the basin the mixed liquor in the activated sludge basin is divided into three parts the liquid phase the peripheral and the inner region of the sludge flocs xl xe and xi in eq 1 stand for the virus concentration in these three parts respectively virus particles in the liquid phase are assumed to have a reversible adsorption balance with the floc peripheral region the floc inner region then encompasses the adsorbed virus particles into the inner part of the flocs also the impact of predation is taken into consideration because the floc inner region is assumed to contain the protozoa and metazoan that uptake the viruses that are either dispersed in the liquid phase or adsorbed to the floc each virus transfer mechanism has an independent rate constant k the values of k are assumed to be proportional to mlss concentration and the amount balance is built upon the first order equations describing the inflow and outflow of the compartments despite having established a dynamic balance of the virus behaviors in the mixed liquor as the effect of environmental factors and the virus transfer mechanisms are overly simplified this model still lacks some crucial features including being able to respond to constantly changing reactor status and influent characteristics and regarding the kinetics of adsorption of virus particles adsorption onto suspended solids xing et al 2019 used kaolinite and fiberglass as examples of colloidal particles present in the aquatic environment and evaluated the adsorption property of ms 2 phage the adsorption kinetics can be well described by the lagergren pseudo first order model 2 d q d t k q e q 3 d c d t k c c e in the equations c is the concentration of unbound ms 2 phage in the bulk liquid phase at time t and ce is the equilibrium concentration similarly q is the concentration of bound ms 2 phage at time t with qe being the equilibrium concentration k and k are the observed pseudo first order rate constants in the solid and liquid phases respectively despite having stated that the rate constants increased with increased kaolinite concentration the authors did not integrate this relationship into the final model since a clear correlation between the two parameters was not found similarly in another virus adsorption kinetic analysis conducted by grant et al 1993 the reversible adsorption behavior of virus particles onto the solid surface was also described by the pseudo first order model using the following equation 4 1 v d ε d t k f q w n f k b w n s where nf and ns indicate the number of virus particles in fluid and surface respectively and kf and kb are pseudo first order rate constants for virus adsorption and desorption ɛ is the number of virus particles transferred from the liquid phase to the solids surface q represents the maximum adsorption capability per unit weight of the solid material and w is the mass of suspended solids in the system considering the adsorption media employed in these studies were stable solid materials the use of fixed rate constants despite not being ideal makes perfect sense however in a real world context the biomass in reactor is a highly dynamic complex that is sensitive to the fluctuation of operational status and influent characteristics ng and kim 2007 robles et al 2018 its composition and bioactivity actively vary over time altering the adsorption behavior and kinetic parameters using fixed constants may not capture these dynamics and may eventually lead to insensitivity to the environmental changes likewise the first order kinetic model was also applied to the virus inactivation process under various conditions with the following equations chaudhry et al 2015a sigstam et al 2013 wu et al 2010 5 d c d t k d c 6 c c 0 exp k d t where kd c 0 and c stand for the inactivation rate coefficients h 1 the initial concentration of somatic coliphage in influent wastewater and the somatic coliphage concentration at time t pfu ml 1 respectively in the aquatic environment the virus inactivation rate is closely related to temperature since the log10 inactivation rate has been found to hold a linear relationship with temperature yates et al 1987 but it was not included in this model regarding the effect of membrane filtration on virus removal performance elhadidy et al 2013 introduced a model for uf membrane bacteriophage rejection based on a protein rejection model developed by mehta and zydney 2005 in the following equations log removal is calculated from eq 7 by s 0 the sieving coefficient s 0 is expressed as the ratio of the virus concentration in filtrate to that in the feed water as expressed in eq 8 s 0 is related to sa r the convective transport coefficient of spherical solutes r the membrane pore radius and f r a log normal probability distribution that describes the membrane pore size distribution as in eq 9 zydney et al 1994 sa r is derived using eq 10 where λ d p a r t i c l e d p o r e dparticle and dpore stand for the diameters of the particle and the pore respectively the calculation method of hydrodynamic coefficients ks and kt in eq 10 was described in bungay and brenner 1973 7 log removal l o g 10 s 0 8 s 0 c f i l t r a t e c f e e d 0 s a r f r r 4 d r 0 f r r 4 d r 9 f r r μ σ 1 r σ 2 π e ln r μ 2 2 σ 2 r 0 10 s a r 0 0 r a 1 λ 2 2 1 λ 2 k s 2 k t a r 1 r the assumptions made for the model include the absence of concentration polarization and the effect of short range intermolecular forces uniform virus concentration inside the pore and in the permeate and due to the properties of uf membrane the exclusion of virus transport routes other than convective transport on one hand this study made a valuable point in establishing a baseline prediction model for membrane virus removal but on the other hand the authors also mentioned that under different ph settings the removal of ms 2 coliphage observed in experiment contradicted the model prediction indicating that electrostatic repulsion despite not being included in the model has an important role in membrane rejection of ms 2 coliphage another simple virus filtration model developed by rathore et al 2014 assumes virus particles are colloidal particles without any specific interaction darcy s law is used to calculate membrane flux and the concentration of virus particles in the permeate is given by the following equation 11 c p k i c m p 12 k i 6 83 19 384 λ 12 518 λ 2 where cp is the permeate virus concentration ki is a coefficient related to the hindrance of pore walls given by eq 12 using λ and cmp is the virus concentration inside the pore mouth which can be calculated by the equations below 13 c m p φ c s 14 φ 1 λ 2 15 c s c b exp j v d δ where φ is the ratio of virus concentration inside the pores to the virus concentration at the pore mouth and the value is determined by the value of λ via eq 14 cs is the virus concentration at the surface of the membrane which can be calculated by eq 15 where cb is the bulk virus concentration jv is the permeate flux d is a coefficient for apparent diffusion of virus particles and δ is the thickness of the concentration polarization cp layer formed by the rejected virus particles on the membrane surface which can be given by the equation below 16 δ a t b where a and b are both constants and t is the time of filtration this equation indicates that as the filtration proceeds the cp layer would grow thicker wu et al 2010 took a deep look into the removal process of somatic coliphages in a bench scale mbr system and analyzed the contribution of each major mechanism both physical and biological processes were considered and fitted with mathematical models although it is worth pointing out that this model is only partially process driven because some relationships and coefficients are obtained via regression methods the model starts with the mechanical sieving by the pristine membrane a linear relationship between the log removal and λ was reported eq 17 shows the equation 17 log removal 5 06 d p a r t i c l e d p o r e 0 03 the decay and inactivation either spontaneous or enhanced by activated sludge of somatic coliphage fitted well with the first order kinetic model of eqs 5 and 6 as for the coefficient kd the authors found the observed kd value of sewage was higher than that of natural water and attributed it to the increased number of bacteria in sewage however the impact of water type was not packed into the model because how environmental factors quantitatively affect the decay rate coefficient remains unclear the adsorption of coliphage particles by activated sludge was fitted by the freundlich isotherm equation shown in eq 18 18 l o g 10 q l o g 10 k a 1 n l o g 10 c e in this equation ce and q are the adsorption equilibrium somatic coliphage concentration and the adsorptive capacity at certain ce respectively and n and ka are constants the authors also mentioned that the removal contributed by the fouled membrane is positively correlated with fouling degree yet a mathematical model was not proposed whereas the process driven models listed provide great reference value in many ways including evaluating and simulating individual mechanisms in the removal process their applicability to real mbr systems still needs further validation before they can be useful in practical applications the major obstacle is the model complexity when facing a process as complex as the virus removal in mbr systems if all the contributing factors in both the biological and physical processes are integrated into an exhaustive and generalized mechanistic model not only the number of active variables may outreach the scope of practical experiments design and routine monitoring haimi et al 2013 le clech et al 2006 but the coordination and balance of components involved in the complex system would also significantly increase the amount of work and computational power needed moreover the current understanding of the process is still far from adequate the effect of some parameters on certain processes such as membrane fouling has yet to be clarified and some processes may not even be able to be described by a mathematical model bis et al 2019 ferrero et al 2012 madaeni and kurdian 2011 naessens et al 2012 bagheri et al 2019 listed 28 parameters as important factors associated with membrane fouling but they also stated that available information is not enough to infer the relative importance of those parameters similarly the membrane fouling model developed by li and wang 2006 takes into account the uneven distribution of aeration turbulence and the different rates of cake layer accumulation that follows the final model consists of a large number of equations with 49 functioning parameters and coefficients but even that several assumptions such as the absence of biomass properties variability and the effect of floc size on membrane fouling were still made for simplicity the simulation result shows that although the prediction of the general trend can be obtained the fitness between the simulated result and experimental data was not satisfactory further demonstrating the degree of complexity and nonlinearity of the membrane fouling process the operating condition is generally set to be stable which not only has limited tolarence for fluctuation but also attenuates the potential effect of environmental factors that could alter the biomass behavior and the membrane physicochemical properties such as ph conductivity and chemical composition making the model insensitive to the dynamic operating condition 3 5 data driven and hybrid virus removal modeling efforts since the virus removal process has not yet been clearly described by mathematical formulas due to its complexity ferrero et al 2012 hwang et al 2009 li and wang 2006 a chance for data driven modeling approach may exist generally a model can be classified as data driven if the link between input and output variables is established via statistical methods using existing dataset circumventing the need for studying the actual mechanisms due to this feature some data driven models are referred to as black box model because the inner structure can be too obscure for further interpretation fig 2 shows the typical workflow of designing and operating a data driven soft sensor model considering the critical role of membrane filtration in the virus removal process the efficiency of virus removal may be inferred from certain process indicators reflecting the membrane permeability which can easily be put under real time monitoring existing studies have supported such an idea shang et al 2005 and wu et al 2010 both stated that when other operational conditions remain unchanged transmembrane pressure tmp a common measure of membrane fouling degree could be used as an indicator for virus rejection and the latter study reported a significant positive correlation r 0 693 p 0 006 between the somatic coliphage rejection and tmp a similar correlation between tmp and virus removal r 2 ranges from 0 63 to 0 94 was also highlighted in the study of yin et al 2016 where human adenovirus was used as the model virus but the authors acknowledged that the quantitative relationship may be system dependent and is hence challenging to establish however as pointed out by fox and stuckey 2015 it is also indispensable to find a way to incorporate other factors as well since the virus removal is not entirely dependent on tmp led by the increasing demand for online process monitoring and the inherent inadequacies of mechanistic models the approach of data driven modeling is gaining interest among researchers in various fields and researchers working on water related topics are no exception dürrenmatt and gujer 2012 han et al 2018 yin et al 2014 the main appealing aspect of data driven models is that the connection between input and output variables is derived from available dataset by designated algorithms without the need for an understanding of underlying mechanisms which could be either beyond current knowledge base or mathematically unsolvable madaeni and kurdian 2011 nadiri et al 2018 in addition data driven models allow better handling of the uncertainty and nonlinearity by comparison yusuf et al 2019 this is especially intriguing when modeling a sophisticated process such as membrane fouling which is closely related to the virus removal performance during the filtration process the data driven modeling approach has seen a handful of successful applications with regard to mbr systems with a special interest in automation and membrane fouling control bagheri et al 2019 yusuf et al 2019 in the review paper of naessens et al 2012 several data driven modeling methods already applied to mbr systems for different purposes are introduced generally two types of methods can be considered to be data driven machine learning methods and multivariate statistics machine learning techniques covered here include artificial neural network ann and adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system anfis while principal component analysis pca and partial least squares pls are discussed under the category of multivariate statistics in essence machine learning methods stand out in establishing nonlinear input output relationships without prior knowledge while the power of multivariate statistics lies in capturing the hidden relationship between inputs and output and finding the variables mostly correlated with the desired output the two types of methods are often used together to offer better performance for instance the structure of ann and anfis can be optimized by using pca to reduce the dimensionality of data bagheri et al 2019 dürrenmatt and gujer 2012 han et al 2018 wan et al 2011 the power of these methods has been demonstrated in many cases one example is the study conducted by liu and kim 2008 in which a comparison between an ann model and single blocking law in tmp prediction was performed while the ann model took only three variables as input its accuracy surpassed the single blocking law over the complete experimental period with all the progress having been made though examples directly related to applying data driven modeling techniques to virus removal in mbr systems remain scarce in literature and the potential of such techniques is yet to be fully acknowledged the closest example is the study of madaeni and kurdian 2011 in which virus removal by microfiltration membrane was predicted by a fuzzy inference system notwithstanding a decent agreement was reached among the predicted and experimental data rmse 15 81 the highly simplified filtration module design means there is still a long way to go before such a method could be employed for practical use despite the competitive performance data driven models still suffer from some restrictions in practical applications first of all by nature such models need to be fed a large dataset to properly tune the internal parameters baker et al 2018 which means when the availability of experimental data is less than ideal the model may underperform haimi et al 2013 secondly since the understanding of the underlying process mechanisms is bypassed and the models are dedicated to existing data the opaqueness of black box models make them less easy to interpret when the interaction between process variables needs to be analyzed dürrenmatt and gujer 2012 thürlimann et al 2018 these drawbacks have raised the discussion among researchers about the potential of hybrid methods essentially the objective is the convergence of mechanistic understanding of the process being modeled and the overwhelming superiority of data driven models in learning from data and handling nonlinearity and uncertainty conceptually in a properly built hybrid model the mechanistic part and statistical part should complement each other which means the resultant model can diminish the demand for training data and offer better extrapolation potential despite there has not been a study on applying hybrid model to virus removal in mbr systems some efforts have been made for related topics such as membrane permeability prediction hwang et al 2009 developed a hybrid model for membrane filtration performance forecasting the model consists of a filtration model and an ann model two variables obtained from the physical model are fed into the ann model as input variables while the output is tmp predicted by 6 inputs in total another example of hybrid tmp prediction model can be found in the study of chew et al 2017 but in this model the order is reversed the ann model was used to predict the specific cake resistance α a coefficient that both fluctuates with the characteristics of feed water and requires extensive works to determine via experimental method the predicted value of α is then used in a first principle model which gives tmp as output by replacing the actual experiment with ann model prediction the model enabled rapid estimation and provided good agreement between experimental and predicted results 3 6 preferred features of future model from the viewpoint of maximizing the model capability and robustness several merits would be of particular interest when conceiving and designing a pioneering model firstly the model should be equipped with the ability to accurately grasp and approximate the intricate interactions between a large set of input and output parameters while being tolerant to data noise and fluctuation in addition it should have the capability to learn from the available data and adjust itself accordingly to go beyond the scope of the current understanding of the virus removal process thirdly as suggested by the concept of haccp risk factors should be monitored in real time and time consuming variable measurements should be avoided therefore if possible the model should take only easy to measure parameters or online sensor signals as inputs to guarantee a short response time which serves as the cornerstone for real time risk process control last but not least the model should be flexible enough to allow easily extrapolation to the various conditions the reactor may encounter due to the wide range of reactor configurations and wastewater characteristics the coefficients obtained from one reactor and one set of operational conditions might result in significant deviation when applied to others so the ability to adapt to new configurations and operational conditions would be critical for model usability 4 conclusion to ensure the safe use of the reclaimed water from mbr systems one crucial mission is to analyze and control the health risks of such systems particularly the viral infection and disease risks due to the high survivability and infectivity of enteric viruses in addition to virus removal experiments as end product inspection a mathematical prediction model based on the concept of soft sensor needs to be developed for advanced risk management schemes however the high degree of complexity nonlinearity and uncertainty of the mbr based wastewater treatment process makes establishing such a model an arduous task to the best of our knowledge there is no virus removal performance prediction model currently in existence that can fulfill all the requirements for a practical and robust soft sensor model future studies on the understanding and integration of physical and biological virus removal mechanisms and their joint impact on the final performance would be of great importance also the application of burgeoning data driven models and hybrid modeling approaches has been proven to be a promising direction in the water reclamation field the need for further research about the potential of such approaches in virus removal modeling is also highlighted declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper acknowledgments this study was supported by the japan science and

resistance to chlorine disinfection or bacteria which can survive or even regrow in the residual chlorine chlorine disinfection cannot completely control the risks of crb such as risks of pathogenicity antibiotic resistance and microbial growth currently researchers pay more attention to crb with pathogenicity or antibiotic resistance the microbial growth risks of non pathogenic crb in water treatment and reclamation systems have been neglected to some extent in this review these three kinds of risks are all analyzed and the last one is also highlighted in order to study crb various methods are used to evaluate chlorine resistance this review summarizes the evaluating methods for chlorine resistance reported in the literatures and collects the important information about the typical isolated crb strains including their genera sources and levels of chlorine resistance to our knowledge few review papers have provided such systematic information about crb among 44 typical crb strains from 17 genera isolated by researchers mycobacterium bacillus legionella pseudomonas and sphingomonas were the five genera with the highest frequency of occurrence in literatures they are all pathogenic or opportunistic pathogenic bacteria in addition although there are many studies on crb information about chlorine resistance level is still limited to specie level or strain level the difference in chlorine resistance level among different bacterial genera is less well understood an inconvenient truth is that there is still no widely accepted method to evaluate chlorine resistance and to identify crb due to the lack of a unified method it is difficult to compare the results about chlorine resistance level of bacterial strains in different literatures a recommended evaluating method using logarithmic removal rate as an index and e coli as a reference strain is proposed in this review based on the summary of the current evaluating methods this method can provide common range of chlorine resistance of each genus and it is conducive to analyzing the distribution and abundance of crb in the environment graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords chlorine resistant bacteria crb recommended evaluating method chlorine disinfection microbial growth risks 1 introduction chlorine disinfection has been used as one of the most common disinfection technology for controlling the risks of microorganism in drinking water wastewater treatment and wastewater reclamation as well as industrial cooling water system chen et al 2012b wang wu et al 2019a zhang tian et al 2019 rajeev sushmitha et al 2020 in water treatment system based membrane technologies such as the ultrafiltration and reverse osmosis system chlorine is not only used as a disinfection technology for controlling health risks but also as a cleaning method or pretreatment for controlling biological fouling khan hong et al 2015 wang wu et al 2019a wang wu et al 2019b taking the changi newater plant in singapore as an example there are 5 times of chlorine addition during the entire treatment process of which 3 chlorine addition sites are located in the pretreatment stage some bacteria in drinking water can cause health risks but chlorine disinfection cannot inactivate all the bacteria in water roi klimenko et al 2015 pang xi et al 2016 roy and ghosh 2017 shekhawat kulshreshtha et al 2020 zeng cao et al 2020 some bacteria have stronger chlorine resistance compared with the normal ones so they are defined as chlorine resistant bacteria crb farkashimsley 1964 firstly used the term chlorine resistant bacteria recently more studies have reported that crb are widely present in water wastewater treatment plants water distribution system and cooling water system le dantec duguet et al 2002 ding jin et al 2019 significantly chlorine resistance in this review only refers to the resistance of planktonic cells and does not include the biofilm protection a total of 1040 articles are found on the web of science with chlorine resistant bacteria as topic judging from the publication of the articles the attention to crb is increasing significantly from the year of 2001 as shown in fig 1 especially in the recent 5 years although crb have long been a concern there is no widely accepted scientific definition of crb and quantification methodology of the chlorine resistant ability crb are commonly defined as bacteria with high resistance to chlorine disinfection or bacteria which can survive or even regrow in the residual chlorine jingyu wang 2019 jia jia et al 2020 proposed that chlorine resistance of crb was a relative concept rather than fully quantifiable since it was affected by the growth conditions however it is still possible to establish a recommended method for comparison of chlorine resistance among different bacterial strains who 2011 proposed a method to evaluate the chlorine resistance of pathogenic microorganisms which was based on the survival time of microorganisms in conventional disinfection dosage 0 5 mg l free chlorine health risks are the initial cause of concern for crb but more and more studies have revealed other risks of crb recently besides it is found that there is a correlation between chlorine resistance and antibiotic resistance and the presence of crb leads to an increase in the abundance of antibiotic resistance genes after disinfection khan beattie et al 2016 moreover crb in water distribution system can cause pipeline corrosion and biofilm overgrowth wang sui et al 2019 the last risk is often ignored but very important excessive breeding of crb lead to decrease of system efficiency increase of energy consumption and shortening of service life of structural components in membrane water production systems or industrial cooling water systems wang wu et al 2019a rajeev sushmitha et al 2020 the microorganisms which regrow rapidly after disinfection might not be considered as crb but is also worthy of attention after disinfection the relative abundance of such microorganisms will increase rapidly which may also have similar risks to the ones of crb mentioned above 2 risks of chlorine resistant bacteria 2 1 influence on human health studies show that some pathogenic bacteria or conditional pathogenic bacteria have chlorine resistance as shown in table 1 among various water mediated pathogens who only found that francisella tularensis and non tuberculosis mycobacteria had moderate or high chlorine resistance survival time exceeded 1 min or 30 min under 0 5 mg l free chlorine who 2011 however some studies reported other pathogenic or opportunistic pathogenic crb such as pseudomonas aeruginosa and legionella miyamoto yamaguchi et al 2000 owoseni 2017a recovered chlorine resistant enterococcus and citrobacter spp which are both opportunistic pathogens from the eastern cape wastewater treatment plant in south africa opportunistic pathogens enterococcus and salmonella were also detected in the disinfected reclaimed water enterococcus and salmonella li zeng et al 2013 it has found that salmonella had a high level of regeneration capacity after chlorine disinfection li zeng et al 2013 chlorine disinfection leads to the selection of anti chlorine pathogenic bacteria and the regeneration of pathogenic bacteria after chlorine disinfection in reclaimed water with long retention time will threaten public health at present there are many related researches on chlorine resistance but the research objects are mainly pathogenic and opportunistic pathogenic bacteria there are still some deficiencies in the current researches on the one hand these pathogenic and opportunistic pathogenic bacteria may not exist in drinking water or reclaimed water on the other hand the risks of non pathogenic crb which exist widely have been ignored 2 2 influence on abundance of antibiotic resistance genes antibiotic resistance and antibiotic resistance genes arg of residual bacteria after chlorine disinfection are one of the research hot spots in recent years jia shi et al 2015 some studies reported that chlorine disinfection lead to an increase in the abundance of antibiotic resistant bacteria khan beattie et al 2016 studied the relationship between antibiotic resistance and chlorine disinfection resistance in microbial bacterial strains it was found that crb had higher minimum inhibitory concentration mic to tetracycline sulfamethoxazole and amoxicillin khan beattie et al 2016 during chlorine disinfection of drinking water the antibiotic resistance of the bacterial community as a whole increased jia shi et al 2015 the above researches showed that residual bacteria after chlorine disinfection might have higher antibiotic resistance level than other bacteria some studies have been used to explain the inherited mechanism of relationship between chloride resistance and antimicrobial resistance researchers found that pseudomonas mycobacteria and clostridium which are potential bacterial hosts of arg in drinking water showed resistance to chlorine disinfection jia bian et al 2020 karumathil yin et al 2014 found that the exposure of acinetobacter baumannii to chlorine will increase the expression of efflux pump and activate the genes that give resistance to chloramphenicol sulfonamide and β lactam antibiotics pseudomonas aeruginosa cells damaged by chlorine can also enhance antibiotic resistance through increasing the expression of efflux pump jin liu et al 2020 oxidative stress regulon are thought to be triggered by chlorine and affect the gene expression of antibiotic resistance antibiotic intake and antibiotic accumulation thus enhancing the antibiotic resistance of bacteria greenberg monach et al 1990 demple 1996 in addition the horizontal transfer of arg among disinfection residual bacteria deserves attention researchers proposed that through horizontal gene transfer non pathogenic microorganism species with arg could be used as gene banks for pathogenic bacteria salyers and shoemaker 2006 increased arg abundance of disinfection residual crb might lead to increase of antibiotic resistance of pathogenic bacteria chlorine disinfection affects the horizontal transfer of arg through various pathways shi jia et al 2013 reported that chlorine disinfection could increase the relative abundance of arg related insertion sequences zhang chang et al 2019 found that disinfection significantly increased the relative abundance of arg and antibiotic resistant bacteria carrying mobile genetic elements mge mge which often coexists with arg plays an important role in the horizontal transfer of arg to recipient bacteria yu he et al 2016 jin liu et al 2020 found that chlorine disinfection would kill non chlorine resistant bacteria carrying arg and release a large number of arg vectors with genetic information integrity at the same time the permeability of cell membrane of crb damaged by chlorine is enhanced and it is easier to obtain extracellular arg and transform them into antibiotic resistant bacteria these two effects explain the mechanism that chlorine disinfection enhances the horizontal transfer of arg gene from non chlorine resistant bacteria to crb jin liu et al 2020 2 3 influence on water treatment distribution and utilization systems 2 3 1 microbial growth in water treatment systems with the expansion of demand for high quality reclaimed water and the widely application of water production processes based on membrane technologies the demand for biofouling control in water production is increasing wang et al 2019 reported that there was adverse effect of chlorine disinfection on the biofouling control of reverse osmosis membranes used for municipal wastewater reclamation since crb survived chlorine disinfection secreted more extracellular polymeric substances eps wang wu et al 2019b the reverse osmosis system for seawater desalination plant in saudi arabia also reported similar phenomenon of increased membrane fouling caused by chlorine disinfection khan hong et al 2015 however the mechanism of chlorine disinfection aggravating membrane fouling is not completely clear in addition researchers reported that in a drinking water treatment plant in southern china in 2014 abnormal growth of bacteria was observed and could not be controlled by sodium hypochlorite ding jin et al 2019 it is necessary to develop control methods for crb or propose other alternative technologies to inhibit microbial growth of crb 2 3 2 microbial growth in water distribution systems the influence of non pathogenic crb on water distribution system is another important issue chlorine disinfection could slow down but could not prevent biofilm growth mainly due to the presence of crb ling and liu 2013 breeding of non pathogenic crb caused pipeline corrosion biofilm formation nitrification and affect the sensory index color taste and odors of drinking water system boe hansen albrechtsen et al 2002 zhang stout et al 2008 gomes simoes et al 2016 regrowth of crb also lead to enrichment of pathogen in biofilm in water distribution system zhang stout et al 2008 biofilm protects pathogenic bacteria from disinfectants besides crb in reclaimed water distribution system also attracted the attention of researchers zhang tian et al 2019 and the findings were similar to those of studies on drinking water 2 3 3 microbial growth in industrial cooling water systems industrial cooling water system often use reclaimed water or desalinated seawater as heat exchange medium saravanan nancharaiah et al 2006 cherchi kesaano et al 2019 saeed et al 2019 and chlorine is used to control microbial growth in cooling water system rahmani jadidian et al 2016 rajeev sushmitha et al 2020 crb that could not be completely inactivated colonize on the surface of the heat exchanger or pipelines and then develop into biofouling resulting in a serial of problems such as pipeline blockage flow rate reduction heat exchange efficiency reduction and shorter service life of system structural components pinel moed et al 2020 rajeev sushmitha et al 2020 in addition biofouling would increase operating cost of cooling water system schultz bendick et al 2011 rajeev sushmitha et al 2020 3 mechanisms of chlorine resistance of crb the mechanism of chlorine disinfection is different from antibiotics and thus the mechanism of chlorine resistance is also different from antibiotic resistance antibiotics usually have specific cell targets while disinfectants such as chlorine are nonspecific and usually act on multiple cell target cites ortega morente fernandez fuentes et al 2013 chlorine react with cell components such as cell walls cell membranes and genetic materials and damage them thus inactivating microorganisms mcdonnell and russell 1999 therefore permeability barrier and chlorine consumption capacity of matrix cells and eps are the main sources of chlorine resistance the permeation barrier consisting of cell membranes cell walls spore coats and eps provide protection against chlorine lechevallier cawthon et al 1988 cloete 2003 fig 2 shows four kinds of cellular permeability barriers against chlorine to provide chlorine resistance chlorine consuming substances refer to lipids amino acids in cell membranes and eps covering cells lechevallier cawthon et al 1988 cloete 2003 furuhata ishizaki et al 2014 wang wu et al 2019b the above resistant effects are determined by genes and influenced by environmental factors in addition the intracellular molecular reaction induced by chlorine is considered as a possible explanation for the enhanced chlorine resistance of bacteria studies have shown that chlorine disinfection induces the expression of many functional genes including oxidative stress dna repair efflux pump antioxidant enzyme secretion pore protein regulation and cell wall repair demple 1996 small chang et al 2007 kim park et al 2009 holder berry et al 2013 karumathil yin et al 2014 hou yang et al 2019 however it is still difficult to answer whether the protective function of these intracellular molecular reactions is stronger than the cellular permeability barriers or chlorine consuming substances 3 1 intrinsic chlorine resistance determined by genes intrinsic resistance was the resistance determined by genetic materials so different genera of bacteria had different resistance levels and mechanisms the resistance of bacteria against free chlorine was often due to the unique variation of cell structures and protein composition which had barrier function or chlorine consumption capacity cloete 2003 donnermair and blatchley 2003 mir morato et al 1997 considered gram positive bacteria had stronger chlorine resistance because gram positive bacteria had thicker cell walls than gram negative bacteria waxy substances in the cell wall of mycobacterium enhanced hydrophobicity and barrier function so also enhanced chlorine resistance of mycobacterium bacillus relied on intracellular spore to resist disinfectants ortega morente fernandez fuentes et al 2013 another study found that chlorine sensitive bacteria and crb showed differences in the relative percentages of fatty acids in cell walls and cell membranes furuhata ishizaki et al 2014 besides secretion characteristic of extracellular polymers eps was also considered to be related to chlorine resistance of bacteria the amount components and molecular weight of eps of different microorganisms were different and bacteria that secrete more eps had stronger chlorine resistance wang wu et al 2019b early study also showed that the permeation barrier composed of eps was related to the chlorine resistance hoyle and costerton 1991 in the molecular mechanism of chlorine resistance the effects of chlorine on a few species such as e coli pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter baumannii were reported but the differences of molecular mechanism of chlorine resistance among different bacteria are still unclear demple 1996 karumathil yin et al 2014 jin liu et al 2020 3 2 apparent chlorine resistance affected by environmental factors intrinsic resistance determined by genes cannot explain the change in chlorine resistance of a specific strain during different growth conditions environmental factors affect the apparent chlorine resistance of microorganisms in two ways one is to affect the composition and permeability of bacterial cell membranes and the other is to regulate eps secretion characteristics and agglomeration behavior of bacteria le dantec et al 2002b found that the change of culture medium type affected the composition of cell membranes thus changing the chlorine resistance mycobacteria grown in water had greater resistance than those grown in culture medium which may be related to changes of lipids in cells le dantec et al 2002b eps itself was also an important chlorine resistance barrier for bacteria and the secretion characteristics of eps were affected by ph temperature carbon sources nitrogen sources and other conditions more yadav et al 2014 4 evaluating methods of chlorine resistance and identification of chlorine resistant bacteria in the current research there are many different methods used to evaluate chlorine resistance and to identify crb as shown in table 2 the evaluating methods can be classified according to evaluation indexes and reference strains fig 3 shows schematic diagram of the indexes for chlorine resistance evaluation compared with other evaluating methods of chlorine resistance logarithmic removal rate is a more feasible evaluation index as a recommended standard method evaluating chlorine resistance by logarithmic removal rate makes comparison of chlorine resistance among different studies more easily and avoids some intrinsic disadvantages of other methods application of ct value or mic need a large amount of experimental operations which are not suitable for comparison of a large number of strains but these two indexes can be compared among studies easily furthermore neither ct value nor mic can reflect inactivation effect of typical chlorine concentrations in water treatment on different bacteria for bacteria that need special nutrition conditions or whose growth rate is obviously inconsistent the test results of inhibition zone method are often inaccurate table 3 lists the practical application cases of crb identification there are many differences in the reference strains evaluation indexes disinfection methods and disinfection time used in different studies so the identification standards of crb are also very different up to now there is no widely accepted identification method of crb leading to the inconvenience in the comparison of chlorine resistance among different studies 5 typical species sources and chlorine resistance of chlorine resistant bacteria some studies have revealed the changes of microbial community structure in actual water samples before and after chlorine disinfection providing us with the possibility to study crb in the process of wastewater treatment in this review we defined the microorganisms whose relative abundance increases by 200 after disinfection as crb with increased relative abundance analyzed the relevant results in several studies and counted the phylum and genera of those crb as shown in fig 4 authors of these studies did not isolate bacteria with increased abundance and not systematically evaluate the chlorine resistance of these bacteria neither among the crb with increased relative abundance 14 strains were proteobacteria 5 strains were firmicutes and 2 strains were actinobacteria the genera of crb with the highest frequency of occurrence are pseudomonas and bacillus some researchers also evaluated the chlorine resistance of strains isolated by themselves or other researchers a total of 365 articles were searched from the web of science core collection with chlorine resistant bacteria as topic highly relevant researches are selected from these articles and other researches mentioned in these articles are also supplemented table 4 comprehensively summarizes the results of relevant researches the phylum genera sources and chlorine resistance of isolated crb fig 5 shows the distribution of genera of typical isolated crb among the typical isolated crb 21 strains were proteobacteria 9 strains were firmicutes and 14 strains were actinobacteria the genera of isolated crb with the highest frequency of occurrence were mycobacterium bacillus legionella pseudomonas and sphingomonas the genera with the highest frequency of isolated and detected crb were different from fig 4 because researches pay more attention to the chlorine resistance of pathogenic bacteria and rarely isolate non pathogenic crb although some researchers considered gram positive bacteria had stronger chlorine resistance mir morato et al 1997 but most isolated crb in fig 3 were gram negative bacteria which could not be explained by above theory except bacillus staphylococcus clostridium and enterococcus some articles disclosed the genbank accession numbers of chlorine resistant strains the gene sequence information of these strains and escherichia coli was used to establish the neighborhood joining n j evolutionary tree as shown in fig 6 according to fig 6 chlorine resistant bacteria are widely distributed in many phylum and have no similar genetic relationship the genetic difference between e coli non chlorine resistant bacteria and crb is not greater than that between crb which indicates that there is no long term selective pressure related to chlorine resistance in nature in addition there are doubts about whether some isolated microorganisms can be called crb in the above mentioned researches because they used different evaluating methods for chlorine resistance it is difficult to compare the chlorine resistance of these microorganisms and rank their chlorine resistance ability therefore in order to systematically compare the chlorine resistance of different bacterial strains in different studies it is necessary to propose a recommended evaluating method for chlorine resistance and a scientific quantitative definition for crb in this paper genus is taken as the basic unit to study crb many other researchers also cite the reported genera of crb to explain the differences of community structure between the samples before and after chlorine disinfection zhou ahmad et al 2020 but how much chlorine resistance depends on bacterial genus is still unclear if inter genus difference in chlorine resistance is greater than the inter species difference taking genus as the basic research unit of crb is scientific at present there is a lack of rapid detection technology for crb these facts make it difficult to know the abundance of crb in the environment if researchers can take genus as the basic research unit it is feasible to evaluate the environmental abundance of crb however many studies showed that the chlorine resistance of bacteria was different among species strains and even generations le dantec duguet et al 2002 zyara torvinen et al 2016 jia jia et al 2020 in a study on chlorine resistance of e coli the mic range of free chlorine from the most sensitive strain to the most resistant strain was 0 04 0 2 mg l zyara torvinen et al 2016 while there was also some evidences to support the opposite view khan beattie et al 2016 isolated 87 strains of bacteria of 22 genera from drinking water and evaluated the chlorine resistance of these bacteria isolated bacteria were divided into three grades according to their chlorine resistance and almost each genus was in a single grade khan beattie et al 2016 this result suggested that the difference of chlorine resistance at species level might be less than that at genus level undoubtedly some studies found that some specific species had abnormal chlorine resistance bolton dodd et al 1988 found that one staphylococcus strain was 100 times more resistant to chlorine than a natural strain whether this difference was a special case or a common phenomenon was still unclear the existing research results using different methods are difficult to compare under the same standard so it is difficult to give the general range of chlorine resistance of a certain genus therefore it proves the necessity to propose a recommended evaluating method for crb 6 recommended evaluation and identification methods of chlorine resistant bacteria in view of the lack of standard evaluating methods as mentioned above we suggest using logarithmic removal rate as an index and e coli as a reference other evaluating methods or evaluation indexes can provide additional information on crb to supplement the recommended evaluating method the reason why logarithmic inactivation rate is the appropriate index of recommended evaluating method is analyzed in section 4 as reference bacterial strains e coli is a kind of typical chlorine sensitive bacteria and readily available so far e coli is generally considered to have weak chlorine resistance compared with other genera though there were small differences among different e coli species zyara torvinen et al 2016 evaluating chlorine resistance of e coli gives a benchmark of comparison in experiments to identify crb more researches in the future can provide a common range of chlorine resistance of e coli and the common range of chlorine resistance of e coli is conducive to the quality control of relevant experiments according to the information above we propose a kind of recommended standard method to evaluate chlorine resistance and to grade the crb as following hydraulic retention time of disinfection tank in wwtp is within the range of 0 5 1 0 h and the common disinfection time ranges from 1 min to 60 min in evaluating experiments of crb in current experimental research scoaris dde colacite et al 2008 roy and ghosh 2017 shekhawat kulshreshtha et al 2020 we choose 30 min as the standard disinfection time in the recommended evaluating method the conventional chlorine dosage used by who to evaluate the chlorine resistance of pathogenic bacteria is 0 5 mg l who 2011 the common chlorine concentration for disinfection ranged from 0 5 to 2 mg l in evaluating experiments of crb scoaris dde colacite et al 2008 roy and ghosh 2017 shekhawat kulshreshtha et al 2020 corinne reported that the ct value to achieve 99 9 inactivation of mycobacterium strain can reach 135 mg min l le dantec et al 2002b but the upper limit of the ct value corresponding to the concentration of 2 mg l for 30 min was only 60 mg min l which could not reflect the chlorine resistance of strong crb a higher concentration such as 5 mg l is needed the list of crb varies with different concentrations of chlorine distinguishing crb in specific concentration of chlorine can help to analyze the changes of dominant genera in residual bacteria after chlorine disinfection with different concentrations in terms of removal rate 1 log reduction and 3 log reduction of microorganism correspond to majority inactivation and complete inactivation respectively in addition it is necessary to unify the initial concentration of bacteria initial concentration of bacteria affects the maximum inactivation rate the recommended initial bacterial concentration is 107 108 cfu ml it should be noted that the chlorine concentration level in the experiment cannot be considered completely equal to the actual chlorine dosage in the water treatment sterile oxidant demand free odf deionized water buffered with phosphate buffered saline pbs is used as a solvent for the bacterial suspension ofori maddila et al 2018 therefore at the same concentration the inactivation rate in the experiment is higher than that in actual conditions water with chemicals which can react with chlorine to sum up present researches we used the results of experiments which conform to the evaluating conditions mentioned above to draw a grading picture of the reported crb in literatures as shown in fig 7 we divided fig 7 into three zones including high chlorine resistance zone removal rates 1 log low chlorine resistance zone removal rates 3 log and 1 log no chlorine resistance zone removal rates 3 log the microorganisms with low or high chlorine resistance at 0 5 2 and 5 mg l free chlorine were defined as crb0 5 crb2 and crb5 pseudomonas has high resistance to 0 5 mg l chlorine but no resistance to 5 mg l chlorine so it is a kind of crb0 5 but not crb5 according to the recommended evaluating method isolated enterococcus and stenotrophomonas involved in table 4 cannot be considered as strains with strong chlorine resistance although the microorganisms on the right side of high chlorine resistance zone in fig 7 are much more chlorine resistant than those on the left side the ones on the right side may not be the most critical crb because under the condition of low concentration chlorine the selection pressure is small and they have no obvious competitive advantage therefore crb under the condition of low chlorine concentration should also receive attention the recommended standard method covers multiple reference disinfection concentrations and can be used to analyze the list of crb at typical chlorine concentrations in water treatment other evaluating methods could also be used to supplement the recommended standard method when evaluating specific microorganisms researchers can also use ct values or mic to provide more information about these bacteria the recommended standard method is proposed in the hope that the subsequent studies include recommended disinfection conditions and provide possibility for comparison among different studies the recommended standard method is also helpful to study the mechanism of chlorine resistance more researches based on the recommended standard method will provide the common chlorine resistance range of each bacterial genus analysis of cell structure and secretion characteristics of abnormal strains will deepen the understanding of chlorine resistance it is worth noting that chlorine disinfection may cause residual bacteria to enter viable but noncuturable vbnc state chen li et al 2018 olszewska and bialobrzewski 2019 ye lin et al 2020 vbnc state may make some crb unable to be separated from water samples and be ignored the isolation and culture of these crb is an important research direction 7 conclusions in this review we summarized the risks of crb and highlighted the microbial growth risks the critical assessment for existing evaluating methods for chlorine resistance provided guidance for systematic study on crb however there was still no widely accepted method to evaluate chlorine resistance therefore a recommended evaluating method for chlorine resistance and a quantitative definition of crb was proposed in this review in addition we summarized the genera sources and chlorine resistance of the typical isolated crb strains there are several key points in this review as follows 1 chlorine disinfection cannot completely control the risks of crb such as risks of pathogenicity antibiotic resistance and microbial growth the microbial growth risks of crb in water treatment and reclamation systems attracted more and more attention a possible explanation of microbial growth risks was that eps protected crb and caused more severe fouling at the same time the microbial growth risks of crb and its control will become a promising research field in the future 2 the genera of isolated crb with the highest frequency of occurrence were mycobacterium bacillus legionella pseudomonas and sphingomonas which were all pathogenic or opportunistic pathogenic bacteria the non pathogenic crb were neglected to some extent these isolated crb mainly came from drinking water 3 a recommended evaluating method using logarithmic removal rate as an index and e coli as a reference strain was proposed the appropriate disinfection conditions were 0 5 2 5 mg l free chlorine for 30 min under recommended disinfection conditions non majority inactivation 1 log reduction and non complete inactivation 3 log reduction are respectively taken as quantitative definitions of high chlorine resistance bacteria and low chlorine resistance bacteria the recommended standard method provided a comparison benchmark for chlorine resistance evaluation which had great potential for analyzing chlorine resistance at specific species level declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could

resistance to chlorine disinfection or bacteria which can survive or even regrow in the residual chlorine chlorine disinfection cannot completely control the risks of crb such as risks of pathogenicity antibiotic resistance and microbial growth currently researchers pay more attention to crb with pathogenicity or antibiotic resistance the microbial growth risks of non pathogenic crb in water treatment and reclamation systems have been neglected to some extent in this review these three kinds of risks are all analyzed and the last one is also highlighted in order to study crb various methods are used to evaluate chlorine resistance this review summarizes the evaluating methods for chlorine resistance reported in the literatures and collects the important information about the typical isolated crb strains including their genera sources and levels of chlorine resistance to our knowledge few review papers have provided such systematic information about crb among 44 typical crb strains from 17 genera isolated by researchers mycobacterium bacillus legionella pseudomonas and sphingomonas were the five genera with the highest frequency of occurrence in literatures they are all pathogenic or opportunistic pathogenic bacteria in addition although there are many studies on crb information about chlorine resistance level is still limited to specie level or strain level the difference in chlorine resistance level among different bacterial genera is less well understood an inconvenient truth is that there is still no widely accepted method to evaluate chlorine resistance and to identify crb due to the lack of a unified method it is difficult to compare the results about chlorine resistance level of bacterial strains in different literatures a recommended evaluating method using logarithmic removal rate as an index and e coli as a reference strain is proposed in this review based on the summary of the current evaluating methods this method can provide common range of chlorine resistance of each genus and it is conducive to analyzing the distribution and abundance of crb in the environment graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords chlorine resistant bacteria crb recommended evaluating method chlorine disinfection microbial growth risks 1 introduction chlorine disinfection has been used as one of the most common disinfection technology for controlling the risks of microorganism in drinking water wastewater treatment and wastewater reclamation as well as industrial cooling water system chen et al 2012b wang wu et al 2019a zhang tian et al 2019 rajeev sushmitha et al 2020 in water treatment system based membrane technologies such as the ultrafiltration and reverse osmosis system chlorine is not only used as a disinfection technology for controlling health risks but also as a cleaning method or pretreatment for controlling biological fouling khan hong et al 2015 wang wu et al 2019a wang wu et al 2019b taking the changi newater plant in singapore as an example there are 5 times of chlorine addition during the entire treatment process of which 3 chlorine addition sites are located in the pretreatment stage some bacteria in drinking water can cause health risks but chlorine disinfection cannot inactivate all the bacteria in water roi klimenko et al 2015 pang xi et al 2016 roy and ghosh 2017 shekhawat kulshreshtha et al 2020 zeng cao et al 2020 some bacteria have stronger chlorine resistance compared with the normal ones so they are defined as chlorine resistant bacteria crb farkashimsley 1964 firstly used the term chlorine resistant bacteria recently more studies have reported that crb are widely present in water wastewater treatment plants water distribution system and cooling water system le dantec duguet et al 2002 ding jin et al 2019 significantly chlorine resistance in this review only refers to the resistance of planktonic cells and does not include the biofilm protection a total of 1040 articles are found on the web of science with chlorine resistant bacteria as topic judging from the publication of the articles the attention to crb is increasing significantly from the year of 2001 as shown in fig 1 especially in the recent 5 years although crb have long been a concern there is no widely accepted scientific definition of crb and quantification methodology of the chlorine resistant ability crb are commonly defined as bacteria with high resistance to chlorine disinfection or bacteria which can survive or even regrow in the residual chlorine jingyu wang 2019 jia jia et al 2020 proposed that chlorine resistance of crb was a relative concept rather than fully quantifiable since it was affected by the growth conditions however it is still possible to establish a recommended method for comparison of chlorine resistance among different bacterial strains who 2011 proposed a method to evaluate the chlorine resistance of pathogenic microorganisms which was based on the survival time of microorganisms in conventional disinfection dosage 0 5 mg l free chlorine health risks are the initial cause of concern for crb but more and more studies have revealed other risks of crb recently besides it is found that there is a correlation between chlorine resistance and antibiotic resistance and the presence of crb leads to an increase in the abundance of antibiotic resistance genes after disinfection khan beattie et al 2016 moreover crb in water distribution system can cause pipeline corrosion and biofilm overgrowth wang sui et al 2019 the last risk is often ignored but very important excessive breeding of crb lead to decrease of system efficiency increase of energy consumption and shortening of service life of structural components in membrane water production systems or industrial cooling water systems wang wu et al 2019a rajeev sushmitha et al 2020 the microorganisms which regrow rapidly after disinfection might not be considered as crb but is also worthy of attention after disinfection the relative abundance of such microorganisms will increase rapidly which may also have similar risks to the ones of crb mentioned above 2 risks of chlorine resistant bacteria 2 1 influence on human health studies show that some pathogenic bacteria or conditional pathogenic bacteria have chlorine resistance as shown in table 1 among various water mediated pathogens who only found that francisella tularensis and non tuberculosis mycobacteria had moderate or high chlorine resistance survival time exceeded 1 min or 30 min under 0 5 mg l free chlorine who 2011 however some studies reported other pathogenic or opportunistic pathogenic crb such as pseudomonas aeruginosa and legionella miyamoto yamaguchi et al 2000 owoseni 2017a recovered chlorine resistant enterococcus and citrobacter spp which are both opportunistic pathogens from the eastern cape wastewater treatment plant in south africa opportunistic pathogens enterococcus and salmonella were also detected in the disinfected reclaimed water enterococcus and salmonella li zeng et al 2013 it has found that salmonella had a high level of regeneration capacity after chlorine disinfection li zeng et al 2013 chlorine disinfection leads to the selection of anti chlorine pathogenic bacteria and the regeneration of pathogenic bacteria after chlorine disinfection in reclaimed water with long retention time will threaten public health at present there are many related researches on chlorine resistance but the research objects are mainly pathogenic and opportunistic pathogenic bacteria there are still some deficiencies in the current researches on the one hand these pathogenic and opportunistic pathogenic bacteria may not exist in drinking water or reclaimed water on the other hand the risks of non pathogenic crb which exist widely have been ignored 2 2 influence on abundance of antibiotic resistance genes antibiotic resistance and antibiotic resistance genes arg of residual bacteria after chlorine disinfection are one of the research hot spots in recent years jia shi et al 2015 some studies reported that chlorine disinfection lead to an increase in the abundance of antibiotic resistant bacteria khan beattie et al 2016 studied the relationship between antibiotic resistance and chlorine disinfection resistance in microbial bacterial strains it was found that crb had higher minimum inhibitory concentration mic to tetracycline sulfamethoxazole and amoxicillin khan beattie et al 2016 during chlorine disinfection of drinking water the antibiotic resistance of the bacterial community as a whole increased jia shi et al 2015 the above researches showed that residual bacteria after chlorine disinfection might have higher antibiotic resistance level than other bacteria some studies have been used to explain the inherited mechanism of relationship between chloride resistance and antimicrobial resistance researchers found that pseudomonas mycobacteria and clostridium which are potential bacterial hosts of arg in drinking water showed resistance to chlorine disinfection jia bian et al 2020 karumathil yin et al 2014 found that the exposure of acinetobacter baumannii to chlorine will increase the expression of efflux pump and activate the genes that give resistance to chloramphenicol sulfonamide and β lactam antibiotics pseudomonas aeruginosa cells damaged by chlorine can also enhance antibiotic resistance through increasing the expression of efflux pump jin liu et al 2020 oxidative stress regulon are thought to be triggered by chlorine and affect the gene expression of antibiotic resistance antibiotic intake and antibiotic accumulation thus enhancing the antibiotic resistance of bacteria greenberg monach et al 1990 demple 1996 in addition the horizontal transfer of arg among disinfection residual bacteria deserves attention researchers proposed that through horizontal gene transfer non pathogenic microorganism species with arg could be used as gene banks for pathogenic bacteria salyers and shoemaker 2006 increased arg abundance of disinfection residual crb might lead to increase of antibiotic resistance of pathogenic bacteria chlorine disinfection affects the horizontal transfer of arg through various pathways shi jia et al 2013 reported that chlorine disinfection could increase the relative abundance of arg related insertion sequences zhang chang et al 2019 found that disinfection significantly increased the relative abundance of arg and antibiotic resistant bacteria carrying mobile genetic elements mge mge which often coexists with arg plays an important role in the horizontal transfer of arg to recipient bacteria yu he et al 2016 jin liu et al 2020 found that chlorine disinfection would kill non chlorine resistant bacteria carrying arg and release a large number of arg vectors with genetic information integrity at the same time the permeability of cell membrane of crb damaged by chlorine is enhanced and it is easier to obtain extracellular arg and transform them into antibiotic resistant bacteria these two effects explain the mechanism that chlorine disinfection enhances the horizontal transfer of arg gene from non chlorine resistant bacteria to crb jin liu et al 2020 2 3 influence on water treatment distribution and utilization systems 2 3 1 microbial growth in water treatment systems with the expansion of demand for high quality reclaimed water and the widely application of water production processes based on membrane technologies the demand for biofouling control in water production is increasing wang et al 2019 reported that there was adverse effect of chlorine disinfection on the biofouling control of reverse osmosis membranes used for municipal wastewater reclamation since crb survived chlorine disinfection secreted more extracellular polymeric substances eps wang wu et al 2019b the reverse osmosis system for seawater desalination plant in saudi arabia also reported similar phenomenon of increased membrane fouling caused by chlorine disinfection khan hong et al 2015 however the mechanism of chlorine disinfection aggravating membrane fouling is not completely clear in addition researchers reported that in a drinking water treatment plant in southern china in 2014 abnormal growth of bacteria was observed and could not be controlled by sodium hypochlorite ding jin et al 2019 it is necessary to develop control methods for crb or propose other alternative technologies to inhibit microbial growth of crb 2 3 2 microbial growth in water distribution systems the influence of non pathogenic crb on water distribution system is another important issue chlorine disinfection could slow down but could not prevent biofilm growth mainly due to the presence of crb ling and liu 2013 breeding of non pathogenic crb caused pipeline corrosion biofilm formation nitrification and affect the sensory index color taste and odors of drinking water system boe hansen albrechtsen et al 2002 zhang stout et al 2008 gomes simoes et al 2016 regrowth of crb also lead to enrichment of pathogen in biofilm in water distribution system zhang stout et al 2008 biofilm protects pathogenic bacteria from disinfectants besides crb in reclaimed water distribution system also attracted the attention of researchers zhang tian et al 2019 and the findings were similar to those of studies on drinking water 2 3 3 microbial growth in industrial cooling water systems industrial cooling water system often use reclaimed water or desalinated seawater as heat exchange medium saravanan nancharaiah et al 2006 cherchi kesaano et al 2019 saeed et al 2019 and chlorine is used to control microbial growth in cooling water system rahmani jadidian et al 2016 rajeev sushmitha et al 2020 crb that could not be completely inactivated colonize on the surface of the heat exchanger or pipelines and then develop into biofouling resulting in a serial of problems such as pipeline blockage flow rate reduction heat exchange efficiency reduction and shorter service life of system structural components pinel moed et al 2020 rajeev sushmitha et al 2020 in addition biofouling would increase operating cost of cooling water system schultz bendick et al 2011 rajeev sushmitha et al 2020 3 mechanisms of chlorine resistance of crb the mechanism of chlorine disinfection is different from antibiotics and thus the mechanism of chlorine resistance is also different from antibiotic resistance antibiotics usually have specific cell targets while disinfectants such as chlorine are nonspecific and usually act on multiple cell target cites ortega morente fernandez fuentes et al 2013 chlorine react with cell components such as cell walls cell membranes and genetic materials and damage them thus inactivating microorganisms mcdonnell and russell 1999 therefore permeability barrier and chlorine consumption capacity of matrix cells and eps are the main sources of chlorine resistance the permeation barrier consisting of cell membranes cell walls spore coats and eps provide protection against chlorine lechevallier cawthon et al 1988 cloete 2003 fig 2 shows four kinds of cellular permeability barriers against chlorine to provide chlorine resistance chlorine consuming substances refer to lipids amino acids in cell membranes and eps covering cells lechevallier cawthon et al 1988 cloete 2003 furuhata ishizaki et al 2014 wang wu et al 2019b the above resistant effects are determined by genes and influenced by environmental factors in addition the intracellular molecular reaction induced by chlorine is considered as a possible explanation for the enhanced chlorine resistance of bacteria studies have shown that chlorine disinfection induces the expression of many functional genes including oxidative stress dna repair efflux pump antioxidant enzyme secretion pore protein regulation and cell wall repair demple 1996 small chang et al 2007 kim park et al 2009 holder berry et al 2013 karumathil yin et al 2014 hou yang et al 2019 however it is still difficult to answer whether the protective function of these intracellular molecular reactions is stronger than the cellular permeability barriers or chlorine consuming substances 3 1 intrinsic chlorine resistance determined by genes intrinsic resistance was the resistance determined by genetic materials so different genera of bacteria had different resistance levels and mechanisms the resistance of bacteria against free chlorine was often due to the unique variation of cell structures and protein composition which had barrier function or chlorine consumption capacity cloete 2003 donnermair and blatchley 2003 mir morato et al 1997 considered gram positive bacteria had stronger chlorine resistance because gram positive bacteria had thicker cell walls than gram negative bacteria waxy substances in the cell wall of mycobacterium enhanced hydrophobicity and barrier function so also enhanced chlorine resistance of mycobacterium bacillus relied on intracellular spore to resist disinfectants ortega morente fernandez fuentes et al 2013 another study found that chlorine sensitive bacteria and crb showed differences in the relative percentages of fatty acids in cell walls and cell membranes furuhata ishizaki et al 2014 besides secretion characteristic of extracellular polymers eps was also considered to be related to chlorine resistance of bacteria the amount components and molecular weight of eps of different microorganisms were different and bacteria that secrete more eps had stronger chlorine resistance wang wu et al 2019b early study also showed that the permeation barrier composed of eps was related to the chlorine resistance hoyle and costerton 1991 in the molecular mechanism of chlorine resistance the effects of chlorine on a few species such as e coli pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter baumannii were reported but the differences of molecular mechanism of chlorine resistance among different bacteria are still unclear demple 1996 karumathil yin et al 2014 jin liu et al 2020 3 2 apparent chlorine resistance affected by environmental factors intrinsic resistance determined by genes cannot explain the change in chlorine resistance of a specific strain during different growth conditions environmental factors affect the apparent chlorine resistance of microorganisms in two ways one is to affect the composition and permeability of bacterial cell membranes and the other is to regulate eps secretion characteristics and agglomeration behavior of bacteria le dantec et al 2002b found that the change of culture medium type affected the composition of cell membranes thus changing the chlorine resistance mycobacteria grown in water had greater resistance than those grown in culture medium which may be related to changes of lipids in cells le dantec et al 2002b eps itself was also an important chlorine resistance barrier for bacteria and the secretion characteristics of eps were affected by ph temperature carbon sources nitrogen sources and other conditions more yadav et al 2014 4 evaluating methods of chlorine resistance and identification of chlorine resistant bacteria in the current research there are many different methods used to evaluate chlorine resistance and to identify crb as shown in table 2 the evaluating methods can be classified according to evaluation indexes and reference strains fig 3 shows schematic diagram of the indexes for chlorine resistance evaluation compared with other evaluating methods of chlorine resistance logarithmic removal rate is a more feasible evaluation index as a recommended standard method evaluating chlorine resistance by logarithmic removal rate makes comparison of chlorine resistance among different studies more easily and avoids some intrinsic disadvantages of other methods application of ct value or mic need a large amount of experimental operations which are not suitable for comparison of a large number of strains but these two indexes can be compared among studies easily furthermore neither ct value nor mic can reflect inactivation effect of typical chlorine concentrations in water treatment on different bacteria for bacteria that need special nutrition conditions or whose growth rate is obviously inconsistent the test results of inhibition zone method are often inaccurate table 3 lists the practical application cases of crb identification there are many differences in the reference strains evaluation indexes disinfection methods and disinfection time used in different studies so the identification standards of crb are also very different up to now there is no widely accepted identification method of crb leading to the inconvenience in the comparison of chlorine resistance among different studies 5 typical species sources and chlorine resistance of chlorine resistant bacteria some studies have revealed the changes of microbial community structure in actual water samples before and after chlorine disinfection providing us with the possibility to study crb in the process of wastewater treatment in this review we defined the microorganisms whose relative abundance increases by 200 after disinfection as crb with increased relative abundance analyzed the relevant results in several studies and counted the phylum and genera of those crb as shown in fig 4 authors of these studies did not isolate bacteria with increased abundance and not systematically evaluate the chlorine resistance of these bacteria neither among the crb with increased relative abundance 14 strains were proteobacteria 5 strains were firmicutes and 2 strains were actinobacteria the genera of crb with the highest frequency of occurrence are pseudomonas and bacillus some researchers also evaluated the chlorine resistance of strains isolated by themselves or other researchers a total of 365 articles were searched from the web of science core collection with chlorine resistant bacteria as topic highly relevant researches are selected from these articles and other researches mentioned in these articles are also supplemented table 4 comprehensively summarizes the results of relevant researches the phylum genera sources and chlorine resistance of isolated crb fig 5 shows the distribution of genera of typical isolated crb among the typical isolated crb 21 strains were proteobacteria 9 strains were firmicutes and 14 strains were actinobacteria the genera of isolated crb with the highest frequency of occurrence were mycobacterium bacillus legionella pseudomonas and sphingomonas the genera with the highest frequency of isolated and detected crb were different from fig 4 because researches pay more attention to the chlorine resistance of pathogenic bacteria and rarely isolate non pathogenic crb although some researchers considered gram positive bacteria had stronger chlorine resistance mir morato et al 1997 but most isolated crb in fig 3 were gram negative bacteria which could not be explained by above theory except bacillus staphylococcus clostridium and enterococcus some articles disclosed the genbank accession numbers of chlorine resistant strains the gene sequence information of these strains and escherichia coli was used to establish the neighborhood joining n j evolutionary tree as shown in fig 6 according to fig 6 chlorine resistant bacteria are widely distributed in many phylum and have no similar genetic relationship the genetic difference between e coli non chlorine resistant bacteria and crb is not greater than that between crb which indicates that there is no long term selective pressure related to chlorine resistance in nature in addition there are doubts about whether some isolated microorganisms can be called crb in the above mentioned researches because they used different evaluating methods for chlorine resistance it is difficult to compare the chlorine resistance of these microorganisms and rank their chlorine resistance ability therefore in order to systematically compare the chlorine resistance of different bacterial strains in different studies it is necessary to propose a recommended evaluating method for chlorine resistance and a scientific quantitative definition for crb in this paper genus is taken as the basic unit to study crb many other researchers also cite the reported genera of crb to explain the differences of community structure between the samples before and after chlorine disinfection zhou ahmad et al 2020 but how much chlorine resistance depends on bacterial genus is still unclear if inter genus difference in chlorine resistance is greater than the inter species difference taking genus as the basic research unit of crb is scientific at present there is a lack of rapid detection technology for crb these facts make it difficult to know the abundance of crb in the environment if researchers can take genus as the basic research unit it is feasible to evaluate the environmental abundance of crb however many studies showed that the chlorine resistance of bacteria was different among species strains and even generations le dantec duguet et al 2002 zyara torvinen et al 2016 jia jia et al 2020 in a study on chlorine resistance of e coli the mic range of free chlorine from the most sensitive strain to the most resistant strain was 0 04 0 2 mg l zyara torvinen et al 2016 while there was also some evidences to support the opposite view khan beattie et al 2016 isolated 87 strains of bacteria of 22 genera from drinking water and evaluated the chlorine resistance of these bacteria isolated bacteria were divided into three grades according to their chlorine resistance and almost each genus was in a single grade khan beattie et al 2016 this result suggested that the difference of chlorine resistance at species level might be less than that at genus level undoubtedly some studies found that some specific species had abnormal chlorine resistance bolton dodd et al 1988 found that one staphylococcus strain was 100 times more resistant to chlorine than a natural strain whether this difference was a special case or a common phenomenon was still unclear the existing research results using different methods are difficult to compare under the same standard so it is difficult to give the general range of chlorine resistance of a certain genus therefore it proves the necessity to propose a recommended evaluating method for crb 6 recommended evaluation and identification methods of chlorine resistant bacteria in view of the lack of standard evaluating methods as mentioned above we suggest using logarithmic removal rate as an index and e coli as a reference other evaluating methods or evaluation indexes can provide additional information on crb to supplement the recommended evaluating method the reason why logarithmic inactivation rate is the appropriate index of recommended evaluating method is analyzed in section 4 as reference bacterial strains e coli is a kind of typical chlorine sensitive bacteria and readily available so far e coli is generally considered to have weak chlorine resistance compared with other genera though there were small differences among different e coli species zyara torvinen et al 2016 evaluating chlorine resistance of e coli gives a benchmark of comparison in experiments to identify crb more researches in the future can provide a common range of chlorine resistance of e coli and the common range of chlorine resistance of e coli is conducive to the quality control of relevant experiments according to the information above we propose a kind of recommended standard method to evaluate chlorine resistance and to grade the crb as following hydraulic retention time of disinfection tank in wwtp is within the range of 0 5 1 0 h and the common disinfection time ranges from 1 min to 60 min in evaluating experiments of crb in current experimental research scoaris dde colacite et al 2008 roy and ghosh 2017 shekhawat kulshreshtha et al 2020 we choose 30 min as the standard disinfection time in the recommended evaluating method the conventional chlorine dosage used by who to evaluate the chlorine resistance of pathogenic bacteria is 0 5 mg l who 2011 the common chlorine concentration for disinfection ranged from 0 5 to 2 mg l in evaluating experiments of crb scoaris dde colacite et al 2008 roy and ghosh 2017 shekhawat kulshreshtha et al 2020 corinne reported that the ct value to achieve 99 9 inactivation of mycobacterium strain can reach 135 mg min l le dantec et al 2002b but the upper limit of the ct value corresponding to the concentration of 2 mg l for 30 min was only 60 mg min l which could not reflect the chlorine resistance of strong crb a higher concentration such as 5 mg l is needed the list of crb varies with different concentrations of chlorine distinguishing crb in specific concentration of chlorine can help to analyze the changes of dominant genera in residual bacteria after chlorine disinfection with different concentrations in terms of removal rate 1 log reduction and 3 log reduction of microorganism correspond to majority inactivation and complete inactivation respectively in addition it is necessary to unify the initial concentration of bacteria initial concentration of bacteria affects the maximum inactivation rate the recommended initial bacterial concentration is 107 108 cfu ml it should be noted that the chlorine concentration level in the experiment cannot be considered completely equal to the actual chlorine dosage in the water treatment sterile oxidant demand free odf deionized water buffered with phosphate buffered saline pbs is used as a solvent for the bacterial suspension ofori maddila et al 2018 therefore at the same concentration the inactivation rate in the experiment is higher than that in actual conditions water with chemicals which can react with chlorine to sum up present researches we used the results of experiments which conform to the evaluating conditions mentioned above to draw a grading picture of the reported crb in literatures as shown in fig 7 we divided fig 7 into three zones including high chlorine resistance zone removal rates 1 log low chlorine resistance zone removal rates 3 log and 1 log no chlorine resistance zone removal rates 3 log the microorganisms with low or high chlorine resistance at 0 5 2 and 5 mg l free chlorine were defined as crb0 5 crb2 and crb5 pseudomonas has high resistance to 0 5 mg l chlorine but no resistance to 5 mg l chlorine so it is a kind of crb0 5 but not crb5 according to the recommended evaluating method isolated enterococcus and stenotrophomonas involved in table 4 cannot be considered as strains with strong chlorine resistance although the microorganisms on the right side of high chlorine resistance zone in fig 7 are much more chlorine resistant than those on the left side the ones on the right side may not be the most critical crb because under the condition of low concentration chlorine the selection pressure is small and they have no obvious competitive advantage therefore crb under the condition of low chlorine concentration should also receive attention the recommended standard method covers multiple reference disinfection concentrations and can be used to analyze the list of crb at typical chlorine concentrations in water treatment other evaluating methods could also be used to supplement the recommended standard method when evaluating specific microorganisms researchers can also use ct values or mic to provide more information about these bacteria the recommended standard method is proposed in the hope that the subsequent studies include recommended disinfection conditions and provide possibility for comparison among different studies the recommended standard method is also helpful to study the mechanism of chlorine resistance more researches based on the recommended standard method will provide the common chlorine resistance range of each bacterial genus analysis of cell structure and secretion characteristics of abnormal strains will deepen the understanding of chlorine resistance it is worth noting that chlorine disinfection may cause residual bacteria to enter viable but noncuturable vbnc state chen li et al 2018 olszewska and bialobrzewski 2019 ye lin et al 2020 vbnc state may make some crb unable to be separated from water samples and be ignored the isolation and culture of these crb is an important research direction 7 conclusions in this review we summarized the risks of crb and highlighted the microbial growth risks the critical assessment for existing evaluating methods for chlorine resistance provided guidance for systematic study on crb however there was still no widely accepted method to evaluate chlorine resistance therefore a recommended evaluating method for chlorine resistance and a quantitative definition of crb was proposed in this review in addition we summarized the genera sources and chlorine resistance of the typical isolated crb strains there are several key points in this review as follows 1 chlorine disinfection cannot completely control the risks of crb such as risks of pathogenicity antibiotic resistance and microbial growth the microbial growth risks of crb in water treatment and reclamation systems attracted more and more attention a possible explanation of microbial growth risks was that eps protected crb and caused more severe fouling at the same time the microbial growth risks of crb and its control will become a promising research field in the future 2 the genera of isolated crb with the highest frequency of occurrence were mycobacterium bacillus legionella pseudomonas and sphingomonas which were all pathogenic or opportunistic pathogenic bacteria the non pathogenic crb were neglected to some extent these isolated crb mainly came from drinking water 3 a recommended evaluating method using logarithmic removal rate as an index and e coli as a reference strain was proposed the appropriate disinfection conditions were 0 5 2 5 mg l free chlorine for 30 min under recommended disinfection conditions non majority inactivation 1 log reduction and non complete inactivation 3 log reduction are respectively taken as quantitative definitions of high chlorine resistance bacteria and low chlorine resistance bacteria the recommended standard method provided a comparison benchmark for chlorine resistance evaluation which had great potential for analyzing chlorine resistance at specific species level declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could
