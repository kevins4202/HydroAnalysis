13065,to overcome the shortcomings of separation and recovery difficulties of powdered catalysts in practical applications a novel flexible catalyst film 2d wo3 ca was formed by combining 2d wo3 with cellulose acetate ca and successfully applied in degrading organic pollutants in water under real solar irradiation the structure morphology and optical properties of the new photocatalytic film were characterized by using x ray diffraction scanning electron microscope and uv vis diffuse reflectance spectra technology respectively the results showed that the absorption edges of 2d wo3 ca film shifted remarkably to the longer wavelength compared with 2d wo3 indicating that 2d wo3 ca film could broaden the spectral response range furthermore the photocatalytic capacity of the film was explored by degrading methylene blue mb in aquatic solution under real sunlight in the continuous baffled photo reactor cbpr the film exhibited excellent degrading properties with an average removal rate of 85 for mb and the processing load corresponded to 478 13 mg m2 d the film still had high activity and flexibility after treating wastewater for seven consecutive days therefore the new 2d wo3 ca film is promising in actual dye wastewater treatment based on the above analysis mb degradation mechanism in the photocatalytic system with 2d wo3 ca film was proposed finally keywords 2d wo3 ca film continuous baffled photo reactor photocatalytic performance refractory pollutant solar irradiation 1 introduction as pollution in source water intensifies and human population increases rapidly a large number of organic pollutants e g personal care products and pharmaceuticals have been frequently detected in wastewater in the past decades 1 2 which pose serious threats to the aquatic organisms 3 6 some organic matters e g salicylic acid and phenol can be easily degraded by traditional biological wastewater treatment 7 8 however some refractory organic pollutants such as dyes antibiotics and organic pesticides cannot be easily degraded by traditional biological treatment due to their stable molecular structures 9 10 in term of organic dye contaminants it is essential to remove them from water sources due to their toxic effects on human health animals and plants 11 adsorption fenton oxidation and photocatalysis were proven for effective removal of aqueous dyes 12 however adsorption and fenton oxidation have various shortcomings that limit further applications in wastewater treatments adsorption methods typically have low adsorption capacity and poor recovery capacity and pollutants are not decomposed and eliminated during the disposal process 13 fenton systems typically operate in acidic environments which limits the range of applications 14 in contrast photocatalysis is regarded as an effective way to degrade persistent organic matters in wastewater due to its highly efficiency low cost and being environmentally friendly 15 17 therefore photocatalysis could be an attractive alternative conventional method for organic pollutant removal photocatalysis is one of most efficient advanced oxidation processes in which powerful oxidative hydroxyl radicals oh are generated at ambient temperature 18 19 oh can non selectively degrade persistent organic matters into less toxic compounds 20 the most critical factor in photocatalytic reaction is the high performance photocatalyst 21 among all catalysts titanium dioxide tio2 is the most studied photocatalyst due to its low cost chemical corrosion stability and non toxicity 22 24 however tio2 is active only in ultraviolet light which could be attributed to its wide band gap of 3 2 ev 25 ultraviolet light accounts for about 3 5 of the total solar energy 26 and thus the catalysts in the visible light have attracted many researchers 27 tungsten trioxide wo3 as a transition metal oxide has been widely applied in the degradation of organic pollutants 28 different from the traditional tio2 photocatalytic materials wo3 semiconductor photocatalyst has a smaller band gap 2 6 ev and stronger visible light absorption about 12 29 thus wo3 semiconductor photocatalyst has the potential of practical applications however wo3 exists as the form of nano powder in the semiconductor photocatalyst 30 unfortunately nano wo3 powders are not ideal for practical water treatment because they are difficult to recover and reuse after photocatalytic treatment and the nano powders are difficult to remove from water which is easy to cause secondary contamination 31 compared with powder photocatalysts flexible or soft photocatalysts have many advantages such as convenient separation and operation 32 33 there are many methods to prepare flexible photocatalysts including spinning scraping dip coating and so on 34 36 immobilizing semiconductor materials on polymer carriers is the most widely used method 37 polyvinyl alcohol nylon 6 and polyacrylonitrile fibers are commonly used as polymer carriers 38 40 however these polymer carriers have various shortcomings 41 polyvinyl alcohol often results in adverse effects on the water environment and organisms 42 and nylon 6 and polyacrylonitrile fibers have poor hygroscopicity 43 among all polymers cellulose acetate is considered of industrial significance and has some outstanding advantages such as low cost biodegradability good mechanical properties non toxicity and high stability to most organic solvents 44 hence the combination of wo3 and cellulose acetate to degrade organic pollutants has better prospects in practical applications yet it remains unanswered whether the performance of this composite in the continuous flow reactor flexible catalysts have been widely used for the degradation of organic pollutants usually in eddy currents constant agitation or circulating flows 45 46 however the eddy currents or circulating flows are inconsistent with the continuous flow in the actual wastewater treatment process 47 moreover most studies of photocatalytic degradation are in simulated sunlight 48 and little attention has been paid to real sunlight therefore it is imperative to investigate flexible photocatalysts for degrading organic pollutants in continuous flow conditions in real sunlight in this study two dimensional 2d wo3 were prepared in bsa bovine serum albumin by the liquid exfoliation method and loaded on a flexible cellulose acetate ca film the new 2d wo3 ca film was examined in term of photocatalytic activity stability and reusability using the 2d wo3 ca film photocatalytic process was developed to degrade methylene blue mb in a continuous baffled photo reactor cbpr in real solar light such a green treatment approach may lead to the design of future technologies for removing organic contaminants from wastewater 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals wo3 bsa and ca were purchased from aladdin tai an china mb acetone c3h6o and hydrochloric acid hcl were obtained from tianjin yongda chemical reagent co ltd tianjin china ultrapure water was produced by a milli q water purification system 18 2 mÏ‰ cm millipore usa all other chemicals were above analytical grade and purchased from sinopharm chemical reagent co ltd shanghai china 2 2 preparation of wo3 nanosheets the wo3 nanosheets 2d wo3 were obtained by ultrasonic assisted exfoliation in bsa solution 49 bsa 48 mg was dissolved in 40 ml ultrapure water followed by adjusting the ph below 4 with hcl solution 1 mol wo3 nanoparticles 200 mg were added to the bsa solution then the mixed solution was sonicated for 48 h in a sonicator kq5200de kunshan ultrasonic instrument co ltd with an output power of 480 w the non exfoliated bulk wo3 was removed from the obtained dispersion solution by centrifugation at 2000 rpm for 20 min then the supernatant was sonicated for 10 min to disperse evenly finally the above solution was centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 30 min to obtain 2d wo3 and then 2d wo3 was freeze dried for further use 2 3 preparation of 2d wo3 ca composite films the composite films 2 cm 2 cm were obtained by the scraper method 44 first 2d wo3 was dispersed in 30 ml acetone solution under constant stirring and ca 2 g was added to the mixed solution then the above solution was sonicated for 2 h to obtain a homogeneous 2d wo3 ca dispersion solution finally the dispersion solution was poured on a clean glass plate and quickly dispersed to a homogeneous thickness by a spatula the 2d wo3 ca film could be easily obtained from the glass plate after acetone evaporation different ratios of 2d wo3 ca films were prepared by controlling the amount of 2d wo3 added in this study 2d wo3 ca film 0 1 2d wo3 ca film 0 3 and 2d wo3 ca film 0 5 were obtained by adding 0 1 0 3 and 0 5 g 2d wo3 respectively the composite film used in the reactor was prepared by the dip coating method 50 the detailed methods for preparation adsorption and photocatalytic mb degradation test are given in the supporting information 2 4 characterization the morphology of the obtained wo3 2d wo3 ca film and 2d wo3 ca film was characterized with a scanning electron microscopy sem sigma 300 sem japan with the scanning voltage of 5 kv the atomic force microscopy afm images of 2d wo3 samples were taken with an afm bruker dimension edge germany in scan analyst mode the x ray diffraction xrd patterns of wo3 2d wo3 ca film and 2d wo3 ca film were obtained from an x ray diffractometer x pert pro mpd netherlands and the diffraction angle ranged from 10 to 80 the x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps spectrum of wo3 2d wo3 and 2d wo3 ca film was obtained from an electron spectrometer thermo kalpha uk the uv vis diffuse reflectance spectra were tested using a uv 2450 with an integrating sphere isr 240 japan the fourier transform infrared ftir spectrum of wo3 2d wo3 ca film and 2d wo3 ca film was recorded with a spectrometer nicolet is 10 usa the bet of 2d wo3 and 2d wo3 ca film were tested by specific surface area and porosity analyzer 3h 2000 ps1 beishide instrument technology co ltd 2 5 design of continuous baffled photo reactor the schematic graph of the continuous baffled photo reactor cbpr was shown in fig 1 the reactor was built of perspex sheet and its total working volume was 1 5 l baffles were used to divide the reactor into compartments of uniform size wastewater flowed forward along the baffles from one compartment to the next the total area of the 2d wo3 ca film was 400 cm2 and bottom of in the cbpr the cbpr was put outdoors under the irradiation of sunlight whose intensity was measured simultaneously by a luxmeter gm1030 jumaoyuan technology co ltd the sunlight intensity was measured by a luxmeter during the experiments at hourly intervals the influent was continuously driven by a peristaltic pump with a hydraulic retention time of 8 h the photocatalytic performance of cbpr was calculated by the following formula 1 r c 0 c t c 0 100 where c0 5 mg l is the initial mb concentration of the influent ct mg l is the mb concentration of the effluent and r is the removal ratio 3 results and discussion 3 1 morphological characteristics fig 2 presented the sem images of the wo3 a 2d wo3 b ca film c and 2d wo3 ca film d and its cross section e and f as shown in fig 2a the wo3 particles clustered tightly together with the size range of 50 100 nm the 2d wo3 nanosheets were successfully exfoliated from the wo3 particles fig 2b it was reported that wo3 particles reflected intense electrostatic bonding with nh2 group on bsa surface when the ph was 4 in the reaction system 49 wo3 fell off from the wo3 particles surface and formed free 2d wo3 nanosheets moreover the results of the afm detection for the prepared 2d wo3 further indicated that the thickness of the obtained 2d wo3 was 2 8 nm shown in fig s1 fig 2c showed that a smooth and imperforate ca film was obtained from fig 2d it could be observed that the 2d wo3 nanosheets were scattered homogeneously on the ca film indicating a successful preparation of the 2d wo3 ca film as shown in table s1 the specific surface area of 2d wo3 ca film decreased compared with 2d wo3 which was acceptable since 2d wo3 ca film did not face the challenge of recycling ca film was hyaline and the transmittance of composite film gradually deteriorated with the increase of 2d wo3 content as shown in fig s2 as compared to the original ca film surface fig 2c the surface of the 2d wo3 ca film was rougher the thickness of the film was approximately 19 Î¼m which could be proved by the cross sectional view of the film fig 2e a large number of pores could be clearly observed in the 2d wo3 ca composite film fig 2f which could form a porous interconnected network structure 44 the rough surface and the porous structure of the 2d wo3 ca film may be beneficial to improve the adsorption capacity of photons and pollutants in photocatalysis process 43 the xrd patterns of the wo3 2d wo3 ca film and 2d wo3 ca film were shown in fig 3 for the 2d wo3 the diffraction peaks at 23 1 23 6 24 4 26 6 and 34 1 were assigned to the 002 020 200 120 and 202 planes of the monoclinic wo3 jcpds card no 083 0950 respectively 51 compared to the diffraction peaks of the wo3 nanoparticles the diffraction peaks of the 2d wo3 did not change and corresponded well to monoclinic wo3 crystal structure this result demonstrated that liquid phase exfoliation did not affect the crystal structure of the 2d wo3 in addition other diffraction peaks were not observed in the 2d wo3 which indicated its high purity for the ca film there was only one broad diffraction peak from 15 to 35 fig 3 compared to the diffraction peak intensity of the crystal planes 020 200 202 the diffraction peak intensity of the crystal planes was significantly weaker which could be attributed to the amorphous structure of ca film it could be observed from the xrd pattern of the 2d wo3 ca film sample that the diffraction peak intensity of the 020 200 202 crystal planes were significantly weaker than those of the 2d wo3 the broad diffraction peaks of the ca film between 15 and 35 were also reflected in the xrd pattern of the 2d wo3 ca film 44 the xrd resulted demonstrated the 2d wo3 and ca integrated well in the 2d wo3 ca film the ftir spectra of the wo3 2d wo3 ca film and 2d wo3 ca film were presented in fig 4a the spectra of the as exfoliated 2d wo3 did not change much compared with wo3 the broad peak at 500 1000 cm 1 in the curves of the wo3 and 2d wo3 could be attributed to the stretching vibration of the wow bond 52 in addition the peak at 1385 cm 1 of the 2d wo3 curve might be attributed to the cn bond stretching vibration from bsa 49 for the ca film the main characteristic peaks were located at 1732 cm 1 1367 cm 1 1213 cm 1 and 1033 cm 1 which could be caused by the stretching vibrations of co acetyl methyl acetyl ester and co respectively 53 the peak at 3500 cm 1 was derived from the oh stretching of the hydroxyl group in the ca film 54 the ftir spectra of the 2d wo3 ca film reflected the typical peaks of the 2d wo3 and ca film moreover in the 2d wo3 ca film sample the wider peak of oh bond of the hydroxyl group and the narrower peak of w o w bond indicated the interaction between the 2d wo3 and ca film 55 indicating the homogeneous dispersion of 2d wo3 in the acetone solution these ftir results further verified the successful integration of the 2d wo3 and ca in 2d wo3 ca film the uv vis absorption spectra of the 2d wo3 and 2d wo3 ca film were shown in fig 4b the absorption of the 2d wo3 ca film was significantly enhanced in the visible light and near infrared range which may be attributed to the light scattering in the porous structures of the ca film 44 in addition the absorption edge of the 2d wo3 ca film shifted to a longer wavelength compared with 2d wo3 which can expand the spectral response range 56 compared to wo3 the absorption value of the 2d wo3 did not change significantly in the visible light range in fig s3 the bandgap energy calculated by tauc equation were 2 47 ev for both the 2d wo3 and wo3 the inset image in fig s3 which demonstrated that the band gap energy of the as exfoliated 2d wo3 did not change uv vis results suggested that the optical properties of the 2d wo3 ca film was excellent the surface chemical states of the samples were studied by xps technology the high resolution xps spectra of the wo3 2d wo3 and 2d wo3 ca film were shown in fig 5 fig 5a exhibits the o 1 s spectra of the wo3 and 2d wo3 the strong characteristic peaks at 530 1 ev and 529 8 ev corresponded to lattice oxygen of wo band in the wo3 and 2d wo3 respectively it could be observed that the binding energy of o 1 s of the 2d wo3 shifted to a lower energy compared to the wo3 which was related to the more adsorbed oxygen species on the surface of 2d wo3 57 as shown in fig 5b the characteristic peaks at 35 4 ev and 37 6 ev were ascribed to w 4f7 2 and w 4f5 2 of w6 for the wo3 respectively 58 for the 2d wo3 the characteristic peaks at 35 0 ev and 37 7 ev were from w 4f7 2 and w 4f5 2 of w5 59 the appearance of w5 was attributed to the unsaturated wo bond on the as exfoliated 2d wo3 surface which further confirmed the successful preparation of the 2d wo3 49 fig 5c presented the o 1 s spectra of the 2d wo3 and 2d wo3 ca film the characteristic peak at 531 1 ev of the 2d wo3 ca film was related to the binding energy of lattice oxygen in the film 60 which was a little higher than 2d wo3 529 8 ev thus the binding energy of lattice oxygen shifted to higher energy after formation of the 2d wo3 ca film the o 1 s binding energy of 2d wo3 in the 2d wo3 ca film shifted to higher energy due to the decrease of electron density in 2d wo3 the w 4f spectra analysis of the 2d wo3 and 2d wo3 ca film was shown in fig 5d for the 2d wo3 ca film the peak 35 0 ev of w 4f7 2 did not shift while the peak 37 1 ev of w 4f5 2 shifted to low energy by 0 1 ev compared with the 2d wo3 the change in the binding energy reflected interaction between the 2d wo3 and ca in the 2d wo3 ca film 61 again indicating that the 2d wo3 was well combined with ca 3 2 photocatalytic performance evaluations as shown in fig s4 the adsorption of mb by the ca film 2d wo3 ca film 0 1 2d wo3 ca film 0 3 2d wo3 ca film 0 5 mainly occurred in the first 30 min and subsequently reached an adsorption equilibrium within 60 min the 2d wo3 ca film exhibited the highest adsorption capacity for mb and the maximum adsorption was about 30 using the 2d wo3 ca film 0 5 higher adsorption capacity was observed in cases of using the 2d wo3 ca film than the ca film due to porous structure of the film which improved the adsorption of mb 62 furthermore the adsorption capacities of mb by 2d wo3 ca film increased as the amount of 2d wo3 increased in the 2d wo3 ca film the photocatalytic perofmances of the 2d wo3 ca film with different loading were evaluated by degrading mb in simulated sunlight fig 6a the pure ca film displayed very weak photocatalytic activity in simulated sunlight due to photolysis the mb removal efficiency of the 2d wo3 ca film was much superior to the ca film with the removal efficiency and photocatalytic activity increasing with the content of 2d wo3 in the film when the 2d wo3 content was 0 5 g in the film 2d wo3 ca film 0 5 97 4 removal of mb was achieved in 180 min which can be attributed to the film s optimal light absorption scattering properties 44 however during the photo catalytic experiments the 2d wo3 ca film 0 5 showed more fragile mechanical properties and its surface shed the catalyst the flexibility of 2d wo3 ca film decreased and its integrity was damaged with the increase of 2d wo3 content as shown in fig s5 this might be caused by the excessive catalysts affecting the integrity of the film therefore from practical considerations the 2d wo3 ca film 0 3 which photo degraded 90 8 mb in 180 min can be chosen as the optimum film for later photocatalytic experiments the rate constant k min 1 is calculated by the first order equation 46 as shown in fig 6b 2 ln c 0 c k t where c0 is the initial concentration of mb and c is the concentration of the solution at time t during the photodegradation of mb the maximum values of the first order reaction rate constants k was 1 79 10 2 min 1 corresponding to the 2d wo3 ca film 0 5 in comparison with another recently related photocatalyst the photocatalytic performance of 2d wo3 ca film in the degradation of mb was also comparable and performed in table s2 in addition the stability and reusability of the photocatalyst were important in practical applications 63 in order to further study the stability the composite film was placed in aqueous solution for 30 min ultrasonic treatment as shown in fig s6 2d wo3 nano particles were found to fall off from the surface of the 2d wo3 ca film 0 5 while no 2d wo3 nano particles fell off from the surface of the 2d wo3 ca film 0 3 under the same ultrasonic treatment these results suggested that excessive 2d wo3 in the film might lead to fragileness of the film and 2d wo3 ca film 0 3 possessed an excellent stability in aqueous solution the reusability of the 2d wo3 ca film 0 3 was studied based on recycling tests under simulated sunlight fig 6c in the recycling tests the 2d wo3 ca film 0 3 was recovered and cleaned from the previous experiment and then directly used in the next experiment run without any further processing the mb removal rate 90 did not significantly decrease after 5 times recycle use which demonstrated that the 2d wo3 ca film 0 3 had a high reusability and stability 3 3 continuous baffled photo reactor performance the photocatalytic degradation experiment was carried out to investigate the performance of the prepared 2d wo3 ca film 0 3 in the cbpr under the irradiation of real solar light fig 7 as shown in fig 7a the maximum removal rate of mb was 38 for the control i e blank without catalyst which was possibly resulted from self photodegradation of mb under solar light 45 the mb removal 80 was the highest after the 7 hour continuous irradiation as shown in the fig 7a the solar light intensity reached a maximum of 1 4 105 lux in the third hour and a minimum of 1 1 104 lux at the end of the operation in the 4 h the degradation rate slope of the line was similar from 4 to 6 h the rate decreased with time in 6 8 h the rate was 0 to further investigate the degradation performance of the 2d wo3 ca film 0 3 on mb the seven day continuous photocatalytic degradation experiments in real sunlight were carried out fig 7b the mb removal in the cbpr was 68 6 the lowest on the first day and 98 5 the highest on the sixth day as shown in fig 7b the mb removal by the 2d wo3 ca film was related to the intensity of sunlight the removal increased with the increase of average sunlight intensity the average removal of mb by the 2d wo3 ca film was 85 in 7 days and the corresponding processing load was 478 13 mg m2 d there was no significant change in the xrd patterns fig s7 before and after degradation indicating an excellent photochemical stability of the prepared 2d wo3 ca film the overall mb photodegradation time in the cbpr was longer than that in aqueous suspension photocatalyst systems due to the lower nanocomposite concentration contained in the 2d wo3 ca film and the weaker light transmittance of the 2d wo3 ca film however this was common for cbpr systems as shown by the nanosized tio2 film 64 moreover the flexible photocatalyst did not face the challenge of recycling nano particles in addition the flexible photocatalytic film was excellent performance in the cbpr which was expected to apply to the actual dye wastewater treatment 3 4 photocatalytic mechanism to investigate the photocatalytic mechanism the active species involved in mb degradation were detected by radical trapping experiments as shown in fig 8a after the addition of p benzoquinone bq the degradation efficiency of 2d wo3 ca film did not change significantly indicating that o 2 radical had little effect however when isopropanol ipa was added into mb solution the degradation efficiency decreased significantly indicating that oh was the main active substance in addition the introduction of methyl alcohol meoh also inhibited the degradation efficiency of mb indicating that h also played a certain role in the degradation process it could be inferred that oh radical and h were active groups involved in the degradation of organic pollutants and oh radical played a more important role in the degradation reaction than h on the basis of the above experimental results the possible photocatalytic mechanism of 2d wo3 ca film under visible light was proposed and this mechanism was illustrated in fig 8b under a certain wavelength Î» 500 nm of light the electrons in the valence band of 2d wo3 would jump over the forbidden band to the conduction band producing h and e in the valence band and conduction band respectively based on the band gap positions and xps valence band fig s8 it could be calculated that the conduction band cb 2d wo3 was 0 67 ev the surface photogenerated h of 2d wo3 could oxidize oh to generate oh which was attributed to the higher valence band 3 14 ev vs nhe potential of 2d wo3 than that of oh oh 2 4 ev vs nhe 65 it should be advertent that the free state oh played an important role in disintegrating mb in the solution compared with oh h could simply oxidize mb adsorbed on the surface which limited the role of h to some extent the mb was further degraded through the strong oxidation of oh h and eventually co2 and h2o were produced except for oh and h o2 were also common reactive oxygen groups it was well known that superoxide anion radicals could only be formed by reacting dissolved oxygen with photogenerated electrons when the conduction band potential of a photocatalyst is more negative than the standard redox potential of o2 o2 0 33 ev vs nhe 66 in this case the conduction band potential 0 67 ev vs nhe of 2d wo3 was more positive than the standard redox potential of o2 o2 hence photogenerated e in the conduction band of 2d wo3 was incapable of reacting with o2 to form o2 in a nutshell oh and h played a higher role than o2 in the degradation process of mb which had been verified in the free radical capture experiment 4 conclusions the 2d wo3 photocatalytic material was successfully synthesized and combined with ca to form a new flexible photocatalytic material 2d wo3 ca film for photodegradation of organic dyes in wastewater furthermore the 2d wo3 ca film was successfully used in the cbpr and displayed potential practical value under real sunlight the results showed that the absorption edge of the 2d wo3 ca film shifted to a longer wavelength compared with 2d wo3 which expanded the spectral response range the 2d wo3 ca film had excellent photodegradation capacity for removing mb in both simulated and real solar light irradiations five cycles of experiments suggested the excellent stability of the 2d wo3 ca film in addition the 2d wo3 ca film in the cbpr exhibits excellent photodegradation performance in sunlight with an average removal of 85 and a corresponding treatment load of 478 13 mg m2 d active species trapping experiments indicated that both the oh and h were the dominant mechanisms responsible for the photodegradation process the 2d wo3 ca film has the advantages of being easier to separate and recycle from wastewater than powder catalyst this study indicates that the newly prepared 2d wo3 ca film has a great application potential in practical wastewater treatment declaration of competing interest

solution was sonicated for 48 h in a sonicator kq5200de kunshan ultrasonic instrument co ltd with an output power of 480 w the non exfoliated bulk wo3 was removed from the obtained dispersion solution by centrifugation at 2000 rpm for 20 min then the supernatant was sonicated for 10 min to disperse evenly finally the above solution was centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 30 min to obtain 2d wo3 and then 2d wo3 was freeze dried for further use 2 3 preparation of 2d wo3 ca composite films the composite films 2 cm 2 cm were obtained by the scraper method 44 first 2d wo3 was dispersed in 30 ml acetone solution under constant stirring and ca 2 g was added to the mixed solution then the above solution was sonicated for 2 h to obtain a homogeneous 2d wo3 ca dispersion solution finally the dispersion solution was poured on a clean glass plate and quickly dispersed to a homogeneous thickness by a spatula the 2d wo3 ca film could be easily obtained from the glass plate after acetone evaporation different ratios of 2d wo3 ca films were prepared by controlling the amount of 2d wo3 added in this study 2d wo3 ca film 0 1 2d wo3 ca film 0 3 and 2d wo3 ca film 0 5 were obtained by adding 0 1 0 3 and 0 5 g 2d wo3 respectively the composite film used in the reactor was prepared by the dip coating method 50 the detailed methods for preparation adsorption and photocatalytic mb degradation test are given in the supporting information 2 4 characterization the morphology of the obtained wo3 2d wo3 ca film and 2d wo3 ca film was characterized with a scanning electron microscopy sem sigma 300 sem japan with the scanning voltage of 5 kv the atomic force microscopy afm images of 2d wo3 samples were taken with an afm bruker dimension edge germany in scan analyst mode the x ray diffraction xrd patterns of wo3 2d wo3 ca film and 2d wo3 ca film were obtained from an x ray diffractometer x pert pro mpd netherlands and the diffraction angle ranged from 10 to 80 the x ray photoelectron

integrating sphere isr 240 japan the fourier transform infrared ftir spectrum of wo3 2d wo3 ca film and 2d wo3 ca film was recorded with a spectrometer nicolet is 10 usa the bet of 2d wo3 and 2d wo3 ca film were tested by specific surface area and porosity analyzer 3h 2000 ps1 beishide instrument technology co ltd 2 5 design of continuous baffled photo reactor the schematic graph of the continuous baffled photo reactor cbpr was shown in fig 1 the reactor was built of perspex sheet and its total working volume was 1 5 l baffles were used to divide the reactor into compartments of uniform size wastewater flowed forward along the baffles from one compartment to the next the total area of the 2d wo3 ca film was 400 cm2 and bottom of in the cbpr the cbpr was put outdoors under the irradiation of sunlight whose intensity was measured simultaneously by a luxmeter gm1030 jumaoyuan technology co ltd the sunlight intensity was measured by a luxmeter during the experiments at hourly intervals the influent was continuously driven by a peristaltic pump with a hydraulic retention time of 8 h the photocatalytic performance of cbpr was calculated by the following formula 1 r c 0 c t c 0 100 where c0 5 mg l is the initial mb concentration of the influent ct mg l is the mb concentration of the effluent and r is the removal ratio 3 results and discussion 3 1 morphological characteristics fig 2 presented the sem images of the wo3 a 2d wo3 b ca film c and 2d wo3 ca film d and its cross section e and f as shown in fig 2a the wo3 particles clustered tightly together with the size range of 50 100 nm the 2d wo3 nanosheets were successfully exfoliated from the wo3 particles fig 2b it was reported that wo3 particles reflected intense electrostatic bonding with nh2 group on bsa surface when the ph was 4 in the reaction system 49 wo3 fell off from the wo3 particles surface and formed free 2d wo3 nanosheets moreover the results of the afm detection for the prepared 2d wo3 further indicated that the thickness of the obtained 2d wo3 was 2 8 nm shown in fig s1 fig 2c showed that a smooth and imperforate ca film was obtained from fig 2d it could be observed that the 2d wo3 nanosheets were scattered homogeneously on the ca film indicating a successful preparation of the 2d wo3 ca film as shown in table s1 the specific surface area of 2d wo3 ca film decreased compared with 2d wo3 which was acceptable since 2d wo3 ca film did not face the challenge of recycling ca film was hyaline and the transmittance of composite film gradually deteriorated with the increase of 2d wo3 content as shown in fig s2 as compared to the original ca film surface fig 2c the surface of the 2d wo3 ca film was rougher the thickness of the film was approximately 19 Î¼m which could be proved by the cross sectional view of the film fig 2e a large number of pores could be clearly observed in the 2d wo3 ca composite film fig 2f which could form a porous interconnected network structure 44 the rough surface and the porous structure of the 2d wo3 ca film may be beneficial to improve the adsorption capacity of photons and pollutants in photocatalysis process 43 the xrd patterns of the wo3 2d wo3 ca film and 2d wo3 ca film were shown in fig 3 for the 2d wo3 the diffraction peaks at 23 1 23 6 24 4 26 6 and 34 1 were assigned to the 002 020 200 120 and 202 planes of the monoclinic wo3 jcpds card no 083 0950 respectively 51 compared to the diffraction peaks of the wo3 nanoparticles the diffraction peaks of the 2d wo3 did not change and corresponded well to monoclinic wo3 crystal structure this result demonstrated that liquid phase exfoliation did not affect the crystal structure of the 2d wo3 in addition other diffraction peaks were not observed in the 2d wo3 which indicated its high purity for the ca film there was only one broad diffraction peak from 15 to 35 fig 3 compared to the diffraction peak intensity of the crystal planes 020 200 202 the diffraction peak intensity of the crystal planes was significantly weaker which could be attributed to the amorphous structure of ca film it could be observed from the xrd pattern of the 2d wo3 ca film sample that the diffraction peak intensity of the 020 200 202 crystal planes were significantly weaker than those of the 2d wo3 the broad diffraction peaks of the ca film between 15 and 35 were also reflected in the xrd pattern of the 2d wo3 ca film 44 the xrd resulted demonstrated the 2d wo3 and ca integrated well in the 2d wo3 ca film the ftir spectra of the wo3 2d wo3 ca film and 2d wo3 ca film were presented in fig 4a the spectra of the as exfoliated 2d wo3 did not change much compared with wo3 the broad peak at 500 1000 cm 1 in the curves of the wo3 and 2d wo3 could be attributed to the stretching vibration of the wow bond 52 in addition the peak at 1385 cm 1 of the 2d wo3 curve might be attributed to the cn bond stretching vibration from bsa 49 for the ca film the main characteristic peaks were located at 1732 cm 1 1367 cm 1 1213 cm 1 and 1033 cm 1 which could be caused by the stretching vibrations of co acetyl methyl acetyl ester and co respectively 53 the peak at 3500 cm 1 was derived from the oh stretching of the hydroxyl group in the ca film 54 the ftir spectra of the 2d wo3 ca film reflected the typical peaks of the 2d wo3 and ca film moreover in the 2d wo3 ca film sample the wider peak of oh bond of the hydroxyl group and the narrower peak of w o w bond indicated the interaction between the 2d wo3 and ca film 55 indicating the homogeneous dispersion of 2d wo3 in the acetone solution these ftir results further verified the successful integration of the 2d wo3 and ca in 2d wo3 ca film the uv vis absorption spectra of the 2d wo3 and 2d wo3 ca film were shown in fig 4b the absorption of the 2d wo3 ca film was significantly enhanced in the visible light and near infrared range which may be attributed to the light scattering in the porous structures of the ca film 44 in addition the absorption edge of the 2d wo3 ca film shifted to a longer wavelength compared with 2d wo3 which can expand the spectral response range 56 compared to wo3 the absorption value of the 2d wo3 did not change significantly in the visible light range in fig s3 the bandgap energy calculated by tauc equation were 2 47 ev for both the 2d wo3 and wo3 the inset image in fig s3 which demonstrated that the band gap energy of the as exfoliated 2d wo3 did not change uv vis results suggested that the optical properties of the 2d wo3 ca film was excellent the surface chemical states of the samples were studied by xps technology the high resolution xps spectra of the wo3 2d wo3 and 2d wo3 ca film were shown in fig 5 fig 5a exhibits the o 1 s spectra of the wo3 and 2d wo3 the strong characteristic peaks at 530 1 ev and 529 8 ev corresponded to lattice oxygen of wo band in the wo3 and 2d wo3 respectively it could be observed that the binding energy of o 1 s of the 2d wo3 shifted to a lower energy compared to the wo3 which was related to the more adsorbed oxygen species on the surface of 2d wo3 57 as shown in fig 5b the characteristic peaks at 35 4 ev and 37 6 ev were ascribed to w 4f7 2 and w 4f5 2 of w6 for the wo3 respectively 58 for the 2d wo3 the characteristic peaks at 35 0 ev and 37 7 ev were from w 4f7 2 and w 4f5 2 of w5 59 the appearance of w5 was attributed to the unsaturated wo bond on the as exfoliated 2d wo3 surface which further confirmed the successful preparation of the 2d wo3 49 fig 5c presented the o 1 s spectra of the 2d wo3 and 2d wo3 ca film the characteristic peak at 531 1 ev of the 2d wo3 ca film was related to the binding energy of lattice oxygen in the film 60 which was a little higher than 2d wo3 529 8 ev thus the binding energy of lattice oxygen shifted to higher energy after formation of the 2d wo3 ca film the o 1 s binding energy of 2d wo3 in the 2d wo3 ca film shifted to higher energy due to the decrease of electron density in 2d wo3 the w 4f spectra analysis of the 2d wo3 and 2d wo3 ca film was shown in fig 5d for the 2d wo3 ca film the peak 35 0 ev of w 4f7 2 did not shift while the peak 37 1 ev of w 4f5 2 shifted to low energy by 0 1 ev compared with the 2d wo3 the change in the binding energy reflected interaction between the 2d wo3 and ca in the 2d wo3 ca film 61 again indicating that the 2d wo3 was well combined with ca 3 2 photocatalytic performance evaluations as shown in fig s4 the adsorption of mb by the ca film 2d wo3 ca film 0 1 2d wo3 ca film 0 3 2d wo3 ca film 0 5 mainly occurred in the first 30 min and subsequently reached an adsorption equilibrium within 60 min the 2d wo3 ca film exhibited the highest adsorption capacity for mb and the maximum adsorption was about 30 using the 2d wo3 ca film 0 5 higher adsorption capacity was observed in cases of using the 2d wo3 ca film than the ca film due to porous structure of the film which improved the adsorption of mb 62 furthermore the adsorption capacities of mb by 2d wo3 ca film increased as the amount of 2d wo3 increased in the 2d wo3 ca film the photocatalytic perofmances of the 2d wo3 ca film with different loading were evaluated by degrading mb in simulated sunlight fig 6a the pure ca film displayed very weak photocatalytic activity in simulated sunlight due to photolysis the mb removal efficiency of the 2d wo3 ca film was much superior to the ca film with the removal efficiency and photocatalytic activity increasing with the content of 2d wo3 in the film when the 2d wo3 content was 0 5 g in the film 2d wo3 ca film 0 5 97 4 removal of mb was achieved in 180 min which can be attributed to the film s optimal light absorption scattering properties 44 however during the photo catalytic experiments the 2d wo3 ca film 0 5 showed more fragile mechanical properties and its surface shed the catalyst the flexibility of 2d wo3 ca film decreased and its integrity was damaged with the increase of 2d wo3 content as shown in fig s5 this might be caused by the excessive catalysts affecting the integrity of the film therefore from practical considerations the 2d wo3 ca film 0 3 which photo degraded 90 8 mb in 180 min can be chosen as the optimum film for later photocatalytic experiments the rate constant k min 1 is calculated by the first order equation 46 as shown in fig 6b 2 ln c 0 c k t where c0 is the initial concentration of mb and c is the concentration of the solution at time t during the photodegradation of mb the maximum values of the first order reaction rate constants k was 1 79 10 2 min 1 corresponding to the 2d wo3 ca film 0 5 in comparison with another recently related photocatalyst the photocatalytic performance of 2d wo3 ca film in the degradation of mb was also comparable and performed in table s2 in addition the stability and reusability of the photocatalyst were important in practical applications 63 in order to further study the stability the composite film was placed in aqueous solution for 30 min ultrasonic treatment as shown in fig s6 2d wo3 nano particles were found to fall off from the surface of the 2d wo3 ca film 0 5 while no 2d wo3 nano particles fell off from the surface of the 2d wo3 ca film 0 3 under the same ultrasonic treatment these results suggested that excessive 2d wo3 in the film might lead to fragileness of the film and 2d wo3 ca film 0 3 possessed an excellent stability in aqueous solution the reusability of the 2d wo3 ca film 0 3 was studied based on recycling tests under simulated sunlight fig 6c in the recycling tests the 2d wo3 ca film 0 3 was recovered and cleaned from the previous experiment and then directly used in the next experiment run without any further processing the mb removal rate 90 did not significantly decrease after 5 times recycle use which demonstrated that the 2d wo3 ca film 0 3 had a high reusability and stability 3 3 continuous baffled photo reactor performance the photocatalytic degradation experiment was carried out to investigate the performance of the prepared 2d wo3 ca film 0 3 in the cbpr under the irradiation of real solar light fig 7 as shown in fig 7a the maximum removal rate of mb was 38 for the control i e blank without catalyst which was possibly resulted from self photodegradation of mb under solar light 45 the mb removal 80 was the highest after the 7 hour continuous irradiation as shown in the fig 7a the solar light intensity reached a maximum of 1 4 105 lux in the third hour and a minimum of 1 1 104 lux at the end of the operation in the 4 h the degradation rate slope of the line was similar from 4 to 6 h the rate decreased with time in 6 8 h the rate was 0 to further investigate the degradation performance of the 2d wo3 ca film 0 3 on mb the seven day continuous photocatalytic degradation experiments in real sunlight were carried out fig 7b the mb removal in the cbpr was 68 6 the lowest on the first day and 98 5 the highest on the sixth day as shown in fig 7b the mb removal by the 2d wo3 ca film was related to the intensity of sunlight the removal increased with the increase of average sunlight intensity the average removal of mb by the 2d wo3 ca film was 85 in 7 days and the corresponding processing load was 478 13 mg m2 d there was no significant change in the xrd patterns fig s7 before and after degradation indicating an excellent photochemical stability of the prepared 2d wo3 ca film the overall mb photodegradation time in the cbpr was longer than that in aqueous suspension photocatalyst systems due to the lower nanocomposite concentration contained in the 2d wo3 ca film and the weaker light transmittance of the 2d wo3 ca film however this was common for cbpr systems as shown by the nanosized tio2 film 64 moreover the flexible photocatalyst did not face the challenge of recycling nano particles in addition the flexible photocatalytic film was excellent performance in the cbpr which was expected to apply to the actual dye wastewater treatment 3 4 photocatalytic mechanism to investigate the photocatalytic mechanism the active species involved in mb degradation were detected by radical trapping experiments as shown in fig 8a after the addition of p benzoquinone bq the degradation efficiency of 2d wo3 ca film did not change significantly indicating that o 2 radical had little effect however when isopropanol ipa was added into mb solution the degradation efficiency decreased significantly indicating that oh was the main active substance in addition the introduction of methyl alcohol meoh also inhibited the degradation efficiency of mb indicating that h also played a certain role in the degradation process it could be inferred that oh radical and h were active groups involved in the degradation of organic pollutants and oh radical played a more important role in the degradation reaction than h on the basis of the above experimental results the possible photocatalytic mechanism of 2d wo3 ca film under visible light was proposed and this mechanism was illustrated in fig 8b under a certain wavelength Î» 500 nm of light the electrons in the valence band of 2d wo3 would jump over the forbidden band to the conduction band producing h and e in the valence band and conduction band respectively based on the band gap positions and xps valence band fig s8 it could be calculated that the conduction band cb 2d wo3 was 0 67 ev the surface photogenerated h of 2d wo3 could oxidize oh to generate oh which was attributed to the higher valence band 3 14 ev vs nhe potential of 2d wo3 than that of oh oh 2 4 ev vs nhe 65 it should be advertent that the free state oh played an important role in disintegrating mb in the solution compared with oh h could simply oxidize mb adsorbed on the surface which limited the role of h to some extent the mb was further degraded through the strong oxidation of oh h and eventually co2 and h2o were produced except for oh and h o2 were also common reactive oxygen groups it was well known that superoxide anion radicals could only be formed by reacting dissolved oxygen with photogenerated electrons when the conduction band potential of a photocatalyst is more negative than the standard redox potential of o2 o2 0 33 ev vs nhe 66 in this case the conduction band potential 0 67 ev vs nhe of 2d wo3 was more positive than the standard redox potential of o2 o2 hence photogenerated e in the conduction band of 2d wo3 was incapable of reacting with o2 to form o2 in a nutshell oh and h played a higher role than o2 in the degradation process of mb which had been verified in the free radical capture experiment 4 conclusions the 2d wo3 photocatalytic material was successfully synthesized and combined with ca to form a new flexible photocatalytic material 2d wo3 ca film for photodegradation of organic dyes in wastewater furthermore the 2d wo3 ca film was successfully used in the cbpr and displayed potential practical value under real sunlight the results showed that the absorption edge of the 2d wo3 ca film shifted to a longer wavelength compared with 2d wo3 which expanded the spectral response range the 2d wo3 ca film had excellent photodegradation capacity for removing mb in both simulated and real solar light irradiations five cycles of experiments suggested the excellent stability of the 2d wo3 ca film in addition the 2d wo3 ca film in the cbpr exhibits excellent photodegradation performance in sunlight with an average removal of 85 and a corresponding treatment load of 478 13 mg m2 d active species trapping experiments indicated that both the oh and h were the dominant mechanisms responsible for the photodegradation process the 2d wo3 ca film has the advantages of being easier to separate and recycle from wastewater than powder catalyst this study indicates that the newly prepared 2d wo3 ca film has a great application potential in practical wastewater treatment declaration of competing interest

13066,a hybrid process of catalytic ceramic membrane integrated with granular activated carbon gac was proposed for removal of organic pollutants in water by coating flat sheet ceramic membrane with co oxide and loading gac into membrane channels the integrated catalytic ceramic membrane module mco gac with peroxymonosulfate pms activation and gac adsorption was successfully prepared the decontamination performance of the mco gac pms system was systematically investigated by using bisphenol a bpa as target pollutant excellent removal efficiency of the mco gac pms system was achieved and hydroxyl radicals oh and sulfate radicals so4 were identified as the major reactive species responsible for the degradation process the mco gac pms system showed strong resistance to humic acid ha and various anions for bpa removal moreover the mco gac pms system exhibited excellent universality for various organic pollutants where mco gac had superior stability and reusability the integrated process provides a proposed strategy for enhancing the remediation of organic pollutants graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords integrated process ceramic membrane granular active carbon peroxymonosulfate activation organic pollutants 1 introduction membrane separation technology as an environmentally friendly and efficient separation technology has the advantages of small footprint easy operation and management and decreasing membrane preparation costs etc 1 3 it has been widely used and developed in the field of drinking water and wastewater treatment and has been highly recognized by the water treatment industry in terms of improving water quality and ensuring water safety 4 5 in recent years with the rapid development of industrial technology and continuous improvement of people s living standards the types and quantities of organic pollutants in the environment have been increasing dramatically especially the emerging organic pollutants such as environmental endocrine disruptors edcs pharmaceuticals and personal care products ppcps and persistent organic pollutants pops posing a serious threat to current water environment 6 8 a considerable portion of organic pollutants characterized by refractory degradation and ecotoxicity can exist in water environment for a long time which lead to potential ecological and environmental risks 9 11 most of them may eventually reach the human body through the food chain accumulation and drinking water posing a serious threat to human health 12 14 nevertheless conventional microfiltration ultrafiltration membranes are difficult to effectively remove the dissolved organic contaminants by sieving and retention because of their large membrane pore size which is still a critical impediment to further large scale application and development of membrane separation technology in the field of water treatment 15 16 in recent years advanced oxidation processes aops have been extensively applied and devoted to organic pollutants elimination in response to the difficulty of effective removal of organic pollutants in membrane separation processes many researchers have conducted extensive researches by combining aops with membrane filtration process liu and co workers fabricated a novel cumn2o4 g c3n4 catalytic ceramic membrane and established a catalytic ozonation membrane reactor to remove micropollutants and mitigate membrane fouling which showed good elimination performance of benzophenone 4 bp 4 and toxic byproduct bromate bro3 17 chen and co workers prepared a polyethersulfone composite ultrafiltration membrane by surface modification and in situ generation of cds nanoparticles for removal of organic pollutants the membranes exhibited high activities in photocatalytic degradation of rhodamine b rhb 18 however in the process of treating actual polluted water photocatalysis is easily affected by water quality conditions and other factors 19 21 and membrane filtration coupled with ozonation and photocatalytic oxidation requires additional equipment such as uv lamps ozone generators and exhaust gas collection devices 22 23 thus increasing the infrastructure investment operational costs and management difficulties which is contrary to the original intention of constructing economic and efficient membrane filtration process for water treatment peroxymonosulfate pms catalytic oxidation as one kind of aops has recently received more attention due to the significant oxidation capacity which shows great potential for the development of effective degradation of organic pollutants in water 24 26 compare with ozonation photocatalytic oxidation and other aops the produced active species from most pms activation processes are dominated by sulfate radical so4 that has advantages of stronger oxidation capacity significantly longer lifetime and wider ph range 27 29 importantly pms activation can be achieved under mild conditions with less additional equipment and energy input which is more advantageous for coupling that with membrane filtration process 30 31 among the approaches of pms activation the heterogeneous catalytic system based on transition metal oxides offers the benefits of low application cost high activation efficiency and facile recovery of catalysts 32 35 therefore if catalyst can be directly loaded onto membranes to fabricate catalytic membrane with the function of pms activation the integrated system not only can avoid separation and recovery operation of catalyst but also achieve efficient degradation of organic pollutants in water treatment compared with polymeric membrane ceramic membrane exhibits higher mechanical strength better chemical and thermal stability and high intensity chemical oxidation tolerance dip coating followed by calcination is a simple and efficient method for loading metal oxide catalyst on the ceramic membrane which has been adopted by many researchers 36 however higher calcination temperature is often required in the preparation process of catalytic ceramic membrane to avoid leaching of metal ions and shedding of catalysts during the filtration process which inhibits reactive activity of catalyst leading to unsatisfactory degradation performance of organic pollutants 37 38 moreover in the membrane filtration process the reaction between the catalyst and pms occurs mainly during the passing of the solution through the membrane with short retention time which may also result in insufficient active species for organic pollutant removal especially in the treatment of refractory organic pollutants granular active carbon gac is a kind of common and efficient adsorption material which can adsorb organic pollutants and small molecule degradation products in water 39 41 inspiring from the large channels structure of tubular and flat sheet membranes loading gac into membrane channels is anticipated to effectively remedy the problem of insufficient degradation ability of catalytic ceramic membrane therefore an integrated system of catalytic ceramic membrane combined with gac was developed and applied in water treatment in this study bisphenol a bpa as the major target contaminant was used to investigate removal performance of organic pollutants and effects of operation parameters and water matrix species on bpa removal efficiency in the integrated system a series of quenching experiments and instrument characterization were conducted to identify the roles of active species in the degradation process of the integrated system finally the stability and reusability of this system were also evaluated by the multi cycle experiments 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials and chemicals granular active carbon gac

experiments flat sheet ceramic membrane m0 employed in this study was fabricated from our laboratory table s1 shows the composition and characteristic parameters of the flat sheet ceramic membrane 2 2 preparation of catalytic membrane and module as shown in fig 1 the catalytic membrane was fabricated via dip coating and calcination approach using the virgin flat sheet ceramic membrane firstly the ceramic membrane with a length of 8 cm was immersed in a 20 g l cobalt nitrate solution for 24 h then the membrane was taken and dried in an oven at 80 c for 5 h finally the obtained membrane was calcined in a muffle furnace at 600 c for 3 h at the static air atmosphere and the heating rate was controlled of 5 c min the submerged catalytic membrane module was fabricated by loading the gac into the membrane channels as shown in fig s1 briefly one end of the catalytic ceramic membrane was sealed with epoxy glue and then 5 g of gac was filled into the membrane channels after that a polyamide mold was mounted on the other end of the catalytic ceramic membrane with a polypropylene punching mesh between them in this module the polypropylene punching mesh 72 mm 7 5 mm with pore size of 1 mm can prevent gac from flowing out of the channels during the operation of filtration the prepared catalytic membrane module had an effective membrane area of 90 cm2 in this study the co coated catalytic ceramic membrane was denoted as mco and the resultant catalytic ceramic membrane filled with gac was denoted as mco gac 2 3 characterization of catalytic membrane the morphologies and

shown in fig 2 from the sem images of m0 fig 2a and b and mco fig 2c and d at low and high magnification the surface of the ceramic membrane was coated by a huge number of tiny particles the eds mapping images of mco were presented in fig s3 suggesting that the coated tiny particles may be cobalt oxide and exhibited a relative uniformity further xps and xrd spectra of mco were obtained in fig 3 as shown in fig 3a the full survey spectrum of mco revealed the presence of co elements with the peak at 780 1 ev co 2p as shown in the inset of fig 3a the two peaks located at around 779 5 ev and 780 6 ev were assigned to the co iii 2p3 2 and co ii 2p3 2 respectively and the accompanying 2p1 2 spin orbit component for co iii and co ii appear at 794 6 ev and 796 3 ev respectively suggesting that co iii and co ii were present in the coated particles on the surface of mco fig 3b shows the crystalline structure of m0 and mco by xrd the reflection peaks of m0 at 25 6 35 1 37 8 43 3 52 5 57 5

3 36 9 44 8 55 6 59 3 and 65 2 corresponding to 111 220 311 400 422 511 and 440 were clearly detected in the xrd pattern of mco which were perfectly indexed to tricobalt tetraoxide co3o4 pdf 78 1970 the above results indicated that the ceramic membrane was successfully coated by co oxide and those tiny particles were principally composed of co3o4 3 2 permeate and pollutant removal performance the effect of filling with gac into the catalytic membrane channels on the membrane permeate property was investigated by measuring the trans membrane pressure tmp of pristine membrane and catalytic membrane at different fluxes as shown in fig 4 the tmp fluctuation of m0 and mco were not apparent and both kept at 2 0 3 0 kpa when the constant flux was increased from 20 to 50 l m2 h lmh within 180 min the average tmp of m0 and mco during the whole process was 2 3 kpa and 2 4 kpa respectively the result indicated that coating the catalyst on the ceramic membrane would not affect the permeate property at the given flux range further a slight intensity increase of the tmp for mco gac was observed as the flux increased from 20 to 50 lmh the average tmp of mco gac at the flux of 20 lmh 35 lmh and 50 lmh were 2 3 kpa 2 7 kpa and 3 0 kpa respectively the result suggested that filling with gac into the catalytic membrane channels had a mild influence on membrane permeate and the influence would be intensified as the increase of operating flux however there is little effect on membrane permeability for loading gac into the catalytic membrane channels due to the relatively low operation flux of submerged membrane filtration system in practical application therefore the integrated process of catalytic ceramic membrane and gac in the membrane channels will show a promising potential in the future the removal performance of different membranes under various filtration systems was evaluated by choosing bisphenol a bpa as the target contaminant as shown in fig 5 bpa adsorption rates by m0 and mco were both less than 5 which were very limited for bpa removal bpa adsorption efficiency of 33 5 and 39 3 was achieved by m0 gac and mco gac respectively owing to loading gac into the membrane channels about 3 0 of bpa was degraded when only pms was present in the system and the bpa degradation rate in the m0 pms system was also negligible 4 indicating that pms hardly degraded bpa directly and the pristine membrane showed almost no catalytic activity for pms activation the bpa removal of the m0 gac pms system was 47 5 which was a little higher than the bpa adsorption of mco gac suggesting that gac has a slight effect on pms activation in contrast over 50 bpa removal was achieved in the mco pms system which was significantly higher than the bpa adsorption of mco the result indicated that co coated on the ceramic membrane could efficiently enhance the performance of pms activation therefore the bpa removal rate of the mco gac pms system was up to 95 under the combined action of pms activation by co oxide and gac adsorption in order to clearly demonstrate the high removal efficiency of the mco gac pms system fig 5 also showed the fading performance of rhodamine b rhb of the permeate water in different systems it is obviously observed that the permeate water of the mco gac pms system was completely colorless while those of other systems were still colored 3 3 influence of experimental conditions the effects of various experimental conditions on elimination efficacy of bpa in the mco pms and mco gac pms systems were examined and shown in fig 6 fig 6a presents the effect of operation flux on bpa removal in the system the removal efficiency of bpa slowly decreased from 99 2 to 89 3 with the operation flux from 25 to 50 lmh in the mco gac pms system similarly bpa removal also had a decline with the increase of operation flux in the mco pms system it can be explained that high operation flux leads to a reduction of both interaction time between pms and catalyst on the membrane and adsorption efficiency of gac in the membrane channels as illustrated in fig 6b the effects of pms dosage from 0 05 to 0 2 mm were examined in the mco pms and mco gac pms systems in the two systems as the pms dosage increased from 0 05 to 0 1 mm their removal efficiency of bpa increased sharply suggesting that more radicals were generated at a higher pms concentration and then leaded to the faster bpa degradation however the bpa removal efficiency had no significant change with the pms concentration further increased from 0 1 to 0 2 mm due to the limited loading of co catalyst and gac in the membrane module as shown in fig 6c the effects of initial bpa concentration on bpa removal were investigated in the mco pms and mco gac pms systems when the bpa concentration increased from 2 to 10 mg l in the mco gac pms system there was a little reduction from 100 to 96 1 for the bpa removal rate as the bpa concentration increased to 15 mg l the bpa removal efficiency obviously dropped to 78 5 in the mco pms system the bpa removal showed a significant decrease with the increase of bpa concentration the removal efficiencies of 71 3 49 5 and 25 5 were achieved at the bpa concentration of 2 10 and 15 mg l respectively the all above results indicated that the mco gac pms system exhibited better performance of bpa removal than the mco pms system especially at the bpa concentration of below 10 mg l 3 4 removal process and reactive species identification fig 7a and b show the bpa removal efficiencies of the feed and permeate water in the mco pms and mco gac pms system respectively it can be observed that the concentration of bpa slightly dropped to 90 in the feed water while the bpa degradation of the permeate water in the mco pms system was close to 50 similarly the bpa degradation efficiency in the feed water was also only 10 in the mco gac pms system but the removal efficiency of bpa in the permeate water was found to 100 the results indicated that the degradation performance of direct contact between bpa and the catalyst on the out surface of the membrane in the feed tank was not significant and bpa removal was mainly occurred during the process of passing through the catalytic membrane module according to fig 5 there was just a slight variation in the bpa removal efficiency between the m0 gac and m0 gac pms systems suggesting gac had a poor activation effect on pms thus showing a little contribution to bpa removal rate for pms activated by gac therefore the removal of bpa in the mco gac pms system was mainly contributed to two routes one was the catalytic oxidation of bpa by pms activation through the catalyst co3o4 coated on the membrane which accounted for 50 the other was the adsorption of gac loaded in the membrane channels which accounted for 50 further the major reactive species of bpa degradation in the mco gac pms system would be investigated in the following part the experiments of radical quenching were conducted to investigate the roles of active species in the oxidation process of the mco gac pms system meoh is a typical scavenger for oh k 9 7 108 m 1 s 1 and so4 k 2 5 107 m 1 s 1 and tba is widely used as a selective radical scavenger for oh with the rate constant of 3 6 7 6 108 m 1 s 1 42 44 co3o4 powder as the same as the catalyst coated on the catalytic membrane in this study was obtained under the same preparation conditions and used in the radical quenching experiments as presented in fig 7c the degradation efficiency of bpa decreased from 82 6 to 64 6 as external tba was added to the co3o4 pms system and the degradation efficiency of bpa decreased to 44 2 when external meoh was added to the system the results of radical quenching experiments indicated that both oh and so4 were the dominant species responsible for bpa degradation in the co3o4 pms system which was the same as in the mco gac pms system additionally the reactive radicals from the mco gac pms system were detected by epr spectroscopy using the spin trapping agent dmpo as shown in fig 7d the characteristic peaks of dmpo oh and dmpo so4 adducts were simultaneously observed further proving that oh and so4 were generated in the mco gac pms system 3 5 effect of water matrix considering the potential application of mco gac in practical water treatment the influence of inorganic ions cl hco3 so4 2 and no3 on bpa removal performance in the mco pms m0 gac pms and mco gac pms system was first investigated as shown in fig 8a the bpa degradation efficiencies were all inhibited with the addition of the inorganic ions in the mco pms system after adding 10 mm of cl hco3 so4 2 and no3 into the system the bpa degradation efficiency decreased to 39 9 29 5 25 2 and 21 0 respectively however fig 8b shows that minor changes of the bpa removal efficiency were observed in the m0 gac pms system the results indicated that adding inorganic ions had more negative effects on the process of catalytic oxidation degradation than that on gac adsorption it can be attributed to the fact that no3 hco3 and cl could be oxidized by oh and so4 of the system to produce lower reactive or more selective reactive species such as no3 co3 cl2 and cl2 24 45 it is worth noting that so4 2 exhibited the most significant inhibition of bpa degradation which was likely attributed to the reason that a large amount of so4 2 in the solution may inhibit the generation of free radicals in the system according to the eqs 1 4 46 47 as shown in fig 8c the removal rate of bpa in the mco gac pms system also decreased with the addition of the inorganic ions however compared with the mco pms system the inorganic ions showed much less influence on the removal rate in the mco gac pms system due to the effect of gac adsorption in the membrane channels as a result loading gac into the catalytic membrane channels could contribute to mitigate the inhibitory effect of inorganic ions on bpa removal in the degradation process 1 co ii hso 5 co iii so 4 oh 2 co iii hso 5 co ii so 5 h 3 so 4 h 2 o so 4 2 oh h 4 so 4 oh so 4 2 oh humic acid ha as one of the typical nom fractions was used in the integrated system to investigate bpa removal performance fig 8d shows that there were some influence of adding ha on bpa removal in different systems after adding 10 mg l ha into the system the bpa degradation rate decreased from 79 8 to 63 2 in the m0 gac pms system from 72 8 to 57 9 in the mco pms system and from 98 8 to 95 4 in the mco gac pms system respectively the results showed that the mco gac pms exhibited much less influence by ha than the m0 gac pms and mco pms system illustrating the advantage of the developed mco gac pms system in this study it benefited from the adsorption of gac loaded in the membrane channels moreover the ceramic membrane exhibited satisfactory rejection performance of ha inset of fig 8d which prevented larges number of ha from entering the membrane and avoided the inhibition of the catalytic oxidation reaction and adsorption of gac in the membrane channels further the experiments of the integrated systems were also carried out using the real water dingjiahe reservoir china to investigate the combined effect of background ions and nom on the bpa removal as shown in fig 8e compared with the effect of 10 mg l of ha it was better for the performance of each system in real water especially for the mco gac pms system the bpa removal efficiency in real water was in close proximity to that found in di water and remained at a high level of 96 4 supporting that the mco gac pms system possessed a promising potential for actual water treatment owing to the combined effect of pms catalyzed oxidation of the catalytic membrane and adsorption of gac in the membrane channels the removal performance of various typical organic pollutants including sulfadiazine sdz 4 chlorophenol 4 cp phenol and rhb was investigated by the mco gac pms system and the results were presented in fig 8 f relatively high removal efficiencies with 98 8 of sdz 96 9 of 4 cp 85 5 of phenol and 90 1 of rhb were achieved respectively exhibiting satisfactory universality in the mco gac pms system 3 6 stability and reusability to test the stability of the catalytic ceramic membrane co ions leaching was detected during the operation as shown in fig s4 the co ions leaching concentration slightly increased from 3 3 to 3 5 Î¼g l with the pms dosage from 0 05 to 0 2 mm in the mco pms and mco gac pms system which is lower than the groundwater quality standard limit of 50 Î¼g l used for municipal water resources in china 48 the stability and reusability of the mco gac pms system were evaluated by cycle experiments in this study before the cycle experiments two cleaning methods for the mco gac pms system were investigated one is to immerse the used membrane in di water and running for 60 min at a flux of 10 lmh then determining the bpa levels in the permeate water the other is using the 0 1 mm of pms solution in the same condition as shown in fig 9a about 96 of bpa was removed after cleaning with di water and about 98 was removed after cleaning with pms solution in the mco gac system fig 9b shows that about 98 and 100 of bpa removal were achieved after cleaning with di water and pms solution respectively in the mco gac pms system the results indicated that there were no significant differences between the two cleaning methods in spite of the pms solution could slightly improve the cleaning of membrane therefore the cleaning method with di was applied in the cycle experiments in view of the performance and operation cost reusability tests of the m0 gac pms mco pms and mco gac pms system were performed by washing with di water for 20 min after each cycle test as shown in fig 9c bpa removal rates in the mco pms and mco gac pms system decreased gradually during the five cycle tests however the removal efficiency of bpa showed a small reduction and still above 90 after five repetition trials further fig 9d and e confirmed that huge amounts of co catalyst were maintained on the ceramic membrane surface after repeated usage according to the above findings the mco gac pms system had excellent reusability and possessed sustainable operation with highly efficient performance 4 conclusions in this work an integrated process of membrane filtration coupling with pms activation and adsorption was designed and developed by loading gac into catalytic ceramic membrane channels for efficient removal of organic pollutants in water the integrated process was considerably boosted for bpa removal benefiting from the synergistic effect of catalytic oxidation by oh and so4 and adsorption by gac great adaptability of the integrated process in the presence of various background factors including ha and anions as well as in the real water indicated the feasibility in different water matrixes furthermore the integrated process exhibited excellent reusability and possessed sustainable operation with efficient performance the proposed integrated process with convenient and efficient characteristics may

13066,a hybrid process of catalytic ceramic membrane integrated with granular activated carbon gac was proposed for removal of organic pollutants in water by coating flat sheet ceramic membrane with co oxide and loading gac into membrane channels the integrated catalytic ceramic membrane module mco gac with peroxymonosulfate pms activation and gac adsorption was successfully prepared the decontamination performance of the mco gac pms system was systematically investigated by using bisphenol a bpa as target pollutant excellent removal efficiency of the mco gac pms system was achieved and hydroxyl radicals oh and sulfate radicals so4 were identified as the major reactive species responsible for the degradation process the mco gac pms system showed strong resistance to humic acid ha and various anions for bpa removal moreover the mco gac pms system exhibited excellent universality for various organic pollutants where mco gac had superior stability and reusability the integrated process provides a proposed strategy for enhancing the remediation of organic pollutants graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords integrated process ceramic membrane granular active carbon peroxymonosulfate activation organic pollutants 1 introduction membrane separation technology as an environmentally friendly and efficient separation technology has the advantages of small footprint easy operation and management and decreasing membrane preparation costs etc 1 3 it has been widely used and developed in the field of drinking water and wastewater treatment and has been highly recognized by the water treatment industry in terms of improving water quality and ensuring water safety 4 5 in recent years with the rapid development of industrial technology and continuous improvement of people s living standards the types and quantities of organic pollutants in the environment have been increasing dramatically especially the emerging organic pollutants such as environmental endocrine disruptors edcs pharmaceuticals and personal care products ppcps and persistent organic pollutants pops posing a serious threat to current water environment 6 8 a considerable portion of organic pollutants characterized by refractory degradation and ecotoxicity can exist in water environment for a long time which lead to potential ecological and environmental risks 9 11 most of them may eventually reach the human body through the food chain accumulation and drinking water posing a serious threat to human health 12 14 nevertheless conventional microfiltration ultrafiltration membranes are difficult to effectively remove the dissolved organic contaminants by sieving and retention because of their large membrane pore size which is still a critical impediment to further large scale application and development of membrane separation technology in the field of water treatment 15 16 in recent years advanced oxidation processes aops have been extensively applied and devoted to organic pollutants elimination in response to the difficulty of effective removal of organic pollutants in membrane separation processes many researchers have conducted extensive researches by combining aops with membrane filtration process liu and co workers fabricated a novel cumn2o4 g c3n4 catalytic ceramic membrane and established a catalytic ozonation membrane reactor to remove micropollutants and mitigate membrane fouling which showed good elimination performance of benzophenone 4 bp 4 and toxic byproduct bromate bro3 17 chen and co workers prepared a polyethersulfone composite ultrafiltration membrane by surface modification and in situ generation of cds nanoparticles for removal of organic pollutants the membranes exhibited high activities in photocatalytic degradation of rhodamine b rhb 18 however in the process of treating actual polluted water photocatalysis is easily affected by water quality conditions and other factors 19 21 and membrane filtration coupled with ozonation and photocatalytic oxidation requires additional equipment such as uv lamps ozone generators and exhaust gas collection devices 22 23 thus increasing the infrastructure investment operational costs and management difficulties which is contrary to the original intention of constructing economic and efficient membrane filtration process for water treatment peroxymonosulfate pms catalytic oxidation as one kind of aops has recently received more attention due to the significant oxidation capacity which shows great potential for the development of effective degradation of organic pollutants in water 24 26 compare with ozonation photocatalytic oxidation and other aops the produced active species from most pms activation processes are dominated by sulfate radical so4 that has advantages of stronger oxidation capacity significantly longer lifetime and wider ph range 27 29 importantly pms activation can be achieved under mild conditions with less additional equipment and energy input which is more advantageous for coupling that with membrane filtration process 30 31 among the approaches of pms activation the heterogeneous catalytic system based on transition metal oxides offers the benefits of low application cost high activation efficiency and facile recovery of catalysts 32 35 therefore if catalyst can be directly loaded onto membranes to fabricate catalytic membrane with the function of pms activation the integrated system not only can avoid separation and recovery operation of catalyst but also achieve efficient degradation of organic pollutants in water treatment compared with polymeric membrane ceramic membrane exhibits higher mechanical strength better chemical and thermal stability and high intensity chemical oxidation tolerance dip coating followed by calcination is a simple and efficient method for loading metal oxide catalyst on the ceramic membrane which has been adopted by many researchers 36 however higher calcination temperature is often required in the preparation process of catalytic ceramic membrane to avoid leaching of metal ions and shedding of catalysts during the filtration process which inhibits reactive activity of catalyst leading to unsatisfactory degradation performance of organic pollutants 37 38 moreover in the membrane filtration process the reaction between the catalyst and pms occurs mainly during the passing of the solution through the membrane with short retention time which may also result in insufficient active species for organic pollutant removal especially in the treatment of refractory organic pollutants granular active carbon gac is a kind of common and efficient adsorption material which can adsorb organic pollutants and small molecule degradation products in water 39 41 inspiring from the large channels structure of tubular and flat sheet membranes loading gac into membrane channels is anticipated to effectively remedy the problem of insufficient degradation ability of catalytic ceramic membrane therefore an integrated system of catalytic ceramic membrane combined with gac was developed and applied in water treatment in this study bisphenol a bpa as the major target contaminant was used to investigate removal performance of organic pollutants and effects of operation parameters and water matrix species on bpa removal efficiency in the integrated system a series of quenching experiments and instrument characterization were conducted to identify the roles of active species in the degradation process of the integrated system finally the stability and reusability of this system were also evaluated by the multi cycle experiments 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials and chemicals granular active carbon gac

experiments flat sheet ceramic membrane m0 employed in this study was fabricated from our laboratory table s1 shows the composition and characteristic parameters of the flat sheet ceramic membrane 2 2 preparation of catalytic membrane and module as shown in fig 1 the catalytic membrane was fabricated via dip coating and calcination approach using the virgin flat sheet ceramic membrane firstly the ceramic membrane with a length of 8 cm was immersed in a 20 g l cobalt nitrate solution for 24 h then the membrane was taken and dried in an oven at 80 c for 5 h finally the obtained membrane was calcined in a muffle furnace at 600 c for 3 h at the static air atmosphere and the heating rate was controlled of 5 c min the submerged catalytic membrane module was fabricated by loading the gac into the membrane channels as shown in fig s1 briefly one end of the catalytic ceramic membrane was sealed with epoxy glue and then 5 g of gac was filled into the membrane channels after that a polyamide mold was mounted on the other end of the catalytic ceramic membrane with a polypropylene punching mesh between them in this module the polypropylene punching mesh 72 mm 7 5 mm with pore size of 1 mm can prevent gac from flowing out of the channels during the operation of filtration the prepared catalytic membrane module had an effective membrane area of 90 cm2 in this study the co coated catalytic ceramic membrane was denoted as mco and the resultant catalytic ceramic membrane filled with gac was denoted as mco gac 2 3 characterization of catalytic membrane the morphologies and

shown in fig 2 from the sem images of m0 fig 2a and b and mco fig 2c and d at low and high magnification the surface of the ceramic membrane was coated by a huge number of tiny particles the eds mapping images of mco were presented in fig s3 suggesting that the coated tiny particles may be cobalt oxide and exhibited a relative uniformity further xps and xrd spectra of mco were obtained in fig 3 as shown in fig 3a the full survey spectrum of mco revealed the presence of co elements with the peak at 780 1 ev co 2p as shown in the inset of fig 3a the two peaks located at around 779 5 ev and 780 6 ev were assigned to the co iii 2p3 2 and co ii 2p3 2 respectively and the accompanying 2p1 2 spin orbit component for co iii and co ii appear at 794 6 ev and 796 3 ev respectively suggesting that co iii and co ii were present in the coated particles on the surface of mco fig 3b shows the crystalline structure of m0 and mco by xrd the reflection peaks of m0 at 25 6 35 1 37 8 43 3 52 5 57 5 61 3 66 5 and 68 2 corresponding to 012 104 110 113 024 116 018 214 and 300 were well indexed to al2o3 proving that the major material of m0 is al2o3 compared with m0 more diffraction peaks at 19 0 31 3 36 9 44 8 55 6 59 3 and 65 2 corresponding to 111 220 311 400 422 511 and 440 were clearly detected in the xrd pattern of mco which were perfectly indexed to tricobalt tetraoxide co3o4 pdf 78 1970 the above results indicated that the ceramic membrane was successfully coated by co oxide and those tiny particles were principally composed of co3o4 3 2 permeate and pollutant removal performance the effect of filling with gac into the catalytic membrane channels on the membrane permeate property was investigated by measuring the trans membrane pressure tmp of pristine membrane and catalytic membrane at different fluxes as shown in fig 4 the tmp fluctuation of m0 and mco were not apparent and both kept at 2 0 3 0 kpa when the constant flux was increased from 20 to 50 l m2 h lmh within 180 min the average tmp of m0 and mco during the whole process was 2 3 kpa and 2 4 kpa respectively the result indicated that coating the catalyst on the ceramic membrane would not affect the permeate property at the given flux range further a slight intensity increase of the tmp for mco gac was observed as the flux increased from 20 to 50 lmh the average tmp of mco gac at the flux of 20 lmh 35 lmh and 50 lmh were 2 3 kpa 2 7 kpa and 3 0 kpa respectively the result suggested that filling with gac into the catalytic membrane channels had a mild influence on membrane permeate and the influence would be intensified as the increase of operating flux however there is little effect on membrane permeability for loading gac into the catalytic membrane channels due to the relatively low operation flux of submerged membrane filtration system in practical application therefore the integrated process of catalytic ceramic membrane and gac in the membrane channels will show a promising potential in the future the removal performance of different membranes under various filtration systems was evaluated by choosing bisphenol a bpa as the target contaminant as shown in fig 5 bpa adsorption rates by m0 and mco were both less than 5 which were very limited for bpa removal bpa adsorption efficiency of 33 5 and 39 3 was achieved by m0 gac and mco gac respectively owing to loading gac into the membrane channels about 3 0 of bpa was degraded when only pms was present in the system and the bpa degradation rate in the m0 pms system was also negligible 4 indicating that pms hardly degraded bpa directly and the pristine membrane showed almost no catalytic activity for pms activation the bpa removal of the m0 gac pms system was 47 5 which was a little higher than the bpa adsorption of mco gac suggesting that gac has a slight effect on pms activation in contrast over 50 bpa removal was achieved in the mco pms system which was significantly higher than the bpa adsorption of mco the result indicated that co coated on the ceramic membrane could efficiently enhance the performance of pms activation therefore the bpa removal rate of the mco gac pms system was up to 95 under the combined action of pms activation by co oxide and gac adsorption in order to clearly demonstrate the high removal efficiency of the mco gac pms system fig 5 also showed the fading performance of rhodamine b rhb of the permeate water in different systems it is obviously observed that the permeate water of the mco gac pms system was completely colorless while those of other systems were still colored 3 3 influence of experimental conditions the effects of various experimental conditions on elimination efficacy of bpa in the mco pms and mco gac pms systems were examined and shown in fig 6 fig 6a presents the effect of operation flux on bpa removal in the system the removal efficiency of bpa slowly decreased from 99 2 to 89 3 with the operation flux from 25 to 50 lmh in the mco gac pms system similarly bpa removal also had a decline with the increase of operation flux in the mco pms system it can be explained that high operation flux leads to a reduction of both interaction time between pms and catalyst on the membrane and adsorption efficiency of gac in the membrane channels as illustrated in fig 6b the effects of pms dosage from 0 05 to 0 2 mm were examined in the mco pms and mco gac pms systems in the two systems as the pms dosage increased from 0 05 to 0 1 mm their removal efficiency of bpa increased sharply suggesting that more radicals were generated at a higher pms concentration and then leaded to the faster bpa degradation however the bpa removal efficiency had no significant change with the pms concentration further increased from 0 1 to 0 2 mm due to the limited loading of co catalyst and gac in the membrane module as shown in fig 6c the effects of initial bpa concentration on bpa removal were investigated in the mco pms and mco gac pms systems when the bpa concentration increased from 2 to 10 mg l in the mco gac pms system there was a little reduction from 100 to 96 1 for the bpa removal rate as the bpa concentration increased to 15 mg l the bpa removal efficiency obviously dropped to 78 5 in the mco pms system the bpa removal showed a significant decrease with the increase of bpa concentration the removal efficiencies of 71 3 49 5 and 25 5 were achieved at the bpa concentration of 2 10 and 15 mg l respectively the all above results indicated that the mco gac pms system exhibited better performance of bpa removal than the mco pms system especially at the bpa concentration of below 10 mg l 3 4 removal process and reactive species identification fig 7a and b show the bpa removal efficiencies of the feed and permeate water in the mco pms and mco gac pms system respectively it can be observed that the concentration of bpa slightly dropped to 90 in the feed water while the bpa degradation of the permeate water in the mco pms system was close to 50 similarly the bpa degradation efficiency in the feed water was also only 10 in the mco gac pms system but the removal efficiency of bpa in the permeate water was found to 100 the results indicated that the degradation performance of direct contact between bpa and the catalyst on the out surface of the membrane in the feed tank was not significant and bpa removal was mainly occurred during the process of passing through the catalytic membrane module according to fig 5 there was just a slight variation in the bpa removal efficiency between the m0 gac and m0 gac pms systems suggesting gac had a poor activation effect on pms thus showing a little contribution to bpa removal rate for pms activated by gac therefore the removal of bpa in the mco gac pms system was mainly contributed to two routes one was the catalytic oxidation of bpa by pms activation through the catalyst co3o4 coated on the membrane which accounted for 50 the other was the adsorption of gac loaded in the membrane channels which accounted for 50 further the major reactive species of bpa degradation in the mco gac pms system would be investigated in the following part the experiments of radical quenching were conducted to investigate the roles of active species in the oxidation process of the mco gac pms system meoh is a typical scavenger for oh k 9 7 108 m 1 s 1 and so4 k 2 5 107 m 1 s 1 and tba is widely used as a selective radical scavenger for oh with the rate constant of 3 6 7 6 108 m 1 s 1 42 44 co3o4 powder as the same as the catalyst coated on the catalytic membrane in this study was obtained under the same preparation conditions and used in the radical quenching experiments as presented in fig 7c the degradation efficiency of bpa decreased from 82 6 to 64 6 as external tba was added to the co3o4 pms system and the degradation efficiency of bpa decreased to 44 2 when external meoh was added to the system the results of radical quenching experiments indicated that both oh and so4 were the dominant species responsible for bpa degradation in the co3o4 pms system which was the same as in the mco gac pms system additionally the reactive radicals from the mco gac pms system were detected by epr spectroscopy using the spin trapping agent dmpo as shown in fig 7d the characteristic peaks of dmpo oh and dmpo so4 adducts were simultaneously observed further proving that oh and so4 were generated in the mco gac pms system 3 5 effect of water matrix considering the potential application of mco gac in practical water treatment the influence of inorganic ions cl hco3 so4 2 and no3 on bpa removal performance in the mco pms m0 gac pms and mco gac pms system was first investigated as shown in fig 8a the bpa degradation efficiencies were all inhibited with the addition of the inorganic ions in the mco pms system after adding 10 mm of cl hco3 so4 2 and no3 into the system the bpa degradation efficiency decreased to 39 9 29 5 25 2 and 21 0 respectively however fig 8b shows that minor changes of the bpa removal efficiency were observed in the m0 gac pms system the results indicated that adding inorganic ions had more negative effects on the process of catalytic oxidation degradation than that on gac adsorption it can be attributed to the fact that no3 hco3 and cl could be oxidized by oh and so4 of the system to produce lower reactive or more selective reactive species such as no3 co3 cl2 and cl2 24 45 it is worth noting that so4 2 exhibited the most significant inhibition of bpa degradation which was likely attributed to the reason that a large amount of so4 2 in the solution may inhibit the generation of free radicals in the system according to the eqs 1 4 46 47 as shown in fig 8c the removal rate of bpa in the mco gac pms system also decreased with the addition of the inorganic ions however compared with the mco pms system the inorganic ions showed much less influence on the removal rate in the mco gac pms system due to the effect of gac adsorption in the membrane channels as a result loading gac into the catalytic membrane channels could contribute to mitigate the inhibitory effect of inorganic ions on bpa removal in the degradation process 1 co ii hso 5 co iii so 4 oh 2 co iii hso 5 co ii so 5 h 3 so 4 h 2 o so 4 2 oh h 4 so 4 oh so 4 2 oh humic acid ha as one of the typical nom fractions was used in the integrated system to investigate bpa removal performance fig 8d shows that there were some influence of adding ha on bpa removal in different systems after adding 10 mg l ha into the system the bpa degradation rate decreased from 79 8 to 63 2 in the m0 gac pms system from 72 8 to 57 9 in the mco pms system and from 98 8 to 95 4 in the mco gac pms system respectively the results showed that the mco gac pms exhibited much less influence by ha than the m0 gac pms and mco pms system illustrating the advantage of the developed mco gac pms system in this study it benefited from the adsorption of gac loaded in the membrane channels moreover the ceramic membrane exhibited satisfactory rejection performance of ha inset of fig 8d which prevented larges number of ha from entering the membrane and avoided the inhibition of the catalytic oxidation reaction and adsorption of gac in the membrane channels further the experiments of the integrated systems were also carried out using the real water dingjiahe reservoir china to investigate the combined effect of background ions and nom on the bpa removal as shown in fig 8e compared with the effect of 10 mg l of ha it was better for the performance of each system in real water especially for the mco gac pms system the bpa removal efficiency in real water was in close proximity to that found in di water and remained at a high level of 96 4 supporting that the mco gac pms system possessed a promising potential for actual water treatment owing to the combined effect of pms catalyzed oxidation of the catalytic membrane and adsorption of gac in the membrane channels the removal performance of various typical organic pollutants including sulfadiazine sdz 4 chlorophenol 4 cp phenol and rhb was investigated by the mco gac pms system and the results were presented in fig 8 f relatively high removal efficiencies with 98 8 of sdz 96 9 of 4 cp 85 5 of phenol and 90 1 of rhb were achieved respectively exhibiting satisfactory universality in the mco gac pms system 3 6 stability and reusability to test the stability of the catalytic ceramic membrane co ions leaching was detected during the operation as shown in fig s4 the co ions leaching concentration slightly increased from 3 3 to 3 5 Î¼g l with the pms dosage from 0 05 to 0 2 mm in the mco pms and mco gac pms system which is lower than the groundwater quality standard limit of 50 Î¼g l used for municipal water resources in china 48 the stability and reusability of the mco gac pms system were evaluated by cycle experiments in this study before the cycle experiments two cleaning methods for the mco gac pms system were investigated one is to immerse the used membrane in di water and running for 60 min at a flux of 10 lmh then determining the bpa levels in the permeate water the other is using the 0 1 mm of pms solution in the same condition as shown in fig 9a about 96 of bpa was removed after cleaning with di water and about 98 was removed after cleaning with pms solution in the mco gac system fig 9b shows that about 98 and 100 of bpa removal were achieved after cleaning with di water and pms solution respectively in the mco gac pms system the results indicated that there were no significant differences between the two cleaning methods in spite of the pms solution could slightly improve the cleaning of membrane therefore the cleaning method with di was applied in the cycle experiments in view of the performance and operation cost reusability tests of the m0 gac pms mco pms and mco gac pms system were performed by washing with di water for 20 min after each cycle test as shown in fig 9c bpa removal rates in the mco pms and mco gac pms system decreased gradually during the five cycle tests however the removal efficiency of bpa showed a small reduction and still above 90 after five repetition trials further fig 9d and e confirmed that huge amounts of co catalyst were maintained on the ceramic membrane surface after repeated usage according to the above findings the mco gac pms system had excellent reusability and possessed sustainable operation with highly efficient performance 4 conclusions in this work an integrated process of membrane filtration coupling with pms activation and adsorption was designed and developed by loading gac into catalytic ceramic membrane channels for efficient removal of organic pollutants in water the integrated process was considerably boosted for bpa removal benefiting from the synergistic effect of catalytic oxidation by oh and so4 and adsorption by gac great adaptability of the integrated process in the presence of various background factors including ha and anions as well as in the real water indicated the feasibility in different water matrixes furthermore the integrated process exhibited excellent reusability and possessed sustainable operation with efficient performance the proposed integrated process with convenient and efficient characteristics may offer a promising strategy for effectively removing organic pollutants in natural and engineered aqueous environments declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known

13067,the high water content and huge volume of activated sludge greatly increase the costs for disposal and transportation combined use of acid and flocculant can effectively enhance the sludge dewatering performance in the present work the influence of dosing order of acid and polydiallyldimethylammonium chloride pdmdaac a typical flocculant on sludge dewaterability was investigated results showed that the pdmdaac acid process exhibited a better dewatering capability than the acid pdmdaac process under the identical conditions which indicated that pdmdaac should be dosed before acid treatment the water content decreased from 75 4 to 67 8 for the pdmdaac citric acid process the potential mechanisms behind sludge dewatering were explored and the decomposition of tightly bound extracellular polymeric substances tb eps increased particle size and aggregated morphology of the sludge flocs were found to be closely correlated with the enhanced dewatering performance these results confirmed that the pdmdaac acid treatment achieved a better performance in enhancing sludge dewatering and will help to understand the combined conditioning process of acid and flocculant graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords sludge dewatering flocculant acid treatment dosing order extracellular polymeric substances eps 1 introduction huge volume of activated sludge generated by municipal wastewater treatment process has become a tremendous concern to the scientists and society because water content reaches up to 99 for the raw sludge and the management cost of excess sludge occupies a large portion of the total operating expenses in wastewater treatment plants 1 2 sludge dewatering can decrease the volume of sludge through the separation of sludge and water and can reduce costs for the following transportation and treatments such as landfill and incineration 3 4 in addition to the sludge characteristics the dewatering device and conditioning methods are also very important influencing factors on the dewatering efficiency extracellular polymeric substances eps were negatively charged in sludge and highly hydrated and were the decisive factor for sludge dewatering 5 7 the main organic constituents within eps including proteins polysaccharides and humic substances could significantly influence the floc charge and floc stability eps in sludge flocs showed a three dimensional structure which were composed of soluble eps s eps loosely bound eps lb eps and tightly bound eps tb eps 8 some studies have shown that the transformation of proteins and polysaccharides from tb eps to s eps could improve the sludge dewaterability 9 meanwhile the excessive lb eps were often associated with the poor sludge dewaterability 10 generally the appropriate chemical pretreatments of the sludge before the dewatering are required to enhance the dewatering performance of the devices as the most commonly used chemical conditioners the inorganic or organic flocculants can aggregate small sludge particles into larger sludge flocs on the basis of bridging and charge neutralization which promotes the separation of sludge and water 10 11 however the conventional chemical flocculants are basically not effective in decomposing eps or releasing bound water due to the highly hydrated eps 12 hence a lot of advanced sludge technologies ast have been developed to enhance sludge dewatering by decomposing eps such as acid alkali conditioning 5 13 heat conditioning 14 and fenton fenton like oxidation technologies 1 15 16 etc it has been reported that the combined use of ast and flocculants can improve the sludge dewaterability more efficiently than a single method previous studies showed that pre oxidation by calcium peroxide cao2 combined with chemical re flocculation could effectively reduce specific resistance to filtration srf and the water content of sludge cake 11 the combination of fenton like oxidation and polydiallyldimethylammonium chloride pdmdaac re coagulation was found to reduce capillary suction time cst and enhance sludge dewatering 2 however little is known about the effects of dosing order of ast and flocculants on the sludge dewaterability so far acid treatment has been proven to be an effective method to destroy eps structures and promote the release of sludge bound water 5 9 the possibility of combined acidification and flocculants to enhance sludge dewatering has been rarely investigated the major goal of the present work is to explore the treatment efficiency of combined acid and pdmdaac for improving the sludge dewaterability two organic acids citric acid acetic acid and two inorganic acids sulfuric acid hydrochloric acid were employed for the ph modification i e acidification the sludge dewatering performance conditioned by different single or composite conditioners e g acid only pdmdaac only acid pdmdaac and pdmdaac acid was compared and evaluated to elucidate the mechanisms the organic compounds within the eps matrix the particle size distribution and zeta potential of sludge flocs were studied meanwhile the morphology and structure of sludge flocs under different conditions were investigated in most previous studies flocculants were added after various conditioning methods the present study helps to elucidate the correct dosing order and mechanism of pdmdaac acid treatments on sludge dewatering and provides a new idea for improving the efficiency of sludge dewatering 2 materials and methods 2 1 raw sludge and chemicals raw activated sludge samples were collected from the sludge thickening tank of qige wastewater treatment plant in hangzhou china the collected samples were filtered with a 0 9 mm sieve and then preserved at 4 c before use less than two weeks the main characteristic parameters of raw sludge have been provided as follows total solids 16 02 0 02 g l volatile suspended solids vss 0 40 0 01 g g dry solids ds ph 6 5 0 1 srf 2 89 0 21

shanghai china 2 2 sludge conditioning and dewatering h2so4 and hcl were inorganic acids while acetic acid and citric acid were used as organic acids for acid conditioning 1 m h2so4 and hcl 0 6 m citric acid and acetic acid 95 were added to 100 ml sludge samples to obtain the designed ph value respectively to evaluate the influence of combined acidification and flocculation conditioning on sludge dewaterability pdmdaac with a dosage of 3 75 mg g ds based on our pre experiments was selected as the flocculant a series of experiments with varying dosing order and formulations were carried out and the details have been described in table 1 five sludge conditioning processes were adopted 1 raw sludge rs 2 no flocculant c a s h 3 no acid f 4 the acid flocculant process i e the sludge sample was initially mixed with acid and then mixed with flocculant rapidly c f a f s f h f and 5 the flocculant acid process i e the sludge was quickly mixed with the flocculant and then acid was added f c f a f s f h it should be emphasized that in the ph modification experiments when the ph was lower than 2 7 an excessive amount of organic acid needed to be added and the filtration rate was reduced therefore the ph of 2 7 was selected in the combined acidification and flocculation pretreatment process the range of stirring rate at 150 200 rpm was selected for conditioning because the sludge flocs would be broken if the stirring rate was too fast the dewatering performance of activated sludge was characterized using the specific resistance to filtration srf and the moisture content of sludge cake the srf was determined in a 100 ml buchner funnel based on a previous report 0 06 mpa for 30 min 17 the moisture content was measured after the sludge cake was dried for 12 h at 105 c 2 3 extraction and analysis of sludge eps eps have been obtained from sludge using a previously reported extraction method 18 19 each extracted supernatant i e s eps lb eps and tb eps was filtered by the 0 45 Î¼m membrane filter cellulose acetate and the following aspects were analyzed for eps samples including protein and polysaccharide 1 the content of protein pn within eps was measured using a protein detection kit shanghai sangon biotech china according to the lowry s method and 2 the content of polysaccharides ps was measured with anthrone sulfuric acid method 20 2 4 other analysis the values for ds and vss of sludge were measured based on the standard methods 10 the lap w2000h laser particle size analyzer yishite co china was employed to determine particle sizes of the raw and treated sludge samples and the instrument automatically took three measurements and calculated the average value zeta potentials of different sludge samples were determined by the zetasizer nano instrument zs90 malvern co u k to investigate the morphology and structures of sludge the sludge flocs were directly observed on a microscope ix71 olymplis co japan 3 results and discussion 3 1 effects of pretreatment on sludge dewatering performance the effects of organic acid and inorganic acid pretreatment on the sludge dewaterability are shown in fig 1 and specifically the water content and srf were investigated the sludge samples conditioned by four kinds of acids achieved the slightly lower moisture content than the raw sludge at the same time the moisture content of all the treated sludge samples decreased with the decrease of ph and there was a drastic decline in the sludge volume when ph was less than 3 0 when ph 2 0 the sludge treated by citric acid obtained the lowest water content 65 3 fig 1a the srf of the sludge conditioned by citric acid and acetic acid increased first and then decreased as the ph decreased from 6 0 to 3 0 meanwhile the srf of the sludge treated with acetic acid showed a sharp increase when the ph was lower than 2 0 fig 1b this might be attributed to the large amount of bubbles generated during the filtration process which blocked the funnel and slowed the filtration rate of the sludge similar reaction patterns could be observed for the effects of hydrochloric acid and sulfuric acid on the srf and moisture content of sludge as can be seen the moisture content of sludge conditioned with sulfuric acid and hydrochloric acid decreased from 75 4 raw sludge to 68 8 fig 1c and 68 9 fig 1d respectively however the srf was increased with the decline of ph when the ph was lower than 3 0 this might be due to more eps being released into the water and clogging the filter paper 21 the sludge flocs were broken due to the extremely low ph and the fine particles blocked the hydrophobic channel of the sludge and therefore slowed the filtration rate 3 2 effects of adding order of flocculants and acid on dewatering performance in order to simultaneously decrease the moisture content and srf of sludge samples the process of combining flocculants with acid was employed to treat the sludge fig 2 shows the influences of different conditioning processes on srf and water content the sludge conditioned by pdmdaac alone achieved the slightly lower moisture content than the raw sludge in contrast the srf of the sludge samples treated by pdmdaac alone decreased from the initial value of 2 89 1013 to 0 54 1013 m kg it is generally recognized that a higher value of srf implies the worse sludge dewaterability 5 the addition of pdmdaac tended to speed up the sludge filtration rate while the impacts of pdmdaac on water content of sludge were not substantial this phenomenon was consistent with the reports regarding the effects of flocculant on sludge dewatering performance 12 22 both organic acid and inorganic acid could effectively reduce the water content of sludge but for reducing srf pdmdaac showed better performance the dewatering performance of sludge after synergistic conditioning was further improved compared with raw sludge for example the moisture content and srf of the sludge treated by c f mode decreased from 75 4 to 68 1 fig 2a and from 2 89 1013 to 0 99 1013 m kg respectively notably the adding order of acid and flocculant played a crucial role in enhancing sludge dewatering as depicted in fig 2a the values of water content and srf were 67 8 and 0 87 1013 m kg for the f c mode and were 69 7 and 1 02 1013 m kg for the f a mode these values were lower than those of the converse synergistic conditioning processes i e c f process and a f process the dewatering effect of sludge treated by inorganic acid and flocculant showed the same variation trend as that of organic acid and flocculant fig 2b moreover the srf of the sludge conditioned by f h 0 70 1013 m kg was second only to that of the sludge conditioned by the pdmdaac alone therefore adding pdmdaac before acid treatment was more effective to improve the sludge dewatering performance 3 3 response of eps to the treatments eps which are secreted by microorganisms play a very important role in preserving the integrity of the structures and function of the flocs it has been shown that the decomposition of eps could enhance sludge dewatering 23 analysis of fig 3a and b indicated that compared with raw sludge the ps and pn within tb eps were released after the acid treatment specifically the pn content in tb eps of the sludge treated by h2so4 was decreased from 5 44 to 0 70 mg g ss whereas the totally different trend was found for s eps this result might be attributed to the decomposition of eps by acid the contents of ps and pn within tb eps were reduced due to a lower solution ph and their release to the liquid phase of s eps at the same time the content of pn within s eps of the sludge conditioned by citric acid was lower than that of the raw sludge this might be because the complexation of citric acid with cu2 affected the content of pn during its detection with lowry s method 24 in fig 3 it was found that the pn content in s eps of flocculant acid process was higher than that of the acid flocculant process the pn content in lb eps of flocculant acid process was lower than that of acid flocculant process previous studies showed that pn was the major organic matter influencing the sludge dewatering performance 2 the existence of excessive lb eps exerted negative effects on the sludge dewaterability and settleability 25 the result was in good agreement with the analysis of the sludge dewaterability as depicted in fig 2 all these results convincingly evidenced that more polymeric matrix were degraded and released into s eps during the flocculant acid process when compared with acid flocculant process this could help to release the water trapped in the floc matrix to the supernatant which would decrease the moisture content of sludge cake 3 4 zeta potential and particle size zeta potential and particle size of the sludge flocs are considered to be closely correlated with the sludge dewaterability 6 17 zeta potential of the sludge conditioned with pdmdaac increased from 18 4 0 3 mv to 13 9 0 1 mv fig 4 this was attributed to the charge neutralization of flocculant which could eliminate the electrostatic repulsion between the sludge particles 26 in comparison the zeta potential of sludge treated by the composite conditioner of acid and pdmdaac was less negative than that of sludge treated by pdmdaac and acid alone and also came closer to isoelectric point this might be related to the charge neutralization of flocculant and the h produced under acidic condition that can neutralize the negatively charged sludge surface 27 the zeta potential of sludge samples close to isoelectric point would enhance the dewatering process 2 18 it should be mentioned that the zeta potential of sludge conditioned with acetic acid and pdmdaac became positive which indicated that the repulsive force of sludge particles increased accordingly fig 4a the increased repulsive force was unfavorable for the dewaterability of the sludge which was in good agreement with the analysis of the sludge dewatering performance shown in fig 2a additionally the zeta potential of sludge samples treated by acid flocculant and flocculant acid processes showed negligible differences and this was likely due to the fact that both the charge neutralization of pdmdaac and the existence of h ions in the solution played important roles 12 27 analysis of size distribution of sludge flocs further explained the effects of adding order of pdmdaac and acid on the sludge dewaterability it can be seen from fig 5 that the particle size of raw sludge was the smallest among the samples notably the median particle sizes of sludge treated by f c f a f s and f h were larger than those of c f a f s f and h f which were 79 65 82 11 72 45 and 68 65 Î¼m respectively this result indicated that adding flocculant before acid was helpful to increase the particle size of sludge flocs and improve the sludge dewaterability 3 5 morphological characteristics of flocs micrographs could intuitively show the changes in the size of sludge flocs 17 fig 6 displays the micrographs of raw and treated sludge samples by different conditioners the flocs of sludge treated by four acids i e acetic acid citric acid h2so4 and hcl were more compact than those of raw sludge the particle size of the sludge flocs after pdmdaac treatment was larger than that of other sludge samples these results indicated that both acid and pdmdaac treatment could trigger the aggregation and flocculation of sludge flocs 9 28 this point was in good agreement with those floc characteristics as described above moreover the observation highlighted that there were significant differences between acid pdmdaac and pdmdaac acid processes the flocs of sludge treated by pdmdaac acid were more compact and dense than those by acid pdmdaac and this could enhance the sludge dewatering 3 6 mechanisms of pdmdaac acid conditioning the polymeric matrix have been reported to be closely related to the sludge dewatering performance acids could decompose eps and trigger the collapse of the polymeric structure and therefore the proteins in tb eps were gradually transferred into s eps fig 3 the destruction of the polymeric structure enabled the release and removal of internal water thereby decreasing the moisture content of sludge cake furthermore the released sludge particles were likely to block the filter cake and filter medium and the increased water flow resistance would reduce the filtration rate therefore the combination of acid and flocculant was required to simultaneously reduce the water content and srf value via bridging and charge neutralization however if the sludge was conditioned with acid first the flocculant dosed later could not re flocculate the fine particles to form a large enough agglomeration moreover the agglomeration tended to break up by stirring as shown in fig 7 if the flocculant was added first the acid dosed later could release tb eps and lb eps to s eps which promoted the release of internal water and reduced the water content more importantly the acid during the flocculant acid process could not completely destroy the large dense agglomeration that formed initially figs 5 and 6 thus the sludge filterability was significantly enhanced compared with the acid flocculant process 4 conclusions in the present study the effects of adding order of acid and flocculant on the sludge dewaterability were investigated and the changes in the compositions of eps and morphological characteristics of sludge flocs were experimentally determined the adding order of acid and flocculant was very crucial for enhancing the sludge dewaterability especially for both the water content and filterability better sludge dewatering performance was observed in the process where pdmdaac was added before the acid more eps were released to the filtrate after pdmdaac acid treatment which resulted in the collapse of sludge matrix and the release of bound water and further decreased the water content of sludge cake moreover the increased particle size and zeta potential caused by pdmdaac acid treatment accelerated the filtration rate therefore the flocculant acid process was proven to promote the sludge dewaterability more effectively than the acid flocculant process declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing

reduced therefore the ph of 2 7 was selected in the combined acidification and flocculation pretreatment process the range of stirring rate at 150 200 rpm was selected for conditioning because the sludge flocs would be broken if the stirring rate was too fast the dewatering performance of activated sludge was characterized using the specific resistance to filtration srf and the moisture content of sludge cake the srf was determined in a 100 ml buchner funnel based on a previous report 0 06 mpa for 30 min 17 the moisture content was measured after the sludge cake was dried for 12 h at 105 c 2 3 extraction and analysis of sludge eps eps have been obtained from sludge using a previously reported extraction method 18 19 each extracted supernatant i e s eps lb eps and tb eps was filtered by the 0 45 Î¼m membrane filter cellulose acetate and the following aspects were analyzed for eps samples including protein and polysaccharide 1 the content of protein pn within eps was measured using a protein detection kit shanghai sangon biotech china according to the lowry s method and 2 the content of polysaccharides ps was measured with anthrone sulfuric acid method 20 2 4 other analysis the values for ds and vss of sludge were measured based on the standard methods 10 the lap w2000h laser particle size analyzer yishite co china was employed to determine particle sizes of the raw and treated sludge samples and the instrument automatically took three measurements and calculated the average value zeta potentials of different sludge samples were determined by the zetasizer nano instrument zs90 malvern co u k to investigate the morphology and structures of sludge the sludge flocs were directly observed on a microscope ix71 olymplis co japan 3 results and discussion 3 1 effects of pretreatment on sludge dewatering performance the effects of organic acid and inorganic acid pretreatment on the sludge dewaterability are shown in fig 1 and specifically the water content and srf were investigated the sludge samples conditioned by four kinds of acids achieved the slightly lower moisture content than the raw sludge at the same time the moisture content of all the treated sludge samples decreased with the decrease of ph and there was a drastic decline in the sludge volume when ph was less than 3 0 when ph 2 0 the sludge treated by citric acid obtained the lowest water content 65 3 fig 1a the srf of the sludge conditioned by citric acid and acetic acid increased first and then decreased as the ph decreased from 6 0 to 3 0 meanwhile the srf of the sludge treated with acetic acid showed a sharp increase when the ph was lower than 2 0 fig 1b this might be attributed to the large amount of bubbles generated during the filtration process which blocked the funnel and slowed the filtration rate of the sludge similar reaction patterns could be observed for the effects of hydrochloric acid and sulfuric acid on the srf and moisture content of sludge as can be seen the moisture content of sludge conditioned with sulfuric acid and hydrochloric acid decreased from 75 4 raw sludge to 68 8 fig 1c and 68 9 fig 1d respectively however the srf was increased with the decline of ph when the ph was lower than 3 0 this might be due to more eps being released into the water and clogging the filter paper 21 the sludge flocs were broken due to the extremely low ph and the fine particles blocked the hydrophobic channel of the sludge and therefore slowed the filtration rate 3 2 effects of adding order of flocculants and acid on dewatering performance in order to simultaneously decrease the moisture content and srf of sludge samples the process of combining flocculants with acid was employed to treat the sludge fig 2 shows the influences of different conditioning processes on srf and water content the sludge conditioned by pdmdaac alone achieved the slightly lower moisture content than the raw sludge in contrast the srf of the sludge samples treated by pdmdaac alone decreased from the initial value of 2 89 1013 to 0 54 1013 m kg it is generally recognized that a higher value of srf implies the worse sludge dewaterability 5 the addition of pdmdaac tended to speed up the sludge filtration rate while the impacts of pdmdaac on water content of sludge were not substantial this phenomenon was consistent with the reports regarding the effects of flocculant on sludge dewatering performance 12 22 both organic acid and inorganic acid could effectively reduce the water content of sludge but for reducing srf pdmdaac showed better performance the dewatering performance of sludge after synergistic conditioning was further improved compared with raw sludge for example the moisture content and srf of the sludge treated by c f mode decreased from 75 4 to 68 1 fig 2a and from 2 89 1013 to 0 99 1013 m kg respectively notably the adding order of acid and flocculant played a crucial role in enhancing sludge dewatering as depicted in fig 2a the values of water content and srf were 67 8 and 0 87 1013 m kg for the f c mode and were 69 7 and 1 02 1013 m kg for the f a mode these values were lower than those of the converse synergistic conditioning processes i e c f process and a f process the dewatering effect of sludge treated by inorganic acid and flocculant showed the same variation trend as that of organic acid and flocculant fig 2b moreover the srf of the sludge conditioned by f h 0 70 1013 m kg was second only to that of the sludge conditioned by the pdmdaac alone therefore adding pdmdaac before acid treatment was more effective to improve the sludge dewatering performance 3 3 response of eps to the treatments eps which are secreted by microorganisms play a very important role in preserving the integrity of the structures and function of the flocs it has been shown that the decomposition of eps could enhance sludge dewatering 23 analysis of fig 3a and b indicated that compared with raw sludge the ps and pn within tb eps were released after the acid treatment specifically the pn content in tb eps of the sludge treated by h2so4 was decreased from 5 44 to 0 70 mg g ss whereas the totally different trend was found for s eps this result might be attributed to the decomposition of eps by acid the contents of ps and pn within tb eps were reduced due to a lower solution ph and their release to the liquid phase of s eps at the same time the content of pn within s eps of the sludge conditioned by citric acid was lower than that of the raw sludge this might be because the complexation of citric acid with cu2 affected the content of pn during its detection with lowry s method 24 in fig 3 it was found that the pn content in s eps of flocculant acid process was higher than that of the acid flocculant process the pn content in lb eps of flocculant acid process was lower than that of acid flocculant process previous studies showed that pn was the major organic matter influencing the sludge dewatering performance 2 the existence of excessive lb eps exerted negative effects on the sludge dewaterability and settleability 25 the result was in good agreement with the analysis of the sludge dewaterability as depicted in fig 2 all these results convincingly evidenced that more polymeric matrix were degraded and released into s eps during the flocculant acid process when compared with acid flocculant process this could help to release the water trapped in the floc matrix to the supernatant which would decrease the moisture content of sludge cake 3 4 zeta potential and particle size zeta potential and particle size of the sludge flocs are considered to be closely correlated with the sludge dewaterability 6 17 zeta potential of the sludge conditioned with pdmdaac increased from 18 4 0 3 mv to 13 9 0 1 mv fig 4 this was attributed to the charge neutralization of flocculant which could eliminate the electrostatic repulsion between the sludge particles 26 in comparison the zeta potential of sludge treated by the composite conditioner of acid and pdmdaac was less negative than that of sludge treated by pdmdaac and acid alone and also came closer to isoelectric point this might be related to the charge neutralization of flocculant and the h produced under acidic condition that can neutralize the negatively charged sludge surface 27 the zeta potential of sludge samples close to isoelectric point would enhance the dewatering process 2 18 it should be mentioned that the zeta potential of sludge conditioned with acetic acid and pdmdaac became positive which indicated that the repulsive force of sludge particles increased accordingly fig 4a the increased repulsive force was unfavorable for the dewaterability of the sludge which was in good agreement with the analysis of the sludge dewatering performance shown in fig 2a additionally the zeta potential of sludge samples treated by acid flocculant and flocculant acid processes showed negligible differences and this was likely due to the fact that both the charge neutralization of pdmdaac and the existence of h ions in the solution played important roles 12 27 analysis of size distribution of sludge flocs further explained the effects of adding order of pdmdaac and acid on the sludge dewaterability it can be seen from fig 5 that the particle size of raw sludge was the smallest among the samples notably the median particle sizes of sludge treated by f c f a f s and f h were larger than those of c f a f s f and h f which were 79 65 82 11 72 45 and 68 65 Î¼m respectively this result indicated that adding flocculant before acid was helpful to increase the particle size of sludge flocs and improve the sludge dewaterability 3 5 morphological characteristics of flocs micrographs could intuitively show the changes in the size of sludge flocs 17 fig 6 displays the micrographs of raw and treated sludge samples by different conditioners the flocs of sludge treated by four acids i e acetic acid citric acid h2so4 and hcl were more compact than those of raw sludge the particle size of the sludge flocs after pdmdaac treatment was larger than that of other sludge samples these results indicated that both acid and pdmdaac treatment could trigger the aggregation and flocculation of sludge flocs 9 28 this point was in good agreement with those floc characteristics as described above moreover the observation highlighted that there were significant differences between acid pdmdaac and pdmdaac acid processes the flocs of sludge treated by pdmdaac acid were more compact and dense than those by acid pdmdaac and this could enhance the sludge dewatering 3 6 mechanisms of pdmdaac acid conditioning the polymeric matrix have been reported to be closely related to the sludge dewatering performance acids could decompose eps and trigger the collapse of the polymeric structure and therefore the proteins in tb eps were gradually transferred into s eps fig 3 the destruction of the polymeric structure enabled the release and removal of internal water thereby decreasing the moisture content of sludge cake furthermore the released sludge particles were likely to block the filter cake and filter medium and the increased water flow resistance would reduce the filtration rate therefore the combination of acid and flocculant was required to simultaneously reduce the water content and srf value via bridging and charge neutralization however if the sludge was conditioned with acid first the flocculant dosed later could not re flocculate the fine particles to form a large enough agglomeration moreover the agglomeration tended to break up by stirring as shown in fig 7 if the flocculant was added first the acid dosed later could release tb eps and lb eps to s eps which promoted the release of internal water and reduced the water content more importantly the acid during the flocculant acid process could not completely destroy the large dense agglomeration that formed initially figs 5 and 6 thus the sludge filterability was significantly enhanced compared with the acid flocculant process 4 conclusions in the present study the effects of adding order of acid and flocculant on the sludge dewaterability were investigated and the changes in the compositions of eps and morphological characteristics of sludge flocs were experimentally determined the adding order of acid and flocculant was very crucial for enhancing the sludge dewaterability especially for both the water content and filterability better sludge dewatering performance was observed in the process where pdmdaac was added before the acid more eps were released to the filtrate after pdmdaac acid treatment which resulted in the collapse of sludge matrix and the release of bound water and further decreased the water content of sludge cake moreover the increased particle size and zeta potential caused by pdmdaac acid treatment accelerated the filtration rate therefore the flocculant acid process was proven to promote the sludge dewaterability more effectively than the acid flocculant process declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing

coefficient of determination r2 of 0 885 and 0 880 respectively for the unseen testing data to predict the acc and ph of the produced saew graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords free chlorine gene expression programming hypochlorous acid production parameters slightly acidic electrolyzed water 1 introduction along with general sanitary living conditions concerns regarding disinfection and sanitization protocols have become a topical issue with the recent outbreak of the coronavirus covid 19 pandemic to reduce the spread of pathogens various sanitizing methods have been used to disinfect palms surfaces and food products the covid 19 pandemic necessitated the enforcement of sanitizing measures and strict use of practical sustainable antiviral disinfectants alcohol based disinfectants have proved to be efficient in controlling widespread infections of the covid 19 virus 1 however the worldwide demand for these disinfectants created shortages in alcohol based sanitizers and it became difficult for manufacturers to keep up with the growing demand fully the quest for other efficient and safe disinfectants therefore increased drastically electrolyzed water ew is an alternative disinfectant that has gained much attention because of its relative ease of production and has been reported to have antimicrobial efficiency against viruses and bacteria 2 the ew with an active component hypochlorous acid hocl has been regarded as an effective sanitizer because of its proven efficacy in various sectors it has been applied in food sanitization 3 4 agriculture 5 7 and environmental and medical sterilization 8 9 because it non toxic and environmentally friendly slightly acidic electrolyzed water saew with a ph range of 5 0 6 5 is a type of ew that has been widely used and proven to have antimicrobial effects due to its high hocl concentration 10 12 it is produced by the electrolysis of a hydrochloric acid hcl and or sodium chloride nacl solution in an electrolytic cell with no diaphragm separating the anode and cathode 13 saew is rapidly becoming a popular sanitizer because of its advantages over other types of ew it exhibits effective antimicrobial action at relatively low available chlorine concentrations reducing the corrosion of production electrodes and equipment by chlorine 14 therefore there is a growing interest in applying saew as an eco friendly disinfectant 15 17 nevertheless the characteristics of the saew produced by a generator are mainly dependent on the feed water characteristics and the operational parameters employed in the production process which may significantly affect its ph or available chlorine concentration acc 18 the properties of the source water are even more crucial because saew efficiency requires a strict ph range of 5 0 6 5 however there is a lack of research and literature on the effect of varying feed water properties and operational parameters on the production of saew most studies have focused on the production of saew under standard conditions with little attention to the feed water hardness 14 a few studies have discussed the hardness of feed water at lower concentrations to the best of our knowledge no study has tested the impact of hardness on saew production at caco3 concentrations higher than 200 mg l existing studies related to the effect of organic matter om on hocl are mainly focused on testing the disinfection or sanitizing efficiency of the ew produced therefore it is imperative to investigate the influence of the physicochemical properties of feed water and operational parameters on saew production in this study a lab scale reactor was used to test the effect of feed water physicochemical characteristics and operating parameters on saew production with real and simulated feed water recent advances in soft computing have increased the use of computer aided models for developing and predicting the relationship between operational parameters and system efficiency predictive artificial intelligence ai models potentially maximize the work of environmental engineers and scientists by eliminating the extra burden of tedious experimental work and the cost of labor 19 the ai models can be used in simple to complex networks to predict results that correspond or are close in value to the experimental results for optimizing process mechanisms 20 22 artificial neural networks anns are the most commonly used soft computing tools and have been successfully employed in numerous studies 23 27 ann progresses continuously with different training algorithms development and suitable data input procedures to improve process optimization 28 gene expression programming gep is another robust computing technique representing output using simplified mathematical equations and is suitable for practical applications with higher prediction accuracy 29 the gep has been reported to have a significantly better performance capability and surpass conventional genetic programming gp and genetic algorithm ga by two or more orders of significance 30 notably gep has been stated as a robust and problem independent algorithm as tested in academia industry and real world applications 31 it evaluates all chromosomes according to predefined fitness functions and reproduces the next generation through more genetic functions until the individual with the best fitness is chosen as the output this makes gep helpful in modeling the effects of parameters on process efficiency 32 although various researchers have utilized the gep technique in multiple fields in recent years 33 38 one study reported the application of response surface methodology rsm and ann models to optimize ew production where the rsm model provided an equation to determine the relationship between operating parameters and hocl production 39 the authors proved the feasibility of the proposed rsm quadratic and ann models for acc prediction and reported that ffr ac and afr have a significant effect on the concentration of the acc in ew production this work showed the viability of soft computing techniques in predicting a relationship between hocl production process variables and the acc 39 to the best of our knowledge there is no record in the literature regarding gep that also provides equations to predict the effect of operating parameters and feed water characteristics on the properties of the produced saew and process optimization therefore this study utilizes the gep model to optimize saew production reduce the time consuming and arduous experimental work and compare with previously tested models this study aims to contribute to the existing body of knowledge regarding the efficient production of ew this work specifically intends to highlight the effect of reactor operational parameters and feed water characteristics develop a gep model to optimize the saew production for the first time and validate the proposed mathematical model by comparing the experimental and gep predicted results 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials analytical grade caco3 cacl2 and sodium hydroxide naoh were purchased from

genetic programming gp that uses the fundamental principles of the genetic algorithm ga 40 the three algorithms differ in the representation of individuals ga presents individuals as linear strings of fixed length chromosomes gp features individuals as nonlinear entities of different sizes and shapes parse trees whereas in the case of gep individuals are encoded as linear strings of fixed length genome which are then expressed as nonlinear units of diverse sizes and forms expression trees 33 40 gep defines the relationships between the variables in the datasets in gep algebraic expressions

software v 5 0 obtained from www gepsoft com was used in this study to develop mathematical functions for the optimization of independent variables and their effect on saew generation the number of generations used to train the models ranged from 500 to 1000 five input parameters voltage afr ac phf and ffr were considered as independent variables input for the data with acc and the ph of the saew was taken as the output dependent variable although the presence of om affected the acc and ph of the saew in the experimental work it was exempted from the gep modeling because of data limitations the gep model was developed based on the experimental conditions however the parameters utilized in the model were separately tuned to obtain the best model the statistical details of the dataset from the lab work table 1 were used in the modeling after a random division of the data 70 for training and 30 for testing all datasets inputs and outputs were normalized within the range of 0 1 to avoid the excessive weight of large variance parameters and facilitate efficient training and testing of the gep model the constants in the model were randomly generated according to the standard benchmarks of keijzer and korns a constant value was generated by each model selected for calculation but it was within an interval of 0 10 with a probability of 0 3 indicating 30 constant terminals 41 the outcome of the gep model was evaluated by assessing the statistical coefficient of determination r2 and other indices 42 the statistical mean absolute error mae root mean square error rmse and

from the experimental work the weights of the input variables are calculated to determine the important parameters and their effects on the output of the model determination of influential parameters is essential in modeling to provide knowledge about particular contributing parameters which enhances the precision of the model a percentage contribution assessment was performed to ascertain the sensitivity of the parameters to the gep model all six employed performance matrices mape mae rmse and r2 to assess the performance of each predictive model and over the modeling phases and the proposed model is considered the advantage of performance matrices however some aspects might have conflicting information that additionally decreases the performance of the data analysis 27 43 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of voltage several studies have shown the effect of current amperage on the operation of electrolytic reactors in saew production however studies on the effect of voltage on ew production are lacking considering that voltage is the electromotive force responsible for the movement of electrons electric current through a circuit voltage is a parameter worth studying this study explored the impact of voltage on the properties of saew produced by operating the reactor at different voltages while keeping all the other parameters constant the effect was studied by operating the reactor at different voltages ranging from 3 8 to 3 1 v the results of the variations in acc ph and orp are shown in fig 2 a the acc levels rose steadily with increasing voltage except at 3 6 v where a slight drop was observed and then it increased again at 3 8 v the ph of the produced saew increased slightly with increasing voltage whereas the orp decreased the ezeike and hung 44 reported a general increase in orp values and acidic conditions lower ph as the voltage increased although this study is contrary to their report in terms of the orp and ph results probably due to differences in operation parameters the ph of the saew produced in this study remained within the saew ph range the highest acc was achieved at 3 8 v implying efficient saew production at this voltage 3 2 effect of feed water flow rate ffr according to the literature ffr is one of the most crucial parameters affecting the overall properties of saew during production the results in fig 2 b show the effect of varying ffr on the ph acc and orp of the saew produced in this study in general a decrease in the electrolysis efficiency was observed as the water flow rate increased a drastic reduction in acc levels occurred as the ffr increased from 3 l m to 12 l m with increased ph and decreased orp the ph and orp of the saew varied within a range of 2 76 6 58 and 246 7 31 0 mv respectively hsu 45 reported a similar trend in acc decrease with increasing ffr he attributed the decline in acc at higher feed water flow rates to shorter residence times and reaction times for the ions in the electrolytic reactor a similar situation may have occurred in this study hsu 46 further highlighted the effect of increasing ffr by reporting a decline in the acc and orp of the final saew product an optimum ffr increases the residence time of the electrolyte in the electrolysis cells resulting in higher acc production it can be observed from the results that the highest acc recorded in this study can be found in the ffr test with the optimum value of 6 5 l m this demonstrates the crucial role of ffr in the production of saew 3 3 effect of acid concentration ac and acid flow rate afr several authors have reported the dependence of the saew properties on the concentration and dose of the electrolyte maruyama et al 47 reported that the acc produced in ew is determined mainly by the concentration of the electrolyte rather than the type in this study the effect of hcl concentration on the properties of saew was investigated using 1 6 ac and by varying the afr between 3 and 21 ml s the effects of ac and afr on the saew properties are presented in fig 3 a and b a significant increase in the acc was observed with increasing ac and afr the acc increased from 7 8 ppm at 1 ac to a high of 36 0 36 8 ppm at 6 ac the average ph of the saew decreased from 6 96 to 5 81 upon increasing ac with an expected increase in orp at higher acc afr showed a notably high acc of 44 ppm at 21 ml s and a low acc of 13 ppm at 3 ml s however the ph dropped to 3 85 at 21 ml s afr from a high of 6 85 at 3 ml s higher orp values were also observed as the afr increased the results from this section are consistent with those of hsu 45 and whangchai et al 48 who reported an increase in acc with increasing electrolyte concentration this observation was attributed to an increase in the concentration of electrolyte ions needed to undergo oxidation to produce chlorine gas as observed in this study the ezeike and hung 44 kim et al 49 and zhang et al 50 reported a decrease in ph with increasing acc and orp as the electrolyte concentration increased as recorded in this study jafry et al 51 showed an increase in the acc with increasing electrolyte dose similar to the results of this study however a drastic decline in the ph of the saew was observed when the afr increased to 21 ml s indicating the presence of other chlorine based compounds the ph of the saew at this afr was below the required ph range needed to be considered as saew which was the focus of this study consequently the concentration and dose of the electrolyte are the most critical factors for saew production an afr of 9 ml s and ac of 6 were employed for efficient production of saew in this work 3 4 effect of feed water temperature temperature is generally considered an essential variable in electrolysis because electrolysis reactions often require a certain amount of energy 52 this section focuses on the influence of a broad range of feed water temperatures on the properties of saew namely acc ph and orp as shown in fig 4 a the results revealed that acc was 34pmm at the starting temperature of 10 c and it increased steadily to 41 ppm at a temperature of 40 c a decrease in the ph value of the produced saew was observed along with an increase in orp values as the feed water temperature increased from 10 c to 40 c the ph of the saew decreased from an average of 6 09 at 10 c to 5 65 at 40 c while the orp increased from 69 3 to 84 5 mv with an increase in temperature the introduction of heat energy and electrical energy boosts the reaction rate during electrolysis an increase in solution temperature increases electrolytic conductivity because the increased temperature enhances the dissociation and ionization of molecules as well as the mobility of ions increased molecular collision the increased molecular collisions accelerate the passage of electrical current through the electrolyte resulting in increased electrolytic efficiency of the cell 53 additionally the increase in temperature may have enhanced the electrical conductivity of the electrodes by favoring the passage of current and thus reducing the electrical resistance 54 forghani et al 14 reported that saew produced with water heated to 40 c exhibited higher hocl levels indicating electrolytic efficiency with increasing temperature hsu 45 46 however reported an observation that was not seen in the present study they investigated the effect of feed water temperature on the ph orp and acc of ew and observed an insignificant temperature impact on the ph and orp with minor effects on acc levels the author attributed the low influence of temperature to a small range of temperatures studied the observed increase in acc and orp with increasing temperature indicates the economic efficiency of electrolysis at higher temperatures khelifa et al 55 recommended electrolysis at temperatures lower than 40 c because chlorate formation is reduced at temperatures lower than 40 c 3 5 effect of feed water ph phf the effect of phf on saew properties was studied using feed waters with ph values ranging from 6 to 9 the results fig 4b indicated a high acc level of 38 9 ppm at a phf 6 0 which decreased to 36 8 ppm when the phf rose to 6 5 the acc values remained stable between phf values of 6 5 to 8 and then a slight decrease in acc to 34 6 ppm was observed at phf 9 the initial increase in acc levels can be attributed to the increase in number of ions with the introduction of acidic feed water into the reactor increasing the phf resulted in a significant increase in the ph of the saew and a decrease in the orp levels pangloli and hung 18 investigated the effect of feed water hardness by varying the hard water ph they reported an increase in acc with an increase in phf from 5 to 8 as per their report the observed increase in acc was due to an increase in conductivity induced by the hardness of the water moreover they reported that phf had no significant effect on the ph and orp of saew however this study shows that ph of the saew rose from 3 25 at phf 6 to 6 31 at phf 9 the presence of a more acidic feed water at phf 6 0 introduced more hydrogen ions which lowered the ph of the saew to 3 25 however when the phf was near the neutral value a balanced concentration of hydrogen ions enabled the production of saew within the required ph range the orp also decreased from 219 mv to 46 4 mv as the phf increased acc and orp are weakly correlated because acc is a variable component of orp depending on ph 56 as the saew ph value increases the acc exists mostly as ocl instead of hocl therefore although the acc may be high the orp is likely to be lowered when the ph of the saew is increased although a higher acc was observed at a phf of 6 a phf of 7 45 produced saew with more consistent properties 3 6 effect of water hardness water hardness has been reported to influence the acc during electrolysis this can be attributed to the by products on the surface of the electrodes and those of the chlorine produced by the system 57 the primary cause of water hardness is known to be from calcium and magnesium carbonates calcium and magnesium metallic cations existing in water typically react with electrodes resulting in the deposition of sediments that can affect the efficiency of the electrolytic cell 58 also bicarbonate ions formed in the electrolysis system accelerate sediment deposition by forming caco3 precipitate in the solution and on reactor metal parts during an electrolysis process the total amount of chlorine produced is affected by the reactions of hardness forming salts ca2 and mg2 in solution with chlorine and the continuous deposition of sediments on electrodes 57 a series of experiments were conducted to test the effect of feed water hardness on saew production using simulated hard water by adding cacl2 and caco3 the results are presented in fig 5 a and b the results indicated minor changes in acc with increasing water hardness to a certain level and then the acc declined with further increase in water hardness for both salts under the same operating parameters the cacl2 hard water resulted in a higher acc of 31 ppm than 26 ppm at 50 mg l caco3 the acc remained stable between 33 and 36 ppm from 50 mg l to 250 mg l caco3 and increased slightly up to 37 ppm acc at 300 mg l caco3 however a slight decline in acc was observed when the hardness increased to 500 mg l caco3 34 35 ppm for caco3 hard water acc increased from a low 26 31 ppm at 50 mg l caco3 to 35 38 ppm at 250 mg l caco3 after this the acc decreased from the 35 38 ppm range to 34 36 ppm and 32 35 ppm at 300 mg l caco3 and 500 mg l caco3 respectively it can be observed from the results that a higher water hardness slightly favored higher acc levels the observed increase in acc with increasing water hardness can be attributed to a surge in conductivity and electrical efficiency resulting in higher acc 14 18 the presence of hardness causing minerals at higher concentrations expedites the formation of sediments that reduce current efficiency in an electrolytic cell 59 in the presence of calcium and hydro carbonate ions caco3 precipitates on the surface of electrodes and in solution the increased water hardness and the turbulent flow of water in the system facilitate the deposition of caco3 due to the increase in the mass exchange process on the electrode surface 60 although the available literature reports a decrease in ph with increasing water hardness this was not the same trend in this study in the case of caco3 it was difficult to establish a definite trend for the ph of the produced saew with increasing water hardness the ph fluctuated with increasing hardness until it stabilized at 300 and 500 mg l caco3 at 50 mg l caco3 the ph of the saew was between 5 71 and 5 91 increased to 6 20 6 25 at 70 mg l caco3 and decreased to 5 99 6 13 at 100 mg l caco3 the observed increase and decrease in ph continued until 300 and 500 mg l caco3 which became stable between ph 6 34 6 42 this observed fluctuation may be due to the effect of alkalinity introduced by carbonate ions a similar trend was observed with cacl2 but with minor fluctuations compared to the ph values recorded for caco3 hard water the observed minor changes in ph with the cacl2 hard water can be attributed to the absence of ions that influence the ph these results indicate that water hardness should be considered in the production of saew especially in cases where very high concentrations of hardness are suspected in this case further optimization of the production parameters might be required to increase the acc and its stability 3 7 effect of om content the values of acc free chlorine and total chlorine for the saew produced from the different water samples are presented in fig 6 saew generated with tw produced the highest free chlorine 34 8 ppm and total chlorine concentration of 37 6 ppm the saew from rw exhibited the lowest free chlorine concentration of 12 98 ppm with the total chlorine concentration of 34 7 ppm indicating that the detectable available chlorine mostly exists in the combined form in the presence of om the rwtw as feed water yielded free chlorine of 21 82 ppm with a total chlorine concentration of 35 3 ppm this observed reduction in free chlorine in favor of total chlorine is consistent with previous studies conducted by tanaka et al 61 park et al 62 jo et al 63 and oomori et al 64 who reported that free chlorine is converted to combined chlorine in the presence of organic materials the observed differences in the acc recorded for tw rw and rwtw can be attributed to free chlorine removal through oxidation reduction reactions with the om 65 fig 7 shows the effect of increasing toc levels on the concentration of acc acc levels decreased in response to increasing toc levels this observed trend agrees with reports by fang et al 66 and ogunniyi et al 67 on a drop in free chlorine with the increasing om load 3 8 proposed gep model evaluation the performance of the proposed gep model was assessed using an unseen dataset and statistical measures of r2 cc rmse and mae the predicted model outputs were then compared to the experimental results the expression trees and equations derived from the expression trees for acc and ph are presented in figs s1 and s2 and table s4 respectively in the supplementary data the functions and parameters utilized in gep development are shown in table s5 the mathematical form of the expression tree with corresponding numerical constants is presented in table s6 qpredict is the effect of the production parameters on the saew properties obtained from the model d0 denotes the ffr d1 represents the v d2 is ac d3 the afr and d4 indicates the phf the performance of the proposed gep models for the training and testing datasets are presented in table 2 the training phase showed good learning capability of the model with r2 values of 0 915 and 0 901 for acc and ph respectively however the r2 value slightly dropped to approximately 88 for both acc and ph in the testing phase because of the unseen dataset table 2 according to mansouri et al 33 the proposed model s goodness of fit and reliability can be deduced from r2 values close to 1 sadeghian and fam 68 however it pointed out that r2 closer to 1 is not always an indicator of the prediction of a perfect fit and it is only an index that a linear correlation exists between the experimental and predicted datasets therefore in this study the accuracy of the gep model is not only based on the r2 values other statistical indices such as cc rmse and mae were also evaluated the statistical evaluation parameters for the training and validation of the gep models are presented in table 2 the results show that the models were effectively trained indicating a good correlation between the experimental and predicted outputs with minimum error values the rmse rse and mae records for the training sets of acc were 0 075 0 087 and 0 054 respectively with 0 391 0 461 and 0 239 respectively for the testing dataset similarly the error values from the ph model were 0 109 0 158 and 0 091 for training and 0 259 0 495 and 0 092 for the testing dataset respectively these error values indicate the excellent performance of the proposed model and can be helpful in predicting the actual values to a suitable level of accuracy 34 furthermore as shown in table 2 the cc showed higher training and testing values of 0 956 and 0 941 for acc and 0 949 and 0 938 for ph respectively fig 8 a and b illustrates the regression plot predictions for the testing datasets of acc and ph of the gep model from the results the proposed model showed an efficient input and output relation with r2 of 0 881 and 0 885 for the testing of acc and ph datasets respectively therefore the proposed model is suitable for predicting the effect of saew production parameters on the properties of the saew produced in a previous study proposed rsm and ann models predicted acc efficiently to optimize ew production using operating parameters 39 in this study both operating parameters and water characteristics were tested to predict acc and ph of the produced saew overall the results of the gep model were acceptable to predict acc and ph of saew but slightly less accurate than rsm and ann models this comparative analysis indicated the applicability of soft computing techniques in successfully predicting a relationship between saew production process variables and acc although surprise element is higher in machine learning tools the application of analytics tools selection of the best hyper parameters and algorithms training and testing of models using an unseen dataset can be helpful additionally analysis of the percentage contributions of the independent variables s3 supplementary data indicated that ac 51 3 was the most important variable followed by afr 41 9 and ffr 6 9 was the least contributing variable for acc in terms of the model ph output the phf contributed the most 45 followed by the ffr 30 ac 18 v 4 2 and afr with the least contribution of 2 2 the results from the predicted models indicate that the proposed model utilizes the influence of the input variables to predict the effect of the production parameters on the final product using the unseen dataset 4 conclusion the effects of the operating parameters and feed water characteristics on saew production were studied the voltage afr ac ffr phf water hardness and presence of om were investigated as experimental parameters this study demonstrated that the variations in ffr afr and ac had significant effects on the acc ph and orp of saew the presence of om also affected the acc of the saew significantly while no substantial influence was observed by varying the phf temperature hardness of the feed water and voltage the optimum parameters for production were found to be an ffr of 6 5 l min phf of 7 45 at 20 c using ac of 6 at an afr of 9 ml s with reactor operation at 3 8 v the proposed gep model showed a reliable prediction with correlation coefficient cc of 0 941 and 0 938 and coefficient of determination r2 of 0 885 and 0 880 respectively for acc and ph respectively and can be regarded as a substitute for optimizing saew generation with minimal experimental work future studies should investigate the optimization of ffr afr and ac in relation to the phf temperature and hardness of water and they should test the effect of om on saew properties using different water sources further work is also recommended to validate the gep results against other machine learning models using a different set of hyper parameters algorithms training and testing of models for an unseen testing dataset moreover including the effect of om content and other factors may open the door for model perfection in future studies credit authorship contribution statement rita e ampiaw

13068,slightly acidic electrolyzed water saew was produced through hydrochloric acid hcl electrolysis in a lab scale reactor equipped with titanium coated anode and cathode without a diaphragm the effect of changes in the production parameters voltage feed water flow rate ffr acid flow rate afr and acid concentration ac and feed water characteristics phf temperature organic matter om content and water hardness on the saew properties was evaluated based on the available chlorine concentration acc ph and oxidation reduction potential orp of the final product moreover a gene expression programming gep model was developed using the experimental results as a predictive tool to optimize the process the results indicated that variations in ffr ac afr and om significantly affected the saew properties in contrast no substantial effect was observed by varying the feed water s temperature ph voltage and hardness using tap water the optimal conditions to produce saew were observed at an ffr of 6 5 l min phf of 7 45 at 20 c using 6 ac at an afr of 9 ml s with reactor operation at 3 8 v the proposed gep model showed an efficient correlation coefficient cc of 0 941 and 0 938 and coefficient of determination r2 of 0 885 and 0 880 respectively for the unseen testing data to predict the acc and ph of the produced saew graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords free chlorine gene expression programming hypochlorous acid production parameters slightly acidic electrolyzed water 1 introduction along with general sanitary living conditions concerns regarding disinfection and sanitization protocols have become a topical issue with the recent outbreak of the coronavirus covid 19 pandemic to reduce the spread of pathogens various sanitizing methods have been used to disinfect palms surfaces and food products the covid 19 pandemic necessitated the enforcement of sanitizing measures and strict use of practical sustainable antiviral disinfectants alcohol based disinfectants have proved to be efficient in controlling widespread infections of the covid 19 virus 1 however the worldwide demand for these disinfectants created shortages in alcohol based sanitizers and it became difficult for manufacturers to keep up with the growing demand fully the quest for other efficient and safe disinfectants therefore increased drastically electrolyzed water ew is an alternative disinfectant that has gained much attention because of its relative ease of production and has been reported to have antimicrobial efficiency against viruses and bacteria 2 the ew with an active component hypochlorous acid hocl has been regarded as an effective sanitizer because of its proven efficacy in various sectors it has been applied in food sanitization 3 4 agriculture 5 7 and environmental and medical sterilization 8 9 because it non toxic and environmentally friendly slightly acidic electrolyzed water saew with a ph range of 5 0 6 5 is a type of ew that has been widely used and proven to have antimicrobial effects due to its high hocl concentration 10 12 it is produced by the electrolysis of a hydrochloric acid hcl and or sodium chloride nacl solution in an electrolytic cell with no diaphragm separating the anode and cathode 13 saew is rapidly becoming a popular sanitizer because of its advantages over other types of ew it exhibits effective antimicrobial action at relatively low available chlorine concentrations reducing the corrosion of production electrodes and equipment by chlorine 14 therefore there is a growing interest in applying saew as an eco friendly disinfectant 15 17 nevertheless the characteristics of the saew produced by a generator are mainly dependent on the feed water characteristics and the operational parameters employed in the production process which may significantly affect its ph or available chlorine concentration acc 18 the properties of the source water are even more crucial because saew efficiency requires a strict ph range of 5 0 6 5 however there is a lack of research and literature on the effect of varying feed water properties and operational parameters on the production of saew most studies have focused on the production of saew under standard conditions with little attention to the feed water hardness 14 a few studies have discussed the hardness of feed water at lower concentrations to the best of our knowledge no study has tested the impact of hardness on saew production at caco3 concentrations higher than 200 mg l existing studies related to the effect of organic matter om on hocl are mainly focused on testing the disinfection or sanitizing efficiency of the ew produced therefore it is imperative to investigate the influence of the physicochemical properties of feed water and operational parameters on saew production in this study a lab scale reactor was used to test the effect of feed water physicochemical characteristics and operating parameters on saew production with real and simulated feed water recent advances in soft computing have increased the use of computer aided models for developing and predicting the relationship between operational parameters and system efficiency predictive artificial intelligence ai models potentially maximize the work of environmental engineers and scientists by eliminating the extra burden of tedious experimental work and the cost of labor 19 the ai models can be used in simple to complex networks to predict results that correspond or are close in value to the experimental results for optimizing process mechanisms 20 22 artificial neural networks anns are the most commonly used soft computing tools and have been successfully employed in numerous studies 23 27 ann progresses continuously with different training algorithms development and suitable data input procedures to improve process optimization 28 gene expression programming gep is another robust computing technique representing output using simplified mathematical equations and is suitable for practical applications with higher prediction accuracy 29 the gep has been reported to have a significantly better performance capability and surpass conventional genetic programming gp and genetic algorithm ga by two or more orders of significance 30 notably gep has been stated as a robust and problem independent algorithm as tested in academia industry and real world applications 31 it evaluates all chromosomes according to predefined fitness functions and reproduces the next generation through more genetic functions until the individual with the best fitness is chosen as the output this makes gep helpful in modeling the effects of parameters on process efficiency 32 although various researchers have utilized the gep technique in multiple fields in recent years 33 38 one study reported the application of response surface methodology rsm and ann models to optimize ew production where the rsm model provided an equation to determine the relationship between operating parameters and hocl production 39 the authors proved the feasibility of the proposed rsm quadratic and ann models for acc prediction and reported that ffr ac and afr have a significant effect on the concentration of the acc in ew production this work showed the viability of soft computing techniques in predicting a relationship between hocl production process variables and the acc 39 to the best of our knowledge there is no record in the literature regarding gep that also provides equations to predict the effect of operating parameters and feed water characteristics on the properties of the produced saew and process optimization therefore this study utilizes the gep model to optimize saew production reduce the time consuming and arduous experimental work and compare with previously tested models this study aims to contribute to the existing body of knowledge regarding the efficient production of ew this work specifically intends to highlight the effect of reactor operational parameters and feed water characteristics develop a gep model to optimize the saew production for the first time and validate the proposed mathematical model by comparing the experimental and gep predicted results 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials analytical grade caco3 cacl2 and sodium hydroxide naoh were purchased from

three types of water were tested to generate saew under the same conditions to test the effect of om river water rw from the nakdong river in gumi a mixture of river water and tap water rwtw and tw further tests for the effect of organics were conducted using water from kumoh lake in gumi water collected from the lake was mixed with tap water in different ratios to obtain toc concentrations of 1

orp and ph were immediately measured however while testing the effect of water hardness and om orp could not be measured because the introduction of other chemicals affected the results for each

genetic programming gp that uses the fundamental principles of the genetic algorithm ga 40 the three algorithms differ in the representation of individuals ga presents individuals as linear strings of fixed length chromosomes gp features individuals as nonlinear entities of different sizes and shapes parse trees whereas in the case of gep individuals are encoded as linear strings of fixed length genome which are then expressed as nonlinear units of diverse sizes and forms expression trees 33 40 gep defines the relationships between the variables in the datasets in gep algebraic expressions

software v 5 0 obtained from www gepsoft com was used in this study to develop mathematical functions for the optimization of independent variables and their effect on saew generation the number of generations used to train the models ranged from 500 to 1000 five input parameters voltage afr ac phf and ffr were considered as independent variables input for the data with acc and the ph of the saew was taken as the output dependent variable although the presence of om affected the acc and ph of the saew in the experimental work it was exempted from the gep modeling because of data limitations the gep model was developed based on the experimental conditions however the parameters utilized in the model were separately tuned to obtain the best model the statistical details of the dataset from the lab work table 1 were used in the modeling after a random division of the data 70 for training and 30 for testing all datasets inputs and outputs were normalized within the range of 0 1 to avoid the excessive weight of large variance parameters and facilitate efficient training and testing of the gep model the constants in the model were randomly generated according to the standard benchmarks of keijzer and korns a constant value was generated by each model selected for calculation but it was within an interval of 0 10 with a probability of 0 3 indicating 30 constant terminals 41 the outcome of the gep model was evaluated by assessing the statistical coefficient of determination r2 and other indices 42 the statistical mean absolute error mae root mean square error rmse and

from the experimental work the weights of the input variables are calculated to determine the important parameters and their effects on the output of the model determination of influential parameters is essential in modeling to provide knowledge about particular contributing parameters which enhances the precision of the model a percentage contribution assessment was performed to ascertain the sensitivity of the parameters to the gep model all six employed performance matrices mape mae rmse and r2 to assess the performance of each predictive model and over the modeling phases and the proposed model is considered the advantage of performance matrices however some aspects might have conflicting information that additionally decreases the performance of the data analysis 27 43 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of voltage several studies have shown the effect of current amperage on the operation of electrolytic reactors in saew production however studies on the effect of voltage on ew production are lacking considering that voltage is the electromotive force responsible for the movement of electrons electric current through a circuit voltage is a parameter worth studying this study explored the impact of voltage on the properties of saew produced by operating the reactor at different voltages while keeping all the other parameters constant the effect was studied by operating the reactor at different voltages ranging from 3 8 to 3 1 v the results of the variations in acc ph and orp are shown in fig 2 a the acc levels rose steadily with increasing voltage except at 3 6 v where a slight drop was observed and then it increased again at 3 8 v the ph of the produced saew increased slightly with increasing voltage whereas the orp decreased the ezeike and hung 44 reported a general increase in orp values and acidic conditions lower ph as the voltage increased although this study is contrary to their report in terms of the orp and ph results probably due to differences in operation parameters the ph of the saew produced in this study remained within the saew ph range the highest acc was achieved at 3 8 v implying efficient saew production at this voltage 3 2 effect of feed water flow rate ffr according to the literature ffr is one of the most crucial parameters affecting the overall properties of saew during production the results in fig 2 b show the effect of varying ffr on the ph acc and orp of the saew produced in this study in general a decrease in the electrolysis efficiency was observed as the water flow rate increased a drastic reduction in acc levels occurred as the ffr increased from 3 l m to 12 l m with increased ph and decreased orp the ph and orp of the saew varied within a range of 2 76 6 58 and 246 7 31 0 mv respectively hsu 45 reported a similar trend in acc decrease with increasing ffr he attributed the decline in acc at higher feed water flow rates to shorter residence times and reaction times for the ions in the electrolytic reactor a similar situation may have occurred in this study hsu 46 further highlighted the effect of increasing ffr by reporting a decline in the acc and orp of the final saew product an optimum ffr increases the residence time of the electrolyte in the electrolysis cells resulting in higher acc production it can be observed from the results that the highest acc recorded in this study can be found in the ffr test with the optimum value of 6 5 l m this demonstrates the crucial role of ffr in the production of saew 3 3 effect of acid concentration ac and acid flow rate afr several authors have reported the dependence of the saew properties on the concentration and dose of the electrolyte maruyama et al 47 reported that the acc produced in ew is determined mainly by the concentration of the electrolyte rather than the type in this study the effect of hcl concentration on the properties of saew was investigated using 1 6 ac and by varying the afr between 3 and 21 ml s the effects of ac and afr on the saew properties are presented in fig 3 a and b a significant increase in the acc was observed with increasing ac and afr the acc increased from 7 8 ppm at 1 ac to a high of 36 0 36 8 ppm at 6 ac the average ph of the saew decreased from 6 96 to 5 81 upon increasing ac with an expected increase in orp at higher acc afr showed a notably high acc of 44 ppm at 21 ml s and a low acc of 13 ppm at 3 ml s however the ph dropped to 3 85 at 21 ml s afr from a high of 6 85 at 3 ml s higher orp values were also observed as the afr increased the results from this section are consistent with those of hsu 45 and whangchai et al 48 who reported an increase in acc with increasing electrolyte concentration this observation was attributed to an increase in the concentration of electrolyte ions needed to undergo oxidation to produce chlorine gas as observed in this study the ezeike and hung 44 kim et al 49 and zhang et al 50 reported a decrease in ph with increasing acc and orp as the electrolyte concentration increased as recorded in this study jafry et al 51 showed an increase in the acc with increasing electrolyte dose similar to the results of this study however a drastic decline in the ph of the saew was observed when the afr increased to 21 ml s indicating the presence of other chlorine based compounds the ph of the saew at this afr was below the required ph range needed to be considered as saew which was the focus of this study consequently the concentration and dose of the electrolyte are the most critical factors for saew production an afr of 9 ml s and ac of 6 were employed for efficient production of saew in this work 3 4 effect of feed water temperature temperature is generally considered an essential variable in electrolysis because electrolysis reactions often require a certain amount of energy 52 this section focuses on the influence of a broad range of feed water temperatures on the properties of saew namely acc ph and orp as shown in fig 4 a the results revealed that acc was 34pmm at the starting temperature of 10 c and it increased steadily to 41 ppm at a temperature of 40 c a decrease in the ph value of the produced saew was observed along with an increase in orp values as the feed water temperature increased from 10 c to 40 c the ph of the saew decreased from an average of 6 09 at 10 c to 5 65 at 40 c while the orp increased from 69 3 to 84 5 mv with an increase in temperature the introduction of heat energy and electrical energy boosts the reaction rate during electrolysis an increase in solution temperature increases electrolytic conductivity because the increased temperature enhances the dissociation and ionization of molecules as well as the mobility of ions increased molecular collision the increased molecular collisions accelerate the passage of electrical current through the electrolyte resulting in increased electrolytic efficiency of the cell 53 additionally the increase in temperature may have enhanced the electrical conductivity of the electrodes by favoring the passage of current and thus reducing the electrical resistance 54 forghani et al 14 reported that saew produced with water heated to 40 c exhibited higher hocl levels indicating electrolytic efficiency with increasing temperature hsu 45 46 however reported an observation that was not seen in the present study they investigated the effect of feed water temperature on the ph orp and acc of ew and observed an insignificant temperature impact on the ph and orp with minor effects on acc levels the author attributed the low influence of temperature to a small range of temperatures studied the observed increase in acc and orp with increasing temperature indicates the economic efficiency of electrolysis at higher temperatures khelifa et al 55 recommended electrolysis at temperatures lower than 40 c because chlorate formation is reduced at temperatures lower than 40 c 3 5 effect of feed water ph phf the effect of phf on saew properties was studied using feed waters with ph values ranging from 6 to 9 the results fig 4b indicated a high acc level of 38 9 ppm at a phf 6 0 which decreased to 36 8 ppm when the phf rose to 6 5 the acc values remained stable between phf values of 6 5 to 8 and then a slight decrease in acc to 34 6 ppm was observed at phf 9 the initial increase in acc levels can be attributed to the increase in number of ions with the introduction of acidic feed water into the reactor increasing the phf resulted in a significant increase in the ph of the saew and a decrease in the orp levels pangloli and hung 18 investigated the effect of feed water hardness by varying the hard water ph they reported an increase in acc with an increase in phf from 5 to 8 as per their report the observed increase in acc was due to an increase in conductivity induced by the hardness of the water moreover they reported that phf had no significant effect on the ph and orp of saew however this study shows that ph of the saew rose from 3 25 at phf 6 to 6 31 at phf 9 the presence of a more acidic feed water at phf 6 0 introduced more hydrogen ions which lowered the ph of the saew to 3 25 however when the phf was near the neutral value a balanced concentration of hydrogen ions enabled the production of saew within the required ph range the orp also decreased from 219 mv to 46 4 mv as the phf increased acc and orp are weakly correlated because acc is a variable component of orp depending on ph 56 as the saew ph value increases the acc exists mostly as ocl instead of hocl therefore although the acc may be high the orp is likely to be lowered when the ph of the saew is increased although a higher acc was observed at a phf of 6 a phf of 7 45 produced saew with more consistent properties 3 6 effect of water hardness water hardness has been reported to influence the acc during electrolysis this can be attributed to the by products on the surface of the electrodes and those of the chlorine produced by the system 57 the primary cause of water hardness is known to be from calcium and magnesium carbonates calcium and magnesium metallic cations existing in water typically react with electrodes resulting in the deposition of sediments that can affect the efficiency of the electrolytic cell 58 also bicarbonate ions formed in the electrolysis system accelerate sediment deposition by forming caco3 precipitate in the solution and on reactor metal parts during an electrolysis process the total amount of chlorine produced is affected by the reactions of hardness forming salts ca2 and mg2 in solution with chlorine and the continuous deposition of sediments on electrodes 57 a series of experiments were conducted to test the effect of feed water hardness on saew production using simulated hard water by adding cacl2 and caco3 the results are presented in fig 5 a and b the results indicated minor changes in acc with increasing water hardness to a certain level and then the acc declined with further increase in water hardness for both salts under the same operating parameters the cacl2 hard water resulted in a higher acc of 31 ppm than 26 ppm at 50 mg l caco3 the acc remained stable between 33 and 36 ppm from 50 mg l to 250 mg l caco3 and increased slightly up to 37 ppm acc at 300 mg l caco3 however a slight decline in acc was observed when the hardness increased to 500 mg l caco3 34 35 ppm for caco3 hard water acc increased from a low 26 31 ppm at 50 mg l caco3 to 35 38 ppm at 250 mg l caco3 after this the acc decreased from the 35 38 ppm range to 34 36 ppm and 32 35 ppm at 300 mg l caco3 and 500 mg l caco3 respectively it can be observed from the results that a higher water hardness slightly favored higher acc levels the observed increase in acc with increasing water hardness can be attributed to a surge in conductivity and electrical efficiency resulting in higher acc 14 18 the presence of hardness causing minerals at higher concentrations expedites the formation of sediments that reduce current efficiency in an electrolytic cell 59 in the presence of calcium and hydro carbonate ions caco3 precipitates on the surface of electrodes and in solution the increased water hardness and the turbulent flow of water in the system facilitate the deposition of caco3 due to the increase in the mass exchange process on the electrode surface 60 although the available literature reports a decrease in ph with increasing water hardness this was not the same trend in this study in the case of caco3 it was difficult to establish a definite trend for the ph of the produced saew with increasing water hardness the ph fluctuated with increasing hardness until it stabilized at 300 and 500 mg l caco3 at 50 mg l caco3 the ph of the saew was between 5 71 and 5 91 increased to 6 20 6 25 at 70 mg l caco3 and decreased to 5 99 6 13 at 100 mg l caco3 the observed increase and decrease in ph continued until 300 and 500 mg l caco3 which became stable between ph 6 34 6 42 this observed fluctuation may be due to the effect of alkalinity introduced by carbonate ions a similar trend was observed with cacl2 but with minor fluctuations compared to the ph values recorded for caco3 hard water the observed minor changes in ph with the cacl2 hard water can be attributed to the absence of ions that influence the ph these results indicate that water hardness should be considered in the production of saew especially in cases where very high concentrations of hardness are suspected in this case further optimization of the production parameters might be required to increase the acc and its stability 3 7 effect of om content the values of acc free chlorine and total chlorine for the saew produced from the different water samples are presented in fig 6 saew generated with tw produced the highest free chlorine 34 8 ppm and total chlorine concentration of 37 6 ppm the saew from rw exhibited the lowest free chlorine concentration of 12 98 ppm with the total chlorine concentration of 34 7 ppm indicating that the detectable available chlorine mostly exists in the combined form in the presence of om the rwtw as feed water yielded free chlorine of 21 82 ppm with a total chlorine concentration of 35 3 ppm this observed reduction in free chlorine in favor of total chlorine is consistent with previous studies conducted by tanaka et al 61 park et al 62 jo et al 63 and oomori et al 64 who reported that free chlorine is converted to combined chlorine in the presence of organic materials the observed differences in the acc recorded for tw rw and rwtw can be attributed to free chlorine removal through oxidation reduction reactions with the om 65 fig 7 shows the effect of increasing toc levels on the concentration of acc acc levels decreased in response to increasing toc levels this observed trend agrees with reports by fang et al 66 and ogunniyi et al 67 on a drop in free chlorine with the increasing om load 3 8 proposed gep model evaluation the performance of the proposed gep model was assessed using an unseen dataset and statistical measures of r2 cc rmse and mae the predicted model outputs were then compared to the experimental results the expression trees and equations derived from the expression trees for acc and ph are presented in figs s1 and s2 and table s4 respectively in the supplementary data the functions and parameters utilized in gep development are shown in table s5 the mathematical form of the expression tree with corresponding numerical constants is presented in table s6 qpredict is the effect of the production parameters on the saew properties obtained from the model d0 denotes the ffr d1 represents the v d2 is ac d3 the afr and d4 indicates the phf the performance of the proposed gep models for the training and testing datasets are presented in table 2 the training phase showed good learning capability of the model with r2 values of 0 915 and 0 901 for acc and ph respectively however the r2 value slightly dropped to approximately 88 for both acc and ph in the testing phase because of the unseen dataset table 2 according to mansouri et al 33 the proposed model s goodness of fit and reliability can be deduced from r2 values close to 1 sadeghian and fam 68 however it pointed out that r2 closer to 1 is not always an indicator of the prediction of a perfect fit and it is only an index that a linear correlation exists between the experimental and predicted datasets therefore in this study the accuracy of the gep model is not only based on the r2 values other statistical indices such as cc rmse and mae were also evaluated the statistical evaluation parameters for the training and validation of the gep models are presented in table 2 the results show that the models were effectively trained indicating a good correlation between the experimental and predicted outputs with minimum error values the rmse rse and mae records for the training sets of acc were 0 075 0 087 and 0 054 respectively with 0 391 0 461 and 0 239 respectively for the testing dataset similarly the error values from the ph model were 0 109 0 158 and 0 091 for training and 0 259 0 495 and 0 092 for the testing dataset respectively these error values indicate the excellent performance of the proposed model and can be helpful in predicting the actual values to a suitable level of accuracy 34 furthermore as shown in table 2 the cc showed higher training and testing values of 0 956 and 0 941 for acc and 0 949 and 0 938 for ph respectively fig 8 a and b illustrates the regression plot predictions for the testing datasets of acc and ph of the gep model from the results the proposed model showed an efficient input and output relation with r2 of 0 881 and 0 885 for the testing of acc and ph datasets respectively therefore the proposed model is suitable for predicting the effect of saew production parameters on the properties of the saew produced in a previous study proposed rsm and ann models predicted acc efficiently to optimize ew production using operating parameters 39 in this study both operating parameters and water characteristics were tested to predict acc and ph of the produced saew overall the results of the gep model were acceptable to predict acc and ph of saew but slightly less accurate than rsm and ann models this comparative analysis indicated the applicability of soft computing techniques in successfully predicting a relationship between saew production process variables and acc although surprise element is higher in machine learning tools the application of analytics tools selection of the best hyper parameters and algorithms training and testing of models using an unseen dataset can be helpful additionally analysis of the percentage contributions of the independent variables s3 supplementary data indicated that ac 51 3 was the most important variable followed by afr 41 9 and ffr 6 9 was the least contributing variable for acc in terms of the model ph output the phf contributed the most 45 followed by the ffr 30 ac 18 v 4 2 and afr with the least contribution of 2 2 the results from the predicted models indicate that the proposed model utilizes the influence of the input variables to predict the effect of the production parameters on the final product using the unseen dataset 4 conclusion the effects of the operating parameters and feed water characteristics on saew production were studied the voltage afr ac ffr phf water hardness and presence of om were investigated as experimental parameters this study demonstrated that the variations in ffr afr and ac had significant effects on the acc ph and orp of saew the presence of om also affected the acc of the saew significantly while no substantial influence was observed by varying the phf temperature hardness of the feed water and voltage the optimum parameters for production were found to be an ffr of 6 5 l min phf of 7 45 at 20 c using ac of 6 at an afr of 9 ml s with reactor operation at 3 8 v the proposed gep model showed a reliable prediction with correlation coefficient cc of 0 941 and 0 938 and coefficient of determination r2 of 0 885 and 0 880 respectively for acc and ph respectively and can be regarded as a substitute for optimizing saew generation with minimal experimental work future studies should investigate the optimization of ffr afr and ac in relation to the phf temperature and hardness of water and they should test the effect of om on saew properties using different water sources further work is also recommended to validate the gep results against other machine learning models using a different set of hyper parameters algorithms training and testing of models for an unseen testing dataset moreover including the effect of om content and other factors may open the door for model perfection in future studies credit authorship contribution statement rita e ampiaw

13069,to guide optimization of electrochemical process for landfill leachate concentrate llc systematical experiments were performed on treating llc with electrooxidation eo electrocoagulation ec and various combined processes the results show that ec for 60 min followed by eo for 180 min gave the most satisfactory treatment performance in which the removal rates of toc uv254 cod and cn were 79 00 97 30 80 32 and 95 0 respectively three fluorescent components were identified in llc fulvic acid like substances c1 humic like c2 substances and long wave humus c3 by fluorescence excitation emission matrix coupled with parallel factor analysis eem palafac ec effectively remove most of humic like humus from llc and eo could remove fulvic acid fa and humic acid ha simultaneously and promote the transformation of fa to hydrophilic hyi compared with ec after eo eo ec eo after ec ec eo was more effective in reducing aromaticity and molecular weight and could remove humus more efficiently the characteristics of degrading organic matter from llc were further verified with xad 8 resin separation technology which is beneficial to reduce the treatment load of sequent eo improving the performance of ec to remove large molecule humic organic matters is vital to comprehensively manage landfill leachate with lower cost keywords electrooxidation electrocoagulation combined process refractory organic matter degrading characteristics 1 introduction to meet the current landfill leachate ll effluent discharge standards combined process of biological treatment and membrane treatment has been widely used in treating ll 1 although the effluent quality after membrane treatment has reached the discharge standard how to reasonably dispose of the landfill leachate concentrate llc produced in the membrane separation process has become another technical problem in the engineering application the efficient treatment of llc is the key problem of membrane technology application in ll treatment electrocoagulation ec and electrooxidation eo are the two most widely used technologies in electrochemical process which remove pollutants through in situ formation of flocculants and oxidants due to its high removal efficiency no additional chemicals operational feasibility and environmental compatibility electrochemical process has become an effective method for the treatment of complex wastewater 2 it can effectively reduce the content of a variety of pollutants in wastewater from heavy metals to persistent organic pollutants electrochemical process can replace existing conventional physical and chemical processes to degrade complex components 3 the llc shows poor biodegradable property as rich in refractory organic matter i e ha and fa and salt 4 which means it is difficult to effectively treat refractory organic pollutants with high load using only one treatment technique thus it requires a combination of two or more treatment techniques 5 ec and eo have also been widely used in the treatment of ll ghanbari et al 5 studied the performance of removing pollutants from ll by ec eo and achieved satisfactory results with the cod removal rate of 80 21 however most of the current studies are on the performance of treating biochemical effluent of ll by ec 6 eo 7 or a combination of both under different specified process conditions 8 9 less research has been done on the treatment of llc compared with the ll the llc has the following distinctive characteristics poorer biodegradable properties and high suv254 indicating that it contains a large number of complex organic compounds with plenty of aromatic hydrocarbon carbon in addition the llc contains higher contents of ca mg ba so4 2 and heavy metal ions which further lead to higher requirement for efficient treatment in the treatment of llc ren et al 10 founded that the long coagulation eo ec processes could treat the llc of cod 2589 mg l to meet the tough discharge standards but at a high current density of 60 ma cm2 ye et al 11 produced a multi channel electrochemical oxidation reactor to treat the llc for 3 h and the cod removal rate could reach 68 0 yazici et al 12 determined the optimal ec operating conditions in time of 15 min and current density of 3 5a and found that the removal rates of toc cod and cn reached 45 00 57 40 and 77 10 respectively it can be seen that a single electrochemical process has a limited effect on the treatment of the llc and cannot quickly remove contaminants without serious energy consumption so it is necessary to conduct a comparative study of ec eo and eo ec on the llc for process selection how to optimize the process and conditions for treating llc efficiently remains uncertain and needs to be systematically studied to guide the process optimization for llc understanding the characteristics and degradation rules of organic matter in the llc is of great significance 13 considering the heterogeneous composition of the ll there is no doubt that further understanding of the characteristics of removing different organic components in the llc by electrochemical process is of vital importance it can provide a new perspective for optimizing the removal of adverse components in the llc and better predicting the water quality of the concentrate after treatment 14 encouragingly classifying the organic matter with xad 8 resin has greatly made this analysis work feasible ding et al 15 identified the best process for pollutant removal through the separation and removal characteristics of organic matter wang et al 16 analyzed the removal characteristics of humic substances by the o3 through xad 8 resin fractionation besides wang et al 17 found the characteristics of organic matter by the o3 o3 h2o2 and o3 uv through the separation by xad 8 and infer the degradation pathway of ha he et al 18 obtained the relationship between the distribution of pollutants and their biological toxicity by classifying pollutants through the separation by xad 8 dia et al 19 studied the graded degradation characteristics of organic compounds in ll after ec it can be seen that by grading the organic matter in the llc the degradation characteristics of the organic matter by promising ec and eo processes can be better understood to provide valuable guidance for the practical process selection however little work has been done on classifying the organic matter in the ec eo process chain at present most studies on the effect of electrochemical treatment of llc mainly focus on the treatment and disposal of llc 20 but the types and structural transformation of organic compounds in ec eo or combination of ec and eo process have not been fully studied therefore this study carried out systematical experiments under different processing sequence and time of eo ec alone and their combined process firstly the removal efficiencies of toc cod uv254 cn and optimal conditions for each process were determined then three dimensional fluorescence parallel factor modeling was used to identify the most important fluorescence in the llc and to identify the transformation and removal laws under different reactions finally ultraviolet spectrum analysis and organic classification results illustrate the structural changes of refractory organic compounds in different process combinations and the characteristics of removing refractory organic humus pollutants the research outcome will provide valuable support to ll management especially llc management 2 material and methods 2 1 characterization of llc the water used in this experiment was llc after anaerobic anoxic oxic aao biological treatment from a waste incineration plant in zhejiang province china the effluent was brown black and was stored at 4 c in a refrigerator after retrieval the characteristics of the llc are presented in table 1 cd is conductivity cn is color number 2 2 experimental devices the ec and eo experiments were carried out using the device shown in fig 1 the reaction system was a cylindrical organic glass electrolytic cell as shown in fig 1 a with a height of 12 cm and a diameter of 7 cm iron fe aluminum al pbo2 and dsa ti ru ir which contains 8 g ru and 2 g ir per square meter were used as anodes whereas graphite was used as cathode and the effective area of immersion is 24 00 cm2 6 00 cm 4 00 cm 0 10 cm the distance between the electrodes is fixed to 1 cm by the hole punching distance of the cover plate the electrodes were polished with sandpaper before use cleaned with 1 mol l 1 hcl solution for 10 min then washed with deionized water successively and finally dried for use the whole experimental flow chart is shown in fig 1 b a regulated dc power supply wuxi anais jp5200d was used for the experimental power supply 2 3 experimental methods 2 3 1 ec 2 3 1 1 selection of anode plate commonly used ec treatment plates are fe or al because they are cheap and easily available at room temperature 200 ml of llc was added to the reactor and fe and al were initially used as the anode plates the reaction was performed at the current density of 25 ma cm2 and reaction times of 10 20 30 40 50 and 60 min under magnetic stirring conditions 150 rpm after the reaction completion followed by 30 min of precipitation the supernatant was collected and the cod was estimated to select the anode plate 2 3 1 2 determination of current density and time to control the influence of temperature during the ec process the reaction was performed at different current densities 10 15 20 25 and 30 ma cm2 at the initial ph of the llc based on the selected electrodes the reaction times were 10 20 30 40 50 and 60 min after the electrochemical reaction and 30 min of settling a water sample was obtained from the supernatant to measure the cod cn and toc 2 3 2 eo llc contains high amounts of chloride hence two anodes dsa and pbo2 were selected and the best one was determined based on the eo performance to study the influence of ph and current density on the anode efficiency of eo 200 ml of llc was introduced into the eo reactor then the water samples were filtered at selected intervals using a filter paper 0 45 Î¼m the filtrate was measured for cod toc cn and cd 2 3 3 joint process treatment to ensure the practical application of the two stage treatment process the ec supernatant was stored after sedimentation to prepare sufficient water samples for subsequent eo then the ph of this supernatant was adjusted for the eo reaction after the eo under the previous optimal conditions the water sample was stored to prepare sufficient water samples and then the ec reaction was conducted in the ec reactor 2 3 4 parallel factor analysis eem palafac analysis was performed with matlab r2014a following the tutorial of kathlee et al tutorials 21 before analysis the control eem milli q water was subtracted from each eem of the study sample and the rayleigh and raman scattering were removed using the optimized version of the eemscat algorithm in the dreem toolbox the main organic components in the llc were studied as well as the fluorescence removal characteristics and efficiency of different reaction stages 2 3 5 classification of organic pollutants and their removal and conversion efficiency according to the method reported by zomeren et al 22 amberlite xad 8 resin 40 60 mesh rohm and haas usa was used to separate dom into fractions of ha fa and hyi it was used to evaluate the removal efficiency and characteristics of the organic fractions in the treatment stages of ec eo ec eo and eo ec under the optimal conditions the specific steps are as follows first the llc was passed through a 0 45 Î¼m filter membrane to remove suspended solids then the ph was adjusted to less than 2 using 0 1 mol l h2so4 to form a precipitate the precipitate was separated into ha fractions via centrifugation and the ha was dissolved using 0 1 mol l naoh the toc was measured to characterize the ha content furthermore the supernatant was an fa hyi component and xad 8 resin was added to adsorb for 1 h the remaining substance was hyi and the toc was used to characterize its relative content at this point 0 1 mol naoh was used to rinse fa for 2 h and the toc was measured to characterize the fa content the classification process of specific organic matter is shown in fig 2 2 4 analytical and calculation methods cod was measured by rapid closed digestion method toc was measured with german elemental analysis instrument ph was measured with glass electrode ph meter cd was measured with conductivity meter the xrf spectra was used to indicate the element present and its concentration of sludge some metal ion was measured by atomic absorption spectrophotometer aas so4 2 was measured by barium chromate spectrophotometry the surface microstructure of electrode plate was observed by scanning electron microscopy sem chroma was denoted as color number cn and calculated using eq 1 23 1 cn a 436 2 a 525 2 a 620 2 a 436 a 525 a 620 where a436 a525 and a620 are the absorbance values of the concentrated solution at wavelengths of 436 nm 525 nm and 620 nm respectively the energy consumption of ec and eo is calculated in cod the calculation formula of unit energy consumption is using eq 2 2 eec 1000 uit co d 0 co d t v where eec is energy consumption kwh kg cod v is voltage u i is current a t is operation time h and v is the volume of the wastewater l cod0 is initial cod mg l codt is effluent water cod mg l the x cod or toc removal efficiency can be obtained from the following 3 r x 0 x t x 0 100 where x0 is initial x mg l xt is effluent water xt mg l at different processing times uv vis spectrophotometric analysis uv 3900 fluorophotometer was used for measurement and analysis the mode used is abs mode the scanning range is 220 600 nm the medium speed scanning is used and the sampling interval is 1 nm in the experiment 0 45 um filtration membrane was used the filtrated sample was placed in a 1 cm adaptable cuvette and deionized water was used as a blank control for full wavelength scanning the experimental results were plotted with origin software 3 results and discussion 3 1 the performance of ec process first fe and al anodes were used to determine the best material for processing llc at the same current density as shown in fig 3 for fe and al anodes cod removal rate increased rapidly in the first 40 min fe and al anodes were as high as 50 and 38 respectively and slowly increased in the following 20 min fe and al anodes were as high as 53 00 and 40 00 respectively indicating that the performance of fe anode was better than al anode in this study part of the reason is that under the same current intensity and reaction time the fe anode can dissolve more fe flocculant to remove contaminants 24 it is worth noting that the ec process of the two anodes was carried out under weak alkaline conditions in this study the cod removal rate of alkaline llc using fe anodes was higher than that of al anodes which is consistent with the research of predecessors 5 after the ec reaction pitting corrosion appeared on the surface of the fe anode as the fig s3 a shown which was caused by the dissolution of fe ions the comparison of the sem of the fe electrode before and after the reaction as the fig s4 shown further illustrated the dissolution of fe ions compared with the serious damage of the titanium plate in the study of ren et al 10 the fe anode was removed by pitting the entire plane although the pitting corrosion of the electrode plate during the reaction destroys the electrode plate this loss can be avoided by replacing the fe electrode plate for continuous reaction and recycling the scrap fe electrode plate for reprocessing from a cost perspective fe is relatively cheaper than al therefore fe anodes were selected for subsequent tests current density is one of the most important parameters to be considered in electrochemical treatment because it is directly related to the electrode dissolution rate the higher the applied current density the higher the power consumption and cost as shown in fig 4 a as the current density increased the cod degradation rate also increased after 60 min the cod degradation tends to be gentle with the increase in current density so 60 min was chosen as the best time when the current density increased from 25 ma cm2 to 30 ma cm2 the degradation rate of cod was not much different but the energy consumption was higher by 7 kwh kg cod as shown in fig 4 c so the current density of 25 ma cm2 was selected as the best current density as shown in fig 4 c the energy consumption changed in the ec process and gradually increased with the increase of the reaction time and current density the reason as follows on the one hand the decrease in the conductivity and the passivation of the electrode during the reaction increase ohmic resistance in llc as shown in fig 4 d and table s1 the ec has a significant effect on the removal of mg and ca some heavy metal ions and anion resulting in a decrease in cd and a decrease in electrolysis efficiency during the reaction process on the other hand the high ph after long term reaction hinders the formation of soluble iron hydroxide thereby reducing the efficiency of ec 24 moreover sludge management is an important component of any wastewater treatment facility and it also has a significant impact on the total cost of treatment 25 ec will produce a large amount of sludge so the analysis of the sludge after the reaction is very necessary as shown in fig s1 the proportion of sludge volume after 30 min settlement at different times at the optimal current density increased with the reaction time this is because of the formation of precipitation due to the constant production of fe ions then the type and the proportion of the element content in the sludge were analyzed as shown in fig s2 the main ionic components in sludge was fe whose proportion reaches to 36 that is because the electrode keeps dissolving during the reaction according to the change of metal ions contained as shown in table s1 and the proportion of the element content in the sludge sludge produced by ec is very dangerous therefore the disposal of the sludge produced by ec is very necessary which is also a direction of urgent research in the future 3 2 the performance of eo process study has shown that eo at ph value below 5 may promote the formation of undesirable by products such as chlorinated organic compounds 26 so the eo treatment was selected under the conditions of ph 5 7 9 and 11 value the cod removal rates under different anodes and ph values were shown in fig 5 a it can be seen that the cod removal rates of pbo2 at any ph value were higher than those of the dsa electrode and the removal rates under acidic conditions were higher than those under alkaline conditions this is because in the indirect eo mechanism chlorine species including cl2 clo and hocl are the main factors in the degradation of organic pollutants 12 and hocl has a higher degradation ability than chlorine and hypochlorite study 27 has shown that when ph 3 3 the primary active chloro species is cl2 while hocl is the dominant species when the ph continues to rise to 7 5 and when ph 7 5 ocl is the dominant species therefore under the condition of ph 5 hocl is the dominant species to enhance the indirect oxidation ability of eo so the pollutant removal ability is best at ph 5 therefore it is more suitable for chlorine mediated eo under acidic conditions moreover the pbo2 electrode plate has a mesh structure better than dsa so pbo2 was selected as the anode for eo for subsequent reactions compared with the ec anode the surface of the entire electrode plate after eo has little change as the fig s4 b shown after eo the content of pb increased from 0 20 to 0 25 mg l as the table s1 showed this phenomenon indicated the dissolution of the surface coating ions may occur as the fig s5 shown the sem analysis showed that the electrodes surface coating may be partially missing after the eo process it can be seen that the focus should be on how to control the stability of its coating in the future the effect of current density on cod removal is shown in fig 5 b as the current density increases it is found that the degradation rate of cod increases significantly the main reason as follows the increase in current density greatly increases the rate of electron transfer which promotes organic pollutants direct oxidation 28 on the other hand as the number of electrons in the reaction plate increases the strong oxidizing free chlorine generated increases and the indirect oxidation is also enhanced which speeds up the removal of cod however as the current density continued to increase from 25 ma cm2 the cod degradation efficiency was not much different the possible reason is that although the amount of free residual chlorine has increased the concentration of organic matter has decreased therefore at this time limiting the concentration of organic matter and reducing the current density are not the most important factor too the energy consumption gradually increases with the increase of current density as shown in fig 5 e due to the eo reaction time is longer generally 29 and increasing the current will significantly increase the side reaction and energy consumption 30 thus 30 ma cm2 was chosen as the most favorable current density under the optimal conditions the decolorization effect of the electrochemical oxidation on treating the llc is shown in fig 5 c the decolorization effect of the eo was obvious and the decolorization rate can reach more than 95 which reducing from cn 1 98 to cn 0 10 at the same time the removal rate of toc reached 40 6 as shown in fig 5 d 3 3 determination of the processing sequence and time of the combined process in order to determine the sequence and processing time of ec and eo in the two stage process the optimized ec or eo was initially used as the first stage of the electrochemical treatment process and then the eo or ec time was changed during the second stage to determine the best combination time and sequence of the combined treatment the experimental design conditions are shown in table 2 the pollutant removal efficiencies of the two stages were shown in fig 6 it can be seen from fig 6 that the removal efficiency of pollutants after the combined process were much higher than those when only a single process was used and the longer the reaction time in the second stage the higher the removal efficiency this shows that the combined electrochemical treatment process has considerable advantages in general the p3 process is the most effective and the cn change was shown in fig 7 and the overall removal rates of p1 p2 p3 were better than those of p4 p5 and p6 the possible reason is due to the high concentration of the llc so the oxidation caused by the first eo is not very effective however the ec treatment firstly can significantly reduce the pollutant content in the llc and facilitate further oxidation treatment thus significantly improving the efficiency of targeted organic pollutant removal in addition too high content of salt will hinder the growth of microorganisms which is one of the reasons why it is difficult to treat with biological methods 31 it can be seen from fig 7 that the p3 treatment process reduces the cd by 30 or so as shown in fig 4 d the concentration of ca2 and mg2 decreased by more than 50 after the reaction so ec may reduce the cd through the generated flocculant adsorption the co2 produced by the organic matter in llc can react with the hydroxide produced by the negative electrode to form carbonate the carbonate can combine with the large amounts of ca2 and mg2 present in the llc to form a precipitate after the reaction a white precipitate is also observed on the negative electrode substrate resulting in a decrease in salinity 11 which may also be one of the reasons for the decrease in cd due to eo 3 4 degradation characteristics of organic matter 3 4 1 spectral analysis in order to determine the organic components in the llc before and after different process treatments the component identification was carried out by parallel factor analysis based on three dimensional 3d fluorescence parallel factor analysis three identified components were shown in fig s6 a b c the components are as follows component 1 ex em 235 400 as in the research of others is a typical humic acid like 32 component 2 ex em 250 455 is fulvic acid like 33 component 3 ex em 265 460 is long wave humus 34 just like research of shah et al s 35 the llc contains a large amount of refractory organics such as humic acid and fulvic acid study 36 has shown that humic acid like and fulvic acid like are a kind of macromolecular organic matter with a molecular weight of 1 100 kda and ozone oxidation can destroy its structure and convert it into protein intermediates making it effective for mineralization obviously the fluorescence intensity the specific values are shown in table 3 was significantly reduced regardless of the processing stage which indicates that the organic macromolecules may be degraded into non fluorescent compounds or removed from fig 8 it can be found that ec was more effective in c2 but were weak in removing the other two types of c1 and c3 on the contrary eo alone is very effective for various organic fluorescence compared with eo ec the organic fluorescence intensity of ec eo was smaller which means that after removing humic acid like organics by ec eo is easier to reduce the fluorescence intensity of other organics although eo first reduces the overall organic fluorescence the fluorescence intensity removed by ec is less this result shows that the eo can remove the pollutants more effectively when the organic humic acid like organic matter is primarily removed by ec the possible reason is that the ability of eo to target and remove organic matter is strengthened after removing humic acid like organic matter by ec as shown in fig 4 b and 5 d the removal rates of toc under the conditions of single ec and eo treatment were 58 6 and 40 6 respectively it can be seen that the single ec mainly removes organic matter and reduces the subsequent removal load of eo while eo may mainly convert organic matter instead of removing organic matter so the combined effect of the two electrolysis processes is different to further reveal the changes of organic matter during the electrolysis process some typical ultraviolet spectral characteristics e g suva254 e250 e365 were selected to describe the changes of organic matter the changes in the uv spectrum of the llc effluent at different treatment stages are shown in fig s7 the specific absorbance value is helpful to characterize the organic matter in the wastewater 35 the aromaticity of the effluents after ec eo ec eo and eo ec electrochemical treatment was characterized by suva254 37 while e250 e365 indicated the degree of humification and molecular weight during the reaction 38 it can be seen from table 3 that suva254 decreased from 0 063 to 0 026 0 029 0 015 and 0 022 by ec eo ec eo eo ec respectively it can be seen that the value of suva254 decreased in different reaction stages indicating that the aromaticity of the llc organic matter is weakened moreover suva254 of ec eo was reduced to the lowest level indicating that this method is indeed the most effective way to reduce aroma compared with other methods mentioned above the e250 e365 index rose from 4 40 to 17 50 29 00 and 26 00 respectively study has shown that the increase in e250 e365 is due to the degradation of macromolecules such as fulvic acid and humic acid and the production of low molecular weight intermediates 37 it can be found that ec alone does not increase the ratio of e250 e365 very much indicating that the destructive effect of ec on organic matter is not great the reason may be that ec only reduces macromolecular organic humus through adsorption and precipitation so it may make little contribution to the improvement of e250 e365 and eo ec indicates that eo is more destructive to organic matter and the increase of ec eo is more than that of eo ec also shows this problem indicating that ec removes part of the organic matter and then eo makes the organic matter more destructive as shown in figs 4 b 5 d and 6 the toc removal rates of ec eo were higher than those of eo ec and the removal of toc by ec and eo alone were 58 6 and 40 6 respectively which also explained this problem 3 4 2 degradation characteristics of organic humus the difference of organic matter classification between ec eo and eo ec is shown in fig 9 it can be found that the total amount of ha and fa in the llc accounts for more than 65 00 of toc and the content of fa is higher than that of ha between 54 00 and 60 00 the non biodegradable ha in the llc can be completely removed after 60 min of ec alone and 180 min of eo alone which is conducive to further biological treatment or other advanced treatments while fa is only partially removed the ha has a higher molecular weight than fa and hyi and ha and fa are mainly negatively charged therefore ha may be preferentially removed by the adsorption precipitation mechanism because negatively charged ha and fa and positively charged metals because of the electrostatic attraction of negatively charged ha and fa to positively charged metallic hydroxyl compounds it should be noted that after ec treatment the proportion of hydrophilic component did not increase significantly while the proportion of the hydrophilic component increased significantly after eo these results indicate that fa may be indirectly decomposed by eo and converted into non humic substances as shown in fig 9 fa was removed by about 10 after eo and the proportion of hyi in all substances increased slightly it is found that both eo ec and ec eo can completely remove ha component but the removal efficiency of fa component in eo ec treatment is significantly lower than that of ec eo treatment which may be because low molecular weight organics are more difficult to remove in the process of ec because they are more hydrophilic 39 therefore it is difficult to effectively degrade the insoluble organic matter i e ha and fa into components with smaller molecular weight and simpler structure during eo compared with ec eo there are more low molecular weight organic compounds in the wastewater after eo ec treatment which is difficult to remove by ec in addition ha can react with chlorine the most commonly used disinfectant and produce disinfection byproducts i e trihalomethane which are considered mutagenic and carcinogenic compounds 40 so prior removal of ha by ec can partially prevent chloroform production during eo ec treatment alone has almost no effect on the removal of hyi which indicates that the eo converts large molecules such as humic substances into small molecules of hyl compounds therefore large organic molecules are mainly removed by adsorption aggregation and co precipitation after eo treatment it was found that the increase in organic hyi indicates that eo may promote the conversion of macromolecular organic pollutants to small molecular hydrophilic substances 4 conclusions in this work the performance of treating llc and characteristics of removing organic matter with different electrochemical treatment processes were studied anode material and current density were found to greatly influence the treatment efficiencies of both ec and eo processes the best sequential electrochemical processes were ec 60 min followed by eo 180 min and the removal rates of toc and cod were 79 00 80 32 respectively under optimized process conditions ec was very effective in the removal of a large number of humic like humus from the concentrate but weak in the removal of fulvic acid like and long wave humus under this specified water quality conditions ec eo showed better performance of removing aromatic organic matter than eo ec both ec and eo alone can completely degrade ha component and eo can promote the conversion of some fa components to hyi component while ec only has a strong removal effect on ha component with large sludge production to deduce the treatment cost of llc and satisfy with the severe discharge standard more emphasis should be put on primary ec to improve removing large molecule organic matters such as humic substances however the optimized electrochemical processes for llc could only be obtained by comprehensively evaluating the material energy sludge disposal cost

13069,to guide optimization of electrochemical process for landfill leachate concentrate llc systematical experiments were performed on treating llc with electrooxidation eo electrocoagulation ec and various combined processes the results show that ec for 60 min followed by eo for 180 min gave the most satisfactory treatment performance in which the removal rates of toc uv254 cod and cn were 79 00 97 30 80 32 and 95 0 respectively three fluorescent components were identified in llc fulvic acid like substances c1 humic like c2 substances and long wave humus c3 by fluorescence excitation emission matrix coupled with parallel factor analysis eem palafac ec effectively remove most of humic like humus from llc and eo could remove fulvic acid fa and humic acid ha simultaneously and promote the transformation of fa to hydrophilic hyi compared with ec after eo eo ec eo after ec ec eo was more effective in reducing aromaticity and molecular weight and could remove humus more efficiently the characteristics of degrading organic matter from llc were further verified with xad 8 resin separation technology which is beneficial to reduce the treatment load of sequent eo improving the performance of ec to remove large molecule humic organic matters is vital to comprehensively manage landfill leachate with lower cost keywords electrooxidation electrocoagulation combined process refractory organic matter degrading characteristics 1 introduction to meet the current landfill leachate ll effluent discharge standards combined process of biological treatment and membrane treatment has been widely used in treating ll 1 although the effluent quality after membrane treatment has reached the discharge standard how to reasonably dispose of the landfill leachate concentrate llc produced in the membrane separation process has become another technical problem in the engineering application the efficient treatment of llc is the key problem of membrane technology application in ll treatment electrocoagulation ec and electrooxidation eo are the two most widely used technologies in electrochemical process which remove pollutants through in situ formation of flocculants and oxidants due to its high removal efficiency no additional chemicals operational feasibility and environmental compatibility electrochemical process has become an effective method for the treatment of complex wastewater 2 it can effectively reduce the content of a variety of pollutants in wastewater from heavy metals to persistent organic pollutants electrochemical process can replace existing conventional physical and chemical processes to degrade complex components 3 the llc shows poor biodegradable property as rich in refractory organic matter i e ha and fa and salt 4 which means it is difficult to effectively treat refractory organic pollutants with high load using only one treatment technique thus it requires a combination of two or more treatment techniques 5 ec and eo have also been widely used in the treatment of ll ghanbari et al 5 studied the performance of removing pollutants from ll by ec eo and achieved satisfactory results with the cod removal rate of 80 21 however most of the current studies are on the performance of treating biochemical effluent of ll by ec 6 eo 7 or a combination of both under different specified process conditions 8 9 less research has been done on the treatment of llc compared with the ll the llc has the following distinctive characteristics poorer biodegradable properties and high suv254 indicating that it contains a large number of complex organic compounds with plenty of aromatic hydrocarbon carbon in addition the llc contains higher contents of ca mg ba so4 2 and heavy metal ions which further lead to higher requirement for efficient treatment in the treatment of llc ren et al 10 founded that the long coagulation eo ec processes could treat the llc of cod 2589 mg l to meet the tough discharge standards but at a high current density of 60 ma cm2 ye et al 11 produced a multi channel electrochemical oxidation reactor to treat the llc for 3 h and the cod removal rate could reach 68 0 yazici et al 12 determined the optimal ec operating conditions in time of 15 min and current density of 3 5a and found that the removal rates of toc cod and cn reached 45 00 57 40 and 77 10 respectively it can be seen that a single electrochemical process has a limited effect on the treatment of the llc and cannot quickly remove contaminants without serious energy consumption so it is necessary to conduct a comparative study of ec eo and eo ec on the llc for process selection how to optimize the process and conditions for treating llc efficiently remains uncertain and needs to be systematically studied to guide the process optimization for llc understanding the characteristics and degradation rules of organic matter in the llc is of great significance 13 considering the heterogeneous composition of the ll there is no doubt that further understanding of the characteristics of removing different organic components in the llc by electrochemical process is of vital importance it can provide a new perspective for optimizing the removal of adverse components in the llc and better predicting the water quality of the concentrate after treatment 14 encouragingly classifying the organic matter with xad 8 resin has greatly made this analysis work feasible ding et al 15 identified the best process for pollutant removal through the separation and removal characteristics of organic matter wang et al 16 analyzed the removal characteristics of humic substances by the o3 through xad 8 resin fractionation besides wang et al 17 found the characteristics of organic matter by the o3 o3 h2o2 and o3 uv through the separation by xad 8 and infer the degradation pathway of ha he et al 18 obtained the relationship between the distribution of pollutants and their biological toxicity by classifying pollutants through the separation by xad 8 dia et al 19 studied the graded degradation characteristics of organic compounds in ll after ec it can be seen that by grading the organic matter in the llc the degradation characteristics of the organic matter by promising ec and eo processes can be better understood to provide valuable guidance for the practical process selection however little work has been done on classifying the organic matter in the ec eo process chain at present most studies on the effect of electrochemical treatment of llc mainly focus on the treatment and disposal of llc 20 but the types and structural transformation of organic compounds in ec eo or combination of ec and eo process have not been fully studied therefore this study carried out systematical experiments under different processing sequence and time of eo ec alone and their combined process firstly the removal efficiencies of toc cod uv254 cn and optimal conditions for each process were determined then three dimensional fluorescence parallel factor modeling was used to identify the most important fluorescence in the llc and to identify the transformation and removal laws under different reactions finally ultraviolet spectrum analysis and organic classification results illustrate the structural changes of refractory organic compounds in different process combinations and the characteristics of removing refractory organic humus pollutants the research outcome will provide valuable support to ll management especially llc management 2 material and methods 2 1 characterization of llc the water used in this experiment was llc after anaerobic anoxic oxic aao biological treatment from a waste incineration plant in zhejiang province china the effluent was brown black and was stored at 4 c in a refrigerator after retrieval the characteristics of the llc are presented in table 1 cd is conductivity cn is color number 2 2 experimental devices the ec and eo experiments were carried out using the device shown in fig 1 the reaction system was a cylindrical organic glass electrolytic cell as shown in fig 1 a with a height of 12 cm and a diameter of 7 cm iron fe aluminum al pbo2 and dsa ti ru ir which contains 8 g ru and 2 g ir per square meter were used as anodes whereas graphite was used as cathode and the effective area of immersion is 24 00 cm2 6 00 cm 4 00 cm 0 10 cm the distance between the electrodes is fixed to 1 cm by the hole punching distance of the cover plate the electrodes were polished with sandpaper before use cleaned with 1 mol l 1 hcl solution for 10 min then washed with deionized water successively and finally dried for use the whole experimental flow chart is shown in fig 1 b a regulated dc power supply wuxi anais jp5200d was used for the experimental power supply 2 3 experimental methods 2 3 1 ec 2 3 1 1 selection of anode plate commonly used ec treatment plates are fe or al because they are cheap and easily available at room temperature 200 ml of llc was added to the reactor and fe and al were initially used as the anode plates the reaction was performed at the current density of 25 ma cm2 and reaction times of 10 20 30 40 50 and 60 min under magnetic stirring conditions 150 rpm after the reaction completion followed by 30 min of precipitation the supernatant was collected and the cod was estimated to select the anode plate 2 3 1 2 determination of current density and time to control the influence of temperature during the ec process the reaction was performed at different current densities 10 15 20 25 and 30 ma cm2 at the initial ph of the llc based on the selected electrodes the reaction times were 10 20 30 40 50 and 60 min after the electrochemical reaction and 30 min of settling a water sample was obtained from the supernatant to measure the cod cn and toc 2 3 2 eo llc contains high amounts of chloride hence two anodes dsa and pbo2 were selected and the best one was determined based on the eo performance to study the influence of ph and current density on the anode efficiency of eo 200 ml of llc was introduced into the eo reactor then the water samples were filtered at selected intervals using a filter paper 0 45 Î¼m the filtrate was measured for cod toc cn and cd 2 3 3 joint process treatment to ensure the practical application of the two stage treatment process the ec supernatant was stored after sedimentation to prepare sufficient water samples for subsequent eo then the ph of this supernatant was adjusted for the eo reaction after the eo under the previous optimal conditions the water sample was stored to prepare sufficient water samples and then the ec reaction was conducted in the ec reactor 2 3 4 parallel factor analysis eem palafac analysis was performed with matlab r2014a following the tutorial of kathlee et al tutorials 21 before analysis the control eem milli q water was subtracted from each eem of the study sample and the rayleigh and raman scattering were removed using the optimized version of the eemscat algorithm in the dreem toolbox the main organic components in the llc were studied as well as the fluorescence removal characteristics and efficiency of different reaction stages 2 3 5 classification of organic pollutants and their removal and conversion efficiency according to the method reported by zomeren et al 22 amberlite xad 8 resin 40 60 mesh rohm and haas usa was used to separate dom into fractions of ha fa and hyi it was used to evaluate the removal efficiency and characteristics of the organic fractions in the treatment stages of ec eo ec eo and eo ec under the optimal conditions the specific steps are as follows first the llc was passed through a 0 45 Î¼m filter membrane to remove suspended solids then the ph was adjusted to less than 2 using 0 1 mol l h2so4 to form a precipitate the precipitate was separated into ha fractions via centrifugation and the ha was dissolved using 0 1 mol l naoh the toc was measured to characterize the ha content furthermore the supernatant was an fa hyi component and xad 8 resin was added to adsorb for 1 h the remaining substance was hyi and the toc was used to characterize its relative content at this point 0 1 mol naoh was used to rinse fa for 2 h and the toc was measured to characterize the fa content the classification process of specific organic matter is shown in fig 2 2 4 analytical and calculation methods cod was measured by rapid closed digestion method toc was measured with german elemental analysis instrument ph was measured with glass electrode ph meter cd was measured with conductivity meter the xrf spectra was used to indicate the element present and its concentration of sludge some metal ion was measured by atomic absorption spectrophotometer aas so4 2 was measured by barium chromate spectrophotometry the surface microstructure of electrode plate was observed by scanning electron microscopy sem chroma was denoted as color number cn and calculated using eq 1 23 1 cn a 436 2 a 525 2 a 620 2 a 436 a 525 a 620 where a436 a525 and a620 are the absorbance values of the concentrated solution at wavelengths of 436 nm 525 nm and 620 nm respectively the energy consumption of ec and eo is calculated in cod the calculation formula of unit energy consumption is using eq 2 2 eec 1000 uit co d 0 co d t v where eec is energy consumption kwh kg cod v is voltage u i is current a t is operation time h and v is the volume of the wastewater l cod0 is initial cod mg l codt is effluent water cod mg l the x cod or toc removal efficiency can be obtained from the following 3 r x 0 x t x 0 100 where x0 is initial x mg l xt is effluent water xt mg l at different processing times uv vis spectrophotometric analysis uv 3900 fluorophotometer was used for measurement and analysis the mode used is abs mode the scanning range is 220 600 nm the medium speed scanning is used and the sampling interval is 1 nm in the experiment 0 45 um filtration membrane was used the filtrated sample was placed in a 1 cm adaptable cuvette and deionized water was used as a blank control for full wavelength scanning the experimental results were plotted with origin software 3 results and discussion 3 1 the performance of ec process first fe and al anodes were used to determine the best material for processing llc at the same current density as shown in fig 3 for fe and al anodes cod removal rate increased rapidly in the first 40 min fe and al anodes were as high as 50 and 38 respectively and slowly increased in the following 20 min fe and al anodes were as high as 53 00 and 40 00 respectively indicating that the performance of fe anode was better than al anode in this study part of the reason is that under the same current intensity and reaction time the fe anode can dissolve more fe flocculant to remove contaminants 24 it is worth noting that the ec process of the two anodes was carried out under weak alkaline conditions in this study the cod removal rate of alkaline llc using fe anodes was higher than that of al anodes which is consistent with the research of predecessors 5 after the ec reaction pitting corrosion appeared on the surface of the fe anode as the fig s3 a shown which was caused by the dissolution of fe ions the comparison of the sem of the fe electrode before and after the reaction as the fig s4 shown further illustrated the dissolution of fe ions compared with the serious damage of the titanium plate in the study of ren et al 10 the fe anode was removed by pitting the entire plane although the pitting corrosion of the electrode plate during the reaction destroys the electrode plate this loss can be avoided by replacing the fe electrode plate for continuous reaction and recycling the scrap fe electrode plate for reprocessing from a cost perspective fe is relatively cheaper than al therefore fe anodes were selected for subsequent tests current density is one of the most important parameters to be considered in electrochemical treatment because it is directly related to the electrode dissolution rate the higher the applied current density the higher the power consumption and cost as shown in fig 4 a as the current density increased the cod degradation rate also increased after 60 min the cod degradation tends to be gentle with the increase in current density so 60 min was chosen as the best time when the current density increased from 25 ma cm2 to 30 ma cm2 the degradation rate of cod was not much different but the energy consumption was higher by 7 kwh kg cod as shown in fig 4 c so the current density of 25 ma cm2 was selected as the best current density as shown in fig 4 c the energy consumption changed in the ec process and gradually increased with the increase of the reaction time and current density the reason as follows on the one hand the decrease in the conductivity and the passivation of the electrode during the reaction increase ohmic resistance in llc as shown in fig 4 d and table s1 the ec has a significant effect on the removal of mg and ca some heavy metal ions and anion resulting in a decrease in cd and a decrease in electrolysis efficiency during the reaction process on the other hand the high ph after long term reaction hinders the formation of soluble iron hydroxide thereby reducing the efficiency of ec 24 moreover sludge management is an important component of any wastewater treatment facility and it also has a significant impact on the total cost of treatment 25 ec will produce a large amount of sludge so the analysis of the sludge after the reaction is very necessary as shown in fig s1 the proportion of sludge volume after 30 min settlement at different times at the optimal current density increased with the reaction time this is because of the formation of precipitation due to the constant production of fe ions then the type and the proportion of the element content in the sludge were analyzed as shown in fig s2 the main ionic components in sludge was fe whose proportion reaches to 36 that is because the electrode keeps dissolving during the reaction according to the change of metal ions contained as shown in table s1 and the proportion of the element content in the sludge sludge produced by ec is very dangerous therefore the disposal of the sludge produced by ec is very necessary which is also a direction of urgent research in the future 3 2 the performance of eo process study has shown that eo at ph value below 5 may promote the formation of undesirable by products such as chlorinated organic compounds 26 so the eo treatment was selected under the conditions of ph 5 7 9 and 11 value the cod removal rates under different anodes and ph values were shown in fig 5 a it can be seen that the cod removal rates of pbo2 at any ph value were higher than those of the dsa electrode and the removal rates under acidic conditions were higher than those under alkaline conditions this is because in the indirect eo mechanism chlorine species including cl2 clo and hocl are the main factors in the degradation of organic pollutants 12 and hocl has a higher degradation ability than chlorine and hypochlorite study 27 has shown that when ph 3 3 the primary active chloro species is cl2 while hocl is the dominant species when the ph continues to rise to 7 5 and when ph 7 5 ocl is the dominant species therefore under the condition of ph 5 hocl is the dominant species to enhance the indirect oxidation ability of eo so the pollutant removal ability is best at ph 5 therefore it is more suitable for chlorine mediated eo under acidic conditions moreover the pbo2 electrode plate has a mesh structure better than dsa so pbo2 was selected as the anode for eo for subsequent reactions compared with the ec anode the surface of the entire electrode plate after eo has little change as the fig s4 b shown after eo the content of pb increased from 0 20 to 0 25 mg l as the table s1 showed this phenomenon indicated the dissolution of the surface coating ions may occur as the fig s5 shown the sem analysis showed that the electrodes surface coating may be partially missing after the eo process it can be seen that the focus should be on how to control the stability of its coating in the future the effect of current density on cod removal is shown in fig 5 b as the current density increases it is found that the degradation rate of cod increases significantly the main reason as follows the increase in current density greatly increases the rate of electron transfer which promotes organic pollutants direct oxidation 28 on the other hand as the number of electrons in the reaction plate increases the strong oxidizing free chlorine generated increases and the indirect oxidation is also enhanced which speeds up the removal of cod however as the current density continued to increase from 25 ma cm2 the cod degradation efficiency was not much different the possible reason is that although the amount of free residual chlorine has increased the concentration of organic matter has decreased therefore at this time limiting the concentration of organic matter and reducing the current density are not the most important factor too the energy consumption gradually increases with the increase of current density as shown in fig 5 e due to the eo reaction time is longer generally 29 and increasing the current will significantly increase the side reaction and energy consumption 30 thus 30 ma cm2 was chosen as the most favorable current density under the optimal conditions the decolorization effect of the electrochemical oxidation on treating the llc is shown in fig 5 c the decolorization effect of the eo was obvious and the decolorization rate can reach more than 95 which reducing from cn 1 98 to cn 0 10 at the same time the removal rate of toc reached 40 6 as shown in fig 5 d 3 3 determination of the processing sequence and time of the combined process in order to determine the sequence and processing time of ec and eo in the two stage process the optimized ec or eo was initially used as the first stage of the electrochemical treatment process and then the eo or ec time was changed during the second stage to determine the best combination time and sequence of the combined treatment the experimental design conditions are shown in table 2 the pollutant removal efficiencies of the two stages were shown in fig 6 it can be seen from fig 6 that the removal efficiency of pollutants after the combined process were much higher than those when only a single process was used and the longer the reaction time in the second stage the higher the removal efficiency this shows that the combined electrochemical treatment process has considerable advantages in general the p3 process is the most effective and the cn change was shown in fig 7 and the overall removal rates of p1 p2 p3 were better than those of p4 p5 and p6 the possible reason is due to the high concentration of the llc so the oxidation caused by the first eo is not very effective however the ec treatment firstly can significantly reduce the pollutant content in the llc and facilitate further oxidation treatment thus significantly improving the efficiency of targeted organic pollutant removal in addition too high content of salt will hinder the growth of microorganisms which is one of the reasons why it is difficult to treat with biological methods 31 it can be seen from fig 7 that the p3 treatment process reduces the cd by 30 or so as shown in fig 4 d the concentration of ca2 and mg2 decreased by more than 50 after the reaction so ec may reduce the cd through the generated flocculant adsorption the co2 produced by the organic matter in llc can react with the hydroxide produced by the negative electrode to form carbonate the carbonate can combine with the large amounts of ca2 and mg2 present in the llc to form a precipitate after the reaction a white precipitate is also observed on the negative electrode substrate resulting in a decrease in salinity 11 which may also be one of the reasons for the decrease in cd due to eo 3 4 degradation characteristics of organic matter 3 4 1 spectral analysis in order to determine the organic components in the llc before and after different process treatments the component identification was carried out by parallel factor analysis based on three dimensional 3d fluorescence parallel factor analysis three identified components were shown in fig s6 a b c the components are as follows component 1 ex em 235 400 as in the research of others is a typical humic acid like 32 component 2 ex em 250 455 is fulvic acid like 33 component 3 ex em 265 460 is long wave humus 34 just like research of shah et al s 35 the llc contains a large amount of refractory organics such as humic acid and fulvic acid study 36 has shown that humic acid like and fulvic acid like are a kind of macromolecular organic matter with a molecular weight of 1 100 kda and ozone oxidation can destroy its structure and convert it into protein intermediates making it effective for mineralization obviously the fluorescence intensity the specific values are shown in table 3 was significantly reduced regardless of the processing stage which indicates that the organic macromolecules may be degraded into non fluorescent compounds or removed from fig 8 it can be found that ec was more effective in c2 but were weak in removing the other two types of c1 and c3 on the contrary eo alone is very effective for various organic fluorescence compared with eo ec the organic fluorescence intensity of ec eo was smaller which means that after removing humic acid like organics by ec eo is easier to reduce the fluorescence intensity of other organics although eo first reduces the overall organic fluorescence the fluorescence intensity removed by ec is less this result shows that the eo can remove the pollutants more effectively when the organic humic acid like organic matter is primarily removed by ec the possible reason is that the ability of eo to target and remove organic matter is strengthened after removing humic acid like organic matter by ec as shown in fig 4 b and 5 d the removal rates of toc under the conditions of single ec and eo treatment were 58 6 and 40 6 respectively it can be seen that the single ec mainly removes organic matter and reduces the subsequent removal load of eo while eo may mainly convert organic matter instead of removing organic matter so the combined effect of the two electrolysis processes is different to further reveal the changes of organic matter during the electrolysis process some typical ultraviolet spectral characteristics e g suva254 e250 e365 were selected to describe the changes of organic matter the changes in the uv spectrum of the llc effluent at different treatment stages are shown in fig s7 the specific absorbance value is helpful to characterize the organic matter in the wastewater 35 the aromaticity of the effluents after ec eo ec eo and eo ec electrochemical treatment was characterized by suva254 37 while e250 e365 indicated the degree of humification and molecular weight during the reaction 38 it can be seen from table 3 that suva254 decreased from 0 063 to 0 026 0 029 0 015 and 0 022 by ec eo ec eo eo ec respectively it can be seen that the value of suva254 decreased in different reaction stages indicating that the aromaticity of the llc organic matter is weakened moreover suva254 of ec eo was reduced to the lowest level indicating that this method is indeed the most effective way to reduce aroma compared with other methods mentioned above the e250 e365 index rose from 4 40 to 17 50 29 00 and 26 00 respectively study has shown that the increase in e250 e365 is due to the degradation of macromolecules such as fulvic acid and humic acid and the production of low molecular weight intermediates 37 it can be found that ec alone does not increase the ratio of e250 e365 very much indicating that the destructive effect of ec on organic matter is not great the reason may be that ec only reduces macromolecular organic humus through adsorption and precipitation so it may make little contribution to the improvement of e250 e365 and eo ec indicates that eo is more destructive to organic matter and the increase of ec eo is more than that of eo ec also shows this problem indicating that ec removes part of the organic matter and then eo makes the organic matter more destructive as shown in figs 4 b 5 d and 6 the toc removal rates of ec eo were higher than those of eo ec and the removal of toc by ec and eo alone were 58 6 and 40 6 respectively which also explained this problem 3 4 2 degradation characteristics of organic humus the difference of organic matter classification between ec eo and eo ec is shown in fig 9 it can be found that the total amount of ha and fa in the llc accounts for more than 65 00 of toc and the content of fa is higher than that of ha between 54 00 and 60 00 the non biodegradable ha in the llc can be completely removed after 60 min of ec alone and 180 min of eo alone which is conducive to further biological treatment or other advanced treatments while fa is only partially removed the ha has a higher molecular weight than fa and hyi and ha and fa are mainly negatively charged therefore ha may be preferentially removed by the adsorption precipitation mechanism because negatively charged ha and fa and positively charged metals because of the electrostatic attraction of negatively charged ha and fa to positively charged metallic hydroxyl compounds it should be noted that after ec treatment the proportion of hydrophilic component did not increase significantly while the proportion of the hydrophilic component increased significantly after eo these results indicate that fa may be indirectly decomposed by eo and converted into non humic substances as shown in fig 9 fa was removed by about 10 after eo and the proportion of hyi in all substances increased slightly it is found that both eo ec and ec eo can completely remove ha component but the removal efficiency of fa component in eo ec treatment is significantly lower than that of ec eo treatment which may be because low molecular weight organics are more difficult to remove in the process of ec because they are more hydrophilic 39 therefore it is difficult to effectively degrade the insoluble organic matter i e ha and fa into components with smaller molecular weight and simpler structure during eo compared with ec eo there are more low molecular weight organic compounds in the wastewater after eo ec treatment which is difficult to remove by ec in addition ha can react with chlorine the most commonly used disinfectant and produce disinfection byproducts i e trihalomethane which are considered mutagenic and carcinogenic compounds 40 so prior removal of ha by ec can partially prevent chloroform production during eo ec treatment alone has almost no effect on the removal of hyi which indicates that the eo converts large molecules such as humic substances into small molecules of hyl compounds therefore large organic molecules are mainly removed by adsorption aggregation and co precipitation after eo treatment it was found that the increase in organic hyi indicates that eo may promote the conversion of macromolecular organic pollutants to small molecular hydrophilic substances 4 conclusions in this work the performance of treating llc and characteristics of removing organic matter with different electrochemical treatment processes were studied anode material and current density were found to greatly influence the treatment efficiencies of both ec and eo processes the best sequential electrochemical processes were ec 60 min followed by eo 180 min and the removal rates of toc and cod were 79 00 80 32 respectively under optimized process conditions ec was very effective in the removal of a large number of humic like humus from the concentrate but weak in the removal of fulvic acid like and long wave humus under this specified water quality conditions ec eo showed better performance of removing aromatic organic matter than eo ec both ec and eo alone can completely degrade ha component and eo can promote the conversion of some fa components to hyi component while ec only has a strong removal effect on ha component with large sludge production to deduce the treatment cost of llc and satisfy with the severe discharge standard more emphasis should be put on primary ec to improve removing large molecule organic matters such as humic substances however the optimized electrochemical processes for llc could only be obtained by comprehensively evaluating the material energy sludge disposal cost
