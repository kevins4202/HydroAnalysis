20075,there has long been interest in making inferences about future low probability natural events that have magnitudes greater than any in the past record given a stationary time series the unbounded type 1 and type 2 asymptotic extreme value distributions are often invoked as giving theoretical justification for extrapolating to large magnitudes and long return periods for hydrological variables such as rainfall and river discharge however there is a problem in that environmental extremes are bounded above by the bounded nature of their causal variables extrapolation using unbounded asymptotic models therefore cannot be justified from extreme value theory and at some point there will be over prediction of future magnitudes this creates the apparent contradiction for example of annual rainfall maxima being well approximated by type 2 extreme value distributions despite the bounded nature of rainfall magnitudes an alternative asymptotic extreme value approach is suggested for further investigation with the model being the asymptotic distribution of minima weibull distribution applied to block maxima reciprocals two examples are presented where data that are well matched by type 1 or type 2 extreme value distributions give reciprocals suggestive of lower bounds upper bound γ to the original data the asymptotic model here is a 3 parameter weibull distribution for the reciprocals with positive location parameter γ 1 when this situation is demonstrated from data parameter estimation can be carried out with respect to the distribution of reciprocals of 3 parameter weibull random variables this distribution is referenced here as the bounded inverse weibull distribution a maximum likelihood parameter estimation methodology is presented together with a parametric bootstrap approach for obtaining one sided upper confidence limits to γ when data permits estimation of γ the bounded inverse weibull distribution is suggested as an improved alternative to type 1 or type 2 extreme value distributions because the upper bound reality is recognised however extensive application to many data sets is required to evaluate the practical utility of the bounded approach for extrapolating beyond the largest recorded event keywords bounded extremes bounded inverse weibull distribution s form gumbel plots annual maxima reciprocals extreme value theory introduction there has long been interest in the magnitude of future large low probability natural events that are greater than any previously recorded for example future large floods may significantly impact catchment ecosystems and their magnitudes are also of relevance for civil engineering design extrapolating beyond the largest event is always subject to error and asymptotic extreme value theory has been widely employed as an aid the theory was developed by the early workers in the field including fisher and tippett 1928 gnedenko 1943 and von mises 1936 an historical overview is given by kotz and nadarajah 2000 coles 2001 considers a range of practical applications for magnitudes that are unbounded above extreme value theory indicates that the largest values of sufficiently large samples will be distributed approximately as either a type 1 gumbel extreme value distribution or a type 2 extreme value distribution both type 1 and type 2 distributions have been widely applied to environmental maxima the type 2 form for application to rainfall annual maxima was first proposed by jenkinson 1955 and has been subsequently supported by studies of many rainfall data sets see for example papalexiou and koutsoyiannis 2013 type 1 and type 2 extreme value distributions applied to data are conveniently presented on gumbel plots type 1 distributions yield linear data plots and type 2 forms display an upward curvature fig 1 and fig 2 illustrate gumbel data plots for the two distribution types the lines passing through the data in fig 1 and fig 2 represent respectively a type 1 linear relation and a type 2 curve the respective lines here were not fitted by formal methods but were superposed on the data to illustrate similarity to the data values this similarity would normally be taken to mean that the unbounded extreme value models hold and there is therefore some theoretical justification to extrapolate to large low probability event magnitudes however there is a significant issue of concern in such extrapotations type 1 and type 2 extreme value distributions are both unbounded above so their utilisation in any context implies magnitudes increasing without limit as exceedance probabilities decrease that is the type 1 and type 2 models at some point must over predict event magnitudes in reality environmental magnitudes are bounded above by the bounded nature of the processes that create them for example is always possible to specify a rainfall magnitude so large that it has zero probability of exceedance as opposed to a vanishingly small probability applying unbounded extreme value models to bounded situations invalidates the theoretical justification for extrapolating beyond the largest past magnitude of course for application within the data range there is no issue with utilising any flexible unbounded distribution as an empirical exercise in data matching zaghloul et al 2020 give an overview of distributions applied to flood maxima see also el adlouni et al 2010 and marani and ignaccolo 2015 however all unbounded distributions will inevitably lead to over prediction at some point if extrapolated far beyond the largest value the question then arises as to whether there exists any approach which might permit bounded extreme value theory to be applied to apparently unbounded data this will carry the implication of estimating an upper bound parameter and quantifying its inevitably large estimation uncertainty the purpose of this brief paper is to outline one such approach which might be considered for further studies the content here is developed from an earlier published paper by the senior author bardsley 2019 asymptotic distribution of maxima reciprocals as is well known asymptotic extreme value theory for sample maxima can also be applied to sample minima in particular reciprocals of sample maxima become the sample minima for positive valued random variables if the original sampled variable has an upper bound γ then asymptotic extreme value theory for minima indicates that for sufficiently large samples the distribution of sample maxima reciprocals will be approximated by a 3 parameter weibull distribution with distribution function 1 w z p r z z 1 exp z γ 1 α c γ 1 0 α 0 c 0 z γ 1 w z here is the probability of a smaller reciprocal value and γ 1 α and c are the weibull location scale and shape parameters respectively the parameter γ is the upper bound to the original data from the w z inverse it is evident that z will plot as a linear function of r where r ln 1 w z 1 c it follows that a graphical check of the fit of the 3 parameter weibull distribution to maxima reciprocals can be made if values of γ 1 α and c can found so that the reciprocals plot close to the linear function of r the weibull plots for the buller river discharge reciprocals and the lake tekapo rainfall reciprocals are shown in fig 3 and fig 4 respectively the data r i values were obtained here by estimating the w z values with the gringorten plotting position expression there is evidently something of a contradiction between the two extreme value approaches applied to these data sets the type 1 and type 2 extreme value similarities to the data could be interpreted as being consistent with an absence of upper bounds however the weibull reciprocal plots from the same data are suggestive of upper bounds particularly for the buller river example this indicates that some apparent type 1 and type 2 extreme value data plots can be equally well described by the reciprocal extreme value model with an upper magnitude bound a 3 parameter weibull match to maxima reciprocals while interesting is not helpful in itself for practical application this is because all the extrapolation would be within the narrow region between the smallest reciprocal value and zero this would inevitably result in considerable error if weibull parameter estimation was carried out using the data reciprocals it is therefore more useful to work with the original untransformed data to this end an alternative distribution for maxima can be defined as the distribution of the reciprocals of random variables from the 3 parameter weibull distribution defined by eq 1 the implication is that if sample size is large enough for eq 1 to apply to reciprocals then the distribution of 3 parameter weibull random variable reciprocals would be a useful distribution to apply to the original maxima this distribution is referred to here by the utility name of bounded inverse weibull distribution described in the next section bounded inverse weibull distribution the bounded inverse weibull distribution is defined here as the distribution of reciprocals of random variables from a 3 parameter weibull distribution with a positive location parameter the distribution function and density function are given respectively by 2 f x p r x x exp α c x 1 γ 1 c 3 f x exp α c x 1 γ 1 c c α c x 1 γ 1 c 1 x 2 where γ is the distribution upper bound and α and c are the weibull scale and shape parameters the bounded inverse weibull distribution should not be confused with the 3 parameter inverse weibull distribution which is unbounded above marušić et al 2010 the moments of the bounded inverse weibull distribution seem not amenable to analytical expressions so moment based parameter estimators are not available the situation where c 1 is likely to be of most interest for application to block maxima this corresponds to f γ 0 f x tending toward zero as x approaches zero from above and a single mode m within the range 0 m γ a lower bound approximation to the mode is given by 4 γ 1 α c c 1 c 1 c 1 m if c is held constant then α 0 implies m γ if other parameters are held constant then increasing γ causes f x to tend toward the distribution function of a type 2 extreme value distribution with its location parameter at zero it is of interest to see how the bounded inverse weibull distribution displays in gumbel plots that is plots where magnitude x vertical axis is expressed as a function of the horizontal gumbel variate y ln ln f x for the bounded inverse weibull distribution this function is given by 5 x γ 1 α exp y c 1 which is a rising s shaped form a with a single inflection point at y c ln α γ that is the second derivative is positive for y y and negative for y y gumbel data plots from bounded inverse weibull distributions may therefore show increasing gradients decreasing gradients or have s shaped forms depending on whether y is located above below or within the data range in contrast gumbel plots for the extreme value distributions do not have inflection points with type 1 distributions plotting as straight lines and type 2 distributions having rising curves with increasing gradient if a bounded inverse weibull distribution quantile value is fixed at k such that f k exp 1 then increasing c while holding γ fixed will result in the distribution moving toward a type 1 extreme value distribution which has k as its location parameter good matches of type 1 and type 2 extreme value distributions to block maxima are therefore not evidence for the absence of an upper bound the bounded inverse weibull model predicts that all gumbel plots are of s shaped form in reality however impossibly long data records might sometimes be required to confirm the final s form the issue then becomes whether the largest few values in an existing record are close enough to the upper bound to reflect its influence and permit a data based estimate of γ fig 5 illustrates some bounded inverse weibull distribution forms and their associated gumbel plots all the gumbel plots extend over the range of y from 1 53 to 4 6 corresponding to f x 0 01 and f x 0 99 respectively the fig 5 a gumbel plot has an inflection point at y 2 08 and the distribution has similarities with the type 1 extreme value distribution the fig 5 b distribution is similar in form to a type 2 extreme value distribution with a location parameter at zero its associated gumbel plot has an inflection point at y 3 6 the inflection point for the fig 5 c gumbel plot is located at y 1 83 this is below the y range of the plot so the graphed curve displays a consistent decreasing gradient the s shaped gumbel plot form of bounded inverse weibull distributions is most evident in the parameter combination of fig 5 d where the gumbel plot inflection point is more clearly visible at y 1 65 such distinct s shaped forms might be interpreted as arising from mixtures of distributions however the bounded inverse weibull distribution can accommodate some plots of this type without bringing in additional parameters from a second probability distribution other parameter combinations can be set up which give unnatural distribution forms not shown here because they would be of no value as descriptors of real world block maxima distributions a feature of the bounded inverse weibull distribution is that like the extreme value distributions for maxima it has a reproductive property with respect to its sample maxima if random samples of size n are taken from a bounded inverse weibull distribution c α γ then the distribution of its sample maxima is a bounded inverse weibull distribution c αn γ where α n α n 1 c this means that if it happens that individual events within a year can be approximated as bounded inverse weibull random variables then there is empirical support for also using the distribution for annual maxima with parameter adjustment for α zaghloul et al 2020 make similar comments with respect to the reproductive property of the unbounded burr type 3 distribution parameter estimation and an upper confidence bound to γ distribution location parameters outside of the data range can make estimation difficult and may create considerable estimation error this applies particularly for practical application of the bounded inverse weibull distribution where the physical upper bound to rainfall or flood magnitude may be some distance away from the largest recorded event magnitude maximum likelihood estimation is one convenient approach for bounded inverse weibull distribution estimation given the absence of moment estimators maximising the log likelihood function simplifies to finding the maximum of a function defined by two parameters rather than three appendix plotting the log likelihood function over a range of trial γ values provides a necessary check on whether estimation of γ is feasible in any given instance in particular estimation of the upper bound will not be possible if the likelihood increases without limit for increasing trial values of γ the maximum likelihood estimate γ would also not be helpful if it was less than the largest recorded value some preliminary study suggests that γ is biased toward under estimation however this can be offset in part by obtaining a 95 upper confidence bound to γ by using a bootstrap approach this bound is likely to be more useful than γ itself for making inferences about large magnitudes beyond the data range given maximum likelihood estimates of the three unknown bounded inverse weibull parameters from a sample of size n an upper confidence bound to γ can be obtained by a parametric bootstrap procedure the inverse of eq 2 is first used to simulate n samples of size n where n is sufficiently large alternatively the n samples could be generated from the corresponding weibull distribution and then converted to reciprocals for each of the n simulated samples maximum likelihood parameter estimates are obtained and the n bound estimates b i are recorded in the event that a simulated sample generates likelihood which is monotonically increasing with γ the b i estimate is specified as a large unknown value a sequence d i is defined as d i b i γ and the d i values are arranged in decreasing rank order with any unknown large values grouped at the start if a 95 upper confidence bound to γ is required then the quantile k 0 05 is found defined such that 5 of the d i values are smaller the γ0 95 upper confidence bound to γ is then obtained as γ0 95 γ k 0 05 a useful description for obtaining parametric bootstrap confidence intervals is given in mit opencourseware orloff and bloom 2014 examples we consider again the buller river annual flow maxima and lake tekapo annual rain maxima the buller river data proved feasible for obtaining maximum likelihood parameter estimates of all parameters inserting the estimates into eq 5 gives the function plot shown in fig 6 it is evident from comparison with fig 1 that the recorded maxima are consistent with both the type 1 extreme value distribution and the bounded inverse weibull distribution that is the inflection point in fig 6 at y 0 58 is hardly discernible so there is little to choose between the two distributions over the data range however extrapolating beyond the largest flood event may be better achieved by the bounded inverse weibull distribution given evidence of a lower bound to the discharge reciprocals fig 3 at the same time due note must be taken of the estimation error of γ fig 7 shows the degree of definition of the upper discharge bound estimate for the buller river for trial γ values up to 15 000 m3s 1 the 95 upper confidence bound was obtained as γ0 95 11 252 m3s 1 from maximum likelihood γ estimates from 1000 samples of size n 59 simulated from the distribution the buller river example is helpful for illustrating the effect of estimation error and the importance of the largest recorded values prior to 2021 the largest flood in the period of observation was 8 192 m3s 1 in 1970 this was exceeded by a large event of 8 887 m3s 1 in july 2021 an upper bound estimate made at the end of 2020 would have given γ 8 753 m3s 1 and γ0 95 10 214 m3s 1 with γ in this case being less than the large flood magnitude in the following year fig 8 shows how incorporating the 2021 flood magnitude modified the upper tail form of the fitted distribution for the lake tekapo rainfall example inserting the maximum likelihood parameter estimates into eq 5 gives the gumbel plot shown in fig 9 and the probability distribution shown in fig 10 comparison with fig 2 indicates that there is little difference between the data support for the bounded inverse weibull distribution and an unbounded extreme value distribution in this case the type 2 extreme value distribution it can be seen from fig 10 that the maximum likelihood upper rainfall bound estimate of γ 277 mm is some distance above the main body of the distribution so there is likely to be considerable estimation error also the reciprocal of the 95 upper confidence bound is 0 002 mm 1 which is not far removed from zero when taking into account that simulating n 1000 samples involves some error in defining the γ0 95 value of 400 mm fig 11 indicates that the likelihood as a function of trial γ values declines consistently from around 300 mm as with the buller example this estimate is likely to be be changed by the occurrence of a larger event discussion asymptotic extreme value models for maxima have traditionally provided the theoretical justification for extrapolating hydrological magnitudes beyond the largest recorded value as noted earlier the theoretical validity of the unbounded type 1 and type 2 distributions to this end is questionable because they ignore the existence of physical upper bounds to the environmental processes involved the proposed alternative is approaching the extrapolation issue via invoking the weibull asymptotic extreme value distribution for minima applied to maxima reciprocals this is a considerable departure and has generated robust discussion see for example the hess discussions in bardsley 2017 there is also a school of thought that has argued against even the concept of upper rainfall bounds koutsoyiannis 2004 more recently lombardo et al 2019 derive unbounded and supposedly exact distributions of hydrological extremes however we find it is difficult to see how such distributions can be described as exact in the absence of an upper bound parameter there is no suggestion of course that the two examples considered here provide justification of an alternative general model of extreme value analysis incorporating upper bounds nonetheless the examples do give proof of concept that at least in some situations the more physically justifiable weibull based upper bound models can be applicable to apparently unbounded data one specific aspect for further work could be of interest an upper confidence bound to γ for rainfall maxima has similarities to probable maximum precipitation pmp which has been defined as a rainfall magnitude having very small chance of being exceeded salas et al 2020 for situations where γ estimates are possible for rainfall data it would be useful to compare upper confidence bounds for various significance levels against any previously determined pmp magnitudes conclusion the use of the weibull distribution for reciprocals of block maxima from sufficiently large samples is no less valid an application of asymptotic extreme value theory than applying the generalised extreme value distribution directly to the maxima the case of particular interest is where the distribution of data reciprocals indicates the presence of a positive lower bound this corresponds to the 3 parameter weibull distribution being the appropriate asymptotic form of smallest extremes showing that the data indicates the presence of an upper bound to the maxima in such situations parameter estimation is best carried out using the distribution of weibull reciprocals referenced here as the bounded inverse weibull distribution it can be possible for apparent type 1 and type 2 extreme value data plots to contain sufficient information to enable maximum likelihood upper bound estimation via the inverse weibull distribution the method outlined here has potential for extreme value extrapolation beyond the largest recorded magnitude because any detected upper bound prevents unrealistically large magnitudes from low exceedance probabilities use of the upper confidence bound to γ should offset the risk of anticipating future magnitudes which are too small because of estimator bias however the method remains a proposal for now and extensive application to data sets would be required to establish its practical value declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper acknowledgements the annual maxima data for the buller river and lake tekapo rainfalls were supplied by the new zealand national institute of water and atmospheric research niwa we appreciate the constructive comments by reviewers in revising the original manuscript appendix a maximum likelihood estimation for bounded inverse weibull distribution parameters the probability density function given by eq 3 can be written a1 f x exp ζ x 1 γ 1 c c ζ x 1 γ 1 c 1 x 2 where ζ α c given a random sample x 1 x 2 x n from this distribution and maximum likelihood estimates exist they will be the values ζ α c that maximise the log likelihood function a2 l ζ γ c n ln c n ln ζ ζ i 1 n x i 1 γ 1 c c 1 i 1 n ln x i 1 γ 1 2 i 1 n ln x i the derivative of eq a2 with respect to ζ is given by a3 n ζ 1 i 1 n x i 1 γ 1 c if a finite maximum value of eq a2 exists ζ at the maximum is found by setting eq a3 to zero a4 ζ n i 1 n x i 1 γ 1 c substituting ζ for ζ in eq a2 gives an expression l γ c which is a function of c and γ only this gives a means of obtaining the maximum likelihood estimates by increasing γ by increments starting from above the largest observed data value for a given trial value of γ the value of c is found within a feasible range which yields the maximum of l γ c given a global maximum of l γ c the maximum likelihood estimates of γ and c are then used to obtain ζ from eq a4 the maximum likelihood estimate of α is obtained from the relation ζ α c in the examples given here l γ c was evaluated for values of c between 1 1 and 3 0 at increments of 0 01 increments of γ were 1 mm and 1 m3s 1 for the lake tekapo rainfall and buller river examples respectively an alternative approach would be to find the maximum of l γ c by using a hill climbing algorithm

is no issue with utilising any flexible unbounded distribution as an empirical exercise in data matching zaghloul et al 2020 give an overview of distributions applied to flood maxima see also el adlouni et al 2010 and marani and ignaccolo 2015 however all unbounded distributions will inevitably lead to over prediction at some point if extrapolated far beyond the largest value the question then arises as to whether there exists any approach which might permit bounded extreme value theory to be applied to apparently unbounded data this will carry the implication of estimating an upper bound parameter and quantifying its inevitably large estimation uncertainty the purpose of this brief paper is to outline one such approach which might be considered for further studies the content here is developed from an earlier published paper by the senior author bardsley 2019 asymptotic distribution of maxima reciprocals as is well known asymptotic extreme value theory for sample maxima can also be applied to sample minima in particular reciprocals of sample maxima become the sample minima for positive valued random variables if the original sampled variable has an upper bound γ then asymptotic extreme value theory for minima indicates that for sufficiently large samples the distribution of sample maxima reciprocals will be approximated by a 3 parameter weibull distribution with distribution function 1 w z p r z z 1 exp z γ 1 α c γ 1 0 α 0 c 0 z γ 1 w z here is the probability of a smaller reciprocal value and γ 1 α and c are the weibull location scale and shape parameters respectively the parameter γ is the upper bound to the original data from the w z inverse it is evident that z will plot as a linear function of r where r ln 1 w z 1 c it follows that a graphical check of the fit of the 3 parameter weibull distribution to maxima reciprocals can be made if values of γ 1 α and c can found so that the reciprocals plot close to the linear function of r the weibull plots for the buller river discharge reciprocals and the lake tekapo rainfall reciprocals are shown in fig 3 and fig 4 respectively the data r i values were obtained here by estimating the w z values with the gringorten plotting position expression there is evidently something of a contradiction between the two extreme value approaches applied to these data sets the type 1 and type 2 extreme value similarities to the data could be interpreted as being consistent with an absence of upper bounds however the weibull reciprocal plots from the same data are suggestive of upper bounds particularly for the buller river example this indicates that some apparent type 1 and type 2 extreme value data plots can be equally well described by the reciprocal extreme value model with an upper magnitude bound a 3 parameter weibull match to maxima reciprocals while interesting is not helpful in itself for practical application this is because all the extrapolation would be within the narrow region between the smallest reciprocal value and zero this would inevitably result in considerable error if weibull parameter estimation was carried out using the data reciprocals it is therefore more useful to work with the original untransformed data to this end an alternative distribution for maxima can be defined as the distribution of the reciprocals of random variables from the 3 parameter weibull distribution defined by eq 1 the implication is that if sample size is large enough for eq 1 to apply to reciprocals then the distribution of 3 parameter weibull random variable reciprocals would be a useful distribution to apply to the original maxima this distribution is referred to here by the utility name of bounded inverse weibull distribution described in the next section bounded inverse weibull distribution the bounded inverse weibull distribution is defined here as the distribution of reciprocals of random variables from a 3 parameter weibull distribution with a positive location parameter the distribution function and density function are given respectively by 2 f x p r x x exp α c x 1 γ 1 c 3 f x exp α c x 1 γ 1 c c α c x 1 γ 1 c 1 x 2 where γ is the distribution upper bound and α and c are the weibull scale and shape parameters the bounded inverse weibull distribution should not be confused with the 3 parameter inverse weibull distribution which is unbounded above marušić et al 2010 the moments of the bounded inverse weibull distribution seem not amenable to analytical expressions so moment based parameter estimators are not available the situation where c 1 is likely to be of most interest for application to block maxima this corresponds to f γ 0 f x tending toward zero as x approaches zero from above and a single mode m within the range 0 m γ a lower bound approximation to the mode is given by 4 γ 1 α c c 1 c 1 c 1 m if c is held constant then α 0 implies m γ if other parameters are held constant then increasing γ causes f x to tend toward the distribution function of a type 2 extreme value distribution with its location parameter at zero it is of interest to see how the bounded inverse weibull distribution displays in gumbel plots that is plots where magnitude x vertical axis is expressed as a function of the horizontal gumbel variate y ln ln f x for the bounded inverse weibull distribution this function is given by 5 x γ 1 α exp y c 1 which is a rising s shaped form a with a single inflection point at y c ln α γ that is the second derivative is positive for y y and negative for y y gumbel data plots from bounded inverse weibull distributions may therefore show increasing gradients decreasing gradients or have s shaped forms depending on whether y is located above below or within the data range in contrast gumbel plots for the extreme value distributions do not have inflection points with type 1 distributions plotting as straight lines and type 2 distributions having rising curves with increasing gradient if a bounded inverse weibull distribution quantile value is fixed at k such that f k exp 1 then increasing c while holding γ fixed will result in the distribution moving toward a type 1 extreme value distribution which has k as its location parameter good matches of type 1 and type 2 extreme value distributions to block maxima are therefore not evidence for the absence of an upper bound the bounded inverse weibull model predicts that all gumbel plots are of s shaped form in reality however impossibly long data records might sometimes be required to confirm the final s form the issue then becomes whether the largest few values in an existing record are close enough to the upper bound to reflect its influence and permit a data based estimate of γ fig 5 illustrates some bounded inverse weibull distribution forms and their associated gumbel plots all the gumbel plots extend over the range of y from 1 53 to 4 6 corresponding to f x 0 01 and f x 0 99 respectively the fig 5 a gumbel plot has an inflection point at y 2 08 and the distribution has similarities with the type 1 extreme value distribution the fig 5 b distribution is similar in form to a type 2 extreme value distribution with a location parameter at zero its associated gumbel plot has an inflection point at y 3 6 the inflection point for the fig 5 c gumbel plot is located at y 1 83 this is below the y range of the plot so the graphed curve displays a consistent decreasing gradient the s shaped gumbel plot form of bounded inverse weibull distributions is most evident in the parameter combination of fig 5 d where the gumbel plot inflection point is more clearly visible at y 1 65 such distinct s shaped forms might be interpreted as arising from mixtures of distributions however the bounded inverse weibull distribution can accommodate some plots of this type without bringing in additional parameters from a second probability distribution other parameter combinations can be set up which give unnatural distribution forms not shown here because they would be of no value as descriptors of real world block maxima distributions a feature of the bounded inverse weibull distribution is that like the extreme value distributions for maxima it has a reproductive property with respect to its sample maxima if random samples of size n are taken from a bounded inverse weibull distribution c α γ then the distribution of its sample maxima is a bounded inverse weibull distribution c αn γ where α n α n 1 c this means that if it happens that individual events within a year can be approximated as bounded inverse weibull random variables then there is empirical support for also using the distribution for annual maxima with parameter adjustment for α zaghloul et al 2020 make similar comments with respect to the reproductive property of the unbounded burr type 3 distribution parameter estimation and an upper confidence bound to γ distribution location parameters outside of the data range can make estimation difficult and may create considerable estimation error this applies particularly for practical application of the bounded inverse weibull distribution where the physical upper bound to rainfall or flood magnitude may be some distance away from the largest recorded event magnitude maximum likelihood estimation is one convenient approach for bounded inverse weibull distribution estimation given the absence of moment estimators maximising the log likelihood function simplifies to finding the maximum of a function defined by two parameters rather than three appendix plotting the log likelihood function over a range of trial γ values provides a necessary check on whether estimation of γ is feasible in any given instance in particular estimation of the upper bound will not be possible if the likelihood increases without limit for increasing trial values of γ the maximum likelihood estimate γ would also not be helpful if it was less than the largest recorded value some preliminary study suggests that γ is biased toward under estimation however this can be offset in part by obtaining a 95 upper confidence bound to γ by using a bootstrap approach this bound is likely to be more useful than γ itself for making inferences about large magnitudes beyond the data range given maximum likelihood estimates of the three unknown bounded inverse weibull parameters from a sample of size n an upper confidence bound to γ can be obtained by a parametric bootstrap procedure the inverse of eq 2 is first used to simulate n samples of size n where n is sufficiently large alternatively the n samples could be generated from the corresponding weibull distribution and then converted to reciprocals for each of the n simulated samples maximum likelihood parameter estimates are obtained and the n bound estimates b i are recorded in the event that a simulated sample generates likelihood which is monotonically increasing with γ the b i estimate is specified as a large unknown value a sequence d i is defined as d i b i γ and the d i values are arranged in decreasing rank order with any unknown large values grouped at the start if a 95 upper confidence bound to γ is required then the quantile k 0 05 is found defined such that 5 of the d i values are smaller the γ0 95 upper confidence bound to γ is then obtained as γ0 95 γ k 0 05 a useful description for obtaining parametric bootstrap confidence intervals is given in mit opencourseware orloff and bloom 2014 examples we consider again the buller river annual flow maxima and lake tekapo annual rain maxima the buller river data proved feasible for obtaining maximum likelihood parameter estimates of all parameters inserting the estimates into eq 5 gives the function plot shown in fig 6 it is evident from comparison with fig 1 that the recorded maxima are consistent with both the type 1 extreme value distribution and the bounded inverse weibull distribution that is the inflection point in fig 6 at y 0 58 is hardly discernible so there is little to choose between the two distributions over the data range however extrapolating beyond the largest flood event may be better achieved by the bounded inverse weibull distribution given evidence of a lower bound to the discharge reciprocals fig 3 at the same time due note must be taken of the estimation error of γ fig 7 shows the degree of definition of the upper discharge bound estimate for the buller river for trial γ values up to 15 000 m3s 1 the 95 upper confidence bound was obtained as γ0 95 11 252 m3s 1 from maximum likelihood γ estimates from 1000 samples of size n 59 simulated from the distribution the buller river example is helpful for illustrating the effect of estimation error and the importance of the largest recorded values prior to 2021 the largest flood in the period of observation was 8 192 m3s 1 in 1970 this was exceeded by a large event of 8 887 m3s 1 in july 2021 an upper bound estimate made at the end of 2020 would have given γ 8 753 m3s 1 and γ0 95 10 214 m3s 1 with γ in this case being less than the large flood magnitude in the following year fig 8 shows how incorporating the 2021 flood magnitude modified the upper tail form of the fitted distribution for the lake tekapo rainfall example inserting the maximum likelihood parameter estimates into eq 5 gives the gumbel plot shown in fig 9 and the probability distribution shown in fig 10 comparison with fig 2 indicates that there is little difference between the data support for the bounded inverse weibull distribution and an unbounded extreme value distribution in this case the type 2 extreme value distribution it can be seen from fig 10 that the maximum likelihood upper rainfall bound estimate of γ 277 mm is some distance above the main body of the distribution so there is likely to be considerable estimation error also the reciprocal of the 95 upper confidence bound is 0 002 mm 1 which is not far removed from zero when taking into account that simulating n 1000 samples involves some error in defining the γ0 95 value of 400 mm fig 11 indicates that the likelihood as a function of trial γ values declines consistently from around 300 mm as with the buller example this estimate is likely to be be changed by the occurrence of a larger event discussion asymptotic extreme value models for maxima have traditionally provided the theoretical justification for extrapolating hydrological magnitudes beyond the largest recorded value as noted earlier the theoretical validity of the unbounded type 1 and type 2 distributions to this end is questionable because they ignore the existence of physical upper bounds to the environmental processes involved the proposed alternative is approaching the extrapolation issue via invoking the weibull asymptotic extreme value distribution for minima applied to maxima reciprocals this is a considerable departure and has generated robust discussion see for example the hess discussions in bardsley 2017 there is also a school of thought that has argued against even the concept of upper rainfall bounds koutsoyiannis 2004 more recently lombardo et al 2019 derive unbounded and supposedly exact distributions of hydrological extremes however we find it is difficult to see how such distributions can be described as exact in the absence of an upper bound parameter there is no suggestion of course that the two examples considered here provide justification of an alternative general model of extreme value analysis incorporating upper bounds nonetheless the examples do give proof of concept that at least in some situations the more physically justifiable weibull based upper bound models can be applicable to apparently unbounded data one specific aspect for further work could be of interest an upper confidence bound to γ for rainfall maxima has similarities to probable maximum precipitation pmp which has been defined as a rainfall magnitude having very small chance of being exceeded salas et al 2020 for situations where γ estimates are possible for rainfall data it would be useful to compare upper confidence bounds for various significance levels against any previously determined pmp magnitudes conclusion the use of the weibull distribution for reciprocals of block maxima from sufficiently large samples is no less valid an application of asymptotic extreme value theory than applying the generalised extreme value distribution directly to the maxima the case of particular interest is where the distribution of data reciprocals indicates the presence of a positive lower bound this corresponds to the 3 parameter weibull distribution being the appropriate asymptotic form of smallest extremes showing that the data indicates the presence of an upper bound to the maxima in such situations parameter estimation is best carried out using the distribution of weibull reciprocals referenced here as the bounded inverse weibull distribution it can be possible for apparent type 1 and type 2 extreme value data plots to contain sufficient information to enable maximum likelihood upper bound estimation via the inverse weibull distribution the method outlined here has potential for extreme value extrapolation beyond the largest recorded magnitude because any detected upper bound prevents unrealistically large magnitudes from low exceedance probabilities use of the upper confidence bound to γ should offset the risk of anticipating future magnitudes which are too small because of estimator bias however the method remains a proposal for now and extensive application to data sets would be required to establish its practical value declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or

new zealand national institute of water and atmospheric research niwa we appreciate the constructive comments by reviewers in revising the original manuscript appendix a maximum likelihood estimation for bounded inverse weibull distribution parameters the probability density function given by eq 3 can be written a1 f x exp ζ x 1 γ 1 c c ζ x 1 γ 1 c 1 x 2 where ζ α c given a random sample x 1 x 2 x n from this distribution and maximum likelihood estimates exist they will be the values ζ α c that maximise the log likelihood function a2 l ζ γ c n ln c n ln ζ ζ i 1 n x i 1 γ 1 c c 1 i 1 n ln x i 1 γ 1 2 i 1 n ln x i the derivative of eq a2 with respect to ζ is given by a3 n ζ 1 i 1 n x i 1 γ 1 c if a finite maximum value of eq a2 exists ζ at the maximum is found by setting eq a3 to zero a4 ζ n i 1 n x i 1 γ 1 c substituting ζ for ζ in eq a2 gives an expression l γ c which is a function of c and γ only this gives a means of obtaining the maximum likelihood estimates by increasing γ by increments starting from above the largest observed data value for a given trial value of γ the value of c is found within a feasible range which yields the maximum of l γ c given a global maximum of l γ c the maximum likelihood estimates of γ and c are then used to obtain ζ from eq a4 the maximum likelihood estimate of α is obtained from the relation ζ α c in the examples given here l γ c was evaluated for values of c between 1 1 and 3 0 at increments of 0 01 increments of γ were 1 mm and 1 m3s 1 for the lake tekapo rainfall and buller river examples respectively an alternative approach would be to find the maximum of l γ c by using a hill climbing algorithm 
20076,sulfur s uptakes by woody plants might indicate the presence of urban air pollution in the form of sulfur dioxide so2 which is one of the most important pollutants worldwide the present study detected total carbon c and s contents in the leaf and stem dry mass of 53 common woody species in representative forest plots in five cities across the pearl river delta prd a densely urbanized region in southern china coupling analysis explored whether spatial patterns of s content in woody species were relatively consistent with atmospheric so2 concentration in the five prd cities total s content varied in leaves and stems with averages of 2 0 g kg and 0 8 g kg respectively while air so2 concentration ranged from 9 0 to 108 0 g m3 however total c content was relatively constant among all the species across the diverse forest plots with an average of 443 5 g kg and a median of 448 0 g kg in leaves and 437 0 g kg in stems this suggests that air so2 pollution did not influence tree

woody species at the species level mean c content average of the leaf and stem for each species accounted for 440 g kg table 1 with relatively low content in aporosa yunnanensis phyllanthaceae and relatively high content in cratoxylum cochinchinense hypericaceae mean s content accounted for 2 2 g kg with relatively low content in ficus microcarpa moraceae and relatively high content in litsea glutinosa lauraceae fig 2 the highest s content was over 36 times the lowest value among all the 53 species furthermore mean c contents were basically constant in leaves and stems t 1 815 df 52 p 0

high levels in lfs mean s content varied greatly across the diverse forest plots in the five cities with relatively low values in the dhs and relatively high values in the lfs table 1 so2 concentrations were relatively higher near lfs in foshan city and wgs in zhongshan city than in the other three a weakly positive correlation between average so2 concentration and mean s content r 0

mainly by influencing microbial properties and litter chemistry in the surrounding habitats wu et al 2017 wang et al 2018 our results showed that sites with higher annual mean gas phase so2 concentrations tended to contain more s content in their biomass e g lfs and wgs fig 2 theoretically urban trees and greenings can improve air quality by facilitating widespread deposition of various gases and particles over large surface areas as well as through their influence on microclimate and air turbulence grote et al 2016 generally s content in plant leaves serves as an indicator of atmospheric so2 concentration hrdlicka and kula 2009 mukherjee and agrawal 2016 our results showed that s content in either the leaf or stem had a significant positive correlation with atmospheric so2 concentration furthermore our results indicated the central and south prd have the highest so2 concentrations this suggests that s pollutants might be immobilized in forest ecosystems which means that afforestation efforts may have potentially huge benefits sun et al 2009 shi et al 2016 however baseline s content levels should account for trees soils and even the atmosphere together for instance the annual averages of so2 decreased by 72 from 47 μg m3 in 2006 to 13 μg m3 in 2015 as recorded by the prd raqmn in fact in the pearl river delta acid rain is mainly caused by so4 2 and no3 knabe 1976 yang et al 2014 natural and artificial forests in and around the urban regions provide huge stabilizing ecological benefits including improving the quality of habitats therefore afforestation in urban regions is expected to be an environmentally friendly method to reduce s pollution and support multiple ecological functions 4 conclusions this work explores the temporal patterns of so2 concentrations from five cities and s contents in 53 common woody species in five forest plots across the urbanized prd southern china our fundamental results regarding s stoichiometry are potentially useful for improving environmental quality and exploring forest ecosystem functions in both natural and urban regions though emission reduction measures e g phasing out severely polluted industrial facilities retrofitting power plants tightening the vehicle emission standards are still regarded as top priorities for improving overall air quality we highly expect that protecting natural forests and carrying out afforestation projects will continue to play a special role in tackling the photochemical pollution problem our findings might also be referenced by local authorities and stakeholders

useful for improving environmental quality and exploring forest ecosystem functions in both natural and urban regions though emission reduction measures e g phasing out severely polluted industrial facilities retrofitting power plants tightening the vehicle emission standards are still regarded as top priorities for improving overall air quality we highly expect that protecting natural forests and carrying out afforestation projects will continue to play a special role in tackling the photochemical pollution problem our findings might also be referenced by local authorities and stakeholders troubled by s pollution issues especially in the regions adjacent to the prd such as hunan jiangxi and fujian provinces given the instantaneous and interregional influences of atmospheric pollution

20077,the coastal area with its fragile environment and the characteristics of both marine and terrestrial is getting increasing attention globally highlighting a critical need to form a systematic management framework the objectives of this article are to illustrate the status quo of chinese regional ecological civilization and land sea integrated development then combine resilience theory and sustainable development goals sdgs of united nations together for selecting social ecological indicators to build a resilience assessment matrix applying to the coastal urban area further explore the core mechanisms of coastal resilience evolution accordingly we suggest a new method of evaluation matrix with 12 indicators representing the function of the target system in four phases prepare absorb recover and adapt and three domains economic natural resources and eco environment respectively which focusing on the dynamic progress instead of the static situation of the typical and unique urbanizing area is exactly one of its improvements in comparison with other existing assessment tools the key findings reveal the dificient resilience of dapeng new district in dealing with the rapid urbanization stressor as well as its asymmetrical performance among three subsystems within the temporal scope of 2014 2016 another contribution reflected in the regime shifts of land sea integration which uncovers the states of critical functions in the target system correspondingly outlines how to integrate the land use water management and biodiversity conservation into resilience based management and sustainability for the coastal zone namely the land water biodiversity nexus our scope is taking the typical coastal zone shenzhen dapeng new district greater bay area of china as an example and to promote the research technology in other coastal urban regions graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords land sea integration resilience assessment sdgs coastal zone urban area 1 introduction the coastal provinces in mainland china carry 43 of the population and contribute to 57 of gdp with 13 of the country s land area in 2018 at present the region is facing overwhelming pressures such as changes in land use patterns and sedimentary environment increased pollution and sea level rise and degradation of fishery resources jones et al 2013 thorne et al 2018 however these adversities resulted from rapid urbanization happens to promote the researches and applications of sustainable development and resilience ideas bai et al 2014 malhi et al 2019 the sustainable and resilient development of the coastal zone needs to consider the nexus between the land and sea such as the natural flows occurring between realms to balance and incorporate information from multiple stakeholders to identify the priority of voluntary commitment by states governmental or non governmental organizations thus to develop regional and national strategies for coastal risk reduction through natural and hybrid infrastructure neumann and unger 2019 sutton grier et al 2015 thus solving regional environmental issues from a global perspective is the core idea of this research in 2015 the united nations presented 17 sustainable development goals sdgs with 169 sub goals among which enhancing system resilience is one of the key goals in the next 15 years two years later the un signed the new urban agenda the declaration proposed to ensure environmental sustainability and strengthen urban resilience these documents emphasize the urgency of sustainable and resilient management of coastal natural resources guide us to decompose global targets to a regionally oriented management system thereby reducing the susceptibility of systems to disasters and promote the resilience and adaptability of coastal zones resilience or sustainability theory is both cross cutting and emphasized concepts frequently used in the evaluation of sdgs resilience in physics means the ability of a target object to revert to its original state after being disturbed after several revisions resilience theory has evolved into a new stage where the adaptive cycle was proposed to implement its flexibility in continuously changing the social ecological system carpenter et al 2011 sustainability the core mechanism of sdgs measures the capacity of the biosphere and human civilization to exist constantly which encourages new development to meet the demand of present without compromising the ability of future generations sustainability is an ideal state or result while the theory of resilience draws attention to the process of system deformation marchese et al 2018 redman 2014 although both the resilience and sustainability theory focuses on the dynamics of the system and the diversity of stakeholders redman 2014 they also lead to the confusion between the two in many academic articles and policy documents elmqvist 2017 different responses to risks are key factors to distinguish between the two kates et al 2001 meerow et al 2016 resilience is a supplement and sublimation of the concept of sustainable development systemic assessment of resilience is the first step in building a resilient city the risk management oriented resilience assessment model was used to assess the vulnerability of coastal cities facing natural disasters such as earthquakes floods wildfire and typhoons mcwethy et al 2019 based on assessment results it proposed suggestions such as limiting the rapid expansion of densely populated residential areas barria et al 2019 meerow and newell 2017 the resilience assessment criteria based on land water biodiversity nexus stresses the interaction between different ecosystems pointing out the priority of regulating land use and biodiversity conservation to maintain system resilience wang et al 2018 according to grafton grafton et al 2019 planning adaptation and transformation actions are critical factors shaping the characteristics of social ecological systems the key to applying resilience thinking is to improve the adaptability of social ecological systems to maintain the health of landscapes and aquatic system and to adjust internal needs by enhancing the internal and external links sellberg et al 2018 warrick et al 2017 which inevitably leads to conflicts between original driving factors and powers among stakeholders and then increase the difficulty of planning and management weighing the opinions of different participants in the scenario planning and decision making process can effectively solve the contradiction although the research of resilience practice is insufficient its superiority to sustainability makes it potential to promote and stimulate the transformation and upgrading of ecological civilization in china its popularization also reflects the connection and combination of social science ecology urban planning and other related disciplines cretney 2014 donohue et al 2016 resilience thinking is open to changes and uncertainties which superiority in a continuously changing world comparing with risk based approaches shows its great prospect in sustainability assessment jozaei et al 2020 however one of the main challenges in applying resilience thinking to practice is to localize the theoretical model into the real world hence a macroscopic resilience framework together with the empirical analysis will help us to better understand the core meaning of the social ecological system the objectives of this paper are 1 build an assessment framework of social ecological resilience for the coastal urban area by analyzing current governmental documents and conducting field surveys 2 compare the proposed matrix with other evaluation tools and test its compatibility with sdgs 3 apply the assessment results into the land sea integrated resilient management of dapeng so as to further achieve sdgs in the coastal area 2 study area dapeng new district is located in the southeast of shenzhen surrounded by the sea on three sides east of daya bay bordering huizhou and holding dapeng bay in the west fig 1 geographically it is an important node in the greater bay area of guangdong hong kong and macau the area of the jurisdiction is 600 km2 of which the land area is 295 km2 the sea area is 305 km2 and the coastline is 133 km long from administrative division and population aspect dapeng new district has three offices in kuichong dapeng and nanao subdistrict 25 communities with a permanent population of nearly 200 000 and a registered population of 39 000 while it is precisely because dapeng was established as an ecological pilot national or local regulations set lax standards for its economic indicators since its foundation five years ago dapeng has been awarded the national pilot of ecological civilization 2014 2015 2018 and the national pilot of marine ecological civilization 2015 2018 which showed not only its abundant natural resources and great ecological environment conditions and also reflected its incentive and attempt of exploring a new way to environment friendly cities same as many cities in china dapeng has been already struggling with environmental degradation such as natural shoreline depletion traffic congestion inadequate urban infrastructure such as hospitals and schools and a lack of basic services such as water sanitation and waste management maintaining economic growth while creating a sustainable livable city is the biggest urban challenge facing dapeng and other chinese cities recently transformative resilience has been laid out to distinguish the former phases basic resilience and adaptive resilience which encourages systems to embrace risks in upstream approaches such as by rebuilding ecosystem structure mcwethy et al 2019 nevertheless it requires tremendous social agreement and political effort for any of a developed city frantzeskaki et al 2018 therefore taking dapeng as a sample to further explore the mechanism of resilience practice is of great advantage as it is full of vitality to design sustainable pilot cities in china it is of great significance for promoting the ecological civilization in china and is also a forward looking study of resilience practice useful for all the coastal areas in the world 3 methodology the coastal zone resilience evaluation system is an innovative system based on land sea integration and social ecological system resilience theory according to the characteristics of the chinese environmental management system and the triple bottom line theory the assessment module is divided into three sub systems socio economic natural resources and eco environment which corresponds to the departments reform of chinese central government in 2018 as well from the time scale the regional development patterns can be summarized as four stages of prepare absorb recover and adapt linkov et al 2014 so far we can evaluate the performance of various subsystems in response to global climate change in different stages to provide specific and precise policy implications against the specific spatial temporal objectives to meet the sdgs the basis for the implementation of sdgs is the construction of a dynamic assessment system based on practice and monitoring yonehara et al 2017 decomposed the 15 year planning goal into three phases a planning phase driven by a feasibility assessment an improvement phase characterized by formative assessment and monitoring and a completion phase involving outcome and impact assessment the resilience theory also stresses understanding adaptive cycles from a longer temporal period or a bigger spatial scale the global production ecosystem as objectives of different stages determine the focal indicator of an evaluation framework nyström et al 2019 investigating key formants and conducting weight surveys is to prioritize assessment indicators through understanding stakeholders cognition about resilience and sustainability in different sectors or hierarchies voinov et al 2016 45 indicators in the index weighing questionnaire are extracted from 20 evaluation documents of ecological civilization and green development in china that have been enacted since 2012 a total of 250 key informants including government officers environmental protection and water affairs bureau city administration economic services bureau development and finance bureau integrated legal enforcement bureau of eco resources and environment planning and land commission grassroots officers staff of the sub district office enterprise representatives shenzhen cheer land life technology investment co ltd shenzhen tissue bank precision medicine co ltd shenzhen overseas chinese town co ltd shenzhen bgi marine science technology co ltd byd co ltd and the masses were interviewed eventually we got 211 valid questionnaires based on the field survey and adaptive resilience theory we select 12 indicators from 45 candidate indicators table 1 the core mechanism of assessing system resilience is to measure its ability threshold tolerating pervasive risks standish et al 2014 as a consequence the indicator selection strictly adheres to the development status of the coastal zone and regulations the resilience is formed on account of some data deficiency surrogates were presented to acknowledge that important aspects of resilience in a system may not be directly observable darnhofer et al 2010 scheffer et al 2000 the illustration in the collection of the 12 targets is as follows table 2 historically global urbanization and economic development have common features cities expanding with the increase of population bettencourt et al 2007 initially economic development is given top priority the government tends to improve the ability of cities to cope with economic risks and crises s1 hereafter the pursuit of fast economic growth and development scale led to the crisis of the urban ecosystem s2 after the crisis government comes to realize the truth to restore urban vitality through activating technological innovation and explore urban economic functions s3 finally it reaches the stage with upgrading structural and distinctive leading economic industries s4 a stock that yields a flow of valuable goods or services into the future is called natural capital costanza and daly 1992 whose importance is reflected in the continuous provision of ecosystem services protecting and increase the value of natural resources is an important way to enhance human well being vassallo et al 2017 in resilience theory the lower the energy consumption per unit grp the higher the industrial production efficiency the higher the utilization rate of natural resources namely the stronger the ability of urban ecosystems to cope with natural resource crises n2 one of the indicators for biodiversity assessment represents the preservation outcome of urban green space systems n3 is an indicator reflecting the efficiency of urban resource utilization n4 reflects the current status of urban ecological space and natural ecosystems in nearshore waters from the issue of china s air pollution prevention action plan 2013 water pollution prevention action plan 2015 and soil pollution prevention action plan 2016 we conclude the attention transformation of our nation in the face of major environmental events therefore e1 e2 and e3 are selected to reflect the city s emphasis on air water and soil contamination respectively the goal of people oriented ecological civilization is improving the quality of life and status of residents e4 as an indicator of ecological habitat represents the final stage of urban resilience before using the above assessment model we need to first define the targeted system and its major threats identify the critical functions of the study area and select the performance indicators yamagata and sharifi 2018 then calculate the score ultimately identify gaps and prioritize efforts by interpreting the matrix results data sources include shenzhen statistical yearbook 2014 2015 2016 dapeng new district statistical yearbook 2014 2015 2016 report on the state of the environment in shenzhen 2014 2015 2016 dapeng new district ecological index 2014 2015 2016 threshold sources include guideline for construction of national ecological civilization pilot in dapeng new district 2014 2016 2013 2020 twelfth five plan of human settlements in shenzhen 2010 twelfth five plan of resources utilization 2011 index of marine ecological civilization pilot on trial 2012 index of national ecological civilization pilots for counties and prefectures 2018 more information about the threshold could be found in table a1 appendix 2 there are positive and negative indicators in the evaluation system and evaluation criteria vary among different indicators to reduce the deviation among them this paper normalized all the values in the matrix ranging from zero to 100 zero means no response and 100 indicates that the subsystem responds well in the corresponding phase meeting the threshold of national policy documents normalize data as followed for indicators positively related to ecological civilization positive indicators qi 100 ci si when ci si take qi 100 for indicators that are negatively correlated with ecological civilization inverse indicators qi 100 si ci when ci si take qi 100 note qi is the standard value of the indicator i si is the threshold of the indicator i ci is the current value of the indicator i the threshold value of each indicator is available from national or local governmental documents such as the five year plan of china or shenzhen city 4 results according to the instruction of the resilience matrix the main threat in the dapeng district is defined as the urban ecosystem degradation caused by rapid anthropogenic urbanization its core functions are defined as residential areas high tech biotechnology and marine industries ecological protection and tourism given dapeng s history and the accessibility of data sources we sorted out information from three years in 2014 2015 and 2016 the three years have witnessed the construction and development of dapeng district from a little coastal village to a developing modern eco district the results are as follows table 3 owing to the implementation of a series of ecological civilization regulations results indicate a remarkable performance in the ecological civilization of shenzhen dapeng new district with achieving high scores of 91 16 92 94 and 95 58 in 2014 2015 and 2016 respectively the horizontal analysis shows that the scores of the latter two stages are significantly lower than the first stage that is the ecosystem of the study area has insufficient resilience in response to the urbanization crisis thus cannot respond recover and adapt in time which also demonstrates the indicator selection in resilience matrix is in line with the objective discipline of urban development the reason for this result is that resilience planning and management have not been applied into the urban risk management system most of the existing financial funds are applied to physical disaster prevention and mitigation and these measures cannot improve the ability of the research region to recover and adapt to the risks from rapid urbanization in addition with the planning and policy not completely conducted the ecological restoration effect has not yet fully manifested the longitudinal analysis shows that the social and economic module tends to get higher scores with the natural resources and ecosystem modules relatively low scores for example the value of natural shoreline retention rate is unstable and it has not met the goal of no reducing set by marine ecological civilization demonstration zone construction indicator system trial in some respects the shenzhen municipal government set a relatively lower economic threshold while a relatively higher environment threshold to dapeng as it is an ecosystem services oriented administrative district 5 discussion 5 1 comparison with other resilience assessment tools in dapeng district the comprehensive index has been calculated since 2014 trying to use a single index to reflect the progress of ecological civilization status there is superiority in both targets city or agglomeration and scope up down or bottom up between the comprehensive index and our resilience matrix while the land sea integration social ecological theory and resilience concept are added in the assessment matrix researches have also been done to assess the vulnerability of shenzhen city by invest integrated valuation of ecosystem services and tradeoffs tools same as our results relative moderate slr sea level rise scores and socially sensitivities in comparison with western shenzhen but lower adaptive capacity was observed in the dapeng district zhang et al 2020 in short we advocate the coastal zone resilience assessment model merges with sdgs that determines the assessment indicators from the four stages of regional development and sustainable development it quantifies the regional resilience from different time dimensions and meanwhile enhances the local global linkages through combining sustainable development goals resilience assessment of ecosystems can effectively identify key risks faced by target systems and help raise community awareness prior and hagmann 2014 the dynamics and temporal spatial complexity of the social ecosystem insisted by resilience theory are gradually being accepted and used by urban planning and management disciplines however the devil is always in the details that is as resilience is still an emerging subject there are no accurate and universal assessment tools for planners to embed resilience theory into practice sellberg et al 2015 besides the role of spatial knowledge and visualization technology is still absent in resilience evaluation and practice borie et al 2019 globally there are much regional resilience assessment cra to assess the level of resilience in regions sharifi sharifi and yamagata 2016 compared 36 cra tools worldwide and found that only in 4 assessment tools all the four stages of resilience theory were included most models ignore the latter two stages of recovery and adaptation as for the assessment methodology the resilience assessments in coastal rural villages showed that practices utilizing local and indigenous knowledge have helped locals effectively mitigate the impacts of disasters chen and cheng 2020 a resilience assessment approach for power system used two resilience indices from the perspectives of the system and individual component levels respectively liu et al 2020 recently fuzzy cognitive mapping has been used to elicit subjective views on resilience mechanisms of the wastewater sector in the belfast area northern ireland tepes and neumann 2020 totally we are trying to find a common solution for resilience assessment by conducting empirical researches in different regions cutter cutter 2016 raised a question whether there is an evaluation system that considers all the 10 essentials for making cities resilient by united nations office for disaster risk reduction undrr after analyzing 27 us resilience assessment tools indices and scorecards in terms of four parameters including focus on assets baseline conditions spatial orientation local to the globe mythology top down or bottom up and domain area characteristic to capacities despite this we also encounter some problems in the application of the resilience assessment model including 1 the absence of data for some indicators will directly lead to inaccurate results for example in this assessment due to the lack of data on the gdp ratio of marine economic output the final result is not as authentic analyzing the social economic module 2 practice has proved that the integrity and simplicity of the assessment cannot be accomplished jointly considering the uncertainty of the system and the role of dynamic impact factors the sole independent indicators are not always perfectly accurate or common suitable in practices while miscellaneous indicators cause trouble to governmental officers and the public bennett et al 2013 in practice policy documents that give priority to sustainable development tend to focus only on the maximization of resource utilization efficiency ignoring the social equity caused by resource allocation elmqvist et al 2019 3 as resilience thinking and its planning is still in its infancy even if the research on the threshold is the leading topic of resilience theory the judgment of threshold and boundary of indicators are not accurate lade et al 2019 walker and meyers 2004 so the results of the matrix are mainly used to identify the gaps between sub systems in terms of corresponding capabilities 4 there is a contradiction between macro coordination and micro dimension as diversities and complexities of targets core functions there may be a partial bias for the selection of a certain index consequently deviation will be involved in the comprehensive analysis for instance when we take ecological residential as the main function of dapeng new district we tend to focus more on urban infrastructure urban living standards and ecological livability nevertheless when port trade or tourism is the main function economic level industrial exploitation intensity and resource utilization efficiency become dominant factors the solution to this problem is to evaluate the resilience of the study area by sub function which however loses the advantage of assessing in a holistic view 5 2 the correlation between resilience indicators and sdgs the propose of sustainability theory makes the urban sustainability assessment frameworks usafs emerge in an endless stream ameen and mourshed 2019 which targets include risk assessment and potential risk impact assessment pope et al 2017 sustainability assessment is currently designed to fit into relevant decision context depending on the objectives the scale and the scope namely it acknowledges the importance of pluralism cinelli et al 2014 while its long evaluation period strong normative nature and lack of feedback mechanism have become obstructions that hinder the promotion of sustainable evaluation the resilience assessment model in this article combines the merits of sustainability assessment by taking some sdgs into consideration which is a refinement of the common ideals of global sustainable development and also a concrete way and innovative practice to achieve this goal xu et al 2015 taking the sdg 11 sustainable cities and communities for example sub target sdg 11 3 1 states the ratio of land consumption rate to population growth rate for assessing the urban planning and management in all countries and in total sdg 11 focuses on all residents satisfaction with urban function transportation health care etc or environment air water and soil so sdg 11 is consistent with s2 and e4 in both the indicator layer and the target layer table 4 5 3 apply assessment results into rapidly urbanization coastal cities to maintain positive momentum in ecological civilization and sustainability in the immediate future it is important to critically engage within an integrated management network for coastal zone landscape based on land water biodiversity nexus the lwb land water biodiversity nexus an innovative environmental management framework derived from catastrophe theory prioritizes the interconnections between its components of urban ecosystems water systems and creatures across scales wang et al 2018 it is similar to the concept of biogeochemistry a key aspect of urban ecology which argues vegetation and water stand in close relation to land change in the urban ecosystem whereas in this paper we focus more on the correlation among land water and biodiversity instead of their causality land is the foundation of water and organisms water facilitates the mass cycle and energy flows and biodiversity is the carrier of both only when we admit the lwb nexus a key node in the social ecological framework will we find out a new path toward urban resilience as fig 2 shows resilience sdgs and lwb nexus are core mechanisms in applying this model representing the theory base final targets and innovative pattern respectively furthermore the incorporation of diverse social ecological systems guides us in the right direction to the achievements of sustainable development goals the stability of a city system is the harmony of all its functions and dynamics bai et al 2016 donohue et al 2016 trust between individuals information sharing and public private partnership ppp is the key impetus of supply chain network recovery subsequent to risk or crisis papadopoulos et al 2017 even though when the government actually formulates and enforces urban planning programs it often neglects the connection and correspondence between systems therefore constituting a communication network for planners policymakers and managers at both national and international scales provides new ideas for improving the resilience and sustainability of urban agglomerations elmqvist et al 2019 kremen 2005 mcphearson et al 2016 zhong et al 2018 in 2007 biermann biermann 2007 presented the earth system governance project which can be understood as the sum of myriad public and private non state actors at all levels of decision making to ensure the co evolution of human and natural systems in a sustainable way accordingly jointly resisting climate changes in another word global climate change calls for truly collaborative and integrative research which appreciates the strengths and limitations of different knowledge domains approaches and perspectives brondizio et al 2016 coastal areas especially river deltas areas concentrate most of the world s mega cities thorne et al 2018 where urbanization and population growth appear unique geographical characteristics however how to balance urban economic development and ecosystem protection is a universal and tricky problem for all cities theoretically indicators in the resilience assessment are corresponding to three basic modules in modern environment management the social economic natural resources and ecological environment respectively namely both the framework and indicators are general dealing with global issues empirically dapeng district is selected as a specific case study for its significance in land sea integrated and sustainable development and its ecological superiority among all administrative regions in shenzhen city as well besides shenzhen city the first port city influenced by the reform and opening up policy in china is also representative among all the global coastal cities undergoing rapid urbanization therefore promoting the experience learned from dapeng to other coastal area depends on extending and refining the resilience matrix locally in short this paper come up with a land water biodiversity nexus coastal zone system governance model enhancing the ability of urban agglomerations to respond to risks recover and adapt to hazard quickly 6 conclusions in the context of the deteriorating global coastal zone this paper takes the dapeng new district of shenzhen city as a sample to explore how coastal cities respond to the habitat destruction under the endogenous pressure of rapid urbanization as well as coordinate economic development and ecological civilization construction the main contributions of the papers are 1 the resilience matrix we proposed broadens the scope of resilience reshapes the conceptual connection between the social and ecological system and stresses the integration of land and sea as well after evaluation dapeng new district with its flaws in the recovery and adaptive stages offers us new ideas on how to improve resilience based on lwb nexus 2 comparing to existing resilience assessment tools we are trying to find a common and universal solution for evaluation by conducting empirical researches in different regions 3 in the consideration of characteristics of coastal cities this paper comes up with a land water biodiversity nexus coastal zone system governance model enhancing the ability of urban agglomerations to respond to risks recover and adapt to hazard quickly to measure distance and progress to sdgs the assessment should be linked to baseline data in the existing database and identify the trends and gaps that is why establishing and maintaining system resilience requires continuous dynamic monitoring instead of only one assessment tool to this end the resilience assessment tool in this paper provides the benchmark performance scores to determine the future direction and shortcomings of cities under sdgs in times to come succinctly this evaluation system offers an outlook on the limitations of resilience practice and endeavors to inspire a discussion toward a resilient and sustainable coastal city the linked interactions of social and ecological systems in coastal areas can be applied through land water biodiversity nexus which guides decision makers to consider the target city holistically with physical substrates and organisms as well as anthropogenic effects we suggest that conceptual advances within urban resilience and sustainability have created the potential to transform the future coastal cities into a more magnificent ecosystem an integrated science of cities for example the lwb nexus will enhance refine and embrace the existing conceptual framework in perusing a more sustainable and resilient urban system to clarify the correlation between sub systems in the coastal zone to apply the long term research and big data in resilience planning or to visualize the resilience are some possible ways to embed lwb nexus into empirical environment management confined to the available database a three year resilience score was calculated in dapeng district next using panel data of recent decades in dapeng to evaluate its resilience can help to improve the habitat quality index framework and the assessment model based on lwb nexus looking into the future the united nation will set further sdgs for vision 2030 applying new goals into coastal urban area management taking dapeng as a pilot and proposing an integration scheme is suggested declaration of competing interest the authors declare no

20077,the coastal area with its fragile environment and the characteristics of both marine and terrestrial is getting increasing attention globally highlighting a critical need to form a systematic management framework the objectives of this article are to illustrate the status quo of chinese regional ecological civilization and land sea integrated development then combine resilience theory and sustainable development goals sdgs of united nations together for selecting social ecological indicators to build a resilience assessment matrix applying to the coastal urban area further explore the core mechanisms of coastal resilience evolution accordingly we suggest a new method of evaluation matrix with 12 indicators representing the function of the target system in four phases prepare absorb recover and adapt and three domains economic natural resources and eco environment respectively which focusing on the dynamic progress instead of the static situation of the typical and unique urbanizing area is exactly one of its improvements in comparison with other existing assessment tools the key findings reveal the dificient resilience of dapeng new district in dealing with the rapid urbanization stressor as well as its asymmetrical performance among three subsystems within the temporal scope of 2014 2016 another contribution reflected in the regime shifts of land sea integration which uncovers the states of critical functions in the target system correspondingly outlines how to integrate the land use water management and biodiversity conservation into resilience based management and sustainability for the coastal zone namely the land water biodiversity nexus our scope is taking the typical coastal zone shenzhen dapeng new district greater bay area of china as an example and to promote the research technology in other coastal urban regions graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords land sea integration resilience assessment sdgs coastal zone urban area 1 introduction the coastal provinces in mainland china carry 43 of the population and contribute to 57 of gdp with 13 of the country s land area in 2018 at present the region is facing overwhelming pressures such as changes in land use patterns and sedimentary environment increased pollution and sea level rise and degradation of fishery resources jones et al 2013 thorne et al 2018 however these adversities resulted from rapid urbanization happens to promote the researches and applications of sustainable development and resilience ideas bai et al 2014 malhi et al 2019 the sustainable and resilient development of the coastal zone needs to consider the nexus between the land and sea such as the natural flows occurring between realms to balance and incorporate information from multiple stakeholders to identify the priority of voluntary commitment by states governmental or non governmental organizations thus to develop regional and national strategies for coastal risk reduction through natural and hybrid infrastructure neumann and unger 2019 sutton grier et al 2015 thus solving regional environmental issues from a global perspective is the core idea of this research in 2015 the united nations presented 17 sustainable development goals sdgs with 169 sub goals among which enhancing system resilience is one of the key goals in the next 15 years two years later the un signed the new urban agenda the declaration proposed to ensure environmental sustainability and strengthen urban resilience these documents emphasize the urgency of sustainable and resilient management of coastal natural resources guide us to decompose global targets to a regionally oriented management system thereby reducing the susceptibility of systems to disasters and promote the resilience and adaptability of coastal zones resilience or sustainability theory is both cross cutting and emphasized concepts frequently used in the evaluation of sdgs resilience in physics means the ability of a target object to revert to its original state after being disturbed after several revisions resilience theory has evolved into a new stage where the adaptive cycle was proposed to implement its flexibility in continuously changing the social ecological system carpenter et al 2011 sustainability the core mechanism of sdgs measures the capacity of the biosphere and human civilization to exist constantly which encourages new development to meet the demand of present without compromising the ability of future generations sustainability is an ideal state or result while the theory of resilience draws attention to the process of system deformation marchese et al 2018 redman 2014 although both the resilience and sustainability theory focuses on the dynamics of the system and the diversity of stakeholders redman 2014 they also lead to the confusion between the two in many academic articles and policy documents elmqvist 2017 different responses to risks are key factors to distinguish between the two kates et al 2001 meerow et al 2016 resilience is a supplement and sublimation of the concept of sustainable development systemic assessment of resilience is the first step in building a resilient city the risk management oriented resilience assessment model was used to assess the vulnerability of coastal cities facing natural disasters such as earthquakes floods wildfire and typhoons mcwethy et al 2019 based on assessment results it proposed suggestions such as limiting the rapid expansion of densely populated residential areas barria et al 2019 meerow and newell 2017 the resilience assessment criteria based on land water biodiversity nexus stresses the interaction between different ecosystems pointing out the priority of regulating land use and biodiversity conservation to maintain system resilience wang et al 2018 according to grafton grafton et al 2019 planning adaptation and transformation actions are critical factors shaping the characteristics of social ecological systems the key to applying resilience thinking is to improve the adaptability of social ecological systems to maintain the health of landscapes and aquatic system and to adjust internal needs by enhancing the internal and external links sellberg et al 2018 warrick et al 2017 which inevitably leads to conflicts between original driving factors and powers among stakeholders and then increase the difficulty of planning and management weighing the opinions of different participants in the scenario planning and decision making process can effectively solve the contradiction although the research of resilience practice is insufficient its superiority to sustainability makes it potential to promote and stimulate the transformation and upgrading of ecological civilization in china its popularization also reflects the connection and combination of social science ecology urban planning and other related disciplines cretney 2014 donohue et al 2016 resilience thinking is open to changes and uncertainties which superiority in a continuously changing world comparing with risk based approaches shows its great prospect in sustainability assessment jozaei et al 2020 however one of the main challenges in applying resilience thinking to practice is to localize the theoretical model into the real world hence a macroscopic resilience framework together with the empirical analysis will help us to better understand the core meaning of the social ecological system the objectives of this paper are 1 build an assessment framework of social ecological resilience for the coastal urban area by analyzing current governmental documents and conducting field surveys 2 compare the proposed matrix with other evaluation tools and test its compatibility with sdgs 3 apply the assessment results into the land sea integrated resilient management of dapeng so as to further achieve sdgs in the coastal area 2 study area dapeng new district is located in the southeast of shenzhen surrounded by the sea on three sides east of daya bay bordering huizhou and holding dapeng bay in the west fig 1 geographically it is an important node in the greater bay area of guangdong hong kong and macau the area of the jurisdiction is 600 km2 of which the land area is 295 km2 the sea area is 305 km2 and the coastline is 133 km long from administrative division and population aspect dapeng new district has three offices in kuichong dapeng and nanao subdistrict 25 communities with a permanent population of nearly 200 000 and a registered population of 39 000 while it is precisely because dapeng was established as an ecological pilot national or local regulations set lax standards for its economic indicators since its foundation five years ago dapeng has been awarded the national pilot of ecological civilization 2014 2015 2018 and the national pilot of marine ecological civilization 2015 2018 which showed not only its abundant natural resources and great ecological environment conditions and also reflected its incentive and attempt of exploring a new way to environment friendly cities same as many cities in china dapeng has been already struggling with environmental degradation such as natural shoreline depletion traffic congestion inadequate urban infrastructure such as hospitals and schools and a lack of basic services such as water sanitation and waste management maintaining economic growth while creating a sustainable livable city is the biggest urban challenge facing dapeng and other chinese cities recently transformative resilience has been laid out to distinguish the former phases basic resilience and adaptive resilience which encourages systems to embrace risks in upstream approaches such as by rebuilding ecosystem structure mcwethy et al 2019 nevertheless it requires tremendous social agreement and political effort for any of a developed city frantzeskaki et al 2018 therefore taking dapeng as a sample to further explore the mechanism of resilience practice is of great advantage as it is full of vitality to design sustainable pilot cities in china it is of great significance for promoting the ecological civilization in china and is also a forward looking study of resilience practice useful for all the coastal areas in the world 3 methodology the coastal zone resilience evaluation system is an innovative system based on land sea integration and social ecological system resilience theory according to the characteristics of the chinese environmental management system and the triple bottom line theory the assessment module is divided into three sub systems socio economic natural resources and eco environment which corresponds to the departments reform of chinese central government in 2018 as well from the time scale the regional development patterns can be summarized as four stages of prepare absorb recover and adapt linkov et al 2014 so far we can evaluate the performance of various subsystems in response to global climate change in different stages to provide specific and precise policy implications against the specific spatial temporal objectives to meet the sdgs the basis for the implementation of sdgs is the construction of a dynamic assessment system based on practice and monitoring yonehara et al 2017 decomposed the 15 year planning goal into three phases a planning phase driven by a feasibility assessment an improvement phase characterized by formative assessment and monitoring and a completion phase involving outcome and impact assessment the resilience theory also stresses understanding adaptive cycles from a longer temporal period or a bigger spatial scale the global production ecosystem as objectives of different stages determine the focal indicator of an evaluation framework nyström et al 2019 investigating key formants and conducting weight surveys is to prioritize assessment indicators through understanding stakeholders cognition about resilience and sustainability in different sectors or hierarchies voinov et al 2016 45 indicators in the index weighing questionnaire are extracted from 20 evaluation documents of ecological civilization and green development in china that have been enacted since 2012 a total of 250 key informants including government officers environmental protection and water affairs bureau city administration economic services bureau development and finance bureau integrated legal enforcement bureau of eco resources and environment planning and land commission grassroots officers staff of the sub district office enterprise representatives shenzhen cheer land life technology investment co ltd shenzhen tissue bank precision medicine co ltd shenzhen overseas chinese town co ltd shenzhen bgi marine science technology co ltd byd co ltd and the masses were interviewed eventually we got 211 valid questionnaires based on the field survey and adaptive resilience theory we select 12 indicators from 45 candidate indicators table 1 the core mechanism of assessing system resilience is to measure its ability threshold tolerating pervasive risks standish et al 2014 as a consequence the indicator selection strictly adheres to the development status of the coastal zone and regulations the resilience is formed on account of some data deficiency surrogates were presented to acknowledge that important aspects of resilience in a system may not be directly observable darnhofer et al 2010 scheffer et al 2000 the illustration in the collection of the 12 targets is as follows table 2 historically global urbanization and economic development have common features cities expanding with the increase of population bettencourt et al 2007 initially economic development is given top priority the government tends to improve the ability of cities to cope with economic risks and crises s1 hereafter the pursuit of fast economic growth and development scale led to the crisis of the urban ecosystem s2 after the crisis government comes to realize the truth to restore urban vitality through activating technological innovation and explore urban economic functions s3 finally it reaches the stage with upgrading structural and distinctive leading economic industries s4 a stock that yields a flow of valuable goods or services into the future is called natural capital costanza and daly 1992 whose importance is reflected in the continuous provision of ecosystem services protecting and increase the value of natural resources is an important way to enhance human well being vassallo et al 2017 in resilience theory the lower the energy consumption per unit grp the higher the industrial production efficiency the higher the utilization rate of natural resources namely the stronger the ability of urban ecosystems to cope with natural resource crises n2 one of the indicators for biodiversity assessment represents the preservation outcome of urban green space systems n3 is an indicator reflecting the efficiency of urban resource utilization n4 reflects the current status of urban ecological space and natural ecosystems in nearshore waters from the issue of china s air pollution prevention action plan 2013 water pollution prevention action plan 2015 and soil pollution prevention action plan 2016 we conclude the attention transformation of our nation in the face of major environmental events therefore e1 e2 and e3 are selected to reflect the city s emphasis on air water and soil contamination respectively the goal of people oriented ecological civilization is improving the quality of life and status of residents e4 as an indicator of ecological habitat represents the final stage of urban resilience before using the above assessment model we need to first define the targeted system and its major threats identify the critical functions of the study area and select the performance indicators yamagata and sharifi 2018 then calculate the score ultimately identify gaps and prioritize efforts by interpreting the matrix results data sources include shenzhen statistical yearbook 2014 2015 2016 dapeng new district statistical yearbook 2014 2015 2016 report on the state of the environment in shenzhen 2014 2015 2016 dapeng new district ecological index 2014 2015 2016 threshold sources include guideline for construction of national ecological civilization pilot in dapeng new district 2014 2016 2013 2020 twelfth five plan of human settlements in shenzhen 2010 twelfth five plan of resources utilization 2011 index of marine ecological civilization pilot on trial 2012 index of national ecological civilization pilots for counties and prefectures 2018 more information about the threshold could be found in table a1 appendix 2 there are positive and negative indicators in the evaluation system and evaluation criteria vary among different indicators to reduce the deviation among them this paper normalized all the values in the matrix ranging from zero to 100 zero means no response and 100 indicates that the subsystem responds well in the corresponding phase meeting the threshold of national policy documents normalize data as followed for indicators positively related to ecological civilization positive indicators qi 100 ci si when ci si take qi 100 for indicators that are negatively correlated with ecological civilization inverse indicators qi 100 si ci when ci si take qi 100 note qi is the standard value of the indicator i si is the threshold of the indicator i ci is the current value of the indicator i the threshold value of each indicator is available from national or local governmental documents such as the five year plan of china or shenzhen city 4 results according to the instruction of the resilience matrix the main threat in the dapeng district is defined as the urban ecosystem degradation caused by rapid anthropogenic urbanization its core functions are defined as residential areas high tech biotechnology and marine industries ecological protection and tourism given dapeng s history and the accessibility of data sources we sorted out information from three years in 2014 2015 and 2016 the three years have witnessed the construction and development of dapeng district from a little coastal village to a developing modern eco district the results are as follows table 3 owing to the implementation of a series of ecological civilization regulations results indicate a remarkable performance in the ecological civilization of shenzhen dapeng new district with achieving high scores of 91 16 92 94 and 95 58 in 2014 2015 and 2016 respectively the horizontal analysis shows that the scores of the latter two stages are significantly lower than the first stage that is the ecosystem of the study area has insufficient resilience in response to the urbanization crisis thus cannot respond recover and adapt in time which also demonstrates the indicator selection in resilience matrix is in line with the objective discipline of urban development the reason for this result is that resilience planning and management have not been applied into the urban risk management system most of the existing financial funds are applied to physical disaster prevention and mitigation and these measures cannot improve the ability of the research region to recover and adapt to the risks from rapid urbanization in addition with the planning and policy not completely conducted the ecological restoration effect has not yet fully manifested the longitudinal analysis shows that the social and economic module tends to get higher scores with the natural resources and ecosystem modules relatively low scores for example the value of natural shoreline retention rate is unstable and it has not met the goal of no reducing set by marine ecological civilization demonstration zone construction indicator system trial in some respects the shenzhen municipal government set a relatively lower economic threshold while a relatively higher environment threshold to dapeng as it is an ecosystem services oriented administrative district 5 discussion 5 1 comparison with other resilience assessment tools in dapeng district the comprehensive index has been calculated since 2014 trying to use a single index to reflect the progress of ecological civilization status there is superiority in both targets city or agglomeration and scope up down or bottom up between the comprehensive index and our resilience matrix while the land sea integration social ecological theory and resilience concept are added in the assessment matrix researches have also been done to assess the vulnerability of shenzhen city by invest integrated valuation of ecosystem services and tradeoffs tools same as our results relative moderate slr sea level rise scores and socially sensitivities in comparison with western shenzhen but lower adaptive capacity was observed in the dapeng district zhang et al 2020 in short we advocate the coastal zone resilience assessment model merges with sdgs that determines the assessment indicators from the four stages of regional development and sustainable development it quantifies the regional resilience from different time dimensions and meanwhile enhances the local global linkages through combining sustainable development goals resilience assessment of ecosystems can effectively identify key risks faced by target systems and help raise community awareness prior and hagmann 2014 the dynamics and temporal spatial complexity of the social ecosystem insisted by resilience theory are gradually being accepted and used by urban planning and management disciplines however the devil is always in the details that is as resilience is still an emerging subject there are no accurate and universal assessment tools for planners to embed resilience theory into practice sellberg et al 2015 besides the role of spatial knowledge and visualization technology is still absent in resilience evaluation and practice borie et al 2019 globally there are much regional resilience assessment cra to assess the level of resilience in regions sharifi sharifi and yamagata 2016 compared 36 cra tools worldwide and found that only in 4 assessment tools all the four stages of resilience theory were included most models ignore the latter two stages of recovery and adaptation as for the assessment methodology the resilience assessments in coastal rural villages showed that practices utilizing local and indigenous knowledge have helped locals effectively mitigate the impacts of disasters chen and cheng 2020 a resilience assessment approach for power system used two resilience indices from the perspectives of the system and individual component levels respectively liu et al 2020 recently fuzzy cognitive mapping has been used to elicit subjective views on resilience mechanisms of the wastewater sector in the belfast area northern ireland tepes and neumann 2020 totally we are trying to find a common solution for resilience assessment by conducting empirical researches in different regions cutter cutter 2016 raised a question whether there is an evaluation system that considers all the 10 essentials for making cities resilient by united nations office for disaster risk reduction undrr after analyzing 27 us resilience assessment tools indices and scorecards in terms of four parameters including focus on assets baseline conditions spatial orientation local to the globe mythology top down or bottom up and domain area characteristic to capacities despite this we also encounter some problems in the application of the resilience assessment model including 1 the absence of data for some indicators will directly lead to inaccurate results for example in this assessment due to the lack of data on the gdp ratio of marine economic output the final result is not as authentic analyzing the social economic module 2 practice has proved that the integrity and simplicity of the assessment cannot be accomplished jointly considering the uncertainty of the system and the role of dynamic impact factors the sole independent indicators are not always perfectly accurate or common suitable in practices while miscellaneous indicators cause trouble to governmental officers and the public bennett et al 2013 in practice policy documents that give priority to sustainable development tend to focus only on the maximization of resource utilization efficiency ignoring the social equity caused by resource allocation elmqvist et al 2019 3 as resilience thinking and its planning is still in its infancy even if the research on the threshold is the leading topic of resilience theory the judgment of threshold and boundary of indicators are not accurate lade et al 2019 walker and meyers 2004 so the results of the matrix are mainly used to identify the gaps between sub systems in terms of corresponding capabilities 4 there is a contradiction between macro coordination and micro dimension as diversities and complexities of targets core functions there may be a partial bias for the selection of a certain index consequently deviation will be involved in the comprehensive analysis for instance when we take ecological residential as the main function of dapeng new district we tend to focus more on urban infrastructure urban living standards and ecological livability nevertheless when port trade or tourism is the main function economic level industrial exploitation intensity and resource utilization efficiency become dominant factors the solution to this problem is to evaluate the resilience of the study area by sub function which however loses the advantage of assessing in a holistic view 5 2 the correlation between resilience indicators and sdgs the propose of sustainability theory makes the urban sustainability assessment frameworks usafs emerge in an endless stream ameen and mourshed 2019 which targets include risk assessment and potential risk impact assessment pope et al 2017 sustainability assessment is currently designed to fit into relevant decision context depending on the objectives the scale and the scope namely it acknowledges the importance of pluralism cinelli et al 2014 while its long evaluation period strong normative nature and lack of feedback mechanism have become obstructions that hinder the promotion of sustainable evaluation the resilience assessment model in this article combines the merits of sustainability assessment by taking some sdgs into consideration which is a refinement of the common ideals of global sustainable development and also a concrete way and innovative practice to achieve this goal xu et al 2015 taking the sdg 11 sustainable cities and communities for example sub target sdg 11 3 1 states the ratio of land consumption rate to population growth rate for assessing the urban planning and management in all countries and in total sdg 11 focuses on all residents satisfaction with urban function transportation health care etc or environment air water and soil so sdg 11 is consistent with s2 and e4 in both the indicator layer and the target layer table 4 5 3 apply assessment results into rapidly urbanization coastal cities to maintain positive momentum in ecological civilization and sustainability in the immediate future it is important to critically engage within an integrated management network for coastal zone landscape based on land water biodiversity nexus the lwb land water biodiversity nexus an innovative environmental management framework derived from catastrophe theory prioritizes the interconnections between its components of urban ecosystems water systems and creatures across scales wang et al 2018 it is similar to the concept of biogeochemistry a key aspect of urban ecology which argues vegetation and water stand in close relation to land change in the urban ecosystem whereas in this paper we focus more on the correlation among land water and biodiversity instead of their causality land is the foundation of water and organisms water facilitates the mass cycle and energy flows and biodiversity is the carrier of both only when we admit the lwb nexus a key node in the social ecological framework will we find out a new path toward urban resilience as fig 2 shows resilience sdgs and lwb nexus are core mechanisms in applying this model representing the theory base final targets and innovative pattern respectively furthermore the incorporation of diverse social ecological systems guides us in the right direction to the achievements of sustainable development goals the stability of a city system is the harmony of all its functions and dynamics bai et al 2016 donohue et al 2016 trust between individuals information sharing and public private partnership ppp is the key impetus of supply chain network recovery subsequent to risk or crisis papadopoulos et al 2017 even though when the government actually formulates and enforces urban planning programs it often neglects the connection and correspondence between systems therefore constituting a communication network for planners policymakers and managers at both national and international scales provides new ideas for improving the resilience and sustainability of urban agglomerations elmqvist et al 2019 kremen 2005 mcphearson et al 2016 zhong et al 2018 in 2007 biermann biermann 2007 presented the earth system governance project which can be understood as the sum of myriad public and private non state actors at all levels of decision making to ensure the co evolution of human and natural systems in a sustainable way accordingly jointly resisting climate changes in another word global climate change calls for truly collaborative and integrative research which appreciates the strengths and limitations of different knowledge domains approaches and perspectives brondizio et al 2016 coastal areas especially river deltas areas concentrate most of the world s mega cities thorne et al 2018 where urbanization and population growth appear unique geographical characteristics however how to balance urban economic development and ecosystem protection is a universal and tricky problem for all cities theoretically indicators in the resilience assessment are corresponding to three basic modules in modern environment management the social economic natural resources and ecological environment respectively namely both the framework and indicators are general dealing with global issues empirically dapeng district is selected as a specific case study for its significance in land sea integrated and sustainable development and its ecological superiority among all administrative regions in shenzhen city as well besides shenzhen city the first port city influenced by the reform and opening up policy in china is also representative among all the global coastal cities undergoing rapid urbanization therefore promoting the experience learned from dapeng to other coastal area depends on extending and refining the resilience matrix locally in short this paper come up with a land water biodiversity nexus coastal zone system governance model enhancing the ability of urban agglomerations to respond to risks recover and adapt to hazard quickly 6 conclusions in the context of the deteriorating global coastal zone this paper takes the dapeng new district of shenzhen city as a sample to explore how coastal cities respond to the habitat destruction under the endogenous pressure of rapid urbanization as well as coordinate economic development and ecological civilization construction the main contributions of the papers are 1 the resilience matrix we proposed broadens the scope of resilience reshapes the conceptual connection between the social and ecological system and stresses the integration of land and sea as well after evaluation dapeng new district with its flaws in the recovery and adaptive stages offers us new ideas on how to improve resilience based on lwb nexus 2 comparing to existing resilience assessment tools we are trying to find a common and universal solution for evaluation by conducting empirical researches in different regions 3 in the consideration of characteristics of coastal cities this paper comes up with a land water biodiversity nexus coastal zone system governance model enhancing the ability of urban agglomerations to respond to risks recover and adapt to hazard quickly to measure distance and progress to sdgs the assessment should be linked to baseline data in the existing database and identify the trends and gaps that is why establishing and maintaining system resilience requires continuous dynamic monitoring instead of only one assessment tool to this end the resilience assessment tool in this paper provides the benchmark performance scores to determine the future direction and shortcomings of cities under sdgs in times to come succinctly this evaluation system offers an outlook on the limitations of resilience practice and endeavors to inspire a discussion toward a resilient and sustainable coastal city the linked interactions of social and ecological systems in coastal areas can be applied through land water biodiversity nexus which guides decision makers to consider the target city holistically with physical substrates and organisms as well as anthropogenic effects we suggest that conceptual advances within urban resilience and sustainability have created the potential to transform the future coastal cities into a more magnificent ecosystem an integrated science of cities for example the lwb nexus will enhance refine and embrace the existing conceptual framework in perusing a more sustainable and resilient urban system to clarify the correlation between sub systems in the coastal zone to apply the long term research and big data in resilience planning or to visualize the resilience are some possible ways to embed lwb nexus into empirical environment management confined to the available database a three year resilience score was calculated in dapeng district next using panel data of recent decades in dapeng to evaluate its resilience can help to improve the habitat quality index framework and the assessment model based on lwb nexus looking into the future the united nation will set further sdgs for vision 2030 applying new goals into coastal urban area management taking dapeng as a pilot and proposing an integration scheme is suggested declaration of competing interest the authors declare no

all analyses were conducted in triplicate for a set of conditions 3 biological field sampling and technical analysis replicates data were analyzed descriptively by means of t test analysis with a significance level difference set at p 05 the statistical treatment of the data has been realized using sigmastat 11 0 systat software inc usa the data were subjected to the pearson correlation to investigate the possible positive and negative relationships among the variables 3 results and discussion 3 1 water physicochemical characteristics water physicochemical parameters including temperature ph electrical conductivity and dissolved oxygen are presented in table 2 physicochemical properties are important parameters to evaluate the quality of water used for irrigation irrigation water outside recommended values may cause many problems to the development of some legumes and cause nutritional imbalance due to the presence many undesirable substances brockwell and gault 1976 all analyzed water physicochemical parameters were found within the permissible levels set by food and agriculture organization fao 1985 the highest value of conductivity was observed in water samples from groundwater with the values of 1458 μs cm 1 the similar values were observed in the groundwater of the municipality of bumbu in kinshasa kapembo et al 2016 the low dissolved oxygen levels can be explained by probably the excess of organic matter in water samples from studied sites kayembe et al 2018a b 3 2 soil physicochemical characteristics the soil characteristics including organic matter om calcium carbonate caco3 and particle grain size clay silt and sand are reported in table 3 the soil om content ranged from 2 11 to 6 98 the values obtained from the site sas were higher than the values found in the agricultural soil of the region boyer 1982 mulaji et al 2016 the soil grain size varied considerably according to the sampling sites the soil from all sampling sites was sandy soil except for the sites ris mos and tss which were sandy clay loam clay and silt varied significantly but the sand values remained higher with the values ranged from 73 54 to 92 68 than the values of clay and silt except for mos site 36 82 the soil caco3 content was less than 1 for all sampling sites 3 3 metal concentration in water and soil samples the heavy metal cr co cu zn as cd and pb concentrations in water samples are reported in table 4 the obtained values were under the permissible levels set by food and agriculture organization fao 1985 metal and metalloid concentrations in soil samples are reported in table 5 low concentrations were observed for almost all sampling sites except for cecomaf ces site with the values of 251 345 and 2 15 mg kg 1 for pb zn and hg respectively these values are higher than the recommended values for agricultural soils cec 1986 the high metal concentrations observed in soil samples from ces can be probably explained by several human activities performed around and in the site these activities include commercial and industrial settlements and the presence of uncontrolled landfills which contaminate soil and irrigation water used in this site tshibanda et al 2014 the soil samples from cesco control soil near cecomaf site are characterized by notable levels of metals e g zn pb and as but are in general lowest in comparison with metal levels in soil samples from ces soil from cecomaf site 3 4 metal concentrations in a viridis the icp ms analysis results of heavy metals in a viridis are given in table 6 in general the metal and metalloid content in different parts of plant revealed the following order root leaf stem except for the zn which showed the following order leaf root stem the same tendency was observed for pb and cd in a viridis cultivated in lagos nigeria atayese et al 2009 and for cd cr pb and as in vegetables in mature stage cultivated in china meng et al 2016 the content of cr as cd pb and hg in edible portions leaf of a viridis samples from investigated sites mainly from cecomaf and rifflaert sites exceeded safe limits set by food and agriculture organization world health organization for human consumption who fao 2003 jecfa 2006 for example the hg value from cecomaf is 90 times higher than the who acceptable limit 0 001 mg kg 1 table 6 however the concentration of metals cr as cd pb and hg observed in this study was lower than the values observed in the a viridis leaves grown in nigeria atayese et al 2009 azi et al 2018 the maximum hg content 0 09 mg kg 1 in leaves was recorded at cecomaf site this value was higher than the permitted safety limits of 0 001 mg kg 1 who fao 2003 jecfa 2006 for cd the content values were higher than the recommended values in the three part of the plant in the mombele mo cecomaf ce rifflaert ri lemba imbu li and saïo sa sites the cr also showed values above the recommended values in leaf stem and root for tshuenge cecomaf rifflaert lemba imbu and saïo sites in this study high content of cu was detected in cecomaf root 33 89 mg kg 1 while mombele stem had lowest content 0 34 mg kg 1 for cr the highest content 9 12 mg kg 1 was measured in lemba imbu root while the lowest 0 27 mg kg 1 was measured in kimpoko root pb content varied from 0 01 mg kg 1 kimpoko stem to 127 05 mg kg 1 lemba imbu root while cd content varied from 0 01 mg kg 1 kimpoko leaf and stem and monastery stem to 2 98 mg kg 1 lemba imbu root good agreement was observed when our data for the levels of cu cr pb and cd were compared with previously reported data in a chinese study china mlcf 2014 and the who fao reports from 2003 table 7 shows for instance that the maximum concentrations recorded for cu 0 34 33 89 mg kg 1 were higher than the values reported for vegetables in iran 5 8 8 28 mg kg 1 and lower than those reported in china 8 65 317 mg kg 1 india 15 66 34 49 mg kg 1 and uganda 8 65 317 mg kg 1 maleki et al 2014 lui et al 2006 gupta et al 2008 nabulo et al 2010 for pb the maximum values obtained in this study 0 01 127 05 mg kg 1 were higher than those reported in iran 0 33 0 68 mg kg 1 china 0 18 7 75 mg kg 1 india 10 37 17 79 mg kg 1 and uganda 0 18 7 75 mg kg 1 the maximum content obtained for cd 0 01 2 98 mg kg 1 were higher than those reported for vegetables in iran 0 003 0 03 mg kg 1 china 0 036 0 18 mg kg 1 and uganda 0 036 0 18 mg kg 1 and lower than the concentration obtained by india 10 37 17 79 mg kg 1 for cr the maximum values obtained 0 27 9 12 mg kg 1 were higher than the concentrations reported in vegetables from iran 3 85 4 75 mg kg 1 and lower than those obtained in china 0 08 15 4 mg kg 1 india 34 83 96 30 mg kg 1 and uganda 0 08 15 4 mg kg 1 maleki et al 2014 lui et al 2006 gupta et al 2008 nabulo et al 2010 the absence of significant levels of metals in irrigation water and soil means that the high concentrations of metals recorded in investigated plant samples are probably linked to chemicals used to combat and prevent a viridis diseases and to fight against pests pesticides in congo dr the agricultural activities frequently use pesticides and fungicides containing for instance metals such as pb zn cr as ni and hg it also could be attributed to the use of phosphatidic fertilizers which contain metals as a natural impurity ngelinkoto et al 2014 muliele et al 2016 as explained above the cultivation of a viridis is mainly performed in the peri urban municipalities in many cases alongside rivers and or heavily trafficked roads it has been demonstrated that although metal concentrations in analyzed soils are found within the acceptable limits the concentrations of metals in a viridis can be above the recommended values suggesting that aerial deposition may be a major source of contamination atayese et al 2009 the present study demonstrated that metal concentration in analyzed soils and plants decrease as the distance from the roads increases which support the hypothesis of aerial deposition 3 5 pearson correlation between parameters the statistical studies focused on the cecomaf site which showed high metal concentrations for analyzed water soil and plant samples table 8 shows the calculated values of the pearson correlation among metals in both a water and a viridis plant from cecomaf site and in b soil and a viridis plant from cecomaf site in table 8a a significant positive correlation among metals is observed cr recorded a strong positive correlation with cu as and pb a strong positive correlation occurred between co and cu co and zn and between co and cd a strong positive correlation is also recorded between cu and pb zn and cd and as and pb while zn showed a strong negative correlation with as in table 8b a strong positive correlation was recorded for cr and cu cr and as cr and pb cr and hg co and zn co and cd cu and as cu and pb cu and hg zn and cd as and pb as and hg pb and hg suggesting that these elements could come from the same source with a similar pathway strong negative intercorrelation were recorded between cr and cd cu and cd zn and as zn and pb as and cd cd and pb cd and hg 3 6 assessment of potential health risks the targeted hazard quotient thq values for the heavy metal in a viridis are shown in table 9 the calculated thq value for each heavy metal in the leaf of a viridis which is the most edible part of this plant decreased in the following order co pb zn cd cr hg cu as for cecomaf site pb cr co zn hg cd as cu for rifflaert site and pb zn cd co cr cu hg as for lemba imbu site compared to the reference dose set by usepa 2018 the calculated thq were higher than the recommended values except for as in lemba imbu site these findings indicate that the consumption of the plant could present human health risks the sum of the thqs represents the hazard index hi when the hi is equal to 1 it has a protective effect and if it is greater than 1 there will be production of adverse effects on health e g chukwuemeka and hephzibah 2018 for this study the sums of thq values at different sampling sites were greater than 1 the following decreasing order was observed cecomaf 15 975 lemba imbu 8 159 rifflaert 6 456 based on these results consumers of a viridis from these sites are exposed to potential heavy metal adverse effects on human health adverse effects may include but not limited to serious damage to body organs and higher risk of cancer the edi and ewi calculated based on the consumption of cr co cu zn as cd pb and hg in a viridis including 67 g of amaranthus per day and 469 g per week are presented in table 10 it was suggested that there is a link between the toxic hazards of food contaminated by heavy metals and these two parameters 1 the concentration of heavy metal in food and 2 the amount of food consumed mata et al 2019 compared to the values set by the joint committee of experts on food additives of fao who 2013 the calculated edi and ewi were above the permissible limits for cd in leaves from cecomaf and lemba imbu and for pb in leaves from cecomaf rifflaert and lemba imbu thus edi and ewi values from cecomaf rifflaert and lemba imbu sites indicate that consuming leafy vegetables can be associated with human health risks edi and ewi values of cu zn as and hg don t present any risk as they were below the recommended limits 4 conclusion this study investigated for the first time the concentrations of heavy metals in a viridis samples collected from the most exploited sites by the farmers of kinshasa capital city of the democratic republic of the congo the results indicate that a viridis is contaminated by cr co cu zn as cd pb and hg present potential adverse effects to consumers soil and irrigation water characteristics were within allowed food and agriculture organization values the vegetable contamination can be explained by chemicals used to combat and prevent a viridis diseases and the vehicle and motorcycle emissions around therefore the results from this study strongly recommend the control and limitation e g by regulation and raising awareness of the use of unknown compounds and pesticides in urban agriculture to reduce potential health risks additionally as many of these agricultures are mainly carried out alongside heavily trafficked roads the relocation of such site is recommended in order to reduce vehicle and motorcycle emission deposits on foodstuffs based on these present findings the authors ascertained here that more detailed periodical studies should monitor heavy metal content in these vegetables

20078,the urban agriculture in developing countries plays a huge important socioeconomic role in confronting the challenge of eradicating hunger improving food security and the social daily life of the population however the quality evaluation of water used for urban agriculture irrigation as well as the accumulation of pollutants such as heavy metals in fresh produces are still largely unstudied the purpose of this study was to investigate the concentration of metals cr co ni cu zn as cd pb and hg in irrigation water from rivers soil and amaranthus viridis a viridis in order to evaluate the potential human dietary risks the research was conducted in eight sites characterized by intensive agriculture performed in watersheds in kinshasa capital of democratic republic of the congo the results showed high metal concentrations in a viridis leaf varying considerably among sampling sites p 05 reaching the values in mg kg 1 wet weight of 2 97 cr 1 73 co 12 30 ni 16 11 cu 652

associated with contaminated a viridis consumption was performed in comparing the metal values obtained in a viridis leaves with permissible reference levels fao who 2000 2004b 2006 standards for heavy metals in food jecfa 2003 and the food standard agency fsa 2006 we also computed for risks by calculating i the targeted risk quotient thq ii the hazard index hi iii the estimation of daily intake edi and iv the estimation of weekly intake ewi as described in several studies suami et al 2018 zhong et al 2018 makedonski et al 2017 usepa 1989 2018 mata et al 2019 2 9 statistical analysis all analyses were conducted in triplicate for a set of conditions 3 biological field sampling and technical analysis replicates data were analyzed descriptively by means of t test analysis with a significance level difference set at p 05 the statistical treatment of the data has been realized using sigmastat 11 0 systat software inc usa the data were subjected to the pearson correlation to investigate the possible positive and negative relationships among the variables 3 results and discussion 3 1 water physicochemical characteristics water physicochemical parameters including temperature ph electrical conductivity and dissolved oxygen are presented in table 2 physicochemical properties are important parameters to evaluate the quality of water used for irrigation irrigation water outside recommended values may cause many problems to the development of some legumes and cause nutritional imbalance due to the presence many undesirable substances brockwell and gault 1976 all analyzed water physicochemical parameters were found within the permissible levels set by food and agriculture organization fao 1985 the highest value of conductivity was observed in water samples from groundwater with the values of 1458 μs cm 1 the similar values were observed in the groundwater of the municipality of bumbu in kinshasa kapembo et al 2016 the low dissolved oxygen levels can be explained by probably the excess of organic matter in water samples from studied sites kayembe et al 2018a b 3 2 soil physicochemical characteristics the soil characteristics including organic matter om calcium carbonate caco3 and particle grain size clay silt and sand are reported in table 3 the soil om content ranged from 2 11 to 6 98 the values obtained from the site sas were higher than the values found in the agricultural soil of the region boyer 1982 mulaji et al 2016 the soil grain size varied considerably according to the sampling sites the soil from all sampling sites was sandy soil except for the sites ris mos and tss which were sandy clay loam clay and silt varied significantly but the sand values remained higher with the values ranged from 73 54 to 92 68 than the values of clay and silt except for mos site 36 82 the soil caco3 content was less than 1 for all sampling sites 3 3 metal concentration in water and soil samples the heavy metal cr co cu zn as cd and pb concentrations in water samples are reported in table 4 the obtained values were under the permissible levels set by food and agriculture organization fao 1985 metal and metalloid concentrations in soil samples are reported in table 5 low concentrations were observed for almost all sampling sites except for cecomaf ces site with the values of 251 345 and 2 15 mg kg 1 for pb zn and hg respectively these values are higher than the recommended values for agricultural soils cec 1986 the high metal concentrations observed in soil samples from ces can be probably explained by several human activities performed around and in the site these activities include commercial and industrial settlements and the presence of uncontrolled landfills which contaminate soil and irrigation water used in this site tshibanda et al 2014 the soil samples from cesco control soil near cecomaf site are characterized by notable levels of metals e g zn pb and as but are in general lowest in comparison with metal levels in soil samples from ces soil from cecomaf site 3 4 metal concentrations in a viridis the icp ms analysis results of heavy metals in a viridis are given in table 6 in general the metal and metalloid content in different parts of plant revealed the following order root leaf stem except for the zn which showed the following order leaf root stem the same tendency was observed for pb and cd in a viridis cultivated in lagos nigeria atayese et al 2009 and for cd cr pb and as in vegetables in mature stage cultivated in china meng et al 2016 the content of cr as cd pb and hg in edible portions leaf of a viridis samples from investigated sites mainly from cecomaf and rifflaert sites exceeded safe limits set by food and agriculture organization world health organization for human consumption who fao 2003 jecfa 2006 for example the hg value from cecomaf is 90 times higher than the who acceptable limit 0 001 mg kg 1 table 6 however the concentration of metals cr as cd pb and hg observed in this study was lower than the values observed in the a viridis leaves grown in nigeria atayese et al 2009 azi et al 2018 the maximum hg content 0 09 mg kg 1 in leaves was recorded at cecomaf site this value was higher than the permitted safety limits of 0 001 mg kg 1 who fao 2003 jecfa 2006 for cd the content values were higher than the recommended values in the three part of the plant in the mombele mo cecomaf ce rifflaert ri lemba imbu li and saïo sa sites the cr also showed values above the recommended values in leaf stem and root for tshuenge cecomaf rifflaert lemba imbu and saïo sites in this study high content of cu was detected in cecomaf root 33 89 mg kg 1 while mombele stem had lowest content 0 34 mg kg 1 for cr the highest content 9 12 mg kg 1 was measured in lemba imbu root while the lowest 0 27 mg kg 1 was measured in kimpoko root pb content varied from 0 01 mg kg 1 kimpoko stem to 127 05 mg kg 1 lemba imbu root while cd content varied from 0 01 mg kg 1 kimpoko leaf and stem and monastery stem to 2 98 mg kg 1 lemba imbu root good agreement was observed when our data for the levels of cu cr pb and cd were compared with previously reported data in a chinese study china mlcf 2014 and the who fao reports from 2003 table 7 shows for instance that the maximum concentrations recorded for cu 0 34 33 89 mg kg 1 were higher than the values reported for vegetables in iran 5 8 8 28 mg kg 1 and lower than those reported in china 8 65 317 mg kg 1 india 15 66 34 49 mg kg 1 and uganda 8 65 317 mg kg 1 maleki et al 2014 lui et al 2006 gupta et al 2008 nabulo et al 2010 for pb the maximum values obtained in this study 0 01 127 05 mg kg 1 were higher than those reported in iran 0 33 0 68 mg kg 1 china 0 18 7 75 mg kg 1 india 10 37 17 79 mg kg 1 and uganda 0 18 7 75 mg kg 1 the maximum content obtained for cd 0 01 2 98 mg kg 1 were higher than those reported for vegetables in iran 0 003 0 03 mg kg 1 china 0 036 0 18 mg kg 1 and uganda 0 036 0 18 mg kg 1 and lower than the concentration obtained by india 10 37 17 79 mg kg 1 for cr the maximum values obtained 0 27 9 12 mg kg 1 were higher than the concentrations reported in vegetables from iran 3 85 4 75 mg kg 1 and lower than those obtained in china 0 08 15 4 mg kg 1 india 34 83 96 30 mg kg 1 and uganda 0 08 15 4 mg kg 1 maleki et al 2014 lui et al 2006 gupta et al 2008 nabulo et al 2010 the absence of significant levels of metals in irrigation water and soil means that the high concentrations of metals recorded in investigated plant samples are probably linked to chemicals used to combat and prevent a viridis diseases and to fight against pests pesticides in congo dr the agricultural activities frequently use pesticides and fungicides containing for instance metals such as pb zn cr as ni and hg it also could be attributed to the use of phosphatidic fertilizers which contain metals as a natural impurity ngelinkoto et al 2014 muliele et al 2016 as explained above the cultivation of a viridis is mainly performed in the peri urban municipalities in many cases alongside rivers and or heavily trafficked roads it has been demonstrated that although metal concentrations in analyzed soils are found within the acceptable limits the concentrations of metals in a viridis can be above the recommended values suggesting that aerial deposition may be a major source of contamination atayese et al 2009 the present study demonstrated that metal concentration in analyzed soils and plants decrease as the distance from the roads increases which support the hypothesis of aerial deposition 3 5 pearson correlation between parameters the statistical studies focused on the cecomaf site which showed high metal concentrations for analyzed water soil and plant samples table 8 shows the calculated values of the pearson correlation among metals in both a water and a viridis plant from cecomaf site and in b soil and a viridis plant from cecomaf site in table 8a a significant positive correlation among metals is observed cr recorded a strong positive correlation with cu as and pb a strong positive correlation occurred between co and cu co and zn and between co and cd a strong positive correlation is also recorded between cu and pb zn and cd and as and pb while zn showed a strong negative correlation with as in table 8b a strong positive correlation was recorded for cr and cu cr and as cr and pb cr and hg co and zn co and cd cu and as cu and pb cu and hg zn and cd as and pb as and hg pb and hg suggesting that these elements could come from the same source with a similar pathway strong negative intercorrelation were recorded between cr and cd cu and cd zn and as zn and pb as and cd cd and pb cd and hg 3 6 assessment of potential health risks the targeted hazard quotient thq values for the heavy metal in a viridis are shown in table 9 the calculated thq value for each heavy metal in the leaf of a viridis which is the most edible part of this plant decreased in the following order co pb zn cd cr hg cu as for cecomaf site pb cr co zn hg cd as cu for rifflaert site and pb zn cd co cr cu hg as for lemba imbu site compared to the reference dose set by usepa 2018 the calculated thq were higher than the recommended values except for as in lemba imbu site these findings indicate that the consumption of the plant could present human health risks the sum of the thqs represents the hazard index hi when the hi is equal to 1 it has a protective effect and if it is greater than 1 there will be production of adverse effects on health e g chukwuemeka and hephzibah 2018 for this study the sums of thq values at different sampling sites were greater than 1 the following decreasing order was observed cecomaf 15 975 lemba imbu 8 159 rifflaert 6 456 based on these results consumers of a viridis from these sites are exposed to potential heavy metal adverse effects on human health adverse effects may include but not limited to serious damage to body organs and higher risk of cancer the edi and ewi calculated based on the consumption of cr co cu zn as cd pb and hg in a viridis including 67 g of amaranthus per day and 469 g per week are presented in table 10 it was suggested that there is a link between the toxic hazards of food contaminated by heavy metals and these two parameters 1 the concentration of heavy metal in food and 2 the amount of food consumed mata et al 2019 compared to the values set by the joint committee of experts on food additives of fao who 2013 the calculated edi and ewi were above the permissible limits for cd in leaves from cecomaf and lemba imbu and for pb in leaves from cecomaf rifflaert and lemba imbu thus edi and ewi values from cecomaf rifflaert and lemba imbu sites indicate that consuming leafy vegetables can be associated with human health risks edi and ewi values of cu zn as and hg don t present any risk as they were below the recommended limits 4 conclusion this study investigated for the first time the concentrations of heavy metals in a viridis samples collected from the most exploited sites by the farmers of kinshasa capital city of the democratic republic of the congo the results indicate that a viridis is contaminated by cr co cu zn as cd pb and hg present potential adverse effects to consumers soil and irrigation water characteristics were within allowed food and agriculture organization values the vegetable contamination can be explained by chemicals used to combat and prevent a viridis diseases and the vehicle and motorcycle emissions around therefore the results from this study strongly recommend the control and limitation e g by regulation and raising awareness of the use of unknown compounds and pesticides in urban agriculture to reduce potential health risks additionally as many of these agricultures are mainly carried out alongside heavily trafficked roads the relocation of such site is recommended in order to reduce vehicle and motorcycle emission deposits on foodstuffs based on these present findings the authors ascertained here that more detailed periodical studies should monitor heavy metal content in these vegetables

20079,microplastics irrespective of their myriad sources eventually are discharged into the world s oceans posing a serious threat to marine life evidence has shown the increasing threat posed by accumulation of microplastics along shore lines and sandy beaches to the species that inhabit these ecosystems this study evaluates the species at potential risk due to microplastic pollution along the coastal regions of india through a combination of existing literature and original observations the harmful effects of microplastics on various classes of aquatic and coastal species through both direct ingestion and indirect consumption by the process of bio accumulation have been discussed in this study the species at risk in other ecosystems such as freshwater lakes brackish water sites swamplands and marshlands have also been covered the various species recorded at these ecosystems were evaluated on the basis of their potential risk of consumption of microplastics potential routes for bioaccumulation of microplastics through trophic transfer have been proposed with special emphasis on the routes involving those species at risk in order to fill the existing knowledge gaps further studies in the indian scenario are therefore necessary in order to truly gauge the impact of the bioaccumulation in specific species and on the coastal ecosystem as a whole graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords microplastics bio accumulation daphnia benthic littoral 1 introduction plastics are lightweight inexpensive synthetic materials made from a wide range of polymers which cater to a large variety of needs naturally occurring environmental conditions in oceanic and freshwater ecosystems such as radiations from the sun abrasion and interaction with organic inorganic and other living beings cause plastics to weather and degrade into smaller fragments called microplastics frias and nash 2019 primary microplastics are manufactured such that their sizes are within the acceptable range while secondary microplastics are derived from fragmentation and physical chemical biological and degradation processes li et al 2018 yet another characteristic pertinent to defining microplastics are its shapes and types although they are not as significant as the aforementioned aspects due to its subjective nature fragments fibres and pellets foams and microbeads are the most commonly described types of microplastics in literature based on their usage frias and pagter 2018 the smallest category of plastics are nanoplastics which have been classified as those with sizes 1 μm da costa et al 2016 or 100 nm bergmann et al 2015 microplastics have been found in littoral environments like near shore sediments and sandy beaches crump et al 2020 prestholdt and kemp 2020 they are normally formed by the breaking down of macro plastic particles under ultraviolet radiations or mechanical abrasion and those that are manufactured for various industrial and domestic purposes such as resin pellets used in plastic industries exfoliating face and body scrubs synthetic clothing and toothpastes gesamp joint group of experts on the scientific aspects of marine environmental protection 2016 some of the other sources of microplastics are from washing synthetic clothes toothpaste scrubbing agents rubber tyres and city dust shahnawaz et al 2019 marine litter mainly originates from various activities on land they enter the marine ecosystem through wastewater treatment plants domestic as well as industrial drainage systems miladinova et al 2020 due to lack of basic infrastructure inadequate and improper waste management practices microplastics have become a universal environmental issue adversely affecting the marine ecosystem anthropogenic litter in seas is a matter of increasing concern because of the biological economic health and ecological consequences it can have alomar et al 2016 auta et al 2017 owing to their small size microplastics may be ingested by a range of organisms such as bivalves zooplankton mussels fishes shrimps oysters copepods lugworms and whales these particles are reported to cause false satiation pathological stress reproductive complications reduced growth rate blocked enzyme production and oxidative stress auta et al 2017 fossi et al 2016 mason et al 2016 death of marine life occurs mainly due to entanglement and ingestion desforges et al 2015 setälä et al 2014 microplastics first came to light as a potential threat to marine life in the early 1970s microplastics not only cause harm to marine species but also accumulate in the food web and cause damage to higher organisms batel et al 2020 choi et al 2020 wu et al 2020 microplastics may also be ingested indirectly through trophic transfer which is a naturally occurring process when the predators consume contaminated prey gouin 2020 it is estimated that 5 trillion microparticles of plastic are floating at sea weighing 250 000 tons globally eriksen et al 2014 these pollutants are highly persistent bio accumulative and toxic and are hence an area of major concern apart from having the potential to transport other contaminants plastics may also increase the environmental persistence of these pollutants ivar do sul and costa 2014 microplastics absorb the following organic contaminants ddt dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane pahs polycyclic

on microplastics in recent years campanale et al 2020 marine organisms experience physical effects only at higher concentrations of microplastics studies on the possible toxic effects of microplastics on freshwater organisms are limited and those pertaining to terrestrial organisms like soil dwelling invertebrates terrestrial fungi and plant pollinators are still in the initial stage of research de souza machado et al 2018 a study conducted on zebrafish showed the accrual of microplastic content in the liver of the fish caused inflammation and lipid accumulation leading to disrupted lipid and energy metabolism lu et al 2016 the importance of this study is to identify species that must be at risk this is the first step that must be taken before a large scale study on the microplastic pollution transition in the indian ecosystem it is very clear that the ingestion of microplastics by various organisms including fish sea birds zooplankton coral and marine mammals results in its trophic transfer singh et al 2020 trophic transfer through marine routes has in fact been traced right up to human consumption carbery et al 2018 hence it is important that studies on the presence of microplastics have on the indian ecosystem are evaluated in order to conduct this mammoth task this study attempts to focus on species that must be highlighted in order to conduct targeted research this study attempts to act as a preliminary work to determine the species at maximum risk and monitor their dietary habits and record microplastic content in the environment for future studies the effect of microplastics on daphnia corals benthic and littoral species fish avian reptiles mammals and humans have also been discussed 2 literature review the purpose of this review is to perform an assessment of the various species potentially affected by microplastic pollution along the indian coast and in particular the chennai region the paper gives insights to the various species that face a direct threat from microplastic pollution due to their habitats in the habitats they are found in various trophic levels of the ecosystem were assessed and the possible transmission in the ecosystem was assessed the effects of microplastics on indian species has not yet been studied or recorded hence the study evaluated the risk of microplastics to indian species by comparing them to genetically similar species found with microplastics in other parts of the world attention was given to the feeding mechanism of these species habitat of the species and other ecological aspects only those species that had similar diet and mode of feeding were considered while others even if very biologically similar that did not have similar feeding mechanism were not considered in this review the basis of this comparison is tenable as this study only attempts to identify the various species from the indian coast and does not predict the effects that microplastics might have on the described species to do the same google scholar elsevier and springer link were utilized search terms included but were not limited to microplastic pollution birds and microplastic turtles and microplastic daphnia and microplastic corals and microplastic whales and microplastic fish and microplastic fish species of chennai microplastic pollution from india the authors also conducted regular field visits from 2016 to 2019 to record the species distribution of the potentially affected species in the chennai region the health of biodiversity hotspots of chennai were checked for the presence of microplastic content it is impossible to spot all the species of a given area and so for the work to be a complete review other published records were checked and analysed using citizen science initiatives such as ebird and inaturalist 3 microplastic pollution in india microplastic pollution has been well documented in india by many researchers as seen in table 1 from the sabarmati river in gujarat patel et al 2018 to the islands of india like the great nicobar island dharani et al 2003 these studies have recorded plastics such as high density polyethylene hdpe low density polyethylene ldpe poly styrene ps and polyethylene terephthalate pet microplastics have been reported to contaminate sea salt in india seth and shriwastav 2018 however the biological fate of microplastics has not yet been well studied in the coastal estuarine and marine environment in india yellow pellets of microplastics have been recorded in abundance on the chennai coast 201 microplastics were found along the chennai coast by the same researchers mugilarasan et al 2017 pe and pp were recorded to be the most common microplastics along the coramandel coast karthik et al 2018 microplastic content has been observed in the gulf of mannar a marine biodiversity hotspot along the beaches of coral islands in rameswaram white pellets were recorded by a study with the presence of plastics such as polypropylene polyethylene polystyrene nylon and polyvinyl chloride vidyasakar et al 2018 particles of the size 2 5 mm were identified from the beaches of chennai like the marina beach veerasingam et al 2016 another study recorded microplastics from marina beach kanyakumari beach tiruchendur manapad and tuticorin coast sathish et al 2019 these beaches being hotspots for tourists attract large crowds and hence are extremely polluted south india experienced heavy rains during the months of november and december of 2015 due to the formation of a depression over southwest bay of bengal owing to the strong el niño phenomenon the floods that subsequently struck chennai have also seemed to have increased the presence of microplastic content in the city s water a study to observe the effects on the presence of microplastics was conducted in 2015 after the chennai floods this study found that the abundance of these microplastics in november 2015 was three fold higher than those found in march 2015 confirming that a huge quantity of fresh microplastics were swept along to the cooum and adyar rivers from land during the floods veerasingam et al 2016 several studies have been done to ascertain the presence of microplastics in coastal and inland areas of chennai microplastic concentrations have been recorded highest along the mouth of rivers in the southeast coast of india karthik et al 2018 in our study we have recorded the presence of microplastics from the adyar estuary there is a high possibility of microplastic content in other such ecosystems in the study area along the western parts of india microplastic studied have been conducted in the states of gujrat maharastra and kerala studies from gujrat are based from the sabarmathi river ram and kumar 2020 there is a lack of studies from the coastal parts of the state which must be conducted soon in the state of maharastra 41 85 of plastic content was found to be microplastics of which maximum microplastic content 55 3 was found on juhu beach and the concentration of microplastic was highest in the month of may in the juhu bandra and navi mumbai beaches microplastic content was mainly in the form of fragments and fibres which were red black and transparent naidu et al 2019 in kerala the concentration of microplastics in the state was highest in central kerala followed by southern kerala and least from northern kerala robin et al 2020 among the coramandel states the state of tamil nadu recorded the highest amount of microplastic pollution the souther parts of the states espcieally those regions along the gulf of mannar and palk bay recorded the highest microplastic content the north pamban in palk bay with a density of 0 66 particles m3 of micrpplastic content was one of the worst affected locations in the state james et al 2020 microplastics in the regions of thoothukudi and dhanushkodi beach at pamban island in tamil nadu were made up of 51 fibres 40 granules and 9 films it was found that dhanushkodi had least microplastic content from this region tiwari et al 2019 microplastic pollution in tamil nadu was not limited to the coast in the regions of south pennar river in microplastic concentration was higher downstream than upstream rajadurai and roopa 2019 in the northern parts of the east coastal plains the hooghly river in kolkata located in the state of west bengal microplastic fibres and pellets were recorded to be predominant from various sampling sites in the region bagri and darbha 2019 4 recording of species from the region of tamil nadu chennai formerly known as madras is one of the 11 metropolitan cities in india and houses an equatorial type of climate it is well known as a coramandel city and hence enjoys tropical dry evergreen forest one of the forest types of vegetation in the country chennai is home to three main types of water ecosystems namely freshwater lakes brackish water setups and marine ecosystems these ecosystems were chosen as the focus of the study conducted by the authors of this paper owing to the proximity of the region and the high biodiversity of species the extent of biodiversity of species in these places were analysed and the paths of bio accumulation were determined through observation of the food web of the region and examination of previously known diets of the species the marine ecosystems visited in the study were along beaches and other coastline setups all the beaches surveyed were polluted by marine debris that perennially get washed up during tidal movements the impact of microplastic pollution was not uniform on the surveyed beaches marina beach had a lot of visible microplastic agglomerates another ecosystem heavily affected by pollution are swamplands and wetlands su et al 2019 the palikaranai marsh land which was earlier used as a dump site is one of the largest wetlands in the state after efforts by several environmental activists a major part of the existing wetland was declared as a reserve forest however pollution is still very high in the wetland as dumping is still being carried out large amounts of plastic waste have been dumped at the site for decades hence there is a high threat to the habitat from microplastic based pollution though no studies have been conducted to conclusively find the effect or presence of microplastics in the wetland research groups have since started studying the wetland extensively both brackish and freshwater lakes were surveyed during the study two famous bird watching spots which are now important birding areas ibas were taken up as key parts of the study namely mudhuliyarkuppam and pulicat lake during our study kelambakkam backwaters sirthavur lake thaiyur lake were also surveyed due to its proximity to each other these constitute the freshwater lakes in the city these are less disturbed in terms of pollution but the habitats are threatened due to illegal land grabbing and poaching chembarambakkam is a major source of drinking water for chennai city it is an ancient and relatively large water body and so boasts a varied ecosystem the authors regularly visited these locations and recorded the various species that were observed in the ecosystem these species were then evaluated based on the risk of microplastic consumption species with low risk frugivorous bird herbivorous insects etc were not focused on due to a reduced risk of microplastic ingestion microplastic pollution was recorded from all beaches in chennai during this study and shown in table 2 fig 1 shows the extent of microplastics content observed at besant nagar beach the heath of the study areas was not uniform some of the places that were surveyed were taken as control sets to show that protected areas have lesser threats from microplastic pollution survey sites such as sirthavur lake thaiyur lake and chembarambakam lake were also taken in the study to see the difference in the number of species located in the study area even though the risk of microplastic pollution was lower when compared to marine ecosystems this would not act as control setups as the habitats of these places compared to other locations with higher pollution threats and microplastic contents are different moreover the pressure of humans on the ecosystem varies greatly from place to place there are multiple parameters that had to be taken into account and hence the authors felt it would be preferable not to compare the locations however the beaches were relatively comparable as they had an almost equal amount of external threats with respect to each other the presence of microplastics along beaches is a well established fact they have been reported on beaches at numerous locations worldwide ballent et al 2016 kunz et al 2016 mohamed nor and obbard 2014 naji et al 2017 stolte et al 2015 yu et al 2016 the bay of bengal comes under the risk five category of microplastic pollution a data output based on the data collected by a study shows the east coast of india in a red zone for microplastic pollution eriksen et al 2014 a study of microplastic pollution along the tamil nadu coast has been commissioned and started work in 2019 it is expected to deliver its report by 2020 tejonmayam 2019a the full list of species recorded during the survey of this study is attached as appendix a at the end of the manuscript 5 effect on daphnia zooplankton such as daphnia magna use filtration of suspended particles to extract nutrients this is the main feeding strategy of the organism daphnia magna consumes green algae as vital part of its diet green algae can grow and colonize on the surface of plastic materials frias et al 2018 presence of microplastics in the gut lining of d magna can prevent or inhibit the consumption of food a study showed that lower algal concentration has a negative effect of microplastics on reproduction ogonowski et al 2016 but at higher algal concentrations it was seen that microplastics have a positive effect on the reproduction of d magna interference of plastic particles on food intake by d magna is not fully understood a number of studies on microplastic ingestion and egestion by d magna frydkjær et al 2017 gaiser et al 2011 jemec et al 2016 and copepod centropages typicus frias et al 2018 have been conducted that use short term exposure for 48 h laboratory experiments may vary from the natural environmental conditions that expose the organism to various sizes and toxicity levels of microplastics unlike set conditions in the lab a study reported that the number of ingested particles increased with increase in exposure time rist et al 2017 this indicates that the organism would have a higher intake of plastics in the duration of their natural lifespan than the controlled exposure in the laboratory but it is also important to mention that plastic concentrations used in laboratory research are usually higher than those observed in the environment lenz et al 2016 however in the previous experiments and searches conducted it has been observed that d magna ingests and egests microplastics without any significant change in its survival or reproduction canniff and hoang 2018a these results have been both supported by rist et al 2017 and contradicted by ogonowski et al 2016 previously conducted studies in which effects of microplastic particles on survival and reproduction of d magna were demonstrated negative effects of nano plastic consumption on reproduction of d magna have also been recorded besseling et al 2014 however it must also be noted that researchers have also found microplastic content to be merely excreted by d magna canniff and hoang 2018b nevertheless this is a cause of concern as trophic transfer of microplastic to fish has been recorded from the united states elizalde velázquez et al 2020 plastic particles in the natural ecosystem exist in different shapes sizes and types canniff and hoang 2018b cole et al 2011 eerkes medrano et al 2015 spiky particles such as fragments and fibres are not egested as easily eerkes medrano et al 2015 as smooth and round shape beads one study reported that d magna egested microplastic beads at a higher rate than microplastic fibres frydkjær et al 2017 microplastic fibres have been found to twist in the gut of dead d magna jemec et al 2016 slow or no egestion of microplastic particles will in turn lead to decreased ingestion rate resulting in reduced food intake which may lead to starving and adverse effects cole et al 2011 jemec et al 2016 windsor et al 2019 6 effect on corals coral reefs are also not spared by microplastics more recently a study showed the ability of some species of scleractinia corals to ingest microplastics hall et al 2015 this study was done off the coast of australia the rapid accumulation of these microplastics could potentially damage the health of the coral reef it was found that these species of corals mistake microplastics for their prey plankton and can consume up to 50 μg of plastic at a rate similar to their consumption of plankton however it is still uncertain how this ingestion affects coral energetics and growth or if reef growth in general is threatened hall et al 2015 these can also be seen in deep sea corals species however the effects of microplastics on these corals have still not been ascertained woodall et al 2014 in a study conducted by reichert et al 2018 coral species showed different responses to microplastic exposure these responses include ingestion of microplastic polymers mucus production on the reefbuilding corals overgrowth and attachment of microplastic to tentacles polyethylene 37 to 163 μm or mesenterial filaments the most detrimental effects on corals were coral bleaching and tissue necrosis another study showed that acute exposure of pocillopora damicornis to microplastics lead to activation of stress response of these corals resulting in repression in its detoxification and immune system through the jnk and erk signal pathways tang et al 2018 another study suggested that microplastics disturb coral polyps either through direct or indirect interaction or through photosynthesis perturbation due to the microplastics covering the surface of the corals syakti et al 2019 the chennai coast has many species of corals documented by the zoological survey of india along the tamil nadu coast we commonly come across brush coral acropora hyacinthus and biral coral anacropora reticulatal these species may also be affected by microplastic pollution a study on hard corals showed nematocyst discharge and ingestion of different microplastics including pe suggesting that the presence of phagostimulants potentially related to toxic compounds the study also showed that the retention rate of microplastics in mesenterial tissue within the gut cavity after a whole day of recovery was close to 6 allen et al 2017 for a permanent solution to save the coral and island ecosystem from microplastic debris regular monitoring with proper recycling of plastics and restrictions on plastic usage must be implemented along with these measures further investigations on the effect of microplastic pollution on corals must be carried out to help government organisations with policymaking vidyasakar et al 2018 7 accumulation in benthic and littoral species in kochi kerala india spectroscopic analysis of polystyrene in benthic invertebrates was carried out the study examined microplastic particles present in the benthic invertebrates sternaspis scutata magelona cinta deposit feeders and tellina sp suspension feeder naidu et al 2017 microplastics deposit along the coast from the ocean into beaches and sedimentary habitats unfortunately due to their small size both benthic suspension and deposit feeders may accidentally or selectively ingest sinking and sedimentary microplastics cole et al 2011 thompson et al 2004 wright et al 2013 polychaete are a class of annelid worms which are found in the marine ecosystem better known as segmented worms they are widely distributed and are identified by their bristles made of chitin and are important indicators of the heath of any marine ecosystem ragunathan 2012 in the east cost of india polychaete are littoral creatures in our study a few polychaetes have been noted but it was not possible to identify them up to the species level due to the lack of credible resources to ascertain their identification from the indian coast arenicola sp was encountered along many beaches like the besant nagar beach valmiki nagar beach and along the entire east coast road they were found by baiting the coast with crab meat by locals nereis sp were also seen in the study area these are long thick worms which are known to have setae and parapodia for locomotion lugworms have also been observed feeding on microplastic content thompson et al 2004 no other observations were made however wright et al 2013 found that the lug worm arenicola marina ingests microplastic and this causes reduced feeding increased phagocytic activity reduced available energy reserves and lower lipid reserves wright et al 2013 they enter into the bodies of marine animals that could lead to internal damage apart from accumulating toxins microplastics also threaten micro fauna such as plankton single celled tiny organisms that fish and even whales feed on that thrive in oceans fig 2 shows the bioaccumulation of microplastic in the arenicola based food chain oysters are also affected by microplastic debris particles may be ingested and accumulated by oysters leading to physical effects ward and kach 2009 had used oysters and mussels mytilus edulis as a basis of laboratory tests on their ability to uptake polystyrene beads ward and kach 2009 these beads were ingested when they were incorporated into aggregates composed of their normal food sources post ingestion the polystyrene beads were found in digestive glands creating possibilities for toxicological effects and the potential to transfer microparticles to higher order organisms through the process of bioaccumulation ward and kach 2009 this transfer was validated by van cauwenberghe et al 2015 when they purchased muscles and oysters from various markets in france and germany van cauwenberghe et al 2015 along the coast of california the pacific mole crab emerita analoga has been recorded with microplastic in it with one study recording 35 of mole crabs across 38 beaches in california horn et al 2019 the mortality of crabs was seen to increase with areas that have higher concentrations of microplastic embryonic variability and reduced egg carrying capacity were also attributed to the effect of microplastics horn et al 2020 this could also be the case with other species of mole crabs across the globe where microplastic content is persistent in beaches in tamil nadu emerita emeritus has been recorded historically and sporadically subramoniam 1979 during the study it was spotted on all beaches with maximum density found along the besant nagar beach which though cleaned regularly has reported nearly 846 kg of litter in a clean up drive in 2019 tejonmayam 2019b this species is similar in phylogenetics to the pacific mole crab emerita analoga tam et al 2002 and both species are known to have the same feeding mechanism filter feeding and diet subramoniam 2017 another species of mole crab albunea symmysta was recorded from marina beach and besant nagar and has also been recorded several times on the tamil nadu coast kumar et al 2018 the accumulation of microplastic in benthic species is a cause of concern they constitute the diet of several higher order in terms of energy level organisms hence the accumulation of microplastics in benthic and beach sediments could change the quality of marine habitats and cause physiological and toxicological risks on these inhabitants of the ecosystem potentially affecting humans with the latter effect being termed as bioaccumulation many species of waders birds that feed along the costal belt picking up insects and smaller invertebrates do feed on benthic species some of these waders are already in the red data book of iucn under various categories indicating a significant chance that microplastic content in the benthic creature will bio accumulate in the bird it is therefore logical to assume that it can have an adverse effect on waders as well the major route for these species is by direct ingestion accidental small fragments picked up assuming its food and indirect ingestion bio accumulation more studies on the effect of microplastic content are needed to show conclusive evidence of it having an impact on waders 8 effect on fish e j carpenter and k l smith were some of the first people to find microplastics in fish with their study being based in the united states of america in 1972 laskar and kumar 2019 kartar found microplastic content in fish from the united kingdom in 1973 lusher 2015 microplastics in the form of microfibres were observed in the gastrointestinal tracts of fish species like the aplodactylus punctatus jerguilla and basilichthys australis pejerrey in central chile pozo et al 2019 along the coast of rapa nui easter island in chile amberstripe scads decapterus muroadsi were also shown to have ingested microplastic content ory et al 2017 studies have suggested that ingestion of microplastics by various varieties of fish occurs during suction feeding on biofilms external exposure is also likely in the case of fish wherein microplastics are transferred into the system of the fish without the fish trying to ingest the microplastics consciously microplastics can also accumulate in their gills the extent of effect is determined by the size distribution concentration and toxic nature of the microplastic to the particular organism lusher 2015 studies from the united states have shown using fish that trophic transfer is a significant route of microplastic exposure which is known to detrimentally effect the larval stages of fish athey et al 2020 the european bass dicentrarchus labrax was recorded to experience behavioural changes and intestinal alterations due to the presence of microplastics pedà et al 2016 neurotoxic effects of microplastics was also seen in the same fish this is a cause for concern as microplastics have also been linked to the increase of mercury bio concentration in gills and bioaccumulation in the liver barboza et al 2018 this fish is consumed by larger fish and birds causing cases of mercury poising this is a cause of concern to india also as this species is commonly seen in europe and has similar species recorded in the bay of bengal lates calcarifer the asian seabass is commonly recorded along the bay of bengal and is known to have similar feeding patterns and dietary sources as its european cousin the possible routes of bioaccumulation of microplastics through fish have been depicted in figs 3 and 4 using goby species and indian mackerel as examples piscivorous birds feed on goby species these are mainly gulls and tern species sterna group of terns especially collis et al 2011 in this the brown headed gull is known to feed on gobies a study recorded the presence of microplastic in the common goby pomatoschistus microps oliveira et al 2013 ingestion modulation bioavailability or biotransformation of pyrene decreased energy and inhibited ache activity were observed in the samples two goby fishes cryptocentrus cyanotaenia and istigobius diadema have been found in the tuticorin and mandapam coastal waters of tamil nadu india kumar 2014 in another study from in tuticorin mp contamination was found in the following species of fish harpodon nehereus chirocentrus dorab sardinella albella rastrelliger kanagurta katsuwonus pelamis and istiophorus platypterus sathish et al 2020 a study conducted by in the haizhou bay china analysed the mp content in the following major wild fish species thryssa kammalensis amblychaeturichthys hexanema odontamblyopus rubicundus cynoglossus semilaevis chaeturichthys stigmatias and collichthys lucidus the greatest abundance of mp content was found to be in t kammalensis feng et al 2019 thryssa kammalensis along with other fish of the thryssa genus were recorded along the eastern coast of india near odisha saren et al 2019 while o rubicundus has been found in the bakkhali river estuary in the bay of bengal siddique et al 2015 a close relative of c semilaevis c bilineatus has been observed along the west coast of india in the malabar region which has similar feeding mechanisms and dietary needs mohan joseph et al 2003 high concentrations of microplastics was observed in a study conducted by zhu et al 2019b in the south china sea microplastic content was found in the stomach and intestines of r solandri scomber japonicus centroberyx lineatus and m griseus among many other species as well scomber japonicus is said to be found in the northern indian ocean baker and collette 1998 in the musa estuary located in the persian gulf platycephalus indicus saurida tumbil sillago sihama and cynoglossus abbreviates were collected from three sites and analysed for microplastic content s tumbil have been found at ratnagiri on the coast of gujarat in western india sadawarte et al 2018 p indicus has been recorded at karaikal tamil nadu off the southeast coast of india rajasegar and sendhilkumar 2009 while s sihama has been recorded in the same region in the gulf of mannar jayasankar 1991 a study conducted off the portuguese coast found that pelagic fish ingested more mp particles and benthic fish ingested more mp fibres the highest mean of ingested plastics was found to be in the scomber japonicas neves et al 2015 a species known from indian waters india biodiversity portal 2020 microplastic content was also found in indian markel rastrelliger kanagurta an important source of fish based proteins for humans karami et al 2017 in a study conducted by bessa et al 2018 the seabream diplodus vulgaris was also seen to be affected by mps this species is known from which is found in the arabian sea on the northeast coast of brazil a study was conducted on the hyporhampus unifasciatus and significant microplastic consumption was recorded vendel et al 2017 h limbatus a very similar feeding species to h unifasciatus that has been recorded in chilika lake odisha india karna et al 2017 is therefore vulnerable to microplastic consumption as well table 3 lists additional marine organisms that are at risk of consuming microplastics special attention to species found in the region such as harpodon nehereus chirocentrus dorab sardinella albella scomber japonicus rastrelliger kanagurta cryptocentrus cyanotaenia istigobius diadema katsuwonus pelamis platycephalus indicus saurida tumbil and istiophorus platypterus must be given and more studies on the effects and route of microplastic transfer must be investigated in studies from other parts of the world fish have been known to cause microplastic trophic transfer to mammals nelms et al 2018 thus the threat posed by fish on the indian avian and mammalian fauna must be investigated particlualry for the species discussed in the sections that follow 9 effect on avian fauna there have been many clear cases where plastic pollution has proved to be disastrous on bird populations microplastics have known to accumulate in birds by accidental ingestion during feeding and through dietary sources the accumulation of microplastic has been extensively studied in marine birds especially the northern fulmar fulmarus glacialis many studies have been conducted on the species from the northern hemisphere most notable study from iceland serves as a baseline kühn and van franeker 2012 the study indicated that regions that were disturbed by anthropogenic activity were proved to cause more plastic ingestion by the bird recently a study from south georgia reported microplastics in emperor penguins aptenodytes patagonicus that was linked to trophic transfer highlighting the fact that birds can consume microplastics through indirect routes le guen et al 2020 microplastic accumulation in birds of prey found in central florida have also been linked to trophic transfer from consumption of prey avian life metal consumption is known to be facilitated by microplastic due to an increase in its bio accessibility though the risk was accessed to be low holmes et al 2020 in general plastics have been hypothesised to reduce fertility change body conditions and affect mortality of marine birds irrespective of their form and size of the plastic pollutant wilcox et al 2015 in south africa the effect of microplastics on ducks and geese was recorded from barberspan nature reserve and false bay ecology park both ramsar wetlands the results have been recorded in table 4 which also shows how biomagnification is possible in india while comparing similar species of birds that are known to have the same hunting strategy and diet in portugal it was noted that the most prevalent type of plastic affecting marine diving birds were microplastics basto et al 2019 this suggests that microplastics are more bioavailable and have a higher probability of being accidentally or selectively ingested than larger pieces of plastic materials lusher et al 2018 another study from the bay of biscay spain reported microplastics in the faecal pellets of european shag phalacrocorax aristotelis yellow legged gull larus michahellis black headed gull chroicocephalus ridibundus masiá et al 2019 while another study from malta recorded microplastics in the stomach contents of yellow legged gull larus michahellis black headed gull chroicocephalus ridibundus black legged kittiwake rissa tridactyla lesser black backed gull larus fuscus great cormorant phalacrocorax carbo all of which are species that are known to occur in india brauer and brauer 2018 sooty terns onychoprion fuscatus have been recorded with various plastic debris in them including microplastics from brazil de souza petersen et al 2016 another very similar species that is seen feeding along with sooty terns are the bridled tern onychoprion anaethetus making it equally vulnerable to mps both of these species are known to occur in the coastal waters of india and were recorded by the first author shorebirds also known as waders are found near water edges especially near the sea as seen in fig 5 shorebirds inhabit extremely polluted environments along the coast in india making them susceptible to mps one of the most common species of wader seen in the study area is the black tailed godwit limosa limosa ebird india 2020a they have been observed feeding on scrobicularia species such as scrobicularia plana catry et al 2012 which is known accumulate microplastics ribeiro et al 2017 it is thus inherent that the species is vulnerable to microplastic pollution and immediate assessment of the bird is required as it is a near threated species the great knot calidris tenuirostris is a vulnerable species of wader which was recorded from tamil nadu the diet of the great knot calidris tenuirostris consists of bivalves molluscs gastropods polychaete worms crabs shrimps and sea cucumbers they have also been found to eat seeds and berries zhang et al 2011 several species of bivalves have been well documented to have microplastic content as discussed previously the effects of microplastic are not known on the bird but due to the sharp decline in its numbers the role of microplastic pollution in its habitats must be immediately investigated in india a list of waders recorded with microplastic content by a study from the atlantic has been shown in table 5 with notes on where the species have been recorded during our field study microplastics have been conclusively found in red necked phalarope phalaropus lobatus moser and lee 2006 it is a scarce winter visitor to the country recorded during cyclone vardah from adyar nagarajan 2016 and sporadically from pulicat lake ebird india 2020a the red phalarope phalaropus fulicarius another species of the same genus has also been recorded with microplastic content connors and smith 1982 it is a straggler to the indian subcontinent with very few records from the country ebird india 2020b the population of raptor birds indicate the healthy nature of an ecological system it is important that the survival of these species is not jeopardised due to microplastics due to their higher trophic level the probability of accumulation is the most in china the common buzzard buteo buteo black kite milvus migrans lineatus common kestrel falco tinnunculus were observed with microplastic litter in their digestive tracts zhao et al 2016 all species that have been recorded from tamil nadu the common buzzard buteo buteo is an opportunistic species primarily preying on small mammals birds insects worms and snakes this variable diet might increase the risk of anthropogenic litter ingestion via prey secondary ingestion it could be hypothesised that large the diet of a species the higher the chances of microplastic entering the species a recent study in the united states recorded 9 species of raptors with microplastic content carlin et al 2020 the study found the maximum ingestion of microplastic was seen from the red shouldered hawk buteo lineatus and the osprey pandion haliaetus the study also suggested that trophic transfer was likely the cause of accumulation of microplastics based on their diet and proximity to areas affected by microplastics from the tamil nadu coast the osprey pandion haliaetus brahminy kite haliastur indus and white bellied seaeagle haliaeetus leucogaster are at the highest risk of being affected by trophic transfer of these species the osprey pandion haliaetus has been recorded with microplastic content in its gastrointestinal tract in central florida another study also suggested trophic transfer as a possible reason for presence of microplastics in double crested cormorants phalacrocorax auratus brookson et al 2019 a study in the indian context that analyzes discovered dead specimens is therefore necessary in order to confirm the route of transfer from the discussions above it is evident that microplastics are found in birds through their diet a comparative study on the dietary habits of various birds found with microplastics showed that piscivorous birds had higher chances of accumulating microplastics followed by birds that had a wide variety of diet such as smaller crustaceans and worms thus it is vital that the knowledge gaps in the presence and effects of mps from an indian context are filled with more research work and cooperation with the government fig 6 shows the results of this dietary analysis and the distribution of the possible routes of entry 10 effect on reptiles ingestion of marine debris can have lethal and sub lethal effects on sea turtles turtles have been known to eat plastic by accident many instances of olive ridley turtles with plastic bags were seen it has been hypothesised that they mistake the plastic bags for jellyfish however the threat of microplastics has not been discussed in the detail that it must be by turtle conservationists in tamil nadu though the green turtle is generally a herbivore it has been known to be an opportunistic carnivore it can hence ingest sediments with microplastic content from rio grande do sul brazil turtles have been found with microplastic content studies have found microplastics in the green turtle in the great barrier reef which is already an endangered species caron et al 2018 green turtles have been found in the gulf of mannar biosphere reserve near tamil nadu kannan 2008 samples taken from the gastrointestinal tract of leatherback turtles found off the coast of north carolina usa were found to contain 2 particles of microplastics per 100 ml of collected sample duncan et al 2019a in the same study hawksbill turtle samples from queensland australia were found to contain 1 particle per 100 ml leatherback turtles exist in significant populations in the southwestern indian ocean lambardi et al 2008 while hawksbill turtles have been found on the coasts of kerala and tamil nadu as well as those of andaman and nicobar islands and the lakshadweep islands rajagopalan et al 1996 other species of turtles such as olive ridley turtles lepidochelys olivacea have also been recorded with microplastics duncan et al 2019b they have been observed to be primarily carnivorous and eat crustaceans and molluscs it was recorded nesting along the chennai coast during the study fig 7 shows the possible ports of entry for microplastic in the food chain of the turtle this could be another external threat for turtle hatchings as they are more vulnerable to environmental changes turtle nesting sites were also degraded by microplastic pollution in the beaches studied by the authors this could be due to direct ingestion or bio accumulation jellyfish are the favoured food of turtles studies on pelagia noctiluca alcazo et al 2020 a common species of jellyfish in the mediterranean sea showed that jellyfish could a vector in transporting microplastic waste this waste will be transported to higher order organisms by predation jellyfish are known to feed on a wide range of plankton and could accumulate microplastic present in the ocean causing the predation of the jellyfish to have disastrous effects on marine turtles 11 effect on mammals several species of dolphins such as the bottle nosed dolphin risso s dolphin oppili 2018 indo pacific dolphin rahul muralidharan 2013 have been reported from chennai city though these dolphins have been recorded from the chennai coast the common dolphin was the only species recorded in the study marine mammals that employ a raptorial feeding strategy experience trophic transfer as primary route of microplastic ingestion than through direct intake nelms et al 2018 for example lusher et al 2016 found that 11 of mesopelagic fish investigated contained microplastics and estimated that close to 463 million microplastics could be ingested by one striped dolphin stenella coeruleoalba through the consumption of contaminated prey by using probability modules this claim has not been however empirically proved however if found to be true it would prove to be catastrophic on the population of the species studies on dolphins in the united states have claimed that weakened immune systems in them could be attributed to microplastic content but that has not been widely accepted lusher et al 2015 lusher also examined the stomach content 35 common dolphins in ireland to determine microplastic content common dolphins in north west spain were recorded with microplastic content in their stomach hernandez gonzalez et al 2018 this species is seen commonly in the chennai coast therefore the same threat is likely to be posed the indo humpback dolphin scientific name sousa chinensis was found to contain microplastics such as polyester and fibres in the guangxi beibu gulf china the sizes of the particles were between 1 and 5 mm with the majority of the deposits found in the foreguts and midguts zhu et al 2019a microplastics of similar sizes were also discovered in the guts of stranded bottlenose dolphins scientific name tursiops truncatus off the coast of south carolina usa battaglia 2019 and also in killer whales orcinus orca off the coast of ireland lusher et al 2018 ranging from 123 to 422 pieces per individual in the former in the latter 83 6 of the microplastics were fibres as opposed to 16 4 of fragments this indicates that even younger individuals are susceptible to microplastics due to these species being apex predators that consume other organisms that may have ingested microplastics these dolphins have been recorded in the bay of bengal along the east coast of india rahul muralidharan 2013 while killer whales have been observed near the coast of gujarat james and mohan 1987 beaked whales mesoplodon mirus from ireland were reported with microplastic content in ireland lusher et al 2015 rendering it likely whales are susceptible to microplastic pollution though no whales were recorded in the study there have been sightings of dwarf sperm whale kogia sima times of india 2019 sperm whale blue whale and bryde s whale balaenoptera brydei the hindu 2018 by various local experts from the east coast of india fin whales balaenoptera physalus in the mediterranean sea a species that are very similar to the blue whale balaenoptera musculus that is found in the indian ocean de vos et al 2016 have been found to be exposed and threatened by the high presence of microplastics while feeding on plankton fossi et al 2012 which is likely to end up in the blubber of the fins common minkes balaenoptera acutorostrata and sei whales balaenoptera borealis two species of baleen whales have been shown to contain microplastics in different locations all across the pacific ocean due to the nature of the prey they feed on burkhardt holm and n guyen 2019 this is likely to also affect bryde s whales balaenoptera brydei found off the coast of kerala george et al 2011 thus these species are at risk from microplastic pollution the death of a dugong another species that has been recorded in large numbers in the indian ocean sivakumar 2013 occurred in thailand due to the ingestion of plastics lewis 2019 inland mammals have also been recorded with microplastic content high concentrations of microplastics have also been found in the eurasian otter lutra lutra in italy which is likely to serve as a threat to the populations of the same species in the western ghats and central india perinchery 2018 12 effect on humans numerous studies relating to microplastics and their negative impact on marine life have been put forward yet the long term impact of microplastics on human health has not been investigated to great depth due to limited evidences in regard to this aspect humans however are in fact exposed to microplastics through consumption of seafood drinking water and even through the air we breathe apart from this microplastics are also found in cosmetic items such as facial scrubs and washes their minute size makes the entry of microplastics into any environment a facile task microplastics also find extensive use in cosmetics products due to their exfoliating and scrubbing properties kentin 2018 prolonged consumption of microplastics may lead to the disruption of human chromosomes that result in reproductive complications and cancers frias et al 2018 ingestion of microplastics has been suggested as a potential cause of toxicity inflammatory responses and oxidative stress smith et al 2018 however the nature or the consumption of seafood items per capita has doubled from 10 kg to 20 kg over the past 50 years gesamp joint group of experts on the scientific aspects of marine environmental protection 2016 the rapid increase in population will also increase the demand for food resources and ultimately seafood resources due to this there exists a higher probability of microplastics entering the human body through the seafood we consume approximately 50 of seafood is farmed using techniques like agriculture while the rest are wild caught van cauwenberghe and janssen 2014 nanoplastics are considered even more dangerous since their sizes are so minute that they can even penetrate cells and move into tissues and organs oysters and mussels that are harvested for human consumption have been recorded to contain 0 36 0 47 particles of microplastic per gram meaning that shellfish consumers could ingest up to 11 000 particles of microplastic per year van cauwenberghe and janssen 2014 in another study plastic fibres were found in the lungs of 87 of humans inspected this may be due to the microplastics present in air pauly et al 1998 13 conclusion from this study we can conclude that microplastics have been found in marine and terrestrial life in significant amounts and there are numerous other studies to support this fact as well microplastics are unknowingly consumed by animals and may also be indirectly consumed by humans when they feed on these affected organisms the two main processes by which microplastics enter the systems of these animals are by ingestion and bio accumulation which usually occurs in aquatic species due to most of the waste we produce ultimately winding up in water bodies although there is a myriad of evidence to account for the presence of microplastics in animals there is still uncertainty with respect to how these animals are affected by it studies relating to the mechanism by which microplastics pose danger to animals and humans are still rudimentary and so must be explored more in detail by performing more laboratory tests these studies will be necessary to understand the actual impact microplastics have on the environment various studies have presented that microplastics have reduced gene expression and reproductive capability of species this is a serious cause of concern for species that are globally threated and are found in habitats rich in microplastic debris a detailed study on the presence of microplastics in various indian species and the effects they have on these species must be critically evaluated soon targeted studies on larger species such as the black tailed godwit limosa limosa great knot calidris tenuirostris eurasian curlew numenius arquata whimbrel numenius phaeopus pacific golden plover that face the highest risk based on their dietary habits must be evaluated immediately from the indian coast coastal species listed as declining in the recently published state of india s birds report must be evaluated for the risks posed by microplastics clean up drives must be taken up by local residents and more awareness on the sources of microplastic pollution and its effects must be popularised within the indian community it is our recommendation that a commission must be opened to study the effect of microplastic pollution across the indian coast and study the various recommendations provided by other researchers declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work

20079,microplastics irrespective of their myriad sources eventually are discharged into the world s oceans posing a serious threat to marine life evidence has shown the increasing threat posed by accumulation of microplastics along shore lines and sandy beaches to the species that inhabit these ecosystems this study evaluates the species at potential risk due to microplastic pollution along the coastal regions of india through a combination of existing literature and original observations the harmful effects of microplastics on various classes of aquatic and coastal species through both direct ingestion and indirect consumption by the process of bio accumulation have been discussed in this study the species at risk in other ecosystems such as freshwater lakes brackish water sites swamplands and marshlands have also been covered the various species recorded at these ecosystems were evaluated on the basis of their potential risk of consumption of microplastics potential routes for bioaccumulation of microplastics through trophic transfer have been proposed with special emphasis on the routes involving those species at risk in order to fill the existing knowledge gaps further studies in the indian scenario are therefore necessary in order to truly gauge the impact of the bioaccumulation in specific species and on the coastal ecosystem as a whole graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords microplastics bio accumulation daphnia benthic littoral 1 introduction plastics are lightweight inexpensive synthetic materials made from a wide range of polymers which cater to a large variety of needs naturally occurring environmental conditions in oceanic and freshwater ecosystems such as radiations from the sun abrasion and interaction with organic inorganic and other living beings cause plastics to weather and degrade into smaller fragments called microplastics frias and nash 2019 primary microplastics are manufactured such that their sizes are within the acceptable range while secondary microplastics are derived from fragmentation and physical chemical biological and degradation processes li et al 2018 yet another characteristic pertinent to defining microplastics are its shapes and types although they are not as significant as the aforementioned aspects due to its subjective nature fragments fibres and pellets foams and microbeads are the most commonly described types of microplastics in literature based on their usage frias and pagter 2018 the smallest category of plastics are nanoplastics which have been classified as those with sizes 1 μm da costa et al 2016 or 100 nm bergmann et al 2015 microplastics have been found in littoral environments like near shore sediments and sandy beaches crump et al 2020 prestholdt and kemp 2020 they are normally formed by the breaking down of macro plastic particles under ultraviolet radiations or mechanical abrasion and those that are manufactured for various industrial and domestic purposes such as resin pellets used in plastic industries exfoliating face and body scrubs synthetic clothing and toothpastes gesamp joint group of experts on the scientific aspects of marine environmental protection 2016 some of the other sources of microplastics are from washing synthetic clothes toothpaste scrubbing agents rubber tyres and city dust shahnawaz et al 2019 marine litter mainly originates from various activities on land they enter the marine ecosystem through wastewater treatment plants domestic as well as industrial drainage systems miladinova et al 2020 due to lack of basic infrastructure inadequate and improper waste management practices microplastics have become a universal environmental issue adversely affecting the marine ecosystem anthropogenic litter in seas is a matter of increasing concern because of the biological economic health and ecological consequences it can have alomar et al 2016 auta et al 2017 owing to their small size microplastics may be ingested by a range of organisms such as bivalves zooplankton mussels fishes shrimps oysters copepods lugworms and whales these particles are reported to cause false satiation pathological stress reproductive complications reduced growth rate blocked enzyme production and oxidative stress auta et al 2017 fossi et al 2016 mason et al 2016 death of marine life occurs mainly due to entanglement and ingestion desforges et al 2015 setälä et al 2014 microplastics first came to light as a potential threat to marine life in the early 1970s microplastics not only cause harm to marine species but also accumulate in the food web and cause damage to higher organisms batel et al 2020 choi et al 2020 wu et al 2020 microplastics may also be ingested indirectly through trophic transfer which is a naturally occurring process when the predators consume contaminated prey gouin 2020 it is estimated that 5 trillion microparticles of plastic are floating at sea weighing 250 000 tons globally eriksen et al 2014 these pollutants are highly persistent bio accumulative and toxic and are hence an area of major concern apart from having the potential to transport other contaminants plastics may also increase the environmental persistence of these pollutants ivar do sul and costa 2014 microplastics absorb the following organic contaminants ddt dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane pahs polycyclic

on microplastics in recent years campanale et al 2020 marine organisms experience physical effects only at higher concentrations of microplastics studies on the possible toxic effects of microplastics on freshwater organisms are limited and those pertaining to terrestrial organisms like soil dwelling invertebrates terrestrial fungi and plant pollinators are still in the initial stage of research de souza machado et al 2018 a study conducted on zebrafish showed the accrual of microplastic content in the liver of the fish caused inflammation and lipid accumulation leading to disrupted lipid and energy metabolism lu et al 2016 the importance of this study is to identify species that must be at risk this is the first step that must be taken before a large scale study on the microplastic pollution transition in the indian ecosystem it is very clear that the ingestion of microplastics by various organisms including fish sea birds zooplankton coral and marine mammals results in its trophic transfer singh et al 2020 trophic transfer through marine routes has in fact been traced right up to human consumption carbery et al 2018 hence it is important that studies on the presence of microplastics have on the indian ecosystem are evaluated in order to conduct this mammoth task this study attempts to focus on species that must be highlighted in order to conduct targeted research this study attempts to act as a preliminary work to determine the species at maximum risk and monitor their dietary habits and record microplastic content in the environment for future studies the effect of microplastics on daphnia corals benthic and littoral species fish avian reptiles mammals and humans have also been discussed 2 literature review the purpose of this review is to perform an assessment of the various species potentially affected by microplastic pollution along the indian coast and in particular the chennai region the paper gives insights to the various species that face a direct threat from microplastic pollution due to their habitats in the habitats they are found in various trophic levels of the ecosystem were assessed and the possible transmission in the ecosystem was assessed the effects of microplastics on indian species has not yet been studied or recorded hence the study evaluated the risk of microplastics to indian species by comparing them to genetically similar species found with microplastics in other parts of the world attention was given to the feeding mechanism of these species habitat of the species and other ecological aspects only those species that had similar diet and mode of feeding were considered while others even if very biologically similar that did not have similar feeding mechanism were not considered in this review the basis of this comparison is tenable as this study only attempts to identify the various species from the indian coast and does not predict the effects that microplastics might have on the described species to do the same google scholar elsevier and springer link were utilized search terms included but were not limited to microplastic pollution birds and microplastic turtles and microplastic daphnia and microplastic corals and microplastic whales and microplastic fish and microplastic fish species of chennai microplastic pollution from india the authors also conducted regular field visits from 2016 to 2019 to record the species distribution of the potentially affected species in the chennai region the health of biodiversity hotspots of chennai were checked for the presence of microplastic content it is impossible to spot all the species of a given area and so for the work to be a complete review other published records were checked and analysed using citizen science initiatives such as ebird and inaturalist 3 microplastic pollution in india microplastic pollution has been well documented in india by many researchers as seen in table 1 from the sabarmati river in gujarat patel et al 2018 to the islands of india like the great nicobar island dharani et al 2003 these studies have recorded plastics such as high density polyethylene hdpe low density polyethylene ldpe poly styrene ps and polyethylene terephthalate pet microplastics have been reported to contaminate sea salt in india seth and shriwastav 2018 however the biological fate of microplastics has not yet been well studied in the coastal estuarine and marine environment in india yellow pellets of microplastics have been recorded in abundance on the chennai coast 201 microplastics were found along the chennai coast by the same researchers mugilarasan et al 2017 pe and pp were recorded to be the most common microplastics along the coramandel coast karthik et al 2018 microplastic content has been observed in the gulf of mannar a marine biodiversity hotspot along the beaches of coral islands in rameswaram white pellets were recorded by a study with the presence of plastics such as polypropylene polyethylene polystyrene nylon and polyvinyl chloride vidyasakar et al 2018 particles of the size 2 5 mm were identified from the beaches of chennai like the marina beach veerasingam et al 2016 another study recorded microplastics from marina beach kanyakumari beach tiruchendur manapad and tuticorin coast sathish et al 2019 these beaches being hotspots for tourists attract large crowds and hence are extremely polluted south india experienced heavy rains during the months of november and december of 2015 due to the formation of a depression over southwest bay of bengal owing to the strong el niño phenomenon the floods that subsequently struck chennai have also seemed to have increased the presence of microplastic content in the city s water a study to observe the effects on the presence of microplastics was conducted in 2015 after the chennai floods this study found that the abundance of these microplastics in november 2015 was three fold higher than those found in march 2015 confirming that a huge quantity of fresh microplastics were swept along to the cooum and adyar rivers from land during the floods veerasingam et al 2016 several studies have been done to ascertain the presence of microplastics in coastal and inland areas of chennai microplastic concentrations have been recorded highest along the mouth of rivers in the southeast coast of india karthik et al 2018 in our study we have recorded the presence of microplastics from the adyar estuary there is a high possibility of microplastic content in other such ecosystems in the study area along the western parts of india microplastic studied have been conducted in the states of gujrat maharastra and kerala studies from gujrat are based from the sabarmathi river ram and kumar 2020 there is a lack of studies from the coastal parts of the state which must be conducted soon in the state of maharastra 41 85 of plastic content was found to be microplastics of which maximum microplastic content 55 3 was found on juhu beach and the concentration of microplastic was highest in the month of may in the juhu bandra and navi mumbai beaches microplastic content was mainly in the form of fragments and fibres which were red black and transparent naidu et al 2019 in kerala the concentration of microplastics in the state was highest in central kerala followed by southern kerala and least from northern kerala robin et al 2020 among the coramandel states the state of tamil nadu recorded the highest amount of microplastic pollution the souther parts of the states espcieally those regions along the gulf of mannar and palk bay recorded the highest microplastic content the north pamban in palk bay with a density of 0 66 particles m3 of micrpplastic content was one of the worst affected locations in the state james et al 2020 microplastics in the regions of thoothukudi and dhanushkodi beach at pamban island in tamil nadu were made up of 51 fibres 40 granules and 9 films it was found that dhanushkodi had least microplastic content from this region tiwari et al 2019 microplastic pollution in tamil nadu was not limited to the coast in the regions of south pennar river in microplastic concentration was higher downstream than upstream rajadurai and roopa 2019 in the northern parts of the east coastal plains the hooghly river in kolkata located in the state of west bengal microplastic fibres and pellets were recorded to be predominant from various sampling sites in the region bagri and darbha 2019 4 recording of species from the region of tamil nadu chennai formerly known as madras is one of the 11 metropolitan cities in india and houses an equatorial type of climate it is well known as a coramandel city and hence enjoys tropical dry evergreen forest one of the forest types of vegetation in the country chennai is home to three main types of water ecosystems namely freshwater lakes brackish water setups and marine ecosystems these ecosystems were chosen as the focus of the study conducted by the authors of this paper owing to the proximity of the region and the high biodiversity of species the extent of biodiversity of species in these places were analysed and the paths of bio accumulation were determined through observation of the food web of the region and examination of previously known diets of the species the marine ecosystems visited in the study were along beaches and other coastline setups all the beaches surveyed were polluted by marine debris that perennially get washed up during tidal movements the impact of microplastic pollution was not uniform on the surveyed beaches marina beach had a lot of visible microplastic agglomerates another ecosystem heavily affected by pollution are swamplands and wetlands su et al 2019 the palikaranai marsh land which was earlier used as a dump site is one of the largest wetlands in the state after efforts by several environmental activists a major part of the existing wetland was declared as a reserve forest however pollution is still very high in the wetland as dumping is still being carried out large amounts of plastic waste have been dumped at the site for decades hence there is a high threat to the habitat from microplastic based pollution though no studies have been conducted to conclusively find the effect or presence of microplastics in the wetland research groups have since started studying the wetland extensively both brackish and freshwater lakes were surveyed during the study two famous bird watching spots which are now important birding areas ibas were taken up as key parts of the study namely mudhuliyarkuppam and pulicat lake during our study kelambakkam backwaters sirthavur lake thaiyur lake were also surveyed due to its proximity to each other these constitute the freshwater lakes in the city these are less disturbed in terms of pollution but the habitats are threatened due to illegal land grabbing and poaching chembarambakkam is a major source of drinking water for chennai city it is an ancient and relatively large water body and so boasts a varied ecosystem the authors regularly visited these locations and recorded the various species that were observed in the ecosystem these species were then evaluated based on the risk of microplastic consumption species with low risk frugivorous bird herbivorous insects etc were not focused on due to a reduced risk of microplastic ingestion microplastic pollution was recorded from all beaches in chennai during this study and shown in table 2 fig 1 shows the extent of microplastics content observed at besant nagar beach the heath of the study areas was not uniform some of the places that were surveyed were taken as control sets to show that protected areas have lesser threats from microplastic pollution survey sites such as sirthavur lake thaiyur lake and chembarambakam lake were also taken in the study to see the difference in the number of species located in the study area even though the risk of microplastic pollution was lower when compared to marine ecosystems this would not act as control setups as the habitats of these places compared to other locations with higher pollution threats and microplastic contents are different moreover the pressure of humans on the ecosystem varies greatly from place to place there are multiple parameters that had to be taken into account and hence the authors felt it would be preferable not to compare the locations however the beaches were relatively comparable as they had an almost equal amount of external threats with respect to each other the presence of microplastics along beaches is a well established fact they have been reported on beaches at numerous locations worldwide ballent et al 2016 kunz et al 2016 mohamed nor and obbard 2014 naji et al 2017 stolte et al 2015 yu et al 2016 the bay of bengal comes under the risk five category of microplastic pollution a data output based on the data collected by a study shows the east coast of india in a red zone for microplastic pollution eriksen et al 2014 a study of microplastic pollution along the tamil nadu coast has been commissioned and started work in 2019 it is expected to deliver its report by 2020 tejonmayam 2019a the full list of species recorded during the survey of this study is attached as appendix a at the end of the manuscript 5 effect on daphnia zooplankton such as daphnia magna use filtration of suspended particles to extract nutrients this is the main feeding strategy of the organism daphnia magna consumes green algae as vital part of its diet green algae can grow and colonize on the surface of plastic materials frias et al 2018 presence of microplastics in the gut lining of d magna can prevent or inhibit the consumption of food a study showed that lower algal concentration has a negative effect of microplastics on reproduction ogonowski et al 2016 but at higher algal concentrations it was seen that microplastics have a positive effect on the reproduction of d magna interference of plastic particles on food intake by d magna is not fully understood a number of studies on microplastic ingestion and egestion by d magna frydkjær et al 2017 gaiser et al 2011 jemec et al 2016 and copepod centropages typicus frias et al 2018 have been conducted that use short term exposure for 48 h laboratory experiments may vary from the natural environmental conditions that expose the organism to various sizes and toxicity levels of microplastics unlike set conditions in the lab a study reported that the number of ingested particles increased with increase in exposure time rist et al 2017 this indicates that the organism would have a higher intake of plastics in the duration of their natural lifespan than the controlled exposure in the laboratory but it is also important to mention that plastic concentrations used in laboratory research are usually higher than those observed in the environment lenz et al 2016 however in the previous experiments and searches conducted it has been observed that d magna ingests and egests microplastics without any significant change in its survival or reproduction canniff and hoang 2018a these results have been both supported by rist et al 2017 and contradicted by ogonowski et al 2016 previously conducted studies in which effects of microplastic particles on survival and reproduction of d magna were demonstrated negative effects of nano plastic consumption on reproduction of d magna have also been recorded besseling et al 2014 however it must also be noted that researchers have also found microplastic content to be merely excreted by d magna canniff and hoang 2018b nevertheless this is a cause of concern as trophic transfer of microplastic to fish has been recorded from the united states elizalde velázquez et al 2020 plastic particles in the natural ecosystem exist in different shapes sizes and types canniff and hoang 2018b cole et al 2011 eerkes medrano et al 2015 spiky particles such as fragments and fibres are not egested as easily eerkes medrano et al 2015 as smooth and round shape beads one study reported that d magna egested microplastic beads at a higher rate than microplastic fibres frydkjær et al 2017 microplastic fibres have been found to twist in the gut of dead d magna jemec et al 2016 slow or no egestion of microplastic particles will in turn lead to decreased ingestion rate resulting in reduced food intake which may lead to starving and adverse effects cole et al 2011 jemec et al 2016 windsor et al 2019 6 effect on corals coral reefs are also not spared by microplastics more recently a study showed the ability of some species of scleractinia corals to ingest microplastics hall et al 2015 this study was done off the coast of australia the rapid accumulation of these microplastics could potentially damage the health of the coral reef it was found that these species of corals mistake microplastics for their prey plankton and can consume up to 50 μg of plastic at a rate similar to their consumption of plankton however it is still uncertain how this ingestion affects coral energetics and growth or if reef growth in general is threatened hall et al 2015 these can also be seen in deep sea corals species however the effects of microplastics on these corals have still not been ascertained woodall et al 2014 in a study conducted by reichert et al 2018 coral species showed different responses to microplastic exposure these responses include ingestion of microplastic polymers mucus production on the reefbuilding corals overgrowth and attachment of microplastic to tentacles polyethylene 37 to 163 μm or mesenterial filaments the most detrimental effects on corals were coral bleaching and tissue necrosis another study showed that acute exposure of pocillopora damicornis to microplastics lead to activation of stress response of these corals resulting in repression in its detoxification and immune system through the jnk and erk signal pathways tang et al 2018 another study suggested that microplastics disturb coral polyps either through direct or indirect interaction or through photosynthesis perturbation due to the microplastics covering the surface of the corals syakti et al 2019 the chennai coast has many species of corals documented by the zoological survey of india along the tamil nadu coast we commonly come across brush coral acropora hyacinthus and biral coral anacropora reticulatal these species may also be affected by microplastic pollution a study on hard corals showed nematocyst discharge and ingestion of different microplastics including pe suggesting that the presence of phagostimulants potentially related to toxic compounds the study also showed that the retention rate of microplastics in mesenterial tissue within the gut cavity after a whole day of recovery was close to 6 allen et al 2017 for a permanent solution to save the coral and island ecosystem from microplastic debris regular monitoring with proper recycling of plastics and restrictions on plastic usage must be implemented along with these measures further investigations on the effect of microplastic pollution on corals must be carried out to help government organisations with policymaking vidyasakar et al 2018 7 accumulation in benthic and littoral species in kochi kerala india spectroscopic analysis of polystyrene in benthic invertebrates was carried out the study examined microplastic particles present in the benthic invertebrates sternaspis scutata magelona cinta deposit feeders and tellina sp suspension feeder naidu et al 2017 microplastics deposit along the coast from the ocean into beaches and sedimentary habitats unfortunately due to their small size both benthic suspension and deposit feeders may accidentally or selectively ingest sinking and sedimentary microplastics cole et al 2011 thompson et al 2004 wright et al 2013 polychaete are a class of annelid worms which are found in the marine ecosystem better known as segmented worms they are widely distributed and are identified by their bristles made of chitin and are important indicators of the heath of any marine ecosystem ragunathan 2012 in the east cost of india polychaete are littoral creatures in our study a few polychaetes have been noted but it was not possible to identify them up to the species level due to the lack of credible resources to ascertain their identification from the indian coast arenicola sp was encountered along many beaches like the besant nagar beach valmiki nagar beach and along the entire east coast road they were found by baiting the coast with crab meat by locals nereis sp were also seen in the study area these are long thick worms which are known to have setae and parapodia for locomotion lugworms have also been observed feeding on microplastic content thompson et al 2004 no other observations were made however wright et al 2013 found that the lug worm arenicola marina ingests microplastic and this causes reduced feeding increased phagocytic activity reduced available energy reserves and lower lipid reserves wright et al 2013 they enter into the bodies of marine animals that could lead to internal damage apart from accumulating toxins microplastics also threaten micro fauna such as plankton single celled tiny organisms that fish and even whales feed on that thrive in oceans fig 2 shows the bioaccumulation of microplastic in the arenicola based food chain oysters are also affected by microplastic debris particles may be ingested and accumulated by oysters leading to physical effects ward and kach 2009 had used oysters and mussels mytilus edulis as a basis of laboratory tests on their ability to uptake polystyrene beads ward and kach 2009 these beads were ingested when they were incorporated into aggregates composed of their normal food sources post ingestion the polystyrene beads were found in digestive glands creating possibilities for toxicological effects and the potential to transfer microparticles to higher order organisms through the process of bioaccumulation ward and kach 2009 this transfer was validated by van cauwenberghe et al 2015 when they purchased muscles and oysters from various markets in france and germany van cauwenberghe et al 2015 along the coast of california the pacific mole crab emerita analoga has been recorded with microplastic in it with one study recording 35 of mole crabs across 38 beaches in california horn et al 2019 the mortality of crabs was seen to increase with areas that have higher concentrations of microplastic embryonic variability and reduced egg carrying capacity were also attributed to the effect of microplastics horn et al 2020 this could also be the case with other species of mole crabs across the globe where microplastic content is persistent in beaches in tamil nadu emerita emeritus has been recorded historically and sporadically subramoniam 1979 during the study it was spotted on all beaches with maximum density found along the besant nagar beach which though cleaned regularly has reported nearly 846 kg of litter in a clean up drive in 2019 tejonmayam 2019b this species is similar in phylogenetics to the pacific mole crab emerita analoga tam et al 2002 and both species are known to have the same feeding mechanism filter feeding and diet subramoniam 2017 another species of mole crab albunea symmysta was recorded from marina beach and besant nagar and has also been recorded several times on the tamil nadu coast kumar et al 2018 the accumulation of microplastic in benthic species is a cause of concern they constitute the diet of several higher order in terms of energy level organisms hence the accumulation of microplastics in benthic and beach sediments could change the quality of marine habitats and cause physiological and toxicological risks on these inhabitants of the ecosystem potentially affecting humans with the latter effect being termed as bioaccumulation many species of waders birds that feed along the costal belt picking up insects and smaller invertebrates do feed on benthic species some of these waders are already in the red data book of iucn under various categories indicating a significant chance that microplastic content in the benthic creature will bio accumulate in the bird it is therefore logical to assume that it can have an adverse effect on waders as well the major route for these species is by direct ingestion accidental small fragments picked up assuming its food and indirect ingestion bio accumulation more studies on the effect of microplastic content are needed to show conclusive evidence of it having an impact on waders 8 effect on fish e j carpenter and k l smith were some of the first people to find microplastics in fish with their study being based in the united states of america in 1972 laskar and kumar 2019 kartar found microplastic content in fish from the united kingdom in 1973 lusher 2015 microplastics in the form of microfibres were observed in the gastrointestinal tracts of fish species like the aplodactylus punctatus jerguilla and basilichthys australis pejerrey in central chile pozo et al 2019 along the coast of rapa nui easter island in chile amberstripe scads decapterus muroadsi were also shown to have ingested microplastic content ory et al 2017 studies have suggested that ingestion of microplastics by various varieties of fish occurs during suction feeding on biofilms external exposure is also likely in the case of fish wherein microplastics are transferred into the system of the fish without the fish trying to ingest the microplastics consciously microplastics can also accumulate in their gills the extent of effect is determined by the size distribution concentration and toxic nature of the microplastic to the particular organism lusher 2015 studies from the united states have shown using fish that trophic transfer is a significant route of microplastic exposure which is known to detrimentally effect the larval stages of fish athey et al 2020 the european bass dicentrarchus labrax was recorded to experience behavioural changes and intestinal alterations due to the presence of microplastics pedà et al 2016 neurotoxic effects of microplastics was also seen in the same fish this is a cause for concern as microplastics have also been linked to the increase of mercury bio concentration in gills and bioaccumulation in the liver barboza et al 2018 this fish is consumed by larger fish and birds causing cases of mercury poising this is a cause of concern to india also as this species is commonly seen in europe and has similar species recorded in the bay of bengal lates calcarifer the asian seabass is commonly recorded along the bay of bengal and is known to have similar feeding patterns and dietary sources as its european cousin the possible routes of bioaccumulation of microplastics through fish have been depicted in figs 3 and 4 using goby species and indian mackerel as examples piscivorous birds feed on goby species these are mainly gulls and tern species sterna group of terns especially collis et al 2011 in this the brown headed gull is known to feed on gobies a study recorded the presence of microplastic in the common goby pomatoschistus microps oliveira et al 2013 ingestion modulation bioavailability or biotransformation of pyrene decreased energy and inhibited ache activity were observed in the samples two goby fishes cryptocentrus cyanotaenia and istigobius diadema have been found in the tuticorin and mandapam coastal waters of tamil nadu india kumar 2014 in another study from in tuticorin mp contamination was found in the following species of fish harpodon nehereus chirocentrus dorab sardinella albella rastrelliger kanagurta katsuwonus pelamis and istiophorus platypterus sathish et al 2020 a study conducted by in the haizhou bay china analysed the mp content in the following major wild fish species thryssa kammalensis amblychaeturichthys hexanema odontamblyopus rubicundus cynoglossus semilaevis chaeturichthys stigmatias and collichthys lucidus the greatest abundance of mp content was found to be in t kammalensis feng et al 2019 thryssa kammalensis along with other fish of the thryssa genus were recorded along the eastern coast of india near odisha saren et al 2019 while o rubicundus has been found in the bakkhali river estuary in the bay of bengal siddique et al 2015 a close relative of c semilaevis c bilineatus has been observed along the west coast of india in the malabar region which has similar feeding mechanisms and dietary needs mohan joseph et al 2003 high concentrations of microplastics was observed in a study conducted by zhu et al 2019b in the south china sea microplastic content was found in the stomach and intestines of r solandri scomber japonicus centroberyx lineatus and m griseus among many other species as well scomber japonicus is said to be found in the northern indian ocean baker and collette 1998 in the musa estuary located in the persian gulf platycephalus indicus saurida tumbil sillago sihama and cynoglossus abbreviates were collected from three sites and analysed for microplastic content s tumbil have been found at ratnagiri on the coast of gujarat in western india sadawarte et al 2018 p indicus has been recorded at karaikal tamil nadu off the southeast coast of india rajasegar and sendhilkumar 2009 while s sihama has been recorded in the same region in the gulf of mannar jayasankar 1991 a study conducted off the portuguese coast found that pelagic fish ingested more mp particles and benthic fish ingested more mp fibres the highest mean of ingested plastics was found to be in the scomber japonicas neves et al 2015 a species known from indian waters india biodiversity portal 2020 microplastic content was also found in indian markel rastrelliger kanagurta an important source of fish based proteins for humans karami et al 2017 in a study conducted by bessa et al 2018 the seabream diplodus vulgaris was also seen to be affected by mps this species is known from which is found in the arabian sea on the northeast coast of brazil a study was conducted on the hyporhampus unifasciatus and significant microplastic consumption was recorded vendel et al 2017 h limbatus a very similar feeding species to h unifasciatus that has been recorded in chilika lake odisha india karna et al 2017 is therefore vulnerable to microplastic consumption as well table 3 lists additional marine organisms that are at risk of consuming microplastics special attention to species found in the region such as harpodon nehereus chirocentrus dorab sardinella albella scomber japonicus rastrelliger kanagurta cryptocentrus cyanotaenia istigobius diadema katsuwonus pelamis platycephalus indicus saurida tumbil and istiophorus platypterus must be given and more studies on the effects and route of microplastic transfer must be investigated in studies from other parts of the world fish have been known to cause microplastic trophic transfer to mammals nelms et al 2018 thus the threat posed by fish on the indian avian and mammalian fauna must be investigated particlualry for the species discussed in the sections that follow 9 effect on avian fauna there have been many clear cases where plastic pollution has proved to be disastrous on bird populations microplastics have known to accumulate in birds by accidental ingestion during feeding and through dietary sources the accumulation of microplastic has been extensively studied in marine birds especially the northern fulmar fulmarus glacialis many studies have been conducted on the species from the northern hemisphere most notable study from iceland serves as a baseline kühn and van franeker 2012 the study indicated that regions that were disturbed by anthropogenic activity were proved to cause more plastic ingestion by the bird recently a study from south georgia reported microplastics in emperor penguins aptenodytes patagonicus that was linked to trophic transfer highlighting the fact that birds can consume microplastics through indirect routes le guen et al 2020 microplastic accumulation in birds of prey found in central florida have also been linked to trophic transfer from consumption of prey avian life metal consumption is known to be facilitated by microplastic due to an increase in its bio accessibility though the risk was accessed to be low holmes et al 2020 in general plastics have been hypothesised to reduce fertility change body conditions and affect mortality of marine birds irrespective of their form and size of the plastic pollutant wilcox et al 2015 in south africa the effect of microplastics on ducks and geese was recorded from barberspan nature reserve and false bay ecology park both ramsar wetlands the results have been recorded in table 4 which also shows how biomagnification is possible in india while comparing similar species of birds that are known to have the same hunting strategy and diet in portugal it was noted that the most prevalent type of plastic affecting marine diving birds were microplastics basto et al 2019 this suggests that microplastics are more bioavailable and have a higher probability of being accidentally or selectively ingested than larger pieces of plastic materials lusher et al 2018 another study from the bay of biscay spain reported microplastics in the faecal pellets of european shag phalacrocorax aristotelis yellow legged gull larus michahellis black headed gull chroicocephalus ridibundus masiá et al 2019 while another study from malta recorded microplastics in the stomach contents of yellow legged gull larus michahellis black headed gull chroicocephalus ridibundus black legged kittiwake rissa tridactyla lesser black backed gull larus fuscus great cormorant phalacrocorax carbo all of which are species that are known to occur in india brauer and brauer 2018 sooty terns onychoprion fuscatus have been recorded with various plastic debris in them including microplastics from brazil de souza petersen et al 2016 another very similar species that is seen feeding along with sooty terns are the bridled tern onychoprion anaethetus making it equally vulnerable to mps both of these species are known to occur in the coastal waters of india and were recorded by the first author shorebirds also known as waders are found near water edges especially near the sea as seen in fig 5 shorebirds inhabit extremely polluted environments along the coast in india making them susceptible to mps one of the most common species of wader seen in the study area is the black tailed godwit limosa limosa ebird india 2020a they have been observed feeding on scrobicularia species such as scrobicularia plana catry et al 2012 which is known accumulate microplastics ribeiro et al 2017 it is thus inherent that the species is vulnerable to microplastic pollution and immediate assessment of the bird is required as it is a near threated species the great knot calidris tenuirostris is a vulnerable species of wader which was recorded from tamil nadu the diet of the great knot calidris tenuirostris consists of bivalves molluscs gastropods polychaete worms crabs shrimps and sea cucumbers they have also been found to eat seeds and berries zhang et al 2011 several species of bivalves have been well documented to have microplastic content as discussed previously the effects of microplastic are not known on the bird but due to the sharp decline in its numbers the role of microplastic pollution in its habitats must be immediately investigated in india a list of waders recorded with microplastic content by a study from the atlantic has been shown in table 5 with notes on where the species have been recorded during our field study microplastics have been conclusively found in red necked phalarope phalaropus lobatus moser and lee 2006 it is a scarce winter visitor to the country recorded during cyclone vardah from adyar nagarajan 2016 and sporadically from pulicat lake ebird india 2020a the red phalarope phalaropus fulicarius another species of the same genus has also been recorded with microplastic content connors and smith 1982 it is a straggler to the indian subcontinent with very few records from the country ebird india 2020b the population of raptor birds indicate the healthy nature of an ecological system it is important that the survival of these species is not jeopardised due to microplastics due to their higher trophic level the probability of accumulation is the most in china the common buzzard buteo buteo black kite milvus migrans lineatus common kestrel falco tinnunculus were observed with microplastic litter in their digestive tracts zhao et al 2016 all species that have been recorded from tamil nadu the common buzzard buteo buteo is an opportunistic species primarily preying on small mammals birds insects worms and snakes this variable diet might increase the risk of anthropogenic litter ingestion via prey secondary ingestion it could be hypothesised that large the diet of a species the higher the chances of microplastic entering the species a recent study in the united states recorded 9 species of raptors with microplastic content carlin et al 2020 the study found the maximum ingestion of microplastic was seen from the red shouldered hawk buteo lineatus and the osprey pandion haliaetus the study also suggested that trophic transfer was likely the cause of accumulation of microplastics based on their diet and proximity to areas affected by microplastics from the tamil nadu coast the osprey pandion haliaetus brahminy kite haliastur indus and white bellied seaeagle haliaeetus leucogaster are at the highest risk of being affected by trophic transfer of these species the osprey pandion haliaetus has been recorded with microplastic content in its gastrointestinal tract in central florida another study also suggested trophic transfer as a possible reason for presence of microplastics in double crested cormorants phalacrocorax auratus brookson et al 2019 a study in the indian context that analyzes discovered dead specimens is therefore necessary in order to confirm the route of transfer from the discussions above it is evident that microplastics are found in birds through their diet a comparative study on the dietary habits of various birds found with microplastics showed that piscivorous birds had higher chances of accumulating microplastics followed by birds that had a wide variety of diet such as smaller crustaceans and worms thus it is vital that the knowledge gaps in the presence and effects of mps from an indian context are filled with more research work and cooperation with the government fig 6 shows the results of this dietary analysis and the distribution of the possible routes of entry 10 effect on reptiles ingestion of marine debris can have lethal and sub lethal effects on sea turtles turtles have been known to eat plastic by accident many instances of olive ridley turtles with plastic bags were seen it has been hypothesised that they mistake the plastic bags for jellyfish however the threat of microplastics has not been discussed in the detail that it must be by turtle conservationists in tamil nadu though the green turtle is generally a herbivore it has been known to be an opportunistic carnivore it can hence ingest sediments with microplastic content from rio grande do sul brazil turtles have been found with microplastic content studies have found microplastics in the green turtle in the great barrier reef which is already an endangered species caron et al 2018 green turtles have been found in the gulf of mannar biosphere reserve near tamil nadu kannan 2008 samples taken from the gastrointestinal tract of leatherback turtles found off the coast of north carolina usa were found to contain 2 particles of microplastics per 100 ml of collected sample duncan et al 2019a in the same study hawksbill turtle samples from queensland australia were found to contain 1 particle per 100 ml leatherback turtles exist in significant populations in the southwestern indian ocean lambardi et al 2008 while hawksbill turtles have been found on the coasts of kerala and tamil nadu as well as those of andaman and nicobar islands and the lakshadweep islands rajagopalan et al 1996 other species of turtles such as olive ridley turtles lepidochelys olivacea have also been recorded with microplastics duncan et al 2019b they have been observed to be primarily carnivorous and eat crustaceans and molluscs it was recorded nesting along the chennai coast during the study fig 7 shows the possible ports of entry for microplastic in the food chain of the turtle this could be another external threat for turtle hatchings as they are more vulnerable to environmental changes turtle nesting sites were also degraded by microplastic pollution in the beaches studied by the authors this could be due to direct ingestion or bio accumulation jellyfish are the favoured food of turtles studies on pelagia noctiluca alcazo et al 2020 a common species of jellyfish in the mediterranean sea showed that jellyfish could a vector in transporting microplastic waste this waste will be transported to higher order organisms by predation jellyfish are known to feed on a wide range of plankton and could accumulate microplastic present in the ocean causing the predation of the jellyfish to have disastrous effects on marine turtles 11 effect on mammals several species of dolphins such as the bottle nosed dolphin risso s dolphin oppili 2018 indo pacific dolphin rahul muralidharan 2013 have been reported from chennai city though these dolphins have been recorded from the chennai coast the common dolphin was the only species recorded in the study marine mammals that employ a raptorial feeding strategy experience trophic transfer as primary route of microplastic ingestion than through direct intake nelms et al 2018 for example lusher et al 2016 found that 11 of mesopelagic fish investigated contained microplastics and estimated that close to 463 million microplastics could be ingested by one striped dolphin stenella coeruleoalba through the consumption of contaminated prey by using probability modules this claim has not been however empirically proved however if found to be true it would prove to be catastrophic on the population of the species studies on dolphins in the united states have claimed that weakened immune systems in them could be attributed to microplastic content but that has not been widely accepted lusher et al 2015 lusher also examined the stomach content 35 common dolphins in ireland to determine microplastic content common dolphins in north west spain were recorded with microplastic content in their stomach hernandez gonzalez et al 2018 this species is seen commonly in the chennai coast therefore the same threat is likely to be posed the indo humpback dolphin scientific name sousa chinensis was found to contain microplastics such as polyester and fibres in the guangxi beibu gulf china the sizes of the particles were between 1 and 5 mm with the majority of the deposits found in the foreguts and midguts zhu et al 2019a microplastics of similar sizes were also discovered in the guts of stranded bottlenose dolphins scientific name tursiops truncatus off the coast of south carolina usa battaglia 2019 and also in killer whales orcinus orca off the coast of ireland lusher et al 2018 ranging from 123 to 422 pieces per individual in the former in the latter 83 6 of the microplastics were fibres as opposed to 16 4 of fragments this indicates that even younger individuals are susceptible to microplastics due to these species being apex predators that consume other organisms that may have ingested microplastics these dolphins have been recorded in the bay of bengal along the east coast of india rahul muralidharan 2013 while killer whales have been observed near the coast of gujarat james and mohan 1987 beaked whales mesoplodon mirus from ireland were reported with microplastic content in ireland lusher et al 2015 rendering it likely whales are susceptible to microplastic pollution though no whales were recorded in the study there have been sightings of dwarf sperm whale kogia sima times of india 2019 sperm whale blue whale and bryde s whale balaenoptera brydei the hindu 2018 by various local experts from the east coast of india fin whales balaenoptera physalus in the mediterranean sea a species that are very similar to the blue whale balaenoptera musculus that is found in the indian ocean de vos et al 2016 have been found to be exposed and threatened by the high presence of microplastics while feeding on plankton fossi et al 2012 which is likely to end up in the blubber of the fins common minkes balaenoptera acutorostrata and sei whales balaenoptera borealis two species of baleen whales have been shown to contain microplastics in different locations all across the pacific ocean due to the nature of the prey they feed on burkhardt holm and n guyen 2019 this is likely to also affect bryde s whales balaenoptera brydei found off the coast of kerala george et al 2011 thus these species are at risk from microplastic pollution the death of a dugong another species that has been recorded in large numbers in the indian ocean sivakumar 2013 occurred in thailand due to the ingestion of plastics lewis 2019 inland mammals have also been recorded with microplastic content high concentrations of microplastics have also been found in the eurasian otter lutra lutra in italy which is likely to serve as a threat to the populations of the same species in the western ghats and central india perinchery 2018 12 effect on humans numerous studies relating to microplastics and their negative impact on marine life have been put forward yet the long term impact of microplastics on human health has not been investigated to great depth due to limited evidences in regard to this aspect humans however are in fact exposed to microplastics through consumption of seafood drinking water and even through the air we breathe apart from this microplastics are also found in cosmetic items such as facial scrubs and washes their minute size makes the entry of microplastics into any environment a facile task microplastics also find extensive use in cosmetics products due to their exfoliating and scrubbing properties kentin 2018 prolonged consumption of microplastics may lead to the disruption of human chromosomes that result in reproductive complications and cancers frias et al 2018 ingestion of microplastics has been suggested as a potential cause of toxicity inflammatory responses and oxidative stress smith et al 2018 however the nature or the consumption of seafood items per capita has doubled from 10 kg to 20 kg over the past 50 years gesamp joint group of experts on the scientific aspects of marine environmental protection 2016 the rapid increase in population will also increase the demand for food resources and ultimately seafood resources due to this there exists a higher probability of microplastics entering the human body through the seafood we consume approximately 50 of seafood is farmed using techniques like agriculture while the rest are wild caught van cauwenberghe and janssen 2014 nanoplastics are considered even more dangerous since their sizes are so minute that they can even penetrate cells and move into tissues and organs oysters and mussels that are harvested for human consumption have been recorded to contain 0 36 0 47 particles of microplastic per gram meaning that shellfish consumers could ingest up to 11 000 particles of microplastic per year van cauwenberghe and janssen 2014 in another study plastic fibres were found in the lungs of 87 of humans inspected this may be due to the microplastics present in air pauly et al 1998 13 conclusion from this study we can conclude that microplastics have been found in marine and terrestrial life in significant amounts and there are numerous other studies to support this fact as well microplastics are unknowingly consumed by animals and may also be indirectly consumed by humans when they feed on these affected organisms the two main processes by which microplastics enter the systems of these animals are by ingestion and bio accumulation which usually occurs in aquatic species due to most of the waste we produce ultimately winding up in water bodies although there is a myriad of evidence to account for the presence of microplastics in animals there is still uncertainty with respect to how these animals are affected by it studies relating to the mechanism by which microplastics pose danger to animals and humans are still rudimentary and so must be explored more in detail by performing more laboratory tests these studies will be necessary to understand the actual impact microplastics have on the environment various studies have presented that microplastics have reduced gene expression and reproductive capability of species this is a serious cause of concern for species that are globally threated and are found in habitats rich in microplastic debris a detailed study on the presence of microplastics in various indian species and the effects they have on these species must be critically evaluated soon targeted studies on larger species such as the black tailed godwit limosa limosa great knot calidris tenuirostris eurasian curlew numenius arquata whimbrel numenius phaeopus pacific golden plover that face the highest risk based on their dietary habits must be evaluated immediately from the indian coast coastal species listed as declining in the recently published state of india s birds report must be evaluated for the risks posed by microplastics clean up drives must be taken up by local residents and more awareness on the sources of microplastic pollution and its effects must be popularised within the indian community it is our recommendation that a commission must be opened to study the effect of microplastic pollution across the indian coast and study the various recommendations provided by other researchers declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work
