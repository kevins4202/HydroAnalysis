oxygen evolution over potential and excellent electrochemical degradation efficiency for organic pollutants the optimum conditions for the degradation of mg were obtained by studying the effects of different parameters such as initial current densities and initial mg concentration the remaining organic compounds concentrations color and chemical oxygen demand cod removal efficiency were investigated and compared the results indicate that the efficiency of g β pbo2 electrode for both color and cod removals is more than those of other electrodes at the optimum conditions the color and

also proposed the mineralization pathway of mg at β pbo2 electrode graphical abstract image 1 keywords electrocatalytic degradation lead dioxide electrode malachite green electrochemical behavior degradation mechanism 1 introduction in both developing and industrialized nations a growing number of contaminants are entering water from traditional compounds such as heavy metals and the organic compound specifically dyes the worldwide high level of production of dyes is the main reason for the contamination of water sources and the generation of a considerable amount of colored wastewater shannon et al 2008 malachite green mg a cationic dye has numerous industrial applications such as dyeing of silk coloring jute wool leather plastics paper etc it was also used as fungicide and antiseptic in the aquatic and fisheries industries studies have shown that mg producing substances are harmful for the respiratory system reduce fertility in humans singh et al 2013a it is noted that the biodegradation of dyes such as mg due to the presence of nitrogen in their structure is a difficult process this feature makes use of conventional treatment impossible ngamukot et al 2006 therefore removing these environmental pollutants requires technologically advanced treatment systems so far several different technologies are emerging for the removal of dyes from wastewaters including membrane filtration catalytic oxidation flocculation coagulation adsorption and biological technology singh et al 2016 however these methods have some disadvantages such as formation of active sludge and need a great amount of reagents which have restricted their widespread use aquino et al 2014 recent investigations have demonstrated the great potential of electrochemical approaches as cleaner methods to mineralize organic pollution for the degradation treatment of wastewater oturan et al 2008 among them electrocatalytic oxidation processes have been introduced and received greater attention in recent years due to their advantages such as easy operation relative low cost environmental compatibility high efficiency and producing no secondary waste stream brillas and martínez huitle 2015 these methods were performed in two ways i direct oxidation in which the pollutants were destroyed after direct electron transfer at the electrode surface and ii indirect oxidation in which the pollutants were mediated with electro generated oxidants such as hydroxyl radicals ho which is a powerful oxidant singh et al 2016 martinez huitle and ferro 2006 in indirect method it is very important to develop a novel electrode material with high catalytic activity and stability in this regard titanium oxide tio2 ruthenium oxide ruo2 iridium oxide iro2 graphite platinum pt lead dioxides pbo2 tin oxides sbo2 and boron doped diamond bdd have been suggested as promising electrode materials yao et al 2016 these electrodes are divided into two groups i active electrodes ruo2 iro2 pt and ii non active electrode pbo2 tio2 sno2 bdd radjenovic and sedlak 2015 the non active electrodes have high oxygen evolution overpotential oxidative degradation using these electrodes is performed directly by the adsorbed hydroxyl radicals produced from water discharge radjenovic and sedlak 2015 yahiaoui et al 2013 panizza and cerisola 2008 low cost ease of preparation high conductivity good corrosion resistance high oxygen evolution potential and long service lifetime are the most important characteristics of non active electrodes such as pbo2 and sno2 rather than the active electrodes such as platinum or ruthenium oxide feng et al 2016 it is also noted that β pbo2 black color has relatively higher conductivity overpotential for oxygen evolution and stability in acid solutions than α pbo2 brown color mindt 1969 to develop the use of β pbo2 electrodes to mineralization of mg and also the introduction of the most efficient β pbo2 electrode in the present study the electrocatalytic activity and degradation efficiency of a series of β pbo2 electrodes including graphite g β pbo2 stainless steel ss316 β pbo2 ti β pbo2 and pb β pbo2 electrodes in aqueous solution were studied toward malachite green degradation the surface morphology and crystal structure of pbo2 electrodes are characterized by sem edx and xrd respectively in addition a comprehensive study on the parameters effecting degradation efficiency such as initial ph initial mg concentrations current density and electrolysis time was conducted furthermore the behavior of mg and produced intermediates during oxidative degradation were studied by cyclic voltammetry and uv vis spectrophotometry this study proposed the mechanisms for the electrochemical oxidation and oxidative degradation of mg 2 experimental all parts of experimental section including materials instrumentation electrochemical treatments g β pbo2 electrode preparation ss316 β pbo2 electrode preparation ti β pbo2 electrode preparation and pb β pbo2 electrode preparation can be found at supplementary data 3 results and discussion 3 1 surface morphology of β pbo2 electrodes x ray diffraction technique has been used to determination of the pbo2 phases crystal structure and purity of the deposited film fig 1 part i shows xrd patterns of the films cracked from the surface of pbo2 electrodes the main diffraction peaks observed at 2θ 25 4 32 0 36 2 and 49 0 are assigned to the 110 101 200 and 211 plane of β pbo2 it indicates that the electrodeposited pbo2 belongs to the β pbo2 phase hao et al 2014 also the diffraction peaks at 2θ 29 and 52 are indication of α pbo2 phase the comparison of the xrd patterns with the standard diffraction peaks for the β pbo2 jcpds 89 2805 card shows the β pbo2 as a dominant phase in the deposited film and confirms the electrochemical synthesis of tetragonal β pbo2 phase on the surface of electrodes hao et al 2014 chen et al 2016 the data show that when the substrate changes the crystalline orientation of the electrodes did not change and almost no new phase was formed on the β pbo2 film chen et al 2009 the average size of β pbo2 crystals was calculated by debye scherrer formula hao et al 2014 the size of β pbo2 crystals was found to be 30 2 nm 44 7 nm 32 3 nm and 36 0 nm for the g β pbo2 ss316 β pbo2 ti β pbo2 and pb β pbo2 electrodes respectively which are consistent with the sem results fig 1 part ii the sem images of the surface of β pbo2 electrodes are shown in fig 1 part ii these images show that the crystalline structure of β pbo2 in all cases are uniform crack free and very compact with pyramidal cluster distribution li et al 2016 such a morphology guarantees that only β pbo2 is involved in the electrochemical degradation of the dye the results obtained by sem and xrd fig 1 part ii show that the smallest size and the highest uniformity of the β pbo2 ýcrystals were obtained using graphite electrode g β pbo2 this result is in agreement with the data obtained from xrd the smaller particle size is a robust feature that provides a larger specific surface area and enhance the electrogeneration efficiency of ho on β pbo2 electrodes which increases the electrochemical degradation efficiency of mg hao et al 2014 li et al 2016 sem details in figs s1 s4 the edx pattern of β pbo2 electrodes is shown in fig s5 the maps of the elements generated by the edx showing the constituent element lead of the β pbo2 coated on the surface of electrodes fig s5 shows the matching of deposited films with the samples reported in the literature hao et al 2014 li et al 2016 in addition the lack of additional peaks of unknown compounds clearly confirms the purity of the deposited pbo2 films it is worth noting that the presence of low intensity fe or ti peaks is due to the electrode materials 3 2 electrochemical behavior of mg we report here the electrochemical behavior of mg in water solution containing phosphate buffer ph 2 0 c 0 2 m fig 2 part i curve a shows the first cycle of the cyclic voltammogram of mg 1 0 mm at the surface of glassy carbon electrode at the scan rate of 50 mv s the cv shows an anodic peak a1 at 0 69 v vs ag agcl in the positive going scan and one cathodic peak c0 at 0 44 v vs ag agcl in the negative going scan in addition to these peaks the second cycle of the cyclic voltammogram curve b shows a new anodic peak a0 at 0 47 v vs ag agcl when the potential scan range expands to 1 2 v vs ag agcl in addition to the previous peaks a1 a0 and c0 new anodic a2 and cathodic c00 peaks appear at more positive potentials fig 2 part ii the appearance of the cathodic peak c0 and its anodic counterpart a0 in the second cycle of the cyclic voltammogram confirms the formation of a new redox couple at less positive potentials e 1 2 0 46 v the effect of potential scan rate on the cyclic voltammogram of mg in the range of 10 50000 mv s was studied fig 2 parts iii and iv shows the cyclic voltammogram of mg in the range of 10 1000 mv s the important point to note is the relative stability of the peak current ratio i pc0 i pa1 with increasing potential scan rate even at higher scan rates 50000 mv s in addition as can be seen with increasing potential scan rate peak a1 changes from peak shaped to an s shaped voltammogram in the s shape voltammograms which is adapted as indication of a ce mechanism the current is predominantly governed by the rate at which electroactive specie is formed by the preceding reaction rather than by diffusion rafiee et al 2011 one of the most likely preceding reactions in the electrochemical oxidation of amines compounds in acidic solutions is deprotonation of the ammonium group maleki and nematollahi 2013 in order to study the adsorption diffusion behavior of mg the voltammetric data presented in fig 2 parts iii and iv have been analyzed and the related plots are shown as insets in fig 2 the linear relation between i pa1 and v 1 2 in various scan rates r2 0 9998 shows that the oxidation process of mg is diffusion controlled part iii inset in addition the slope of log i pa1 vs log v 1 2 is 0 55 r2 0 9944 part iv inset this value is very close to the theoretical value of 0 5 for the diffusion controlled process which confirms diffusion controlled nature of the electrode process at ph 2 0 according to the data and considering previously published data singh et al 2013a zhu et al 2015 renaud et al 1984 ray et al 2017 we proposed the following mechanism for electrochemical oxidation of mg at ph 2 0 according to scheme 1 one electron oxidation of mg produces dication radical i this compound can participate in both pathways a and b in path a dication radical i after losing a proton to neutralize the positive charge and form the methylene radical ii a further electron to yield the nitrenium ion iii the reaction of water with iii produces mgoh1 accordingly peak a1 is attributed to irreversible two electron oxidation of mg to mgoh1 in addition the two electron reduction of mgoh1 to lmgoh can be take place at the electrode surface therefore we think that the redox couple peaks a0 c0 are attributed to the mgoh1 lmgoh redox couple the overall reaction mechanism for the generation of peak a1 is shown in scheme 2 further oxidation of mgoh1 which occurs at more positive potentials than e pa1 creates peak a2 under these conditions mgoh1 can follow two different paths c and d in path c similar to before mgoh1 converts to mgoh2 the presence of two hydroxyl groups which are electron withdrawing group by induction in the structure of mgoh2 makes its unstable so that in cyclic voltammograms only a small reduction peak c00 can be seen in the cathodic scan it s also possible that mgoh1 after oxidation can directly convert into electro inactive decomposed materials since the peak current ratios i pa0 i pa1 i pc0 i pa1 are too small it can be suggested that a relatively large percentage of dication radical i after re oxidation convert into electro inactive decomposed compounds path b we also report the electrochemical behavior of mg in water solution containing phosphate buffer at ph 7 0 c 0 2 m in two potential ranges fig 2 parts v vii the basic pattern of the voltammograms at ph 7 0 is similar with that of at ph 2 0 fig 2 however they have some differences including a the shift of all peaks to the less positive potentials at this ph e pa1 e pa2 e pa0 and e pc0 are 0 55 0 78 0 39 and 0 33 v vs ag agcl this can be attributed to the participation of proton s in the oxidation of mg b the peak current ratios i pa0 i pa1 i pc0 i pa1 and i pa1 i pa2 at ph 7 0 is less than ph 2 0 this can be related to the hydroxylation and or dimerization of the electron transfer products or intermediates assisted by alkaline ph c at ph 7 0 when the switching potential was changed to 0 90 v vs ag agcl the anodic and cathodic peaks a0 and c0 have nearly disappeared this can be attributed to the transformation of mgoh1 to mgoh2 and or decomposed compounds paths c and d assisted by alkaline ph d δe pa e pa2 e pa1 at ph 7 0 0 23 v is less than δe pa at ph 2 0 0 38 v the effect of potential scan rate on the cyclic voltammogram of mg at ph 7 0 is also shown in fig 2 part vii the first case that can be observed in this figure is the appearance and increasing of i pc0 with increasing potential scan rate moreover the peak current ratio i pa1 i pa2 is dependent on the potential scan rate as the scan rate is increased the peak current ratio increases it was already known that in diffusion controlled process the peak current i p depends on the square root of potential scan rate v 1 2 while in adsorption controlled regime i p depends on the potential scan rate so when the nature of the two peaks is different the change in scan rate causes a change in the peak current ratio it should be noted that this behavior was not observed at ph 2 0 in order to study the adsorption diffusion behavior of peak a1 at ph 7 0 the log i pa1 was analyzed at different scan rates log v the results are plotted in fig 2 part vii inset as can be seen the slope of log i pa1 vs log v 1 2 is 0 70 r2 0 9946 this slope value 0 70 is bigger than the theoretical value of 0 5 diffusion controlled process and is less than one theoretical value for the adsorption controlled electrode process momeni and nematollahi 2017 this result confirms the partial adsorption of mg at the surface of the electrode and increasing i pa1 i pa2 with increasing scan rate compared with the results at ph 2 0 this result also shows that the interaction between mg and the electrode surface at ph 7 0 is stronger than at ph 2 0 considering the dissociation constant of mg pk a 6 9 culp and beland 1996 a reason for this finding is relative deprotonation of mg at ph 7 0 according to the present data we suggest that the reaction pathway at ph 7 0 is not different from ph 2 0 the smaller the i pa0 i pa1 or i pc0 i pa1 at ph 7 0 compared with ph 2 0 can be related to smaller δpa at smaller δpa more amount of mgoh1 convert to mgoh2 and or decomposed compounds so that at reverse scan a lower amount of mgoh1 reduces to lmgoh in addition with increasing potential scan rate decreasing time windows a greater amount of mgoh1 remains at the electrode surface which on the reverse scan creates peak c0 the electrochemical behavior of mg was also reported in water solution containing carbonate buffer at ph 12 0 c 0 2 m fig 2 part viii contrary to what was observed in ph values 2 0 and 7 0 no anodic and cathodic peaks a0 and c0 were observed at ph 12 0 it is known that mg in aqueous solutions is partly converted into its non ionic colorless form carbinol zhu et al 2015 yong et al 2015 fischer et al 2011 scheme 3 as can be seen the chemical reduction of mg to carbinol is ph dependent and increases with increasing ph according to scheme 3 mg participates in a chemical reaction with hydroxide ion to produces its reduced form carbinol therefore we suggest that at ph 12 0 the main species present at the electrode surface is col whose redox behavior is different from mg the oxidation pathway of col is shown in scheme 3 according to scheme 3 carbinol after oxidation is irreversibly broken down at the bond between the central carbon atom and the n n dimethylamino phenyl ring to dimethyl amino phenyl phenyl methanone and n n dimethylaniline fischer et al 2011 yang et al 2015 so unlike phs 2 0 and 7 0 at ph 12 0 peak a1 is attributed to the irreversible oxidation of col to dimethyl amino phenyl phenyl methanone and n n dimethylaniline fischer et al 2011 yang et al 2015 3 3 constant current electrolysis of mg in this work for degradation of mg using β pbo2 electrodes ph 7 0 was selected as optimum ph because of its environmental compatibility degradation of mg during constant current electrolysis was studied by the linear sweep voltammetric technique constant current electrolysis was carried out in an undivided cell equipped with three g β pbo2 plats as anode and two stainless steel plats as cathode in this way an aqueous solution phosphate buffer ph 7 0 c 0 2 m containing 2 0 mm of mg was electrolyzed under current density of 3 ma cm2 electrode surface 100 cm2 for 60 min the progress of electrolysis was monitored by recording the linear sweep voltammograms fig 3 in this figure curve a shows two anodic peaks a1 and a2 as shown during electrolysis all initial peaks decrease and finally disappear at the end of electrolysis t 60 min curve h as can be seen the oxidative degradation of mg using g β pbo2 anode has been successfully performed under constant current condition so that at the end of the electrolysis no electroactive material remains in the electrolysis cell it should be noted that the same data were obtained when ti β pbo2 is used as anode with the difference that when ti β pbo2 is used a longer electrolysis time 70 min is necessary to complete the electrolysis the progress of electrolysis during constant current electrolysis using ti β pbo2 anode was also monitored by recording the uv vis absorption spectra of the resulting solution fig 3 inset the uv vis absorption spectrum of mg shows a strong peak at 617 nm and two weak peaks at 425 and 315 nm the peaks located at 617 and 425 nm are assigned to the cc and cn double bonds yao et al 2016 ju et al 2008 and the third peak at 315 nm is attributed to the benzene ring in the structure of mg yao et al 2016 ju et al 2008 this figure shows that proportional to the advancement of electrolysis the height of all three peaks decrease as the electrolysis time increases these peaks were removed after consumption of 1260 c t 70 min the absence of the peaks at the end of electrolysis is due to the lack of the compounds with chromophore and conjugated π system uv active compounds in electrolysis cell ju et al 2008 the electrochemical and the spectroscopic data present in this research along with previous data singh et al 2013a yong et al 2015 yang et al 2015 on degradation of mg allows us to propose the following pathway for oxidative degradation of mg using β pbo2 anode at ph 7 scheme 4 3 4 kinetic studies and the effect of current density the results of the observed degradation rate constants k obs of mg using β pbo2 electrodes at ýdifferent current density and two mg concentrations are shown in fig 4 the data indicate that the degradation rate constant depends on three factors 1 type of β pbo2 electrode g β pbo2 ýanode exhibits the best degradation performance compared to other electrodes 2 current density the observed degradation rate constant increases with increasing the current density this can be attributed to the higher hydroxyl radical generation degradation agent at higher current density 3 mg concentration the degradation rate constant decreases with increasing the mg concentration this can be attributed to the more adsorption of mg and or intermediates on the electrode surface at higher mg concentration which reduces the efficiency of the electrode toward hydroxyl radical generation the results of these experiments are summarized in table s1 the data show a good linear correlation exists between ln c0 ct and time t which indicates that the electrocatalytic degradation of the mg on the β pbo2 electrodes followed pseudo first order kinetics yahiaoui et al 2013 dai et al 2016 hao et al 2014 the effect of current density on the color removal during electrocatalytic oxidation of mg using β pbo2 electrodes at ph 7 0 was also studied figs s9 and s10 the results show that a complete degradation of mg was occurred during electrocatalytic degradation of mg using all four types of anodes the results also showed that the degradation time of mg decreases with increasing current density fig s11 in addition the time for complete degradation of mg using g β pbo2 electrode is shorter than other β pbo2 electrodes g β pbo2 40 min ss316 β pbo2 50 min ti β pbo2 60 min pb β pbo2 70 min which results in less energy spent fig 5 shows the efficiency of different β pbo2 electrodes on the cod removal the pb β pbo2 anode shows the lowest efficiency of cod removal while the highest removal efficiency was achieved using g β pbo2 electrode the cod removal efficiency increased up to 72 3 88 0 and 90 9 for pb β pbo2 ti pbo2 and ss316 β pbo2 while using g β pbo2 electrode the cod removal efficiency increased up to 94 0 at current density 4 ma cm2 and initial concentration dye 360 mg l due to better interaction between dye molecules and electrogenerated ho radicals fig 5 singh et al 2016 yahiaoui et al 2013 under these conditions the mg degradation efficiency using pb β pbo2 ti pbo2 ss316 β pbo2 and g β pbo2 electrodes was close to 100 this indicates that some generated intermediates during the degradation process are resistant to mineralization the higher cod removal efficiency and degradation efficiency for the g β pbo2 electrode can be related to the greater amount of coated pbo2 on graphite electrode compared to other electrodes which increases the number of sites available for the production of hydroxyl radicals as well as crystals size of β pbo2 which is the lowest value for g β pbo2 compared to other β pbo2 electrodes fig 1 the smaller crystals provide a greatly increased surface area that lead to high efficiency electro generation of ho which is beneficial for the treatment of pollutants feng et al 2016 li et al 2011 ju et al 2008 chen et al 2014 wang et al 2015a 2015b the cod removal rate constant of the different β pbo2 electrodes at current density 4 ma cm2 was also studied fig s12 the calculated observed cod removal rate constant was found to vary in the order g β pbo2 ss316 β pbo2 ti pbo2 pb β pbo2 which confirms the data the above mentioned study the results of these experiments are summarized in table s2 3 5 effects of mg initial concentration due to the fact that the concentrations of colored pollutants changed with the flow of wastewater the study of the effect of initial mg concentration on the removal efficiency is very important in this way the color and cod removal efficiencies were studied at two concentrations of mg 360 and 720 mg l under different β pbo2 electrodes at i 4 ma cm2 and ph 7 0 fig 6 the results indicate that with increasing mg concentration from 360 to 720 mg l both color and cod removal efficiencies decreased which is partially compensated by increasing electrolysis time for example at the g β pbo2 electrode the results showed that when the initial concentration of mg increased from 360 to 720 mg l the color removal is almost constant however the cod removal decreased from 94 0 to 86 1 respectively it should be noted that 86 1 can be increased to 87 0 with increasing the electrolysis time up to 50 min the increasing initial mg concentration increases its concentration on the electrode surface on the one hand and decreases the electro generated physisorbed ho concentration by fouling of the electrode surface with dye molecules and its intermediates on the other hand so the decrease of cod removal efficiency with increasing mg concentration is related to the decrease of the electro generated ho concentration to the initial dye concentration ratio at the electrode surface yahiaoui et al 2013 dai et al 2016 3 6 current efficiency and energy consumption the instantaneous current efficiency ice and average current efficiency ace are a measure of efficiency of electrochemical process in the treatment of mg the formulas for the calculation of the instantaneous current efficiency ice and average current efficiency ace based on the cod values are shown in eqs 1 and 2 dai et al 2016 li et al 2016 canizares et al 2006 guenfoud et al 2014 cañizares et al 2006 zhou and he 2008 1 i c e c o d t c o d t δ t 8 i δ t f v 2 ace c o d 0 c o d t f v 8 i t 100 where cod 0 is initial chemical oxygen demand g l at time t 0 cod t and cod t δt are the chemical oxygen demand at time t and t δt s respectively i is the applied current a t the treatment time s f is the faraday constant c mol v is the volume of the electrolyte l and 8 is the number of electrons exchanged per mole of o2 the calculated ace and ice at concentrations of 360 and 720 mg l of mg dye on different are shown in fig 7 the first striking fact in these figures is that the most ace and ice values were obtained using the g β pbo2 electrode in addition as can be seen for different β pbo2 electrodes with the electrolysis progresses the cod removal rate and consequently ace and ice decreased due to the competition of the oxygen evolution reaction oer aquino et al 2014 dai et al 2016 li et al 2016 wang et al 2015a 2015b canizares et al 2006 guenfoud et al 2014 cañizares et al 2006 zhou and he 2008 the values of ace and ice were lower than the value expected for a purely mass transport controlled process 100 li et al 2016 wang et al 2015a 2015b canizares et al 2006 guenfoud et al 2014 cañizares et al 2006 zhou and he 2008 this can be related to the occurrence of two side and back reactions which can be performed during the electrolysis the formation of reversible redox intermediates occurrence of the back reaction and or resistant to oxidation intermediates occurrence of the side reaction are the reasons for the decrease of ace and ice table 1 represents the average current efficiency ace and instantaneous current efficiency ice values of the different β pbo2 anodes used for the electrocatalytic degradation of mg at the optimum operating conditions energy consumption ec is an important parameter to optimize the degradation process it was calculated by the following equation 3 aquino et al 2011 2014 li et al 2016 guenfoud et al 2014 lin et al 2012 moreira et al 2017 tsantaki et al 2012 3 ec u i t 3 6 c o d 0 c o d t v where u is voltage applied v other parameters were defined before fig 7 also shows the energy consumption for different β pbo2 electrodes as a function of cod removal as can be seen the energy consumption kwh m3 was found to vary in the order g β pbo2 ss316 β pbo2 ti β pbo2 pb β pbo2 table 1 as discussed before this could be ascribed to better performance of the g β pbo2 electrode in electrochemical generation of ho radicals than those of other β pbo2 electrodes due to its high oxygen evolution potential good electric conductivity good electrodeposition and high specific area aquino et al 2011 2014 li et al 2016 guenfoud et al 2014 lin et al 2012 moreira et al 2017 tsantaki et al 2012 yao et al 2015 it should be noted that the electrochemical generated ho radicals led to a significant improvement in the performance of the electrodes with reasonable ec values less than 20 kwh m3 due to the high oxidation activity of ho radicals aquino et al 2011 2014 li et al 2016 guenfoud et al 2014 lin et al 2012 moreira et al 2017 tsantaki et al 2012 yao et al 2015 3 7 comparison with other electrodes for mg electrodegradation the results from the literature survey show that several type of electrodes including active electrodes ruo2 iro2 pt and nonactive electrodes pbo2 tio2 sno2 bdd have evolved for the degradation of mg singh et al 2013a 2013b 2016 yao et al 2016 guenfoud et al 2014 table 2 compares them from the point of view of initial ph electrolysis time initial dye concentration current density average current efficiency ace instantaneous current efficiency ice and energy consumption ec with the prepared electrodes in this research according to table 2 our data in the most cases are superior to previously reported data the life time of the fabricated electrodes was studied by cell potential time responses of β pbo2 electrodes during the constant current experiments 100 ma cm2 in h2so4 3 m solution fig s13 the results show that under the conditions of accelerated aging the electrodes showed stable behavior with cell potential of about 4 5 v for 40 80 h however when the cell potential increases to 10 v due to film detachment and or mechanical damage the electrodes failed song et al 2007 the life time was found to vary in the order g β pbo2 80 h ti pbo2 64 h ss316 β pbo2 52 h pb β pbo2 40 h the formation of pbo2 particles into the carbon matrix as well as smaller particle formation fig 1 which reduces defect density significantly improved the electrochemical stability of g β pbo2 the leaching of lead ion was checked after complete degradation of malachite green using β pbo2 electrodes by cyclic voltammetry fig s14 the data show that no amount of pb2 has been detected in the electrolyzed solution for more certainty the leaching of lead ions after electrolysis for 50 min was checked by icp oes the results show that the pb2 concentration in the electrolyzed solution using g β pbo2 and ti β pbo2 electrodes were 0 0035 and 0 0060 mg l respectively which are much less than who guideline value of 0 01 mg l for drinking water tokimoto et al 2005 4 conclusion in this work four types of β pbo2 electrodes g β pbo2 ss316 β pbo2 ti β pbo2 and pb β pbo2 were developed and compared with regard to their efficiency toward the degradation and mineralization of mg the degradation efficiency of mg using four type of electrodes was perfect and close to 100 the obtained cod removal for different electrodes was found to vary in the order g β pbo2 94 0 ss316 β pbo2 90 9 ti β pbo2 88 0 pb β pbo2 72 3 it is necessary to mention that the same trend is observed for average current efficiency ace instantaneous current efficiency ice and energy consumption ec table 1 the values of ace ice and ec for g β pbo2 electrode are 34 7 34 7 and 7 35 kwh m3 respectively the comparison of these results with the data already existing in the literature showed that our data in the most cases are superior to the previously reported data in addition in this work the electrochemical behavior and adsorption characteristic of mg at different ph values in the range 2 0 12 0 were comprehensively investigated in aqueous solutions these studies have led to the proposed mechanism for oxidation pathway of mg schemes 1 3 and determine the absorption properties of mg in acidic neutral and basic solutions we also proposed the mineralization pathway of mg at β pbo2 electrode using the voltammetric data as well as other published data scheme 4 acknowledgments the authors are grateful to the basu research council 96 250 we also appreciate dr mahnaz sharafi

19380,this work has investigated the electrocatalytic degradation of malachite green mg in aqueous solution with g β pbo2 ss316 β pbo2 ti β pbo2 and pb β pbo2 electrodes these electrodes show high

also proposed the mineralization pathway of mg at β pbo2 electrode graphical abstract image 1 keywords electrocatalytic degradation lead dioxide electrode malachite green electrochemical behavior degradation mechanism 1 introduction in both developing and industrialized nations a growing number of contaminants are entering water from traditional compounds such as heavy metals and the organic compound specifically dyes the worldwide high level of production of dyes is the main reason for the contamination of water sources and the generation of a considerable amount of colored wastewater shannon et al 2008 malachite green mg a cationic dye has numerous industrial applications such as dyeing of silk coloring jute wool leather plastics paper etc it was also used as fungicide and antiseptic in the aquatic and fisheries industries studies have shown that mg producing substances are harmful for the respiratory system reduce fertility in humans singh et al 2013a it is noted that the biodegradation of dyes such as mg due to the presence of nitrogen in their structure is a difficult process this feature makes use of conventional treatment impossible ngamukot et al 2006 therefore removing these environmental pollutants requires technologically advanced treatment systems so far several different technologies are emerging for the removal of dyes from wastewaters including membrane filtration catalytic oxidation flocculation coagulation adsorption and biological technology singh et al 2016 however these methods have some disadvantages such as formation of active sludge and need a great amount of reagents which have restricted their widespread use aquino et al 2014 recent investigations have demonstrated the great potential of electrochemical approaches as cleaner methods to mineralize organic pollution for the degradation treatment of wastewater oturan et al 2008 among them electrocatalytic oxidation processes have been introduced and received greater attention in recent years due to their advantages such as easy operation relative low cost environmental compatibility high efficiency and producing no secondary waste stream brillas and martínez huitle 2015 these methods were performed in two ways i direct oxidation in which the pollutants were destroyed after direct electron transfer at the electrode surface and ii indirect oxidation in which the pollutants were mediated with electro generated oxidants such as hydroxyl radicals ho which is a powerful oxidant singh et al 2016 martinez huitle and ferro 2006 in indirect method it is very important to develop a novel electrode material with high catalytic activity and stability in this regard titanium oxide tio2 ruthenium oxide ruo2 iridium oxide iro2 graphite platinum pt lead dioxides pbo2 tin oxides sbo2 and boron doped diamond bdd have been suggested as promising electrode materials yao et al 2016 these electrodes are divided into two groups i active electrodes ruo2 iro2 pt and ii non active electrode pbo2 tio2 sno2 bdd radjenovic and sedlak 2015 the non active electrodes have high oxygen evolution overpotential oxidative degradation using these electrodes is performed directly by the adsorbed hydroxyl radicals produced from water discharge radjenovic and sedlak 2015 yahiaoui et al 2013 panizza and cerisola 2008 low cost ease of preparation high conductivity good corrosion resistance high oxygen evolution potential and long service lifetime are the most important characteristics of non active electrodes such as pbo2 and sno2 rather than the active electrodes such as platinum or ruthenium oxide feng et al 2016 it is also noted that β pbo2 black color has relatively higher conductivity overpotential for oxygen evolution and stability in acid solutions than α pbo2 brown color mindt 1969 to develop the use of β pbo2 electrodes to mineralization of mg and also the introduction of the most efficient β pbo2 electrode in the present study the electrocatalytic activity and degradation efficiency of a series of β pbo2 electrodes including graphite g β pbo2 stainless steel ss316 β pbo2 ti β pbo2 and pb β pbo2 electrodes in aqueous solution were studied toward malachite green degradation the surface morphology and crystal structure of pbo2 electrodes are characterized by sem edx and xrd respectively in addition a comprehensive study on the parameters effecting degradation efficiency such as initial ph initial mg concentrations current density and electrolysis time was conducted furthermore the behavior of mg and produced intermediates during oxidative degradation were studied by cyclic voltammetry and uv vis spectrophotometry this study proposed the mechanisms for the electrochemical oxidation and oxidative degradation of mg 2 experimental all parts of experimental section including materials instrumentation electrochemical treatments g β pbo2 electrode preparation ss316 β pbo2 electrode preparation ti β pbo2 electrode preparation and pb β pbo2 electrode preparation can be found at supplementary data 3 results and discussion 3 1 surface morphology of β pbo2 electrodes x ray diffraction technique has been used to determination of the pbo2 phases crystal structure and purity of the deposited film fig 1 part i shows xrd patterns of the films cracked from the surface of pbo2 electrodes the main diffraction peaks observed at 2θ 25 4 32 0 36 2 and 49 0 are assigned to the 110 101 200 and 211 plane of β pbo2 it indicates that the electrodeposited pbo2 belongs to the β pbo2 phase hao et al 2014 also the diffraction peaks at 2θ 29 and 52 are indication of α pbo2 phase the comparison of the xrd patterns with the standard diffraction peaks for the β pbo2 jcpds 89 2805 card shows the β pbo2 as a dominant phase in the deposited film and confirms the electrochemical synthesis of tetragonal β pbo2 phase on the surface of electrodes hao et al 2014 chen et al 2016 the data show that when the substrate changes the crystalline orientation of the electrodes did not change and almost no new phase was formed on the β pbo2 film chen et al 2009 the average size of β pbo2 crystals was calculated by debye scherrer formula hao et al 2014 the size of β pbo2 crystals was found to be 30 2 nm 44 7 nm 32 3 nm and 36 0 nm for the g β pbo2 ss316 β pbo2 ti β pbo2 and pb β pbo2 electrodes respectively which are consistent with the sem results fig 1 part ii the sem images of the surface of β pbo2 electrodes are shown in fig 1 part ii these images show that the crystalline structure of β pbo2 in all cases are uniform crack free and very compact with pyramidal cluster distribution li et al 2016 such a morphology guarantees that only β pbo2 is involved in the electrochemical degradation of the dye the results obtained by sem and xrd fig 1 part ii show that the smallest size and the highest uniformity of the β pbo2 ýcrystals were obtained using graphite electrode g β pbo2 this result is in agreement with the data obtained from xrd the smaller particle size is a robust feature that provides a larger specific surface area and enhance the electrogeneration efficiency of ho on β pbo2 electrodes which increases the electrochemical degradation efficiency of mg hao et al 2014 li et al 2016 sem details in figs s1 s4 the edx pattern of β pbo2 electrodes is shown in fig s5 the maps of the elements generated by the edx showing the constituent element lead of the β pbo2 coated on the surface of electrodes fig s5 shows the matching of deposited films with the samples reported in the literature hao et al 2014 li et al 2016 in addition the lack of additional peaks of unknown compounds clearly confirms the purity of the deposited pbo2 films it is worth noting that the presence of low intensity fe or ti peaks is due to the electrode materials 3 2 electrochemical behavior of mg we report here the electrochemical behavior of mg in water solution containing phosphate buffer ph 2 0 c 0 2 m fig 2 part i curve a shows the first cycle of the cyclic voltammogram of mg 1 0 mm at the surface of glassy carbon electrode at the scan rate of 50 mv s the cv shows an anodic peak a1 at 0 69 v vs ag agcl in the positive going scan and one cathodic peak c0 at 0 44 v vs ag agcl in the negative going scan in addition to these peaks the second cycle of the cyclic voltammogram curve b shows a new anodic peak a0 at 0 47 v vs ag agcl when the potential scan range expands to 1 2 v vs ag agcl in addition to the previous peaks a1 a0 and c0 new anodic a2 and cathodic c00 peaks appear at more positive potentials fig 2 part ii the appearance of the cathodic peak c0 and its anodic counterpart a0 in the second cycle of the cyclic voltammogram confirms the formation of a new redox couple at less positive potentials e 1 2 0 46 v the effect of potential scan rate on the cyclic voltammogram of mg in the range of 10 50000 mv s was studied fig 2 parts iii and iv shows the cyclic voltammogram of mg in the range of 10 1000 mv s the important point to note is the relative stability of the peak current ratio i pc0 i pa1 with increasing potential scan rate even at higher scan rates 50000 mv s in addition as can be seen with increasing potential scan rate peak a1 changes from peak shaped to an s shaped voltammogram in the s shape voltammograms which is adapted as indication of a ce mechanism the current is predominantly governed by the rate at which electroactive specie is formed by the preceding reaction rather than by diffusion rafiee et al 2011 one of the most likely preceding reactions in the electrochemical oxidation of amines compounds in acidic solutions is deprotonation of the ammonium group maleki and nematollahi 2013 in order to study the adsorption diffusion behavior of mg the voltammetric data presented in fig 2 parts iii and iv have been analyzed and the related plots are shown as insets in fig 2 the linear relation between i pa1 and v 1 2 in various scan rates r2 0 9998 shows that the oxidation process of mg is diffusion controlled part iii inset in addition the slope of log i pa1 vs log v 1 2 is 0 55 r2 0 9944 part iv inset this value is very close to the theoretical value of 0 5 for the diffusion controlled process which confirms diffusion controlled nature of the electrode process at ph 2 0 according to the data and considering previously published data singh et al 2013a zhu et al 2015 renaud et al 1984 ray et al 2017 we proposed the following mechanism for electrochemical oxidation of mg at ph 2 0 according to scheme 1 one electron oxidation of mg produces dication radical i this compound can participate in both pathways a and b in path a dication radical i after losing a proton to neutralize the positive charge and form the methylene radical ii a further electron to yield the nitrenium ion iii the reaction of water with iii produces mgoh1 accordingly peak a1 is attributed to irreversible two electron oxidation of mg to mgoh1 in addition the two electron reduction of mgoh1 to lmgoh can be take place at the electrode surface therefore we think that the redox couple peaks a0 c0 are attributed to the mgoh1 lmgoh redox couple the overall reaction mechanism for the generation of peak a1 is shown in scheme 2 further oxidation of mgoh1 which occurs at more positive potentials than e pa1 creates peak a2 under these conditions mgoh1 can follow two different paths c and d in path c similar to before mgoh1 converts to mgoh2 the presence of two hydroxyl groups which are electron withdrawing group by induction in the structure of mgoh2 makes its unstable so that in cyclic voltammograms only a small reduction peak c00 can be seen in the cathodic scan it s also possible that mgoh1 after oxidation can directly convert into electro inactive decomposed materials since the peak current ratios i pa0 i pa1 i pc0 i pa1 are too small it can be suggested that a relatively large percentage of dication radical i after re oxidation convert into electro inactive decomposed compounds path b we also report the electrochemical behavior of mg in water solution containing phosphate buffer at ph 7 0 c 0 2 m in two potential ranges fig 2 parts v vii the basic pattern of the voltammograms at ph 7 0 is similar with that of at ph 2 0 fig 2 however they have some differences including a the shift of all peaks to the less positive potentials at this ph e pa1 e pa2 e pa0 and e pc0 are 0 55 0 78 0 39 and 0 33 v vs ag agcl this can be attributed to the participation of proton s in the oxidation of mg b the peak current ratios i pa0 i pa1 i pc0 i pa1 and i pa1 i pa2 at ph 7 0 is less than ph 2 0 this can be related to the hydroxylation and or dimerization of the electron transfer products or intermediates assisted by alkaline ph c at ph 7 0 when the switching potential was changed to 0 90 v vs ag agcl the anodic and cathodic peaks a0 and c0 have nearly disappeared this can be attributed to the transformation of mgoh1 to mgoh2 and or decomposed compounds paths c and d assisted by alkaline ph d δe pa e pa2 e pa1 at ph 7 0 0 23 v is less than δe pa at ph 2 0 0 38 v the effect of potential scan rate on the cyclic voltammogram of mg at ph 7 0 is also shown in fig 2 part vii the first case that can be observed in this figure is the appearance and increasing of i pc0 with increasing potential scan rate moreover the peak current ratio i pa1 i pa2 is dependent on the potential scan rate as the scan rate is increased the peak current ratio increases it was already known that in diffusion controlled process the peak current i p depends on the square root of potential scan rate v 1 2 while in adsorption controlled regime i p depends on the potential scan rate so when the nature of the two peaks is different the change in scan rate causes a change in the peak current ratio it should be noted that this behavior was not observed at ph 2 0 in order to study the adsorption diffusion behavior of peak a1 at ph 7 0 the log i pa1 was analyzed at different scan rates log v the results are plotted in fig 2 part vii inset as can be seen the slope of log i pa1 vs log v 1 2 is 0 70 r2 0 9946 this slope value 0 70 is bigger than the theoretical value of 0 5 diffusion controlled process and is less than one theoretical value for the adsorption controlled electrode process momeni and nematollahi 2017 this result confirms the partial adsorption of mg at the surface of the electrode and increasing i pa1 i pa2 with increasing scan rate compared with the results at ph 2 0 this result also shows that the interaction between mg and the electrode surface at ph 7 0 is stronger than at ph 2 0 considering the dissociation constant of mg pk a 6 9 culp and beland 1996 a reason for this finding is relative deprotonation of mg at ph 7 0 according to the present data we suggest that the reaction pathway at ph 7 0 is not different from ph 2 0 the smaller the i pa0 i pa1 or i pc0 i pa1 at ph 7 0 compared with ph 2 0 can be related to smaller δpa at smaller δpa more amount of mgoh1 convert to mgoh2 and or decomposed compounds so that at reverse scan a lower amount of mgoh1 reduces to lmgoh in addition with increasing potential scan rate decreasing time windows a greater amount of mgoh1 remains at the electrode surface which on the reverse scan creates peak c0 the electrochemical behavior of mg was also reported in water solution containing carbonate buffer at ph 12 0 c 0 2 m fig 2 part viii contrary to what was observed in ph values 2 0 and 7 0 no anodic and cathodic peaks a0 and c0 were observed at ph 12 0 it is known that mg in aqueous solutions is partly converted into its non ionic colorless form carbinol zhu et al 2015 yong et al 2015 fischer et al 2011 scheme 3 as can be seen the chemical reduction of mg to carbinol is ph dependent and increases with increasing ph according to scheme 3 mg participates in a chemical reaction with hydroxide ion to produces its reduced form carbinol therefore we suggest that at ph 12 0 the main species present at the electrode surface is col whose redox behavior is different from mg the oxidation pathway of col is shown in scheme 3 according to scheme 3 carbinol after oxidation is irreversibly broken down at the bond between the central carbon atom and the n n dimethylamino phenyl ring to dimethyl amino phenyl phenyl methanone and n n dimethylaniline fischer et al 2011 yang et al 2015 so unlike phs 2 0 and 7 0 at ph 12 0 peak a1 is attributed to the irreversible oxidation of col to dimethyl amino phenyl phenyl methanone and n n dimethylaniline fischer et al 2011 yang et al 2015 3 3 constant current electrolysis of mg in this work for degradation of mg using β pbo2 electrodes ph 7 0 was selected as optimum ph because of its environmental compatibility degradation of mg during constant current electrolysis was studied by the linear sweep voltammetric technique constant current electrolysis was carried out in an undivided cell equipped with three g β pbo2 plats as anode and two stainless steel plats as cathode in this way an aqueous solution phosphate buffer ph 7 0 c 0 2 m containing 2 0 mm of mg was electrolyzed under current density of 3 ma cm2 electrode surface 100 cm2 for 60 min the progress of electrolysis was monitored by recording the linear sweep voltammograms fig 3 in this figure curve a shows two anodic peaks a1 and a2 as shown during electrolysis all initial peaks decrease and finally disappear at the end of electrolysis t 60 min curve h as can be seen the oxidative degradation of mg using g β pbo2 anode has been successfully performed under constant current condition so that at the end of the electrolysis no electroactive material remains in the electrolysis cell it should be noted that the same data were obtained when ti β pbo2 is used as anode with the difference that when ti β pbo2 is used a longer electrolysis time 70 min is necessary to complete the electrolysis the progress of electrolysis during constant current electrolysis using ti β pbo2 anode was also monitored by recording the uv vis absorption spectra of the resulting solution fig 3 inset the uv vis absorption spectrum of mg shows a strong peak at 617 nm and two weak peaks at 425 and 315 nm the peaks located at 617 and 425 nm are assigned to the cc and cn double bonds yao et al 2016 ju et al 2008 and the third peak at 315 nm is attributed to the benzene ring in the structure of mg yao et al 2016 ju et al 2008 this figure shows that proportional to the advancement of electrolysis the height of all three peaks decrease as the electrolysis time increases these peaks were removed after consumption of 1260 c t 70 min the absence of the peaks at the end of electrolysis is due to the lack of the compounds with chromophore and conjugated π system uv active compounds in electrolysis cell ju et al 2008 the electrochemical and the spectroscopic data present in this research along with previous data singh et al 2013a yong et al 2015 yang et al 2015 on degradation of mg allows us to propose the following pathway for oxidative degradation of mg using β pbo2 anode at ph 7 scheme 4 3 4 kinetic studies and the effect of current density the results of the observed degradation rate constants k obs of mg using β pbo2 electrodes at ýdifferent current density and two mg concentrations are shown in fig 4 the data indicate that the degradation rate constant depends on three factors 1 type of β pbo2 electrode g β pbo2 ýanode exhibits the best degradation performance compared to other electrodes 2 current density the observed degradation rate constant increases with increasing the current density this can be attributed to the higher hydroxyl radical generation degradation agent at higher current density 3 mg concentration the degradation rate constant decreases with increasing the mg concentration this can be attributed to the more adsorption of mg and or intermediates on the electrode surface at higher mg concentration which reduces the efficiency of the electrode toward hydroxyl radical generation the results of these experiments are summarized in table s1 the data show a good linear correlation exists between ln c0 ct and time t which indicates that the electrocatalytic degradation of the mg on the β pbo2 electrodes followed pseudo first order kinetics yahiaoui et al 2013 dai et al 2016 hao et al 2014 the effect of current density on the color removal during electrocatalytic oxidation of mg using β pbo2 electrodes at ph 7 0 was also studied figs s9 and s10 the results show that a complete degradation of mg was occurred during electrocatalytic degradation of mg using all four types of anodes the results also showed that the degradation time of mg decreases with increasing current density fig s11 in addition the time for complete degradation of mg using g β pbo2 electrode is shorter than other β pbo2 electrodes g β pbo2 40 min ss316 β pbo2 50 min ti β pbo2 60 min pb β pbo2 70 min which results in less energy spent fig 5 shows the efficiency of different β pbo2 electrodes on the cod removal the pb β pbo2 anode shows the lowest efficiency of cod removal while the highest removal efficiency was achieved using g β pbo2 electrode the cod removal efficiency increased up to 72 3 88 0 and 90 9 for pb β pbo2 ti pbo2 and ss316 β pbo2 while using g β pbo2 electrode the cod removal efficiency increased up to 94 0 at current density 4 ma cm2 and initial concentration dye 360 mg l due to better interaction between dye molecules and electrogenerated ho radicals fig 5 singh et al 2016 yahiaoui et al 2013 under these conditions the mg degradation efficiency using pb β pbo2 ti pbo2 ss316 β pbo2 and g β pbo2 electrodes was close to 100 this indicates that some generated intermediates during the degradation process are resistant to mineralization the higher cod removal efficiency and degradation efficiency for the g β pbo2 electrode can be related to the greater amount of coated pbo2 on graphite electrode compared to other electrodes which increases the number of sites available for the production of hydroxyl radicals as well as crystals size of β pbo2 which is the lowest value for g β pbo2 compared to other β pbo2 electrodes fig 1 the smaller crystals provide a greatly increased surface area that lead to high efficiency electro generation of ho which is beneficial for the treatment of pollutants feng et al 2016 li et al 2011 ju et al 2008 chen et al 2014 wang et al 2015a 2015b the cod removal rate constant of the different β pbo2 electrodes at current density 4 ma cm2 was also studied fig s12 the calculated observed cod removal rate constant was found to vary in the order g β pbo2 ss316 β pbo2 ti pbo2 pb β pbo2 which confirms the data the above mentioned study the results of these experiments are summarized in table s2 3 5 effects of mg initial concentration due to the fact that the concentrations of colored pollutants changed with the flow of wastewater the study of the effect of initial mg concentration on the removal efficiency is very important in this way the color and cod removal efficiencies were studied at two concentrations of mg 360 and 720 mg l under different β pbo2 electrodes at i 4 ma cm2 and ph 7 0 fig 6 the results indicate that with increasing mg concentration from 360 to 720 mg l both color and cod removal efficiencies decreased which is partially compensated by increasing electrolysis time for example at the g β pbo2 electrode the results showed that when the initial concentration of mg increased from 360 to 720 mg l the color removal is almost constant however the cod removal decreased from 94 0 to 86 1 respectively it should be noted that 86 1 can be increased to 87 0 with increasing the electrolysis time up to 50 min the increasing initial mg concentration increases its concentration on the electrode surface on the one hand and decreases the electro generated physisorbed ho concentration by fouling of the electrode surface with dye molecules and its intermediates on the other hand so the decrease of cod removal efficiency with increasing mg concentration is related to the decrease of the electro generated ho concentration to the initial dye concentration ratio at the electrode surface yahiaoui et al 2013 dai et al 2016 3 6 current efficiency and energy consumption the instantaneous current efficiency ice and average current efficiency ace are a measure of efficiency of electrochemical process in the treatment of mg the formulas for the calculation of the instantaneous current efficiency ice and average current efficiency ace based on the cod values are shown in eqs 1 and 2 dai et al 2016 li et al 2016 canizares et al 2006 guenfoud et al 2014 cañizares et al 2006 zhou and he 2008 1 i c e c o d t c o d t δ t 8 i δ t f v 2 ace c o d 0 c o d t f v 8 i t 100 where cod 0 is initial chemical oxygen demand g l at time t 0 cod t and cod t δt are the chemical oxygen demand at time t and t δt s respectively i is the applied current a t the treatment time s f is the faraday constant c mol v is the volume of the electrolyte l and 8 is the number of electrons exchanged per mole of o2 the calculated ace and ice at concentrations of 360 and 720 mg l of mg dye on different are shown in fig 7 the first striking fact in these figures is that the most ace and ice values were obtained using the g β pbo2 electrode in addition as can be seen for different β pbo2 electrodes with the electrolysis progresses the cod removal rate and consequently ace and ice decreased due to the competition of the oxygen evolution reaction oer aquino et al 2014 dai et al 2016 li et al 2016 wang et al 2015a 2015b canizares et al 2006 guenfoud et al 2014 cañizares et al 2006 zhou and he 2008 the values of ace and ice were lower than the value expected for a purely mass transport controlled process 100 li et al 2016 wang et al 2015a 2015b canizares et al 2006 guenfoud et al 2014 cañizares et al 2006 zhou and he 2008 this can be related to the occurrence of two side and back reactions which can be performed during the electrolysis the formation of reversible redox intermediates occurrence of the back reaction and or resistant to oxidation intermediates occurrence of the side reaction are the reasons for the decrease of ace and ice table 1 represents the average current efficiency ace and instantaneous current efficiency ice values of the different β pbo2 anodes used for the electrocatalytic degradation of mg at the optimum operating conditions energy consumption ec is an important parameter to optimize the degradation process it was calculated by the following equation 3 aquino et al 2011 2014 li et al 2016 guenfoud et al 2014 lin et al 2012 moreira et al 2017 tsantaki et al 2012 3 ec u i t 3 6 c o d 0 c o d t v where u is voltage applied v other parameters were defined before fig 7 also shows the energy consumption for different β pbo2 electrodes as a function of cod removal as can be seen the energy consumption kwh m3 was found to vary in the order g β pbo2 ss316 β pbo2 ti β pbo2 pb β pbo2 table 1 as discussed before this could be ascribed to better performance of the g β pbo2 electrode in electrochemical generation of ho radicals than those of other β pbo2 electrodes due to its high oxygen evolution potential good electric conductivity good electrodeposition and high specific area aquino et al 2011 2014 li et al 2016 guenfoud et al 2014 lin et al 2012 moreira et al 2017 tsantaki et al 2012 yao et al 2015 it should be noted that the electrochemical generated ho radicals led to a significant improvement in the performance of the electrodes with reasonable ec values less than 20 kwh m3 due to the high oxidation activity of ho radicals aquino et al 2011 2014 li et al 2016 guenfoud et al 2014 lin et al 2012 moreira et al 2017 tsantaki et al 2012 yao et al 2015 3 7 comparison with other electrodes for mg electrodegradation the results from the literature survey show that several type of electrodes including active electrodes ruo2 iro2 pt and nonactive electrodes pbo2 tio2 sno2 bdd have evolved for the degradation of mg singh et al 2013a 2013b 2016 yao et al 2016 guenfoud et al 2014 table 2 compares them from the point of view of initial ph electrolysis time initial dye concentration current density average current efficiency ace instantaneous current efficiency ice and energy consumption ec with the prepared electrodes in this research according to table 2 our data in the most cases are superior to previously reported data the life time of the fabricated electrodes was studied by cell potential time responses of β pbo2 electrodes during the constant current experiments 100 ma cm2 in h2so4 3 m solution fig s13 the results show that under the conditions of accelerated aging the electrodes showed stable behavior with cell potential of about 4 5 v for 40 80 h however when the cell potential increases to 10 v due to film detachment and or mechanical damage the electrodes failed song et al 2007 the life time was found to vary in the order g β pbo2 80 h ti pbo2 64 h ss316 β pbo2 52 h pb β pbo2 40 h the formation of pbo2 particles into the carbon matrix as well as smaller particle formation fig 1 which reduces defect density significantly improved the electrochemical stability of g β pbo2 the leaching of lead ion was checked after complete degradation of malachite green using β pbo2 electrodes by cyclic voltammetry fig s14 the data show that no amount of pb2 has been detected in the electrolyzed solution for more certainty the leaching of lead ions after electrolysis for 50 min was checked by icp oes the results show that the pb2 concentration in the electrolyzed solution using g β pbo2 and ti β pbo2 electrodes were 0 0035 and 0 0060 mg l respectively which are much less than who guideline value of 0 01 mg l for drinking water tokimoto et al 2005 4 conclusion in this work four types of β pbo2 electrodes g β pbo2 ss316 β pbo2 ti β pbo2 and pb β pbo2 were developed and compared with regard to their efficiency toward the degradation and mineralization of mg the degradation efficiency of mg using four type of electrodes was perfect and close to 100 the obtained cod removal for different electrodes was found to vary in the order g β pbo2 94 0 ss316 β pbo2 90 9 ti β pbo2 88 0 pb β pbo2 72 3 it is necessary to mention that the same trend is observed for average current efficiency ace instantaneous current efficiency ice and energy consumption ec table 1 the values of ace ice and ec for g β pbo2 electrode are 34 7 34 7 and 7 35 kwh m3 respectively the comparison of these results with the data already existing in the literature showed that our data in the most cases are superior to the previously reported data in addition in this work the electrochemical behavior and adsorption characteristic of mg at different ph values in the range 2 0 12 0 were comprehensively investigated in aqueous solutions these studies have led to the proposed mechanism for oxidation pathway of mg schemes 1 3 and determine the absorption properties of mg in acidic neutral and basic solutions we also proposed the mineralization pathway of mg at β pbo2 electrode using the voltammetric data as well as other published data scheme 4 acknowledgments the authors are grateful to the basu research council 96 250 we also appreciate dr mahnaz sharafi

without any treatment who and unicef 2017 discharging untreated excreta harms the environment by causing eutrophication because human excreta contains plant nutrients smil 2002 spångberg et al 2014 steffen et al 2015 and harms people especially children by spreading disease who 2006 this issue will not be addressed simply by building more toilets there is a need for safe toilets that protect the user as well as a system for safely removing transporting and processing the excreta opel 2012 the characteristics and content of urine and faeces differ greatly with the most pertinent difference being from a managerial point of view that urine contains most of the plant nutrients excreted while faeces contain the majority if not all of the pathogens excreted höglund et al 2000 separate collection of the two fractions means that they can be managed according to their individual composition urine as a plant nutrient resource and faeces as a potential pathogen containing fraction using urine as a liquid fertiliser poses a logistical challenge since approximately 550 kg yr 1 person 1 is produced vinnerås et al 2006 which requires either a large storage tank or frequent emptying to a central storage as fertilisers are not applied more often than twice per growing season with the objective of minimising the volume of urine several treatments to concentrate or extract the nutrients in the urine have been studied maurer et al 2006 since urea is rapidly hydrolysed degraded into nh3 and carbonates already during collection of urine in urine diverting systems udert et al 2003 most studies have focused on recovery from or concentration of hydrolysed urine methods for concentrating urine retaining all nutrients include reverse osmosis forward osmosis or membrane distillation partial nitrification followed by distillation acidification followed by dehydration antonini et al 2012 maurer et al 2006 the recovery of part of nutrients has also been achieved such as ammonia nh3 by air stripping antonini et al 2012 phosphorus with some n via struvite precipitation pradhan et al 2017 udert et al 2015 or n as nh4 by adsorption on cation exchangers kavvada et al 2017 tarpeh et al 2017 if the hydrolysis of urea is prevented urine can be dehydrated with minimal loss of nitrogen retaining also most of other macro and micro nutrients and thus produce a complete fertiliser with a balance reflecting the plant nutrient requirements of the crops winker et al 2009 randall and naidoo 2018 highly acidic or alkaline conditions natural or chemical inhibitors as well as temperature and electrolysis can be used for stopping the hydrolysis randall et al 2016 in soils containing clay lime is often used to increase the ph of the soil to increase the availability of p and alkalinisation of urine to prevent urea hydrolysis seems to be a promising route for urine concentration combining the blocking of hydrolysis and improving the plant nutrient availability simha et al 2018 senecal and vinnerås 2017 and dutta and vinnerås 2016 have developed an approach that retains npk by using unhydrolised urine by this approach the urine is first alkalinised to prevent urea hydrolysis so that the urine can be dehydrated with minimal loss of nitrogen the alkalisation can be performed with chemicals such as lime randall et al 2016 or with alkaline waste products such as wood ash senecal and vinnerås 2017 the concept behind the system is that urine would be dehydrated within the toilet reducing the mass by 90 once the ph of the medium has decreased from 11 5 to 10 5 mainly due to the capture of co2 from the air it would be replaced with fresh dehydration medium by placing the dehydration unit inside the bathroom no extra piping would be required except for connecting the drying unit to the ventilation the dried urine concentrated ten times can be bagged and collected as a solid to a central fertilisation production unit simha et al 2017 existing toilets dry or flush could be retrofitted with such a system and thus simplify the logistics of handling the urine as the system would not require a tank extra plumbing or additional sewer connection for the urine just good ventilation the capital costs of implementation may be minimal and the system could be installed virtually anywhere urine inside the bladder of a healthy person is typically pathogen free willey et al 2009 however during excretion of urine in urine diverting toilets cross contamination from faeces occurs höglund et al 2000 and bacteria can grow in the biofilm inside the pipes as faeces may contain pathogenic viruses bacteria protozoa and helminths who 2006 this risk needs to be considered diseases that can be emitted via the urine are considered a limited risk in temperate countries but should be considered in tropical climates however the main risk is still from the faecal cross contamination who 2006 in the who 2006 guidelines the recommended target log10 reduction of indicator pathogens for source separated urine is 4 5 units who 2006 this paper assessed the hygienic health risks involved in using the urine dehydration end product based on simha et al 2018 process by studying the fate of the pathogens in the material after the dehydration process is complete the experiment was set up to simulate that the last person using the toilet before the dehydration medium is changed is contaminating the medium with misplaced faeces with no time for dehydration of the urine i e a worst case scenario hence the aim was to understand the potential inactivation in the saturated medium after this last user and the effect of storing the alkaline dehydration media wood ash and not the effect of the urine dehydration process in the present study the inactivation of five microorganisms three indicators enterococcus faecalis ms2 bacteriophage and φx 174 bacteriophage and two pathogens ascaris suum and salmonella spp was assessed in medium that had already been used to dehydrate urine 2 methodology 2 1 preparation of the saturated ash wood ash was prepared as described in simha et al 2018 briefly fresh human urine from approximately 10 men and women 22 65 years was collected in sterile 1 l polypropylene containers through out the study for each drying run urine from at least three persons was pooled after storage at 4 c for at the most 2 days before each use the urine composition is presented in detail in simha et al 2018 the ph of the urine was increased from 7 to 10 2 0 5 with amberlite ira410 type 2 resin merck chemicals gmbh darmstadt germany which exchanged the cl in urine for oh ash was produced from burning of birch wood for domestic heating in uppsala sweden ash 175 g was placed in a metal sieve ø 0 198 m in an incubator at 42 c with

ash every 12 h day and night until the ph of the ash decreased to 10 5 at which point the medium was considered not suitable for further drying as at a lower ph an increased risk noted as saturated below a total of 1600 ml of urine was added to 175 g ash the microorganisms to be studied were added together with faeces reaching a concentration of bacteria corresponding to 6 log10 cfu g 1 a phage concentration of 8 log10 pfu g 1 and 160 ascaris suum eggs g 1 the addition of the microorganisms together with faeces was to mimic the environmental contamination of urine with faecal cross contamination additionally in other studies by the authors we have observed that organic material provides a protective environment for microorganisms under hard conditions data not published 2 2

ring tubes were incubated at 37 c for 24 h on a shaker table the hydrolysed urine was then filtered through a 0 45 μm syringe filter sarstedt germany prior to analysis the ph and ec of the ash urine material was measured by diluting 3 g triplicate samples from the mixed with 1 5 distilled water after 1 h rest in capped tubes ph was measured after 1400 and 1600 ml urine had been added and the ec at the end of the dehydration process diluted ash from the ph measurements was returned to the dehydration medium based on the electric conductivity ec ds m 1 the ionic strength i moles m 3 was

according to emerson et al 1975 based on temperature and ph eqs 4 and 5 and then an emerson to pitzer conversion model was used fidjeland 2015 using a pitzer approach considers also the influence of

studied by inoculating already saturated ash see section 2 1 and monitoring the organisms concentration during storage to isolate the effect of temperature ph and ammonia on the microorganisms four controls were used table 1 temperature 20 and 42 c ph 10 5 and fresh urine further described below of the organisms studied three were indicators enterococcus faecalis atcc 29212 ms2 bacteriophage atcc15597 b1 and φx 174 bacteriophage atcc13706 b1 and two were pathogens ascaris suum and salmonella enterica subspecies enterica serovar typhimurium from here on referred to as s typhimurium bacteria and bacteriophages were sampled at different intervals to that of the a suum eggs and thus were prepared in separate containers 2 4 1 ascaris a suum eggs were retrieved by sieving swine faeces excelsior sentinel inc usa and were stored at 4 c in a diluted formalin solution during transportation and storage prior to use at the start of the experiment a sample of the a suum eggs n 100 was observed under a microscope to confirm that they were undeveloped and the initial viability was determined by incubating three sets of the eggs at 28 c in 0 1 n h2so2 for 28 days to allow larval development arene 1986 all viability counts were performed under the microscope x 10 and x 20 magnification unfertilised eggs identified by their incomplete shells were excluded from further counting eggs developing to the larval stage were considered viable while pre larval stages were not initial viability of the a suum eggs was 55 ci95 50 61 fresh faeces were collected from two people and stored in a freezer 18 c and then thawed overnight at 4 c five grams of faeces were inoculated with 2 ml of a suum egg solution 100 000 eggs ml 1 and blended for one minute by hand in a bag the inactivation of a suum during storage in saturated ash 43 initial moisture content was assessed at two temperatures 20 cold storage and 42 c heated storage to prepare the saturated ash for both the cold and heated storage 10 ml of fresh urine was mixed with 0 1 g 0 02 g of the inoculated faeces in a 50 ml centrifuge tube and shaken by hand for 5 s thereafter 25 ml of saturated ash was added without further mixing simulating the final urine loading with faecal contamination tubes were left open to the air no lid at 20 c number of replicates n 27 or at 42 c n 5 during the study the tubes were left open to simulate storing saturated ash collected from households in a stockpile until use as a fertiliser the evaporation rate was monitored throughout the study by weighing the tubes regularly and used to assess the change in moisture content to isolate the effects of temperature and ph and from the urine itself three solutions were prepared table 1 inoculated faeces 0 1 g was mixed with 5 ml of either m 15 phosphate buffer solution ph 7 2 as the temperature controls glycine naoh buffer solution ph 10 5 as the ph control or freshly collected not yet hydrolysed urine as the urine control the faeces and solutions were mixed in 7 ml tubes which after initial shaking for 5 s were left sealed at the respective temperature at 42 c only the temperature control n 5 ph 7 2 was studied whereas at 20 c the full set of controls were studied temperature control n 5 ph control 10 5 n 8 and urine control n 5 the ph in the ph controls was monitored throughout the experiment and was if necessary adjusted to the initial value with glycine naoh buffer solution in total 100 μl of 0 032 m naoh was added this corresponds to less than 1 of the solutions and should therefore not have a significant impact on the urine ion distribution destructive sampling of singlets was undertaken to enable frequent sampling the treatments at 20 c were sampled every third or fourth day for the first 50 days then every seven days until day 74 with two final samplings on days 102 and 346 at 42 c the treatment was sampled daily from day 1 6 and then lastly on day 9 the extraction procedure for the a suum eggs was a modification of the usepa 2003 method to extract the eggs from the solid saturated ash from the both the cold and heated storage treatments approximately 40 ml nacl 0 9 w v peptone water with the surfactant tween ph 7 henceforth called nacl solution was added to the tubes and shaken by hand for 30 s the material in the tubes was left to settle for 10 min and the liquid decanted over tyler sieves 38 μm cat no l3 400 and 300 μm cat no l3 50 magnesium sulfate mgso4 specific gravity 1 20 was added approx 30 ml to the remaining precipitate shaken by hand for 30 s and then centrifuged for 3 min at 4000 rpm to float the a suum to the top the supernatant was decanted over the sieves and the mgso4 washing repeated a total of three times to wash the a suum eggs from the filters nacl solution was used 40 50 ml the a suum eggs were then concentrated by centrifuging the washing solution for 3 min at 4000 rpm decanting the supernatant and adding 5 ml of 0 1 n h2so4 to the remaining nugget after extraction of the eggs a pre incubation check was performed on a subsample of 100 eggs was observed under the microscope to assess the condition of the eggs directly after extraction the remaining eggs were incubated at 28 c in 0 1 n h2so4 for 28 days to enhance larval development to estimate the time for a 3 log10 reduction the a suum egg viability data were logarithmized and fitted against a non linear inactivation model eq 8 from harm 1980 which enables the lag phase and inactivation phase to be determined in the same equation log10 n is the logged egg viability at time 0 and time t in days the parameter determining lag phase duration n and the inactivation rate k were determined by fitting the model to the data by non linear regression using the

bacteria and viruses the bacteria s typhimurium and e faecalis were cultivated in nutrient broth at 37 c on a shaker table approx 200 rpm for 24 h after incubation the solution was centrifuged at 2000 rpm for 15 min and enumeration confirmed a concentration of 6 log10 bacteria ml 1 in the nugget the bacteriophages were propagated according to standard iso10705 1 1995 using hosts strain s typhimurium wg49 nctc12484 and escherichia coli atcc13706 for the propagation of bacteriophages ms2 and φx174 respectively the host strains were propagated at 37 c for 1 5 h on a shaker table approx 200 rpm the bacteriophages were then propagated by added them to the respective host bacteria broth and incubated at 37 c for 24 h on a shaker table the final solutions with the bacteriophages were centrifuged at 2000 rpm for 15 min and filtered through 0 45 μm microfilters removing bacterial debris and reach an end concentration of 8 log10 ml 1 a stock solution of all four microorganisms was prepared by mixing together 100 ml of each of the solutions s typhimurium e faecalis ms2 bacteriophage and φx bacteriophage on a magnetic stir table for ten minutes faeces 0 1 g and microbial stock solution 5 ml were added to 50 ml containers ø 4 cm for the treatments n 21 5 g of saturated ash was added and containers left open to the air at 20 c without further mixing for the temperature n 21 ph n 21 and urine controls n 21 the same solutions were used as described in section 2 4 1 sampling was destructive and taken as independent triplicates for enumeration of bacteria 1 g of material or 1 ml for the controls was serially diluted with nacl solution and vortexed for 1 min and plated on slanetz bartley slaba agar 44 0 5 c 48 2 h and xylose lysine deoxycholate with novobiocin xld agar plates 37 0 5 c 24 1 h for detection of s typhimurium and e faecalis respectively the bacteriophages were sampled by serial diluting 1 g of material with nacl solution filtering the dilute 0 45 μm and plating using the two layer method on blood agar base bab plates using the host strains s typhimurium wg49 atcc 700730 and e coli atcc 1370 for the enumeration of bacteriophages ms2 and φx174 respectively 37 0 5 c 16 1 h the bacteria were analysed on days 1 4 7 and 14 and the bacteriophages on days 1 4 8 and 15 for the controls liquid the non detection limit was 10 colony forming units cfu per ml for bacteria and 1 plaque forming unit pfu per ml for bacteriophages the cold storage treatment had a one log10 higher non detection limit as the samples were solid and needed to be diluted in

with α 0 05 3 results 3 1 ascaris inactivation at 20 c simulating faecal contamination of the urine resulted in approximately 345 ascaris eggs per gram dehydration medium 43 initial moisture content all a suum eggs in the cold storage of 20 c ph 10 5 were non viable on the last sampling day 346 3 log10 the detection limit fig 2 the pre check at sampling prior to incubation showed that in the cold storage the eggs had started to develop after 46 days and after 74 days 7 of them 9 out of 124 eggs had developed to the larval stage at the last sampling of the cold storage day 346 9 97 out of 1090 of the eggs had developed into larvae during treatment but had then died visual defects however lower numbers of eggs were recovered from the cold storage at the last sampling with 1538 eggs versus 3000 5000 eggs typically fitting the inactivation model eqs 2 and 3 to the egg viability data of the cold storage treatment gave a lag phase of 72 days and time for a 3 log10 reduction of 325 days table 2 from the weight change it was assessed that the moisture content decreased from initial 43 1 by day 102 during that time the average ambient temperature was 20 2 c min max 19 9 20 4 c and the average relative air humidity was 53 min max 32 93 the urine was kept in a sealed at 20 c and had a potential concentration of 138 mm of nh3 pitzer no viable eggs were observed at day 88 1 larva per 1000 eggs counted the fitted regression gave a 17 day lag phase table 2 the ph control of 10 5 did not have a stable ph and needed to be increased back up to 10 5 periodically with glycine naoh buffer solution the a suum egg in the ph control 10 5 started to show inactivation after 102 days and at day 346 the viability was 0 1 for the 20 c temperature control ph 7 2 the data are not shown as the tubes had mould growing in them by day 100 which affected the a suum eggs a viability check of the temperature control at days 28 and 57 showed no inactivation at 42 c a suum eggs during the heated storage had a short lag phase of 1 4 days and a 2 log10 inactivation was reached on day 9 fig 2 the last sample was extracted on day 14 but the data are not shown as most of the eggs had disintegrated of the 426 eggs found out of 2500 initially added in the heated storage treatment and counted during the extraction six developed into larvae during incubation the temperature control ph 7 2 sealed had a lag phase of 4 days followed by 3 log10 inactivation detection limit after 6 days after 14 days data not shown a sufficient number of eggs 1000 eggs were extracted with no disintegration

controls including the urine no inactivation of e faecalis was observed for 14 days s typhimurium was inactivated most quickly in the cold storage with a 6 log10 reduction after day 1 and not detectable by day 2 fig 3b for s typhimurium the sampling of the cold storage was at too low a frequency to have sufficient data points to derive the standard error se of the reduction rate in the ph control 10 5 reduction of s typhimurium deviated from first order kinetics with a rapid reduction 6 log10 reduction in the first three days followed by a breakpoint after which no reduction took place during the remaining 11 days of observation the ph of the ph control remained stable at 10 5 throughout the study by day 14 the urine control with a calculated nh3 concentration of 40 mm had only a 1 33 log10 reduction of s typhimurium 3 3 virus inactivation the ms2 phage was below the detection limit by day 4 during the cold storage with a 7 7 log10 reduction fig 3c in urine control and the ph control 10 5 the ms 2 phage was reduced 6 log10 at day 6 and 8 respectively and were for both controls below the detection limit on day 14 the ϕx174 phage was reduced by 5 3 log10 at day 3 reaching the detection limit in the cold storage treatment fig 3d whereas in none of the controls any significant inactivation was observed during the 14 days studied table 3 4 discussion 4 1 ascaris of the studied treatment factors storage temperature urine and ph the elevated temperature of 42 c affected ascaris the most resulting in a 3 log10 reduction in egg viability in 9 2 and 6 2 days for the heated storage and the temperature control respectively however after 14 days data not shown the heated storage treatment had nine out of 436 eggs found developed into larvae 2 the unaccounted for 2074 eggs may have collapsed due to water loss during the treatment at the elevated temperature 42 c and low relative humidity in the air 20 wharton 1979 and may then have been destroyed during the extraction in the temperature control at 42 c the majority of eggs were recovered according to estimated initial start concentration pecson et al 2007 reported similar inactivation of ascaris eggs in ph 7 buffer kept at 40 c which took 12 days for a 2 log10 reduction while koné et al 2007 found that after 40 days of composting of faecal sludge at 45 c the viability of a suum had only decreased from 58 to 20 factors such as temperature distribution particle size and organic matter content could be the reasons for the slow inactivation in the material studied by koné et al 2007 a small difference in temperature can have a great impact especially at such high temperatures nordin et al 2013 at room temperature 20 c the time for inactivation was slow both in the cold storage treatment 3 log10 in 325 days as well as in the 10 5 ph control 3 log10 in 166 days confirming a suum s resistance to high ph capizzi banas et al 2004 as well as to low moisture content wharton 1979 by day 46 the moisture content had decreased to 10 in the cold storage treatment yet several eggs 31 had started to develop into larvae within the treatment the cold storage treatment regression model estimates that 325 days are required for a 3 log10 reduction compared to 166 days in the ph 10 5 control this difference of inactivation rates may be due to that in the cold storage treatment 10 moisture the stress from the elevated ph would have had less of an impact on a suum eggs compared to the ph control which was a liquid even in liquids with elevated ph a suum eggs are very resilient in a ph 12 buffer solution at 20 c with no nh3 pecson et al 2007 estimated that 230 days was required for a 2 log10 reduction of a suum eggs i e slower than in the ph control of 10 5 in the present study fig 1 the low sampling frequency towards the end of this experiment gave some uncertainty to the derivation of inactivation kinetics thus the estimated inactivation time table 2 for the ph 10 5 control may be underestimated whereas the cold storage treatment may be overestimated as the moisture content in the saturated ash decreased during treatment from 43 to 1 the eggs would eventually start to desiccate fig 1 which would impair development and cause the egg to collapse due to water loss wharton 1979 a suum are resilient in extreme environments as the eggs shells are impermeable to liquid water wharton 1979 however the shells are not impermeable to water vapour and other gases such as oxygen wharton 1979 and nh3 can penetrate the shell which can kill the egg nordin et al 2009 any nh3 that may have been formed during the cold storage treatment would have volatilised into the atmosphere as the tubes were stored in the open however we expect very little loss based on previous experiments senecal and vinnerås 2017 whereas in the urine control the nh3 formed was retained at the most 138 mm which explains the 90 days for 3 log10 inactivation in the urine control and confirms that it is the nh3 that is the inactivating factor in urine the inactivation in stored urine was slower compared to other studies where the urine had been hydrolysed prior to the start of the treatment nordin et al 2009 the current study differs from most other urine studies by starting with fresh urine meaning that the urea had not yet hydrolysed in to nh3 resulting in a lag in the inactivation as observed in the current study the estimated time for a 3 log10 reduction during cold storage at 20 c of 325 days may be shortened with increased temperature as wharton 1979 showed that the water loss rate from the egg increased exponentially with the increase in temperature the time required for a 3 log10 reduction might also be considerably shortened by storing the saturated ash in sealed bags so that any nh3 formed would be contained in the material the effect of such sealed storage treatment needs to be verified but from previous studies of storing the saturated ash in sealed containers it is known that nh3 forms over time senecal and vinnerås 2017 and could inactivate the a suum eggs nordin et al 2009 4 2 bacteria and phages bacteria and phages which only were studied at 20 c were inactivated faster in the cold storage treatment compared to the ph and urine controls in the temperature control no significant inactivation was observed for any of the studied organisms whereas the effect of the other controls varied between the organisms table 3 s typhimurium was most sensitive compared to the organisms studied with significant inactivation during the cold storage and controls except the temperature control during cold storage s typhimurium inactivation rate 6 19 d 1 was three times faster than that of e faecalis 1 89 d 1 s typhimurium had a 6 log10 reduction in 15 days in the ph control highlighting its sensitivity to ph e faecalis only showed significant inactivation in the cold storage treatment and this high resistance to treatment conditions elevated ph and nh3 concentration is why e faecalis makes for a conservative indicator organism however the inactivation rate of e faecalis in the cold storage treatment 1 89 log10 cfu d 1 was faster when compared to studies with higher ph and or higher nh3 concentrations with the main difference being that the other studies had a higher moisture content nyberg et al 2011 magri et al 2013 ottoson et al 2008 inactivation of e faecalis during the cold storage was probably due to the combination of high concentration of ions and desiccation the ec1 5 of the saturated ash of 35 ds m 1 was well above the tolerance of 10 ds m 1 for soil bacteria rousk et al 2011 specific tolerance values were not found for enteric pathogenic bacteria the ionic strength of the saturated ash 0 55 m based on a study of thompson and yates 1999 could have some effect on ms2 but no effect assumed on ϕx174 as ϕx174 was not affected by the nh3 in the urine or the ionic strength in the cold storage treatment the low moisture content 30 was likely the main driving factor for inactivation as observed by others decrey et al 2011 the ϕx174 phage showed a similar pattern of sensitivity as e faecalis which has also been observed in another study vinnerås et al 2008 a lag period in the inactivation in all organisms assessed including a suum was to be expected from the fact that the urine used was unhydrolysed at the start of the trial in the urine control the nh3 concentration was low at the most 40 mm due to the ph of 8 8 5 which was lower compared to other studies where the urine was hydrolysed before the start of the experiment and already had reached a ph 9 vinnerås et al 2008 nordin et al 2009 the ph level is significant as the higher the ph the higher the nh3 concentration n h 3 h n h 4 pk a 9 25 for e faecalis the inactivation in the urine control was similar to in another study with similar concentrations of nh3 40 mm a 1 log10 reduction took at least 14 days fidjeland et al 2013 for s typhimurium the inactivation was in contrast to other data which found that with similar concentrations of nh3 34 50 mm over a span of temperatures 14 24 c a decimal reduction only took between 1 3 and 3 days fidjeland et al 2013 vinnerås et al 2008 at 24 c vinnerås 2008 found that a concentration of 40 mm was the threshold for bacteria and bacteriophages except for s typhimurium which has a threshold of only 5 mm park and diez gonzalez 2003 with such a low threshold to nh3 s typhimurium should have been inactivated in the stored urine but potentially the high organic load from the faeces added may have resulted in zones with more favourable conditions in vinnerås 2008 the ph of the stored urine was 9 0 at 24 c such a difference in ph would have changed the amount of nh3 in the system in the present study from 40 mm to 138 mm at such a high concentration of nh3 inactivation of e faecalis occurred within two days vinnerås et al 2008 compared to liquid urine the alkaline dehydration of urine seems to be a very quick method for inactivating bacterial contaminants safely reducing them within 4 days from the last urine addition the ms2 phage was more sensitive k 1 02 log10 pfu day 1 to the nh3 in the urine control than the ϕx174 phage k 0 03 log10 pfu days 1 this result contradicts other studies that have found both ms2 and ϕx174 withstanding much higher concentrations of nh3 193 mm compared to 40 mm in the present experiment with a t90 of 22 24 days magri et al 2015 compared to 1 day for ms2 in this study this difference could potentially be due to the use of emerson to pitzer conversion model in the present study which is a conservative estimation of the concentration of uncharged nh3 4 3 urine diversion and dehydration as a treatment to comply with re use guidelines such as from who 2006 that suggests a specific log10 reduction by excreta treatment for helmuths urine diversion is actually an effective treatment in its own right with a high value of 735 eggs g 1 ts found in faecal sludge jiménez 2006 a daily excretion of 200 g of faeces and 1 5 l of urine vinnerås et al 2006 and an average cross contamination of 9 1 mg of faeces l 1 of urine schönning et al 2002 there is already a 5 2 log10 reduction about 1 egg l 1 or 0 001 eggs g 1 just from diverting the faeces away in the present system where 1 5 l of urine is concentrated into 30 g of ash the final concentration of eggs would be 0 05 g 1 ash or an overall log10 reduction of 3 5 this would meet the who 2006 and usepa 1994 standards for ascaris without any further sanitising treatment being required bacteria and viruses would also be reduced by 3 5 log10 in the urine diversion alkaline dehydration system but depending on their initial concentration this may not be sufficient to meet the who 2006 and usepa 1994 guideline of 1000 e coli or faecal coliforms per g of ts the saturated ash may be collected still wet after the last user if there is no time for dehydration before changing the dehydration media and a final dehydration step outside of the toilet to ensure a ts 90 would be ideal such as during the four days of storage storing the saturated ash open to the air is simpler than six months of storage in a sealed container the recommendation for stored liquid urine if the saturated ash is stockpiled open to the air for an extended period of time the ph might start to decrease however the change would be slow as seen by senecal and vinnerås 2017 where after 97 days with ventilation at 35 c the ph in saturated ash was still above 10 one advantage of using high ph for inhibiting urease activity is the long term effect the remaining elevated ph would continue to inhibit contamination or regrowth of bacteria including the inhibition of urease producing bacteria nyberg et al 2011 other treatments such as oxidation may have good initial inhibition however there is no lasting protection against regrowth of urease producing bacteria or pathogens bacteria and bacteriophage inactivation rates support previous work which has also seen inactivation of indicator bacteria nyberg et al 2011 and viruses decrey et al 2016 in alkaline media after only four days of storage at 20 c the indicator bacteria and viruses in the saturated ash reached a 6 log10 reduction with the dilution factor of separating the urine from the faeces and the concentrating factor from dehydrating the urine a further 3 5 log10 reduction could be included this treatment would be more than sufficient to meet the who guidelines 2006 5 conclusions dehydrating urine in an alkaline medium inactivated both bacteria and viruses after just four days of storage at 20 c providing a safe end product for a suum the use of a urine diverting toilet alone can be a sufficient treatment in its own right as excluding the faeces from the reuse fraction gives a 5 2 log10 lower pathogen concentration compared to when including the faeces even with the concentration from dehydrating the urine in the ash the end product would have a 3 5 log10 reduction meeting who and usepa guidelines as bacteria and viruses are excreted in greater numbers further treatment after urine diversion would be required the saturated ash was a hostile environment for the bacteria and bacteriophages which were below the detection limit ash solid 100 cfu ml 1 for bacteria and 10 pfu ml 1 for bacteriophages within four days using the alkaline dehydration system enabled concentration of the nutrients in urine eliminated the liquid making it easier as it can be bagged and is lighter to transport and resulted in a dry end product that would be safe for use as a fertiliser after just four days of storage acknowledgements this study received funding from the swedish research council

19381,over four billion people are discharging untreated human excreta into the environment without any prior treatment causing eutrophication and spreading disease the most nutrient rich fraction is the urine urine can be collected separately and dehydrated in an alkaline bed producing a nutrient rich fertiliser however faecal cross contamination during the collection risks to introduce pathogens to the urine the objective of this hygiene assessment was to study the inactivation of five microorganisms ascaris suum enterococcus faecalis bacteriophages ms2 and φx 174 and salmonella spp in alkaline dehydrated urine fresh human urine was dehydrated in wood ash at 42 c until the ph decreased to 10 5 at which point the saturated ash was inoculated with faeces containing the microorganisms and left open to the air mimicking stockpiling of the end product at temperatures of 20 and 42 c the bacteria and bacteriophages were inactivated to below the detection limit 100 cfu ml 1 for bacteria 10 pfu ml 1 for bacteriophages within four days storage at 20 c a suum inactivation data was fitted to a non linear regression model which estimated a required 325 days of storage at 20 c and 9 2 days at 42 c to reach a 3 log10 reduction however the urine dehydration in itself achieved a concentration 1 a suum per 4 g of dehydrated medium which fulfil the who guidelines for unrestricted use keywords alkaline treatment sanitation fertiliser pathogen urine diversion urine concentration volume reduction 1 introduction human excreta are poorly managed on a global scale in 2015 the number of people lacking access to basic sanitation was estimated at 2 3 billion however the issue is even more serious with the excreta of an estimated 4 5 billion people being discharged into the environment without any treatment who and unicef 2017 discharging untreated excreta harms the environment by causing eutrophication because human excreta contains plant nutrients smil 2002 spångberg et al 2014 steffen et al 2015 and harms people especially children by spreading disease who 2006 this issue will not be addressed simply by building more toilets there is a need for safe toilets that protect the user as well as a system for safely removing transporting and processing the excreta opel 2012 the characteristics and content of urine and faeces differ greatly with the most pertinent difference being from a managerial point of view that urine contains most of the plant nutrients excreted while faeces contain the majority if not all of the pathogens excreted höglund et al 2000 separate collection of the two fractions means that they can be managed according to their individual composition urine as a plant nutrient resource and faeces as a potential pathogen containing fraction using urine as a liquid fertiliser poses a logistical challenge since approximately 550 kg yr 1 person 1 is produced vinnerås et al 2006 which requires either a large storage tank or frequent emptying to a central storage as fertilisers are not applied more often than twice per growing season with the objective of minimising the volume of urine several treatments to concentrate or extract the nutrients in the urine have been studied maurer et al 2006 since urea is rapidly hydrolysed degraded into nh3 and carbonates already during collection of urine in urine diverting systems udert et al 2003 most studies have focused on recovery from or concentration of hydrolysed urine methods for concentrating urine retaining all nutrients include reverse osmosis forward osmosis or membrane distillation partial nitrification followed by distillation acidification followed by dehydration antonini et al 2012 maurer et al 2006 the recovery of part of nutrients has also been achieved such as ammonia nh3 by air stripping antonini et al 2012 phosphorus with some n via struvite precipitation pradhan et al 2017 udert et al 2015 or n as nh4 by adsorption on cation exchangers kavvada et al 2017 tarpeh et al 2017 if the hydrolysis of urea is prevented urine can be dehydrated with minimal loss of nitrogen retaining also most of other macro and micro nutrients and thus produce a complete fertiliser with a balance reflecting the plant nutrient requirements of the crops winker et al 2009 randall and naidoo 2018 highly acidic or alkaline conditions natural or chemical inhibitors as well as temperature and electrolysis can be used for stopping the hydrolysis randall et al 2016 in soils containing clay lime is often used to increase the ph of the soil to increase the availability of p and alkalinisation of urine to prevent urea hydrolysis seems to be a promising route for urine concentration combining the blocking of hydrolysis and improving the plant nutrient availability simha et al 2018 senecal and vinnerås 2017 and dutta and vinnerås 2016 have developed an approach that retains npk by using unhydrolised urine by this approach the urine is first alkalinised to prevent urea hydrolysis so that the urine can be dehydrated with minimal loss of nitrogen the alkalisation can be performed with chemicals such as lime randall et al 2016 or with alkaline waste products such as wood ash senecal and vinnerås 2017 the concept behind the system is that urine would be dehydrated within the toilet reducing the mass by 90 once the ph of the medium has decreased from 11 5 to 10 5 mainly due to the capture of co2 from the air it would be replaced with fresh dehydration medium by placing the dehydration unit inside the bathroom no extra piping would be required except for connecting the drying unit to the ventilation the dried urine concentrated ten times can be bagged and collected as a solid to a central fertilisation production unit simha et al 2017 existing toilets dry or flush could be retrofitted with such a system and thus simplify the logistics of handling the urine as the system would not require a tank extra plumbing or additional sewer connection for the urine just good ventilation the capital costs of implementation may be minimal and the system could be installed virtually anywhere urine inside the bladder of a healthy person is typically pathogen free willey et al 2009 however during excretion of urine in urine diverting toilets cross contamination from faeces occurs höglund et al 2000 and bacteria can grow in the biofilm inside the pipes as faeces may contain pathogenic viruses bacteria protozoa and helminths who 2006 this risk needs to be considered diseases that can be emitted via the urine are considered a limited risk in temperate countries but should be considered in tropical climates however the main risk is still from the faecal cross contamination who 2006 in the who 2006 guidelines the recommended target log10 reduction of indicator pathogens for source separated urine is 4 5 units who 2006 this paper assessed the hygienic health risks involved in using the urine dehydration end product based on simha et al 2018 process by studying the fate of the pathogens in the material after the dehydration process is complete the experiment was set up to simulate that the last person using the toilet before the dehydration medium is changed is contaminating the medium with misplaced faeces with no time for dehydration of the urine i e a worst case scenario hence the aim was to understand the potential inactivation in the saturated medium after this last user and the effect of storing the alkaline dehydration media wood ash and not the effect of the urine dehydration process in the present study the inactivation of five microorganisms three indicators enterococcus faecalis ms2 bacteriophage and φx 174 bacteriophage and two pathogens ascaris suum and salmonella spp was assessed in medium that had already been used to dehydrate urine 2 methodology 2 1 preparation of the saturated ash wood ash was prepared as described in simha et al 2018 briefly fresh human urine from approximately 10 men and women 22 65 years was collected in sterile 1 l polypropylene containers through out the study for each drying run urine from at least three persons was pooled after storage at 4 c for at the most 2 days before each use the urine composition is presented in detail in simha et al 2018 the ph of the urine was increased from 7 to 10 2 0 5 with amberlite ira410 type 2 resin merck chemicals gmbh darmstadt germany

ash every 12 h day and night until the ph of the ash decreased to 10 5 at which point the medium was considered not suitable for further drying as at a lower ph an increased risk noted as saturated below a total of 1600 ml of urine was added to 175 g ash the microorganisms to be studied were added together with faeces reaching a concentration of bacteria corresponding to 6 log10 cfu g 1 a phage concentration of 8 log10 pfu g 1 and 160 ascaris suum eggs g 1 the addition of the microorganisms together with faeces was to mimic the environmental contamination of urine with faecal cross contamination additionally in other studies by the authors we have observed that organic material provides a protective environment for microorganisms under hard conditions data not published 2 2

studied by inoculating already saturated ash see section 2 1 and monitoring the organisms concentration during storage to isolate the effect of temperature ph and ammonia on the microorganisms four controls were used table 1 temperature 20 and 42 c ph 10 5 and fresh urine further described below of the organisms studied three were indicators enterococcus faecalis atcc 29212 ms2 bacteriophage atcc15597 b1 and φx 174 bacteriophage atcc13706 b1 and two were pathogens ascaris suum and salmonella enterica subspecies enterica serovar typhimurium from here on referred to as s typhimurium bacteria and bacteriophages were sampled at different intervals to that of the a suum eggs and thus were prepared in separate containers 2 4 1 ascaris a suum eggs were retrieved by sieving swine faeces excelsior sentinel inc usa and were stored at 4 c in a diluted formalin solution during transportation and storage prior to use at the start of the experiment a sample of the a suum eggs n 100 was observed under a microscope to confirm that they were undeveloped and the initial viability was determined by incubating three sets of the eggs at 28 c in 0 1 n h2so2 for 28 days to allow larval development arene 1986 all viability counts were performed under the microscope x 10 and x 20 magnification unfertilised eggs identified by their incomplete shells were excluded from further counting eggs developing to the larval stage were considered viable while pre larval stages were not initial viability of the a suum eggs was 55 ci95 50 61 fresh faeces were collected from two people and stored in a freezer 18 c and then thawed overnight at 4 c five grams of faeces were inoculated with 2 ml of a suum egg solution 100 000 eggs ml 1 and blended for one minute by hand in a bag the inactivation of a suum during storage in saturated ash 43 initial moisture content was assessed at two temperatures 20 cold storage and 42 c heated storage to prepare the saturated ash for both the cold and heated storage 10 ml of fresh urine was mixed with 0 1 g 0 02 g of the inoculated faeces in a 50 ml centrifuge tube and shaken by hand for 5 s thereafter 25 ml of saturated ash was added without further mixing simulating the final urine loading with faecal contamination tubes were left open to the air no lid at 20 c number of replicates n 27 or at 42 c n 5 during the study the tubes were left open to simulate storing saturated ash collected from households in a stockpile until use as a fertiliser the evaporation rate was monitored throughout the study by weighing the tubes regularly and used to assess the change in moisture content to isolate the effects of temperature and ph and from the urine itself three solutions were prepared table 1 inoculated faeces 0 1 g was mixed with 5 ml of either m 15 phosphate buffer solution ph 7 2 as the temperature controls glycine naoh buffer solution ph 10 5 as the ph control or freshly collected not yet hydrolysed urine as the urine control the faeces and solutions were mixed in 7 ml tubes which after initial shaking for 5 s were left sealed at the respective temperature at 42 c only the temperature control n 5 ph 7 2 was studied whereas at 20 c the full set of controls were studied temperature control n 5 ph control 10 5 n 8 and urine control n 5 the ph in the ph controls was monitored throughout the experiment and was if necessary adjusted to the initial value with glycine naoh buffer solution in total 100 μl of 0 032 m naoh was added this corresponds to less than 1 of the solutions and should therefore not have a significant impact on the urine ion distribution destructive sampling of singlets was undertaken to enable frequent sampling the treatments at 20 c were sampled every third or fourth day for the first 50 days then every seven days until day 74 with two final samplings on days 102 and 346 at 42 c the treatment was sampled daily from day 1 6 and then lastly on day 9 the extraction procedure for the a suum eggs was a modification of the usepa 2003 method to extract the eggs from the solid saturated ash from the both the cold and heated storage treatments approximately 40 ml nacl 0 9 w v peptone water with the surfactant tween ph 7 henceforth called nacl solution was added to the tubes and shaken by hand for 30 s the material in the tubes was left to settle for 10 min and the liquid decanted over tyler sieves 38 μm cat no l3 400 and 300 μm cat no l3 50 magnesium sulfate mgso4 specific gravity 1 20 was added approx 30 ml to the remaining precipitate shaken by hand for 30 s and then centrifuged for 3 min at 4000 rpm to float the a suum to the top the supernatant was decanted over the sieves and the mgso4 washing repeated a total of three times to wash the a suum eggs from the filters nacl solution was used 40 50 ml the a suum eggs were then concentrated by centrifuging the washing solution for 3 min at 4000 rpm decanting the supernatant and adding 5 ml of 0 1 n h2so4 to the remaining nugget after extraction of the eggs a pre incubation check was performed on a subsample of 100 eggs was observed under the microscope to assess the condition of the eggs directly after extraction the remaining eggs were incubated at 28 c in 0 1 n h2so4 for 28 days to enhance larval development to estimate the time for a 3 log10 reduction the a suum egg viability data were logarithmized and fitted against a non linear inactivation model eq 8 from harm 1980 which enables the lag phase and inactivation phase to be determined in the same equation log10 n is the logged egg viability at time 0 and time t in days the parameter determining lag phase duration n and the inactivation rate k were determined by fitting the model to the data by non linear regression using the

bacteria and viruses the bacteria s typhimurium and e faecalis were cultivated in nutrient broth at 37 c on a shaker table approx 200 rpm for 24 h after incubation the solution was centrifuged at 2000 rpm for 15 min and enumeration confirmed a concentration of 6 log10 bacteria ml 1 in the nugget the bacteriophages were propagated according to standard iso10705 1 1995 using hosts strain s typhimurium wg49 nctc12484 and escherichia coli atcc13706 for the propagation of bacteriophages ms2 and φx174 respectively the host strains were propagated at 37 c for 1 5 h on a shaker table approx 200 rpm the bacteriophages were then propagated by added them to the respective host bacteria broth and incubated at 37 c for 24 h on a shaker table the final solutions with the bacteriophages were centrifuged at 2000 rpm for 15 min and filtered through 0 45 μm microfilters removing bacterial debris and reach an end concentration of 8 log10 ml 1 a stock solution of all four microorganisms was prepared by mixing together 100 ml of each of the solutions s typhimurium e faecalis ms2 bacteriophage and φx bacteriophage on a magnetic stir table for ten minutes faeces 0 1 g and microbial stock solution 5 ml were added to 50 ml containers ø 4 cm for the treatments n 21 5 g of saturated ash was added and containers left open to the air at 20 c without further mixing for the temperature n 21

plates 37 0 5 c 24 1 h for detection of s typhimurium and e faecalis respectively the bacteriophages were sampled by serial diluting 1 g of material with nacl solution filtering the dilute 0 45 μm and plating using the two layer method on blood agar base bab plates using the host strains s typhimurium wg49 atcc 700730 and e coli atcc 1370 for the enumeration of bacteriophages ms2 and φx174 respectively 37 0 5 c 16 1 h the bacteria were analysed on days 1 4 7 and 14 and the bacteriophages on days 1 4 8 and 15 for the controls liquid the non detection limit was 10 colony forming units cfu

solution the a suum egg in the ph control 10 5 started to show inactivation after 102 days and at day 346 the viability was 0 1 for the 20 c temperature control ph 7 2 the data are not shown as the tubes had mould growing in them by day 100 which affected the a suum eggs a viability check of the temperature control at days 28 and 57 showed no inactivation at 42 c a suum eggs during the heated storage had a short lag phase of 1 4 days and a 2 log10 inactivation was reached on day 9 fig 2 the last sample was extracted on day 14 but the data are not shown as most of the eggs had disintegrated

controls including the urine no inactivation of e faecalis was observed for 14 days s typhimurium was inactivated most quickly in the cold storage with a 6 log10 reduction after day 1 and not detectable by day 2 fig 3b for s typhimurium the sampling of the cold storage was at too low a frequency to have sufficient data points to derive the standard error se of the reduction rate in the ph control 10 5 reduction of s typhimurium deviated from first order kinetics with a rapid reduction 6 log10 reduction in the first three days followed by a breakpoint after which no reduction took place during the remaining 11 days of observation the ph of the ph control remained stable at 10 5 throughout the study by day 14 the urine control with a calculated nh3 concentration of 40 mm had only a 1

the detection limit in the cold storage treatment fig 3d whereas in none of the controls any significant inactivation was observed during the 14 days studied table 3 4 discussion 4 1 ascaris of the studied treatment factors storage temperature urine and ph the elevated temperature of 42 c affected ascaris the most resulting in a 3 log10 reduction in egg viability in 9 2 and 6 2 days for the heated storage and the temperature control respectively however after 14 days data not shown the heated storage treatment had nine out of 436 eggs found developed into larvae 2 the unaccounted for 2074 eggs may have collapsed due to water loss during the treatment at the elevated temperature 42 c and low relative humidity in the air 20 wharton 1979 and may then have been destroyed during the extraction in the temperature control at 42 c the majority of eggs were recovered according to estimated initial start concentration pecson et al 2007 reported similar inactivation of ascaris eggs in ph 7 buffer kept at 40 c which took 12 days for a 2 log10 reduction while koné et al 2007 found that after 40 days of composting of faecal sludge at 45 c the viability of a suum had only decreased from 58 to 20 factors such as temperature distribution particle size and organic matter content could be the reasons for the slow inactivation in the material studied by koné et al 2007 a small difference in temperature can have a great impact especially at such high temperatures nordin et al 2013 at room temperature 20 c the time for inactivation was slow both in the cold storage treatment 3 log10 in 325 days as well as in the 10 5 ph control 3 log10 in 166 days confirming a suum s resistance to high ph capizzi banas et al 2004 as well as to low moisture content wharton 1979 by day 46 the moisture content had decreased to 10 in the cold storage treatment yet several eggs 31 had started to develop into larvae within the treatment the cold storage treatment regression model estimates that 325 days are required for a 3 log10 reduction compared to 166 days in the ph 10 5 control this difference of inactivation rates may be due to that in the cold storage treatment 10 moisture the stress from the elevated ph would have had less of an impact on a suum eggs compared to the ph control which was a liquid even in liquids with elevated ph a suum eggs are very resilient in a ph 12 buffer solution at 20 c with no nh3 pecson et al 2007 estimated that 230 days was required for a 2 log10 reduction of a suum eggs i e slower than in the ph control of 10 5 in the present study fig 1 the low sampling frequency towards the end of this experiment gave some uncertainty to the derivation of inactivation kinetics thus the estimated inactivation time table 2 for the ph 10 5 control may be underestimated whereas the cold storage treatment may be overestimated as the moisture content in the saturated ash decreased during treatment from 43 to 1 the eggs would eventually start to desiccate fig 1 which would impair development and cause the egg to collapse due to water loss wharton 1979 a suum are resilient in extreme environments as the eggs shells are impermeable to liquid water wharton 1979 however the shells are not impermeable to water vapour and other gases such as oxygen wharton 1979 and nh3 can penetrate the shell which can kill the egg nordin et al 2009 any nh3 that may have been formed during the cold storage treatment would have volatilised into the atmosphere as the tubes were stored in the open however we expect very little loss based on previous experiments senecal and vinnerås 2017 whereas in the urine control the nh3 formed was retained at the most 138 mm which explains the 90 days for 3 log10 inactivation in the urine control and confirms that it is the nh3 that is the inactivating factor in urine the inactivation in stored urine was slower compared to other studies where the urine had been hydrolysed prior to the start of the treatment nordin et al 2009 the current study differs from most other urine studies by starting with fresh urine meaning that the urea had not yet hydrolysed in to nh3 resulting in a lag in the inactivation as observed in the current study the estimated time for a 3 log10 reduction during cold storage at 20 c of 325 days may be shortened with increased temperature as wharton 1979 showed that the water loss rate from the egg increased exponentially with the increase in temperature the time required for a 3 log10 reduction might also be considerably shortened by storing the saturated ash in sealed bags so that any nh3 formed would be contained in the material the effect of such sealed storage treatment needs to be verified but from previous studies of storing the saturated ash in sealed containers it is known that nh3 forms over time senecal and vinnerås 2017 and could inactivate the a suum eggs nordin et al 2009 4 2 bacteria and phages bacteria and phages which only were studied at 20 c were inactivated faster in the cold storage treatment compared to the ph and urine controls in the temperature control no significant inactivation was observed for any of the studied organisms whereas the effect of the other controls varied between the organisms table 3 s typhimurium was most sensitive compared to the organisms studied with significant inactivation during the cold storage and controls except the temperature control during cold storage s typhimurium inactivation rate 6 19 d 1 was three times faster than that of e faecalis 1 89 d 1 s typhimurium had a 6 log10 reduction in 15 days in the ph control highlighting its sensitivity to ph e faecalis only showed significant inactivation in the cold storage treatment and this high resistance to treatment conditions elevated ph and nh3 concentration is why e faecalis makes for a conservative indicator organism however the inactivation rate of e faecalis in the cold storage treatment 1 89 log10 cfu d 1 was faster when compared to studies with higher ph and or higher nh3 concentrations with the main difference being that the other studies had a higher moisture content nyberg et al 2011 magri et al 2013 ottoson et al 2008 inactivation of e faecalis during the cold storage was probably due to the combination of high concentration of ions and desiccation the ec1 5 of the saturated ash of 35 ds m 1 was well above the tolerance of 10 ds m 1 for soil bacteria rousk et al 2011 specific tolerance values were not found for enteric pathogenic bacteria the ionic strength of the saturated ash 0 55 m based on a study of thompson and yates 1999 could have some effect on ms2 but no effect assumed on ϕx174 as ϕx174 was not affected by the nh3 in the urine or the ionic strength in the cold storage treatment the low moisture content 30 was likely the main driving factor for inactivation as observed by others decrey et al 2011 the ϕx174 phage showed a similar pattern of sensitivity as e faecalis which has also been observed in another study vinnerås et al 2008 a lag period in the inactivation in all organisms assessed including a suum was to be expected from the fact that the urine used was unhydrolysed at the start of the trial in the urine control the nh3 concentration was low at the most 40 mm due to the ph of 8 8 5 which was lower compared to other studies where the urine was hydrolysed before the start of the experiment and already had reached a ph 9 vinnerås et al 2008 nordin et al 2009 the ph level is significant as the higher the ph the higher the nh3 concentration n h 3 h n h 4 pk a 9 25 for e faecalis the inactivation in the urine control was similar to in another study with similar concentrations of nh3 40 mm a 1 log10 reduction took at least 14 days fidjeland et al 2013 for s typhimurium the inactivation was in contrast to other data which found that with similar concentrations of nh3 34 50 mm over a span of temperatures 14 24 c a decimal reduction only took between 1 3 and 3 days fidjeland et al 2013 vinnerås et al 2008 at 24 c vinnerås 2008 found that a concentration of 40 mm was the threshold for bacteria and bacteriophages except for s typhimurium which has a threshold of only 5 mm park and diez gonzalez 2003 with such a low threshold to nh3 s typhimurium should have been inactivated in the stored urine but potentially the high organic load from the faeces added may have resulted in zones with more favourable conditions in vinnerås 2008 the ph of the stored urine was 9 0 at 24 c such a difference in ph would have changed the amount of nh3 in the system in the present study from 40 mm to 138 mm at such a high concentration of nh3 inactivation of e faecalis occurred within two days vinnerås et al 2008 compared to liquid urine the alkaline dehydration of urine seems to be a very quick method for inactivating bacterial contaminants safely reducing them within 4 days from the last urine addition the ms2 phage was more sensitive k 1 02 log10 pfu day 1 to the nh3 in the urine control than the ϕx174 phage k 0 03 log10 pfu days 1 this result contradicts other studies that have found both ms2 and ϕx174 withstanding much higher concentrations of nh3 193 mm compared to 40 mm in the present experiment with a t90 of 22 24 days magri et al 2015 compared to 1 day for ms2 in this study this difference could potentially be due to the use of emerson to pitzer conversion model in the present study which is a conservative estimation of the concentration of uncharged nh3 4 3 urine diversion and dehydration as a treatment to comply with re use guidelines such as from who 2006 that suggests a specific log10 reduction by excreta treatment for helmuths urine diversion is actually an effective treatment in its own right with a high value of 735 eggs g 1 ts found in faecal sludge jiménez 2006 a daily excretion of 200 g of faeces and 1 5 l of urine vinnerås et al 2006 and an average cross contamination of 9 1 mg of faeces l 1 of urine schönning et al 2002 there is already a 5 2 log10 reduction about 1 egg l 1 or 0 001 eggs g 1 just from diverting the faeces away in the present system where 1 5 l of urine is concentrated into 30 g of ash the final concentration of eggs would be 0 05 g 1 ash or an overall log10 reduction of 3 5 this would meet the who 2006 and usepa 1994 standards for ascaris without any further sanitising treatment being required bacteria and viruses would also be reduced by 3 5 log10 in the urine diversion alkaline dehydration system but depending on their initial concentration this may not be sufficient to meet the who 2006 and usepa 1994 guideline of 1000 e coli or faecal coliforms per g of ts the saturated ash may be collected still wet after the last user if there is no time for dehydration before changing the dehydration media and a final dehydration step outside of the toilet to ensure a ts 90 would be ideal such as during the four days of storage storing the saturated ash open to the air is simpler than six months of storage in a sealed container the recommendation for stored liquid urine if the saturated ash is stockpiled open to the air for an extended period of time the ph might start to decrease however the change would be slow as seen by senecal and vinnerås 2017 where after 97 days with ventilation at 35 c the ph in saturated ash was still above 10 one advantage of using high ph for inhibiting urease activity is the long term effect the remaining elevated ph would continue to inhibit contamination or regrowth of bacteria including the inhibition of urease producing bacteria nyberg et al 2011 other treatments such as oxidation may have good initial inhibition however there is no lasting protection against regrowth of urease producing bacteria or pathogens bacteria and bacteriophage inactivation rates support previous work which has also seen inactivation of indicator bacteria nyberg et al 2011 and viruses decrey et al 2016 in alkaline media after only four days of storage at 20 c the indicator bacteria and viruses in the saturated ash reached a 6 log10 reduction with the dilution factor of separating the urine from the faeces and the concentrating factor from dehydrating the urine a further 3 5 log10 reduction could be included this treatment would be more than sufficient to meet the who guidelines 2006 5 conclusions dehydrating urine in an alkaline medium inactivated both bacteria and viruses after just four days of storage at 20 c providing a safe end product for a suum the use of a urine diverting toilet alone can be a sufficient treatment in its own right as excluding the faeces from the reuse fraction gives a 5 2 log10 lower pathogen concentration compared to when including the faeces even with the concentration from dehydrating the urine in the ash the end product would have a 3 5 log10 reduction meeting who and usepa guidelines as bacteria and viruses are excreted in greater numbers further treatment after urine diversion would be required the saturated ash was a hostile environment for the bacteria and bacteriophages which were below the detection limit ash solid 100 cfu ml 1 for bacteria and 10 pfu ml 1 for bacteriophages within four days using the alkaline dehydration system enabled concentration of the nutrients in urine eliminated the liquid making it easier as it can be bagged and is lighter to transport and resulted in a dry end product that would be safe for use as a fertiliser after just four days of storage acknowledgements this study received funding from the swedish research council

19382,toxicity arising from toxic disinfection byproducts is an unintended result of disinfection during water reclamation to ensure safe water reclamation treatment it is important to develop a disinfection strategy with minimal formation of overall toxicity in the reclaimed water the cumulative disinfectant concentration over time ct is a useful concept for pathogen control during reuse water disinfection we evaluated the toxicity impact of ct values and different methods to achieve identical ct values by ozonation or chlorination of wastewaters from four agricultural sources on mammalian cells n acetylcysteine nac reactivity of the wastewater organic extracts was determined to reveal their impact on the thiol specific biological detoxification mechanism the results demonstrated that for two sources and for both ozonation and chlorination higher ct values enhanced cytotoxicity the ozonated waters were at least 10 less toxic and as much as 22 4 times less toxic than either the non disinfected controls or the chlorinated waters chlorination consistently induced higher cytotoxicity than ozonation by between 2 2 and 22 4 fold respectively and induced similar or higher cytotoxicity than the non disinfected controls by at most 4 4 fold given the same ct values the combination of high disinfectant concentration and short contact time produced finished wastewaters with higher toxicity than the combination of low disinfectant concentration and long contact time nac thiol reactivity was positively and significantly correlated with mammalian cell cytotoxicity and agreed with 80 of the cytotoxicity rank order this suggests that the induction of cytotoxicity involved reactions with agents that acted as thiol pool quenchers the overall results indicate that the cytotoxicity of wastewaters may increase when higher ct values are applied to inactivate recalcitrant pathogens to counteract the potential increase in cytotoxicity at high ct values for both ozonation and chlorination lower disinfectant dose and longer contact time may be adopted graphical abstract image 1 keywords disinfectant exposure ct ozone chlorine wastewater thiol 1 introduction water reclamation is necessary for efficient water use world health organization 2015 worldwide 70 of the freshwater resources are used for agricultural purposes food and agriculture organization 2015 it is therefore paramount to more efficiently reuse wastewaters from agricultural sources by means of for instance onsite reuse disinfection is mandatory in this process to protect the public health due to its effectiveness and affordability chlorine is currently the most widely adopted disinfectant for wastewater disinfection metcalf and eddy inc 2013 however chlorine is practically ineffective against several important pathogens such as cryptosporidium parvum korich et al 1990 chlorine disinfection also produces a number of regulated and unregulated disinfection byproducts dbps crittenden et al 2012 richardson and postigo 2015 rook 1974 ozone is a strong disinfectant against several key pathogens such as the norwalk virus shin and sobsey 2003 and c parvum corona vasquez et al 2002 kim et al 2007 and it is being increasingly used for wastewater disinfection gottschalk et al 2010 despite its potential to form bromate a regulated dbp in bromide rich waters united states environmental protection agency 2006 all disinfection processes create dbps some of which can be toxic with the increasing application of reclaimed waters for purposes such as recreational waters and hydroponics to ensure the safety of consumers it is of great importance to determine a disinfection strategy with minimal formation of overall toxic disinfection byproducts while achieving sufficient pathogen inactivation the ct cumulative concentration of disinfectant c in mg l times time t in minutes is a concept based on the chick watson theory chick 1908 that has been widely used for the disinfection of water and wastewaters for both chlorine and ozone stover et al 1986 united states environmental protection agency 2003 it predicts the fractional inactivation of a pathogen given the cumulative concentration of disinfectant over time the ct value accounts for the disinfectant demands in different waters together with the disinfectant exposure duration to achieve a given ct value for pathogen inactivation either a higher cumulative disinfectant concentration over shorter exposure time or lower cumulative disinfectant concentration over longer exposure time may be used the ct concept for microbial inactivation allows for flexibility in disinfection design by varying the chemical dosing and the disinfectant contact time previous research investigated the options to reduce the disinfectant usage while achieving acceptable microbial inactivation and keeping toxicity low such as comparing a three step chlorine dosing vs a one step chlorine dosing strategy li et al 2017a 2017b other research investigated the effect of fixed disinfectant concentration on toxicity among varied waters smith et al 2010 yang et al 2015 however applications of the ct concept were primarily focused on microbial inactivation dong et al 2018a hunt and mariñas 1997 1999 and the ct concept in the context of disinfection mediated toxicity production is not well understood owing to the potential to generate cytotoxic genotoxic and teratogenic dbps which may have adverse effects upon the environment and the public health komaki et al 2014 plewa et al 2004 2010 2017 plewa and wagner 2015 richardson et al 2007 wagner and plewa 2017 published research established that chlorination and ozonation could alter the toxicity of reclaimed waters due to interactions between the disinfectants and the organic and inorganic water components dong et al 2016 2017a 2017b liu and zhang 2014 monarca et al 2000 however a comprehensive toxicological analysis linking the impact of varied disinfectant dose with contact time two of the most important wastewater disinfection operational parameters is lacking the objective of this research is to understand chlorination and ozonation technology for the disinfection of several sources of partially treated wastewaters concerning the toxicological response in mammalian cells to ct values and different ways to achieve the same ct value the chinese hamster ovary cells cytotoxicity assay was used for the toxicity analysis the previously developed n acetylcysteine thiol reactivity assay dong et al 2017a 2018a b was used to measure the potential impact of wastewater organic extracts on the thiol specific biological detoxification mechanism the results presented here will facilitate the disinfectant dose and contact time selection to minimize toxicity of the disinfected wastewater while ensuring pathogen inactivation as reflected by the applied ct values 2 materials and methods 2 1 wastewater sampling processing and characterization four independent sources of agricultural wastewater effluents named a b c and d were collected from two vegetable farms in illinois usa these farms employ closed loop recycling of water to reuse the nutrients and reduce cost one farm was equipped with a state of the art biological nitrogen removal system to better manage the seasonal nutrient surges another farm mainly used an ebb and flow system with sand filtration due to seasonal farming activities we were denied access to the two locations where we collected water samples a and b therefore we obtained samples from two other sources in the same farms instead designated as c and d within one week post sample collection samples were filtered through 1 6 μm glass fiber filters to minimize the interference of suspended solids and the loss of dissolved organic matter the filtrates were stored at 4 c in the dark until use several water quality parameters were measured and are summarized in table 1 the absorbance at 254 nm was measured by a beckman uv vis spectrophotometer beckman coulter life sciences indianapolis in the dissolved organic carbon doc was measured by a shimadzu toc analyzer shimadzu scientific instruments columbia md after filtering each sample through a 0 45 μm filter specific uv absorbance at 254 suva254 was calculated as the ratio of uv254 doc both the free chlorine further detailed below and ammonia nitrogen were measured using hach kits loveland co ph of the filtered wastewaters ranged from 6 13 to 7 05 at room temperature 2 2 disinfection experiments chlorination using free chlorine was compared with ozone we used eq 1 to calculate the ct value in a completely mixed batch reactor 1 ct 0 τ c l dt where c l is the concentration of dissolved disinfectant free chlorine or ozone in this study τ is the hydraulic residence time of the reactor and the integral represents the area under the curve as depicted in fig 1 up to a specific time equal to the hydraulic residence time τ of this reactor the finite middle rieman sum was used to approximate the integral eq 2 2 0 τ c l dt i 1 n c l i c l i 1 2 δt two types of chlorination experiments were carried out for each wastewater source this entails 1a achieving high or low ct values by a combination of high initial chlorine dose with long contact time or low initial chlorine dose with short contact time 2a achieving the identical ct value by a combination of high cumulative chlorine dose with short contact time or low cumulative chlorine dose with long contact time 0 τ c l dt kept identical chlorination experiments were carried out in 4 l amber glass bottles with teflon lined caps as approved by the u s epa united states environmental protection agency 2016 free chlorine was measured using the hach loveland co kit based on the u s epa n n diethyl p phenylenediamine dpd method the chlorine concentration in the stock sodium hypochlorite solution ricca chemical arlington tx was quantified spectrophotometrically at 292 nm using a molar absorptivity of 360 m 1 cm 1 hussain et al 1970 we conducted a preliminary experiment to ensure that at the end of a minimum 15 min contact time and at a cl2 to nh3 n mass ratio of at least 8 3 free chlorine was still available and more importantly for the low ct conditions in experiment 1a the free chlorine concentration was in compliance with actual farm wastewater disinfection practice raudales et al 2014 an example free chlorine concentration profile as a function of exposure time is provided in fig 1a at the end of the experiments free chlorine was quenched stoichiometrically 1 2 safety factor using analytical grade sodium bisulfite fisher scientific hampton nh two types of ozonation experiments were carried out 1b

dissolved ozone calibration curve was prepared by serial dilution of a stock ozone solution obtained by purging ozone into cold ozone demand free phosphate buffer ph 7 standardization of the ozone stock followed a molar absorptivity of 2900 m 1 cm 1 at 258 nm kilpatrick et al 1956 measurement of ozone in solution followed the indigo method as described elsewhere water environmental federation and american public health association 2005 different ozone mass transfer rates were achieved by conducting experiments with or without diffuser stones ozone solutions hull ia an example ozone exposure profile as a function of time is shown in fig 1b ozonation experiments were stopped stoichiometrically 1 2 safety factor using analytical grade sodium thiosulfate fisher scientific hampton nh after the designed ct values were achieved 2 3 sample concentration the organics from the samples were concentrated by adsorption onto clean xad resins it is important to note that despite numerous advantages this extraction method does not consider the contribution of bromate fifty five ml each of amberlite xad 2 sigma aldrich st louis mo and supelite dax 8 sigma aldrich st louis mo resins were packed above a glass wool plug in a glass chromatography column a mixture of xad 2 resin an aromatic polystyrene and xad 8 resin an acrylic ester was used to collect both aromatic and aliphatic compounds the maximum ratio of water to resins was 770 1 to maximize the adsorption of organics and minimize breakthrough ringhand et al 1987 schenck et al 1990 the samples were first acidified to ph 2 by sulfuric acid prior to being passed through the column to ensure protonation of carboxylic organics we used 400 ml of optima grade ethyl acetate fisher scientific hampton nh to elute the organics from the columns kronberg et al 1988 water in the ethyl acetate eluent was removed first using a separatory funnel followed by passing the hydrophobic fraction through a column of anhydrous sodium sulfate fisher scientific hampton nh the ethyl acetate eluent was reduced to 1 ml by a rotary evaporation unit büchi flawil switzerland at 55 c and further reduced to a point where the volume could not be reduced using a gentle stream of nitrogen it should be noted that although previous research identified that the volatile fraction of dbps are not as toxic as the semi to non volatile fractions zhu 2015 at 55 c loss and decomposition of these volatile organics may occur zhang and minear 2002 however even after these processes volatile dbps such as the trihalomethanes are present in samples jeong et al 2012 for each sample 40 μl of dimethyl sulfoxide dmso was added to dissolve the organic extract due to the presence of non negligible amount of organics that could not be blown dry we measured the total volume of 40 μl of added dmso together with the organics by means of density measurement specifically we recorded the weight of the hplc vials prior to sample addition and for each hplc vial containing the extracted organics and the added 40 μl dmso we withdrew a known volume of dmso and organic extract mixture and recorded the change in weight density of the dmso and organic extract mixture could thus be calculated and together with the weight of the dmso and organic extract mixture we were able to calculate the exact final sample volume this information was used to calculate the corresponding concentration factors in experiments compared to the original samples the dmso dissolved samples were stored in amber hplc vials in darkness at 20 c 2 4 chinese hamster ovary cho cells cho k1 cell line as52 clone 11 4 8 was used for all experiments wagner et al 1998 the cho cells were maintained in ham s f12 medium containing 5 fetal bovine serum 1 l glutamine and 1 antibiotics 0 25 μg ml amphotericin b 100 units ml sodium penicillin g and 100 μg ml streptomycin sulfate in 0 85 saline at 37 c in an incubator with a humidified atmosphere of 5 co2 2 5 cho cell chronic cytotoxicity assay the cho cell chronic cytotoxicity assay quantifies the reduction in cho cell density as a function of the concentration of samples over the course of 72 h the metric for the cytotoxicity assay was lc50 the sample concentration that induced a cell density that was 50 of the concurrent negative controls detailed description to apply the assay was published plewa and wagner 2009 wagner and plewa 2017 up to six replicate cho cell clones per concentration were conducted 2 6 n acetylcysteine nac thiol reactivity assay the in chemico nac thiol reactivity assay measures the ability of the samples to react with the biologically relevant thiols the assay was based on ellman s test ellman 1959 the more thiol reactive the samples are the less the added nac thiols remain which corresponds to less color development upon addition of ellman s reagent and can be quantified spectrophotometrically the metric for the nac thiol reactivity assay was ec50 which was the concentration factor of the sample that induced a reduction in the nac thiol concentration by 50 as compared to the concurrent negative controls details regarding this were published dong et al 2017a 2018b pals et al 2016 2 7 statistical analysis lc50 values were obtained through regression analysis for each concentration response curve similarly ec50 values were calculated through regression analyses for each concentration response curve we used tukey anova tests to compare the means of lc50 and ec50 values we used pearson s product moment correlation analysis to establish possible correlations between cytotoxicity and thiol reactivity the power of the anova test for significance was maintained at 0 8 at α 0 05 3 results and discussion different ct values as well as applying identical ct values that are achieved through either high disinfectant concentration with low contact time or low disinfectant concentration with long contact time were compared regarding the induction of cho cell cytotoxicity and thiol reactivity using ozonation and chlorination technologies 3 1 effect of different ct values on cytotoxicity ozonation vs chlorination we compared the induced mammalian cell cytotoxicity of water samples after application of high vs low ct values to wastewaters in this section at the applied ozone doses ozonation lowered cytotoxicity of the non disinfected wastewaters from two sources a and b by at least 2 2 times and as much as 22 4 times regardless of the selected ct values p 0 05 fig 2 here we lengthened the ozone purging duration into the semi batch reactors to create an average of 4 7 fold higher ct values of ozone exposure the prolonged disinfectant exposure may allow for longer reaction time between ozone and precursors to form byproducts during which no significant mineralization occurred refer to doc values in table s1 it is possible that at very high ozone doses beyond that required for disinfection e g 4 mg o3 mg doc rather than the range of 0 31 0 93 mg o3 mg doc in this study highest recorded dissolved ozone concentration achieved for a given sample the mineralization of certain fractions of organic matter may result in further lowered toxicity due to more complete destruction of these organics ratpukdi et al 2010 the impact of chlorination on cytotoxicity was specific to the water matrix for water a in agreement with the general trend as observed among all ozonated waters a higher applied ct value 6 8 times higher increased the toxicity by 1 27 fold as compared to its lower ct value counterpart p 0 05 fig 2a we previously observed that in municipal secondary effluent wastewater longer chlorination contact time e g 48 h vs 15 min resulted in formation of more haloacetonitriles that positively and significantly correlated with cho cell cytotoxicity dong et al 2016 similarly increased residence time for chlorination in a municipal drinking water distribution pipeline was found to have promoted the formation of n nitrosodimethylamine a carcinogenic nitrogenous dbp charrois and hrudey 2007 it is likely that the longer reaction time between chlorine and organic matter led to the formation of more and or higher concentrations of toxic byproducts however although consistent with certain scenarios from our previous study massalha et al 2018 for water sample a neither chlorine ct values produced disinfected waters with significantly different toxicity potencies than the non disinfected controls p 0 05 one possible explanation is that water sample a did not contain sufficient precursors to generate cytotoxic dbps for water sample b a higher ct value reduced the toxicity by 1 63 fold compared to the lower ct value p 0 05 with both being significantly more toxic than the controls p 0 05 fig 2b the observation that higher chlorine ct value yielded less toxic finished waters is inconsistent with earlier research dong et al 2016 and other samples within the current study suggesting water matrix specific toxicological responses this difference in water matrix is reflected by the difference in the aromaticity of water b suva 2 11 m 1mg 1l and water a suva 1 72 m 1mg 1l 18 5 difference despite similar doc values a 14 4 mg c l b 13 9 mg c l 3 5 difference the result that all of the chlorinated sample b were significantly more toxic than the controls was consistent with previous work dong et al 2016 2017b massalha et al 2018 yang et al 2014 in general conditions for both ozonation and chlorination technologies higher ct values produced disinfected wastewaters with enhanced levels of mammalian cell cytotoxicity 3 2 effect of different ways to achieve the same ct values on cytotoxicity ozonation vs chlorination this section discusses the effect of adopting different methods to achieve identical ct values namely varying the disinfectant dose and disinfectant contact time while keeping the cumulative disinfectant dosage over time identical on the cytotoxicity of disinfected wastewaters for both ozonation and chlorination lower cumulative disinfectant concentrations over longer contact times yielded lower cytotoxicity than higher cumulative disinfectant concentrations over shorter exposure times this trend was observed for both tested waters c and d for these two sources of wastewaters c and d for identical ct values ozonation produced cytotoxicity levels that were not significantly different from p 0 05 or even much lower than the non disinfected controls fig 3 p 0 05 these results are consistent with the observations discussed above in section 3 1 and in past research dong et al 2016 2017b massalha et al 2018 chlorination on the other hand increased cytotoxicity by at least 4 27 fold as compared to the negative controls fig 3 at the identical ct value e g ct 56 61 mg min l the chlorination with a higher c and lower t enhanced the cytotoxicity by 4 27 fold which was much more than the 2 79 fold induced by chlorination with a lower c and longer t we observed that during chlorination cytotoxicity was more associated with disinfectant dosage than contact time likely due to higher sensitivity of the cytotoxicity to the chlorine dosage than the contact time in water c scenario when the free chlorine dose increased from 5 to 7 mg l 1 4 fold increase and the contact time reduced from 30 to 10 min 3 fold decrease the lc50 of the disinfected water varied by 1 5 fold from approximately 15 to 10 concentration factor fig 3c for water d scenario when the free chlorine dose increased from 6 to 8 mg l 1 33 fold increase and the contact time reduced from 110 to 15 min 7 33 fold decrease the lc50 of the disinfected water only changed by 1 53 fold from 11 74 to 7 68 concentration factor fig 3d in summary for a given disinfectant exposure ct target lower disinfectant dosages combined with longer disinfectant contact time produced the lowest induced cytotoxicity the cytotoxicity results for chlorination was more responsive to the disinfectant dosage than the disinfectant contact time 3 3 impact of wastewater organic extracts on nac thiol specific biological detoxification mechanism thiol specific reactivity is an important metric associated with cytotoxicity dong et al 2017a 2018b pals et al 2016 2017 schultz et al 2006 2007 in this study 80 of the cytotoxicity analyses rank order was consistent with the rank order of nac thiol reactivity assay fig 4 a pearson s correlation analysis r 0 79 p 0 05 expressed a significant correlation between the cytotoxicity lc50 and nac thiol reactivity ec50 fig 5 this suggests that the adverse biological effects of the xad2 8 organic extracts of the wastewater samples were associated with the nac thiol specific soft nucleophile attacks the thiol groups are present in essentially all mammalian cells in concentrations between one to ten mm with the reduced form dominant over the oxidized form pastore et al 2003 the thiol moiety in these living systems exist in the forms such as amino acid l cysteine and l γ glutamyl l cysteinylglycine glutathione glutathione is the primary intracellular tripeptide that provides a thiol pool to buffer against and remediate toxicity caused by electrophiles meister and anderson 1983 townsend et al 2003 when oxidative stress is present a cysteine thiol group can be oxidized to a disulfide or can follow stepwise reactions to produce sulfenic sulfinic and eventually sulfonic acids timbrell 1999 when the cysteine thiol in glutathione is depleted or overwhelmed by oxidizing agents adverse biological responses may be induced meister and anderson 1983 townsend et al 2003 many halogenated compounds such as chlorinated acyls are known to react with the thiol group consuming the available thiols and forming substances such as thiol esters solomons 1996 previous research on dbps such as alkyl halides suggested that the thiol group on nac reacted with these soft electrophiles and therefore nac may possess the potential to reflect the relative toxicity of these individual compounds pals et al 2016 2017 additionally thiol reactivity was found to correlate with toxicity among several halo carbonyl compounds schultz et al 2007 it is therefore likely that the organic extracts contained these thiol reactive dbps resulting in the observed relationship between cytotoxicity and thiol reactivity we recently demonstrated a good correlation between thiol reactivity and cho cell cytotoxicity dong et al 2018b although these dbps and other agents isolated from the water samples are associated with the interaction of biological thiols further study is necessary to elucidate the precise molecular mechanisms and cellular targets of the individual dbps since thiol specific reactivity may reduce the cellular defenses against reactive toxic agents understanding their direct cellular target molecules and toxicogenomic characteristics responsible for the toxicity requires additional research however

19382,toxicity arising from toxic disinfection byproducts is an unintended result of disinfection during water reclamation to ensure safe water reclamation treatment it is important to develop a disinfection strategy with minimal formation of overall toxicity in the reclaimed water the cumulative disinfectant concentration over time ct is a useful concept for pathogen control during reuse water disinfection we evaluated the toxicity impact of ct values and different methods to achieve identical ct values by ozonation or chlorination of wastewaters from four agricultural sources on mammalian cells n acetylcysteine nac reactivity of the wastewater organic extracts was determined to reveal their impact on the thiol specific biological detoxification mechanism the results demonstrated that for two sources and for both ozonation and chlorination higher ct values enhanced cytotoxicity the ozonated waters were at least 10 less toxic and as much as 22 4 times less toxic than either the non disinfected controls or the chlorinated waters chlorination consistently induced higher cytotoxicity than ozonation by between 2 2 and 22 4 fold respectively and induced similar or higher cytotoxicity than the non disinfected controls by at most 4 4 fold given the same ct values the combination of high disinfectant concentration and short contact time produced finished wastewaters with higher toxicity than the combination of low disinfectant concentration and long contact time nac thiol reactivity was positively and significantly correlated with mammalian cell cytotoxicity and agreed with 80 of the cytotoxicity rank order this suggests that the induction of cytotoxicity involved reactions with agents that acted as thiol pool quenchers the overall results indicate that the cytotoxicity of wastewaters may increase when higher ct values are applied to inactivate recalcitrant pathogens to counteract the potential increase in cytotoxicity at high ct values for both ozonation and chlorination lower disinfectant dose and longer contact time may be adopted graphical abstract image 1 keywords disinfectant exposure ct ozone chlorine wastewater thiol 1 introduction water reclamation is necessary for efficient water use world health organization 2015 worldwide 70 of the freshwater resources are used for agricultural purposes food and agriculture organization 2015 it is therefore paramount to more efficiently reuse wastewaters from agricultural sources by means of for instance onsite reuse disinfection is mandatory in this process to protect the public health due to its effectiveness and affordability chlorine is currently the most widely adopted disinfectant for wastewater disinfection metcalf and eddy inc 2013 however chlorine is practically ineffective against several important pathogens such as cryptosporidium parvum korich et al 1990 chlorine disinfection also produces a number of regulated and unregulated disinfection byproducts dbps crittenden et al 2012 richardson and postigo 2015 rook 1974 ozone is a strong disinfectant against several key pathogens such as the norwalk virus shin and sobsey 2003 and c parvum corona vasquez et al 2002 kim et al 2007 and it is being increasingly used for wastewater disinfection gottschalk et al 2010 despite its potential to form bromate a regulated dbp in bromide rich waters united states environmental protection agency 2006 all disinfection processes create dbps some of which can be toxic with the increasing application of reclaimed waters for purposes such as recreational waters and hydroponics to ensure the safety of consumers it is of great importance to determine a disinfection strategy with minimal formation of overall toxic disinfection byproducts while achieving sufficient pathogen inactivation the ct cumulative concentration of disinfectant c in mg l times time t in minutes is a concept based on the chick watson theory chick 1908 that has been widely used for the disinfection of water and wastewaters for both chlorine and ozone stover et al 1986 united states environmental protection agency 2003 it predicts the fractional inactivation of a pathogen given the cumulative concentration of disinfectant over time the ct value accounts for the disinfectant demands in different waters together with the disinfectant exposure duration to achieve a given ct value for pathogen inactivation either a higher cumulative disinfectant concentration over shorter exposure time or lower cumulative disinfectant concentration over longer exposure time may be used the ct concept for microbial inactivation allows for flexibility in disinfection design by varying the chemical dosing and the disinfectant contact time previous research investigated the options to reduce the disinfectant usage while achieving acceptable microbial inactivation and keeping toxicity low such as comparing a three step chlorine dosing vs a one step chlorine dosing strategy li et al 2017a 2017b other research investigated the effect of fixed disinfectant concentration on toxicity among varied waters smith et al 2010 yang et al 2015 however applications of the ct concept were primarily focused on microbial inactivation dong et al 2018a hunt and mariñas 1997 1999 and the ct concept in the context of disinfection mediated toxicity production is not well understood owing to the potential to generate cytotoxic genotoxic and teratogenic dbps which may have adverse effects upon the environment and the public health komaki et al 2014 plewa et al 2004 2010 2017 plewa and wagner 2015 richardson et al 2007 wagner and plewa 2017 published research established that chlorination and ozonation could alter the toxicity of reclaimed waters due to interactions between the disinfectants and the organic and inorganic water components dong et al 2016 2017a 2017b liu and zhang 2014 monarca et al 2000 however a comprehensive toxicological analysis linking the impact of varied disinfectant dose with contact time two of the most important wastewater disinfection operational parameters is lacking the objective of this research is to understand chlorination and ozonation technology for the disinfection of several sources of partially treated wastewaters concerning the toxicological response in mammalian cells to ct values and different ways to achieve the same ct value the chinese hamster ovary cells cytotoxicity assay was used for the toxicity analysis the previously developed n acetylcysteine thiol reactivity assay dong et al 2017a 2018a b was used to measure the potential impact of wastewater organic extracts on the thiol specific biological detoxification mechanism the results presented here will facilitate the disinfectant dose and contact time selection to minimize toxicity of the disinfected wastewater while ensuring pathogen inactivation as reflected by the applied ct values 2 materials and methods 2 1 wastewater sampling processing and characterization four independent sources of agricultural wastewater effluents named a b c and d were collected from two vegetable farms in illinois usa these farms employ closed loop recycling of water to reuse the nutrients and reduce cost one farm was equipped with a state of the art biological nitrogen removal system to better manage the seasonal nutrient surges another farm mainly used an ebb and flow system with sand filtration due to seasonal farming activities we were denied access to the two locations where we collected water samples a and b therefore we obtained samples from two other sources in the same farms instead designated as c and d within one week post sample collection samples were filtered through 1 6 μm glass fiber filters to minimize the interference of suspended solids and the loss of dissolved organic matter the filtrates were stored at 4 c in the dark until use several water quality parameters were measured and are summarized in table 1 the absorbance at 254 nm was measured by a beckman uv vis spectrophotometer beckman coulter life sciences indianapolis in the dissolved organic carbon doc was measured by a shimadzu toc analyzer shimadzu scientific instruments columbia md after filtering each sample through a 0 45 μm filter specific uv absorbance at 254 suva254 was calculated as the ratio of uv254 doc both the free chlorine further detailed below and ammonia nitrogen were measured using hach kits loveland co ph of the filtered wastewaters ranged from 6 13 to 7 05 at room temperature 2 2 disinfection experiments chlorination using free chlorine was compared with ozone we used eq 1 to calculate the ct value in a completely mixed batch reactor 1 ct 0 τ c l dt where c l is the concentration of dissolved disinfectant free chlorine or ozone in this study τ is the hydraulic residence time of the reactor and the integral represents the area under the curve as depicted in fig 1 up to a specific time equal to the hydraulic residence time τ of this reactor the finite middle rieman sum was used to approximate the integral eq 2 2 0 τ c l dt i 1 n c l i c l i 1 2 δt two types of chlorination experiments were carried out for each wastewater source this entails 1a achieving high or low ct values by a combination of high initial chlorine dose with long contact time or low initial chlorine dose with short contact time 2a achieving the identical ct value by a combination of high cumulative chlorine dose with short contact time or low cumulative chlorine dose with long contact time 0 τ c l dt kept identical chlorination experiments were carried out in 4 l amber glass bottles with teflon lined caps as approved by the u s epa united states environmental protection agency 2016 free chlorine was measured using the hach loveland co kit based on the u s epa n n diethyl p phenylenediamine dpd method the chlorine concentration in the stock sodium hypochlorite solution ricca chemical arlington tx was quantified spectrophotometrically at 292 nm using a molar absorptivity of 360 m 1 cm 1 hussain et al 1970 we conducted a preliminary experiment to ensure that at the end of a minimum 15 min contact time and at a cl2 to nh3 n mass ratio of at least 8 3 free chlorine was still available and more importantly for the low ct conditions in experiment 1a the free chlorine concentration was in compliance with actual farm wastewater disinfection practice raudales et al 2014 an example free chlorine concentration profile as a function of exposure time is provided in fig 1a at the end of the experiments free chlorine was quenched stoichiometrically 1 2 safety factor using analytical grade sodium bisulfite fisher scientific hampton nh two types of ozonation experiments were carried out 1b

stock followed a molar absorptivity of 2900 m 1 cm 1 at 258 nm kilpatrick et al 1956 measurement of ozone in solution followed the indigo method as described elsewhere water environmental federation and american public health association 2005 different ozone mass transfer rates were achieved by conducting experiments with or without diffuser stones ozone solutions hull ia an example ozone exposure profile as a function of time is shown in fig 1b ozonation experiments were stopped stoichiometrically 1 2 safety factor using analytical grade sodium thiosulfate fisher scientific hampton nh after the designed ct values were achieved 2 3 sample concentration the organics from the samples were concentrated by adsorption onto clean xad resins it is important to note that despite numerous advantages this extraction method does not consider the contribution of bromate fifty five ml each of amberlite xad 2 sigma aldrich st louis mo and supelite dax 8 sigma aldrich st louis mo resins were packed above a glass wool plug in a glass chromatography column a mixture of xad 2 resin an aromatic polystyrene and xad 8 resin an acrylic ester was used to collect both aromatic and aliphatic compounds the maximum ratio of water to resins was 770 1 to maximize the adsorption of organics and minimize breakthrough ringhand et al 1987 schenck et al 1990 the samples were first acidified to ph 2 by sulfuric acid prior to being passed through the column to ensure protonation of carboxylic organics we used 400 ml of optima grade ethyl acetate fisher scientific hampton nh to elute the organics from the columns kronberg et al 1988 water in the ethyl acetate eluent was removed first using a separatory funnel followed by passing the hydrophobic fraction through a column of anhydrous sodium sulfate fisher scientific hampton nh the ethyl acetate eluent was reduced to 1 ml by a rotary evaporation unit büchi flawil switzerland at 55 c and further reduced to a point where the volume could not be reduced using a gentle stream of nitrogen it should be noted that although previous research identified that the volatile fraction of dbps are not as toxic as the semi to non volatile fractions zhu 2015 at 55 c loss and decomposition of these volatile organics may occur zhang and minear 2002 however even after these processes volatile dbps such as the trihalomethanes are present in samples jeong et al 2012 for each sample 40 μl of dimethyl sulfoxide dmso was added to dissolve the organic extract due to the presence of non negligible amount of organics that could not be blown dry we measured the total volume of 40 μl of added dmso together with the organics by means of density measurement specifically we recorded the weight of the hplc vials prior to sample addition and for each hplc vial containing the extracted organics and the added 40 μl dmso we withdrew a known volume of dmso and organic extract mixture and recorded the change in weight density of the dmso and organic extract mixture could thus be calculated and together with the weight of the dmso and organic extract mixture we were able to calculate the exact final sample volume this information was used to calculate the corresponding concentration factors in experiments compared to the original samples the dmso dissolved samples were stored in amber hplc vials in darkness at 20 c 2 4 chinese hamster ovary cho cells cho k1 cell line as52 clone 11 4 8 was used for all experiments wagner et al 1998 the cho cells were maintained in ham s f12 medium containing 5 fetal bovine serum 1 l glutamine and 1 antibiotics 0 25 μg ml amphotericin b 100 units ml sodium penicillin g and 100 μg ml streptomycin sulfate in 0 85 saline at 37 c in an incubator with a humidified atmosphere of 5 co2 2 5 cho cell chronic cytotoxicity assay the cho cell chronic cytotoxicity assay quantifies the reduction in cho cell density as a function of the concentration of samples over the course of 72 h the metric for the cytotoxicity assay was lc50 the sample concentration that induced a cell density that was 50 of the concurrent negative controls detailed description to apply the assay was published plewa and wagner 2009 wagner and plewa 2017 up to six replicate cho cell clones per concentration were conducted 2 6 n acetylcysteine nac thiol reactivity assay the in chemico nac thiol reactivity assay measures the ability of the samples to react with the biologically relevant thiols the assay was based on ellman s test ellman 1959 the more thiol reactive the samples are the less the added nac thiols remain which corresponds to less color development upon addition of ellman s reagent and can be quantified spectrophotometrically the metric for the nac thiol reactivity assay was ec50 which was the concentration factor of the sample that induced a reduction in the nac thiol concentration by 50 as compared to the concurrent negative controls details regarding this were published dong et al 2017a 2018b pals et al 2016 2 7 statistical analysis lc50 values were obtained through regression analysis for each concentration response curve similarly ec50 values were calculated through regression analyses for each concentration response curve we used tukey anova tests to compare the means of lc50 and ec50 values we used pearson s product moment correlation analysis to establish possible correlations between cytotoxicity and thiol reactivity the power of the anova test for significance was maintained at 0 8 at α 0 05 3 results and discussion different ct values as well as applying identical ct values that are achieved through either high disinfectant concentration with low contact time or low disinfectant concentration with long contact time were compared regarding the induction of cho cell cytotoxicity and thiol reactivity using ozonation and chlorination technologies 3 1 effect of different ct values on cytotoxicity ozonation vs chlorination we compared the induced mammalian cell cytotoxicity of water samples after application of high vs low ct values to wastewaters in this section at the applied ozone doses ozonation lowered cytotoxicity of the non disinfected wastewaters from two sources a and b by at least 2 2 times and as much as 22 4 times regardless of the selected ct values p 0 05 fig 2 here we lengthened the ozone purging duration into the semi batch reactors to create an average of 4 7 fold higher ct values of ozone exposure the prolonged disinfectant exposure may allow for longer reaction time between ozone and precursors to form byproducts during which no significant mineralization occurred refer to doc values in table s1 it is possible that at very high ozone doses beyond that required for disinfection e g 4 mg o3 mg doc rather than the range of 0 31 0 93 mg o3 mg doc in this study highest recorded dissolved ozone concentration achieved for a given sample the mineralization of certain fractions of organic matter may result in further lowered toxicity due to more complete destruction of these organics ratpukdi et al 2010 the impact of chlorination on cytotoxicity was specific to the water matrix for water a in agreement with the general trend as observed among all ozonated waters a higher applied ct value 6 8 times higher increased the toxicity by 1 27 fold as compared to its lower ct value counterpart p 0 05 fig 2a we previously observed that in municipal secondary effluent wastewater longer chlorination contact time e g 48 h vs 15 min resulted in formation of more haloacetonitriles that positively and significantly correlated with cho cell cytotoxicity dong et al 2016 similarly increased residence time for chlorination in a municipal drinking water distribution pipeline was found to have promoted the formation of n nitrosodimethylamine a carcinogenic nitrogenous dbp charrois and hrudey 2007 it is likely that the longer reaction time between chlorine and organic matter led to the formation of more and or higher concentrations of toxic byproducts however although consistent with certain scenarios from our previous study massalha et al 2018 for water sample a neither chlorine ct values produced disinfected waters with significantly different toxicity potencies than the non disinfected controls p 0 05 one possible explanation is that water sample a did not contain sufficient precursors to generate cytotoxic dbps for water sample b a higher ct value reduced the toxicity by 1 63 fold compared to the lower ct value p 0 05 with both being significantly more toxic than the controls p 0 05 fig 2b the observation that higher chlorine ct value yielded less toxic finished waters is inconsistent with earlier research dong et al 2016 and other samples within the current study suggesting water matrix specific toxicological responses this difference in water matrix is reflected by the difference in the aromaticity of water b suva 2 11 m 1mg 1l and water a suva 1 72 m 1mg 1l 18 5 difference despite similar doc values a 14 4 mg c l b 13 9 mg c l 3 5 difference the result that all of the chlorinated sample b were significantly more toxic than the controls was consistent with previous work dong et al 2016 2017b massalha et al 2018 yang et al 2014 in general conditions for both ozonation and chlorination technologies higher ct values produced disinfected wastewaters with enhanced levels of mammalian cell cytotoxicity 3 2 effect of different ways to achieve the same ct values on cytotoxicity ozonation vs chlorination this section discusses the effect of adopting different methods to achieve identical ct values namely varying the disinfectant dose and disinfectant contact time while keeping the cumulative disinfectant dosage over time identical on the cytotoxicity of disinfected wastewaters for both ozonation and chlorination lower cumulative disinfectant concentrations over longer contact times yielded lower cytotoxicity than higher cumulative disinfectant concentrations over shorter exposure times this trend was observed for both tested waters c and d for these two sources of wastewaters c and d for identical ct values ozonation produced cytotoxicity levels that were not significantly different from p 0 05 or even much lower than the non disinfected controls fig 3 p 0 05 these results are consistent with the observations discussed above in section 3 1 and in past research dong et al 2016 2017b massalha et al 2018 chlorination on the other hand increased cytotoxicity by at least 4 27 fold as compared to the negative controls fig 3 at the identical ct value e g ct 56 61 mg min l the chlorination with a higher c and lower t enhanced the cytotoxicity by 4 27 fold which was much more than the 2 79 fold induced by chlorination with a lower c and longer t we observed that during chlorination cytotoxicity was more associated with disinfectant dosage than contact time likely due to higher sensitivity of the cytotoxicity to the chlorine dosage than the contact time in water c scenario when the free chlorine dose increased from 5 to 7 mg l 1 4 fold increase and the contact time reduced from 30 to 10 min 3 fold decrease the lc50 of the disinfected water varied by 1 5 fold from approximately 15 to 10 concentration factor fig 3c for water d scenario when the free chlorine dose increased from 6 to 8 mg l 1 33 fold increase and the contact time reduced from 110 to 15 min 7 33 fold decrease the lc50 of the disinfected water only changed by 1 53 fold from 11 74 to 7 68 concentration factor fig 3d in summary for a given disinfectant exposure ct target lower disinfectant dosages combined with longer disinfectant contact time produced the lowest induced cytotoxicity the cytotoxicity results for chlorination was more responsive to the disinfectant dosage than the disinfectant contact time 3 3 impact of wastewater organic extracts on nac thiol specific biological detoxification mechanism thiol specific reactivity is an important metric associated with cytotoxicity dong et al 2017a 2018b pals et al 2016 2017 schultz et al 2006 2007 in this study 80 of the cytotoxicity analyses rank order was consistent with the rank order of nac thiol reactivity assay fig 4 a pearson s correlation analysis r 0 79 p 0 05 expressed a significant correlation between the cytotoxicity lc50 and nac thiol reactivity ec50 fig 5 this suggests that the adverse biological effects of the xad2 8 organic extracts of the wastewater samples were associated with the nac thiol specific soft nucleophile attacks the thiol groups are present in essentially all mammalian cells in concentrations between one to ten mm with the reduced form dominant over the oxidized form pastore et al 2003 the thiol moiety in these living systems exist in the forms such as amino acid l cysteine and l γ glutamyl l cysteinylglycine glutathione glutathione is the primary intracellular tripeptide that provides a thiol pool to buffer against and remediate toxicity caused by electrophiles meister and anderson 1983 townsend et al 2003 when oxidative stress is present a cysteine thiol group can be oxidized to a disulfide or can follow stepwise reactions to produce sulfenic sulfinic and eventually sulfonic acids timbrell 1999 when the cysteine thiol in glutathione is depleted or overwhelmed by oxidizing agents adverse biological responses may be induced meister and anderson 1983 townsend et al 2003 many halogenated compounds such as chlorinated acyls are known to react with the thiol group consuming the available thiols and forming substances such as thiol esters solomons 1996 previous research on dbps such as alkyl halides suggested that the thiol group on nac reacted with these soft electrophiles and therefore nac may possess the potential to reflect the relative toxicity of these individual compounds pals et al 2016 2017 additionally thiol reactivity was found to correlate with toxicity among several halo carbonyl compounds schultz et al 2007 it is therefore likely that the organic extracts contained these thiol reactive dbps resulting in the observed relationship between cytotoxicity and thiol reactivity we recently demonstrated a good correlation between thiol reactivity and cho cell cytotoxicity dong et al 2018b although these dbps and other agents isolated from the water samples are associated with the interaction of biological thiols further study is necessary to elucidate the precise molecular mechanisms and cellular targets of the individual dbps since thiol specific reactivity may reduce the cellular defenses against reactive toxic agents understanding their direct cellular target molecules and toxicogenomic characteristics responsible for the toxicity requires additional research however the nac thiol reactivity demonstrated the adverse impact of wastewater organic extracts on the biological thiol specific detoxification mechanism 3 4 implications for ozonation and chlorination

amount of attention e g dong et al 2017 and these studies highlight the increasing interest in providing evidence concerning the magnitude and extent of the beneficial effects of implementing these green strategies at the watershed scale the present study was born in the context of developing an integrated uds river model that considers the functional relationships of features such as meteoric events and overflow structure os basins with cso frequency and receiving water quality the main goal is to provide a quantitative evaluation of the benefits of the reduction of impervious urban surfaces by for instance implementing green practices on the current quality of the receiving waters of the pusiano lake northern italy the lake however suffers from trophic problems and the attainment of high quality will likely require further abatement of the external p load copetti et al 2017 moreover urbanization and climate change scenarios will be developed and the benefits of the reduction of imperviousness will be evaluated as strategies for adapting to climate change which is generally projected to lead to increased rainfall intensities and eventually to higher frequencies of csos 2 site description the lambro river 71 km2 of basin the main tributary of pusiano lake is situated on the southern edge of the alps northern italy between the two branches of lake como lombardy region fig 1 pusiano is a medium sized subalpine lake buraschi et al 2005 the external total phosphorus tp load reached its maximum in middle 80s with values around 21 t y 1 and has progressively decreased since the construction of a wastewater treatment plant wwtp in 1985 and currently it is close 6 t y 1 copetti et al 2017 the strong reduction of the tp load determined a marked decrease of both phosphorus 200 23 μg p l 1 and chlorophyll 18 8 μg l 1 concentrations in lake waters the lake nevertheless suffer the presence of the toxic cyanobacterium planktothrix rubescens carraro et al 2012a 2012b the disappearance of this species and the achievement of a good state of quality will likely require a further abatement of the external phosphorus load copetti et al 2017

transiting in the css a linear reservoir model has been used for calculating the discharge transiting in the css methodological details in supporting information si si2 1 of this paper the model was calibrated and validated thought the discharge measurements collected at canzo2c1 os fig 1 figs si1 and si2 water levels were monitored with a ceramic diaphragm hydrometer dipperiii by seba hydrometrie gmbh by transduction the monitoring period ranged from 1 6 2010 to 1 6 2011 on 30 monitored rainy events occurred during this year 15 were randomly chosen for calibration and the other 15 for validation table 1 it is possible to observe that the two subset of data present on average similar features although the ranges of values are different the discharge was calculated applying the chézy s equation chezy 1775 such features of canzo2c1 os are reported in table 2 it is possible to observe that the canzo2c1 os was selected as its features are closed to the mean of the other 62 active oss 3 4 detection of cso event the cso frequency was monitored over two full years may 2010 may 2011 and february 2014 february 2015 the 2010 2011 year was used as a training period while the 2014 2015 year was a validation period csos were monitored using float switches technical details in si1 connected to a continuous recording device this monitoring system was created for this study and was tested here for the first time fig si1 13 oss out of a total of 62 detected as active were monitored continuously for the two sampling years fig si2 the features of these oss are reported in table 2 it is possible to observe from this table that the selected oss were chosen because these oss are suitably representative of the range of all 62 oss during the calibration 85 cso events were detected while during the validation there were 167 cso events a cso event was identified when 1 overflow occurred in at least 1 os therefore during the same cso event each os may or may not have overflowed depending on the specific hydraulic features of the os a cso was said to have occurred when the data logger connected to the float switch recorded an overflow for at least 10 min 3 5 relative contribution of csos to the river discharge caffeine proved to be a suitable molecule to quantify the volume of wastewater discharged into water bodies buerge et al 2006 it was possible to use this molecule for water mass balance because caffeine is commonly used by humans buerge et al 2006 viviano et al 2014 and viviano et al 2017 used this marker to quantify the volume of wastewater spilled into water bodies in this study the relative contribution of all 62 csos to the river discharge was estimated for 4 rainy events 15 february 2011 27 march 2011 29 april 2015 and 8 may 2015 via a mass balance based on caffeine concentrations detected in the river during these rainy events previously the daily mean per capita caffeine load and the mean untreated wastewater load was defined methodological details in si3 an hourly grab sampling was carried out for 24 h during these 4 rainy events using an automated refrigerated sampler watersam ws porti the location are reported in fig 1 and indicated as monitoring site the starting time of each sampling was selected manually based on the weather forecast each sample was analyzed in the laboratory to determine the caffeine content field procedures caffeine detection methods and mass balance equations are detailed in this case study by viviano et al 2017 and in si2 3 of this paper 3 6 quantity and quality of receiving waters during both calibration and validation years the lambro river was instrumented for the high frequency time step of 1 h collection of water quality and quantity monitoring data the location of the monitoring site is shown in fig 1 the equipment includes one in situ inc troll 9500 multi parametric probe for monitoring water level and turbidity which ranges from 0 to 2830 nephelometric turbidity units ntus the probe was calibrated in the laboratory before installation and regularly tested to ensure calibration daily discharge was calculated from the water levels by using the velocity level curve as described by salerno and tartari 2009 daily tp loads were calculated by multiplying the daily discharge value by the daily tp concentration estimated by the surrogate equations developed for the lambro river in viviano et al 2014 methodological details are provided in si2 4 of this paper 4 modelling design an integrated uds river model was developed as shown in fig 2 the overall model

wastewater that overflowed into the river for each rainy event q c s o i the goodness of this estimate was evaluated by a completely independent approach namely by evaluating the mass balance for 4 rainy events by using caffeine as an anthropogenic marker methodological details in si2 3 a river quality model developed in viviano et al 2014 allows estimation of the mean tp concentration characterizing the total wastewater discharged into the river for each rainy event finally the tp load discharged into the river during each rain event was calculated by multiplying the total volumes

the cso frequency has been simulated by means of a statistical model that could establish a relationship between the state of activation of monitored oss 0 deactivated 1 active respect to the features of its basin the sewerage network and precipitation event the parameters related to the precipitation event selected as potential predictors are total cumulated rain maximum rain intensity and duration of the event the maximum rain intensity was calculated by considering the maximum rainfall height of each event the parameters related to the basin features selected as potential predictors are the same considered for estimating the retention constant in equation si3 refer to si2 1 which is a model parameter that describes the run off behavior of the watershed the basin surface area s the sewage network density d parameter related to the basin shape y the mean slope of the sewage network sl the basin imperviousness degree imp we derived logistic multiple regression models considering interactions among all predictors while quadratic terms were not considered the modelling was conducted using stepwise simplification through the evaluation of the aic akaike information criterion index akaike 1974 the aic index calculated using the stepaic function from the mass library in package in r software ripley 2014 is a measure of the relative quality of statistical models for a given set of data at the end of the process the hypothesis that the final model adds significant explanatory value over the model which considers only a single predictor was tested using an anova f test venables and ripley 2002 the marginal effect of predictors in defining the cso probability has been evaluated as suggested for logistic models calculating a probit regression model fernihough 2015 the roc curve receiver operating characteristic was used as indicator of performance of the logistic model roc curves are two dimensional graphs of true positive rate i e right predictions versus false positive rate i e wrong predictions ben david 2008 roc graphs are commonly used in medical decision making and in recent years have been used increasingly in machine learning and data mining research this statistical method is particularly indicated when a binary classification variable i e overflow vs no overflow is estimated based on continuous variables i e features of os basin and rainy event typically roc curves show the proportion of correctly classified negative observations specificity in the x axis and the proportion of correctly classified positive observations sensitivity in the y axis as the continuous variable moves over its range of values this statistical method is described in detail in ben david 2008 the prediction and performance functions from the rocr package in r software have been used sing et al 2015 moreover the cohen s kappa was used here for measuring the degree of agreement between field observations overflow occurrence recorded by the float switches and model predictions while compensating for agreements that can be attributed to chance cohen 1960 ben david 2008 cohen s kappa ranges from 0 to 1 if cohen s kappa 0 4 the concordance is defined as good ben david 2008 5 present and future scenarios once the calibration and validation phases were completed the integrated uds river model was run for all 62 oss and for 20 rainy events from 21 4 2014 to 8 5 2015 the resulting total tp load from the csos was considered representative of the business as usual scenario following the approach proposed by some authors e g semadeni davies et al 2008 ding et al 2017 in this study the changes in urban watershed imperviousness and in the variation of rainfall intensity are used to quantitatively represent urbanization and climate change respectively future scenarios are defined by increasing both the variables by 10 20 and 30 mitigation strategies to meet ecological standards of water quality and strategies to adapt to climate change are explored by reducing the imperviousness by 10 20 and 30 the integrated model was run for each combination of these variations and 28 scenarios were developed with regard to the urbanization scenario dietz et al 2008 demonstrate that the percent impervious area is a valid predictor of urban impact on stream water quality and is a simple indicator to use with regard to the urbanization scenario dietz et al 2008 demonstrate that the percent impervious area is a valid predictor of urban impact on stream water quality and is a simple indicator to use however changes in impervious surfaces have been investigated by few authors across europe e g hamdi et al 2011 kaspersen et al 2017 none in italy with our present knowledge these authors reports for the last decades increases of impervious surfaces ranging between 0 2 and 0 4 y 1 for some european cities assuming these rates constant until the end of this century a change of imperviousness from 18 to 32 could be considered as urbanization scenario for 2100 ding et al 2017 imagine the future land degradation for a big chinese city and predict an increase of 20 in urban imperviousness hamdi et al 2011 predict the same increase of 20 in the urban imperviousness of the brussels capital region at the end of this century in belgium as ding et al 2017 in china and nelson et al 2009 in usa this projection is intrinsically affected by an huge uncertainty level which is amplified if applied at local scale but it allows having a reference to make future scenarios which otherwise would be avoided therefore even in this study a change in urban watershed imperviousness of 20 was used as the urbanization scenario for 2100 assuming its broad uncertainty a limitation of this kind of studies thus in this study a change in urban watershed imperviousness of 20 was considered as the urbanization scenario for 2100 regarding the climate change scenario brugnara et al 2012 performed a high resolution analysis of precipitation trends in the central alps over the last century 1922 2009 and observed an absence of a trend in total precipitation however the average number of rainy days in northern italy during the 1834 1998 period exhibits a significant negative trend in all seasons brunetti et al 2000 as a consequence the precipitation intensity has a positive trend and is estimated to have increased by 15 20 over the last century brunetti et al 2000 salerno et al 2014b regional results for europe predicted increased contribution of heavy precipitation by around 20 in the 21st century semenov and bengtsson 2002 in fig 13 lenderink and meijgaard 2008 found that precipitation intensity will increase at a rate close to 14 per degree of warming in large parts of europe by the 2071 2100 period temperature increases of between 2 5 c and 4 0 c above the pre industrial level are projected currently the temperature increase of european land area is 1 3 c eea 2012 therefore a further increase of about 1 2 c and 2 7 c is predicted considering the two projections together an increase of precipitation intensity between 17 and 38 is expected for the end of 21st century averaging the observed brunetti et al 2000 and predicted semenov and bengtsson 2002 lenderink and meijgaard 2008 changes the climate scenario is simulated in this study by increasing the rainfall intensity by 20 corresponding to the future scenario for 2100 6 results and discussion 6 1 model the css flow for each of the 30 rainy events monitored the rainfall runoff model si2 1 simulated the hydrograph of the canzo2c1 os fig si2 corresponding to the observed hyetograph all simulated hydrographs were added to the mean values of domestic and industrial sanitary waste water 1 93 l s 1 and 0 023 l s 1 respectively provided by the sewage network manager the model was initialized using the parameters table 2 calculated as discussed in the section rainfall runoff model for css the model was run for 15 rainy events and indicators of performance were calculated a time lag between the observed and simulated hydrographs was evident in all model runs by using a cross correlation with a 1 min time step between observed and simulated hydrographs the best combination of performance indicators was established for a time lag of 13 min details regarding indicators of model performance are provided in si2 1 in the following ens is nash sutcliffe index range 0 1 beginning the simulated hydrograph with r2 0 42 and ens 0 04 after a time lag of 13 min values of r2 0 70 and ens 0 05 were reached then the calibration process considered variations of the parameters used for calculating the retention constant k eq si3 the best combination considered a reduction of 25 in the imperviousness bringing the r2 value to 0 75 and ens value to 0 64 the validation process resulted in similar performance related values r2 of 0 71 and ens of 0 60 6 2 dependence of cso frequency the intensive field campaign assured the monitoring of 85 cso events during the 2010 2011 period and 167 events during the 2014 2015 period cleaning activities were necessary every two weeks to ensure that the float switches correctly recorded the occurrence of cso events fig si1 all false activations and ambiguous results mainly due to the blockage of the float switch by solid waste were removed from the dataset descriptive statistics of the monitored events are presented in table 3 we observed that such oss were more prone to malfunctioning than others the mean number of monitored events for each os was 37 during the calibration 44 of the 85 events and 117 during the validation period 70 of the 167 events increasing field inspections ensured the proper functioning of the float switches during the second period increasing the total number of events to 70 although among the oss the numbers are extremely variable e g the os code 58 recorded only 59 events correctly table 3 reports the number of activations csos and the activation rate number of activations number of monitored events for each os the mean activation rate was 43 12 67 during the calibration and 38 2 70 during the validation period these rates can be considered comparable which implies that on average during 40 of the rainy events the oss overflowed however the mean is highly variable and ranges from oss that overflowed less than 10 e g code 2 to oss that overflowed up to 70 e g code 87 a simple linear correlation between the activation rates during the calibration and validation periods not shown here yields an r2 value of 0 74 which indicates that no noteworthy improvement change in the uds occurred between the two periods and that there is a causality in cso occurrence i e the differences in the activation rates depend on specific features of each os subsequently all selected variables associated with rainy events were tested for the ability to predict cso occurrence the logistic model was run with a stepwise simplification via the evaluation of the aic akaike information criterion refer to 4 in the final step we selected the model that simultaneously showed the highest quality of fit and lowest number of variables and equation terms the final model selected according to both these features considered 1 the imperviousness degree imp and 2 sewage network slope sl as features of the basin associated with each os and the 3 rain intensity int the calibration and validation performances were evaluated by the roc receiver operating characteristic curve refer to 4 roc curves are two dimensional graphs of true positives i e successes versus false positives i e wrong predictions as shown in fig 3 a the two curves red for calibration blue for validation are very close to each other i e the validation provided the same good results as the calibration and far from the bisector of the graph which represents the random effect of a logistic distribution ben david 2008 to further explicit these results the cohen s kappa was calculated cohen s kappa is defined as the ratio between the total agreement probability the accuracy and the probability due to chance we obtained a cohen s kappa value of 0 59 for calibration and 0 56 for validation confirming the goodness of fit of the roc curves fig 3a we complete the description of the statistical model by discussing the relative contribution of each predictor fig 3b shows that the cso frequency can be explained by the imperviousness 27 sewage network slope 20 and intensity of the rainy event 53 which are the main significant predictors as shown above by using the aic index urban basins with more impervious surfaces are responsible for more frequent csos in addition steeper basins increase the run off velocities and the probability of a cso occurrence these two features of the os basin alone contribute to the prediction of almost 50 of the cso probability and the other almost 50 is a result of the specific conditions of the rainy event intensity these results contribute to previous descriptions in the literature of relationships between rainfall and csos mailhot et al 2015 for instance determined the minimum thresholds of rainfall intensity for each os which once exceeded lead to significant cso occurrences however this study did not explain why different oss have different thresholds of rainfall intensity and thus a single model for all csss has been developed in contrast while many papers describe a direct relationship between urban impervious surfaces run off entering csss e g semadeni davies and water quality e g brabec et al 2002 kim et al 2016 to our knowledge the relationship between imperviousness and cso probability has never been modeled before interestingly in this case study we have determined modeled a statistical relationship between these features and cso probability rainfall events with different intensities lead to different cso probabilities moreover during a single rainfall event each os has a different overflow probability depending on the slope and imperviousness of the os however imperviousness and slope have a different management value while reducing the sewage network slope is not a feasible action acting on impervious surfaces is a management practice that in the last few decades has been suggested as a fundamental strategy to mitigate the decline in water quality in urban environments brabec et al 2002 kim et al 2016 in this regard with urban areas becoming increasingly widespread an increase in imperviousness is forecasted for the future e g dong et al 2017 based on these considerations the graph in fig 3c expresses the cso probability as a function of imperviousness and rain intensity 6 3 validation of the integrated model with the caffeine mass balance the total volume of wastewater that overflowed into the river for each rainy event q c s o i was estimated as the difference between the discharge simulated by the rainfall runoff model for all 62 active csos and the overflow threshold was defined for each os q t h w fig si3 the goodness of this estimate was evaluated by a completely independent approach the mass balance was evaluated for 4 rainy events by using caffeine as a marker fig 4 shows the results of this comparison viviano et al 2017 describes the methods and results to estimate the fraction of river discharge originating from csos i e the relative contribution of the csos to discharge and consequently the discharge that overflowed during the csos for these 4 rainy events refer also to si2 3 the discharge overflow during the csos qcso range from a maximum of 0 14 m3 s 1 in the third event to a minimum of 0 01 m3 s 1 in the last event during the first and second events we estimated peaks of 0 13 and 0 05 m3 s 1 respectively the fraction of river discharge that overflowed during the csos was 6 6 on average ranging from 1 to 14 in the four observed rainy events a few hours from 1 to 3 after peak precipitation the css capacity was exceeded and a portion of untreated wastewater was discharged directly into the receiving lambro river in this study the total volume of wastewater that overflowed into the river was estimated from the integrated model and compared by the caffeine mass balance approach the comparison showed a mean r2 value of 0 72 ranging from 0 67 to 0 81 and mean ens value of 0 51 ranging from 0 34 to 0 70 the performance indicators were in good agreement among these independent measurements and the integrated model was thus suitable for simulating the overflow of all oss including those that were not directly monitored 6 4 present and future scenarios the business as usual scenario was developed by running the integrated model for all 62 oss and 20 rainy events the tp loads from the csos and the total tp loads in the river were calculated by continuous monitoring of river waters as described above the representativeness of these events was evaluated by comparing the fractions of the tp loads from csos with the total tp load found in the river both for these events and for a longer period 237 days as reported in viviano et al 2014 for the same river section associated errors have been calculated as described in si2 4 table 4 shows that during the 20 events the total tp load found in the river was 162 37 kg the 39 64 22 kg of this load comes from csos and the remaining 61 98 21 kg have a non point source surface run off this fraction was compared with the results of the continuous monitoring for 237 days by viviano et al 2014 showing that the tp load in the river was 1 96 0 45 t of which 0 66 0 23 t i e 34 had a prevailing point source domestic wastewater csos the remaining samples were mainly from non point sources 1 30 0 28 t consequently the observed fractions 39 and 34 respectively are here considered to be similar being increased the uncertainty associated with the estimation furthermore table 4 shows that the mean cso discharge is 0 2 m3 s 1 i e only 17 of the river discharge confirming that csos contribute to the river conditions with small water volumes and high tp loads moreover an important consideration is related to the frequency distribution of the tp overflow from csos in fact it can be seen from the table that three events 26 7 2014 10 08 2014 and 30 4 2015 alone contribute more than 80 of the overall tp load from csos during the 20 selected events this result indicates that very few rainy events with high rain intensity are sufficient to decidedly influence the water quality status of the receiving water body as discussed above urbanization and climate change scenarios have been developed by considering the changes in urban watershed imperviousness and variation of rainfall intensity we found that these two variables are significant predictors of the occurrence of csos in table 4 results for the two scenarios are presented according to the predicted increase in rain intensity by 20 at the end of this century the tp load overflow into the river from oss is estimated to be equal to 89 31 kg i e 40 more than the current tp load from csos 64 22 kg a second scenario shows that the tp load from csos would increase by 45 92 32 kg if the imperviousness increases by 20 the effects of these two future scenarios varying imperviousness and rain intensity by the same percentage on water quality are very similar each other which was also observed by dong et al 2017 although the comparison was conducted by considering the resilience index of the urban system furthermore we provided to calculate the predicted percentage variations of the tp load from csos with respect to the business as usual scenario black circle considering different combinations of possible variations in imperviousness and rain intensity results are graphically represented in fig 5 with a spatial linear interpolation for the future climate change scenario yellow circle and urbanization scenario purple circle we observed the percentage variations presented in table 4 and discussed above however when the effects of the future urbanization and precipitation scenarios are combined the enhancement is exacerbated red circle with variations in the tp load from csos reaching values close to 100 i e if the climatic and urban predictions are realized the tp load from csos would be double the current tp load notably however if further increases in urban surface imperviousness are avoided and land management is used as a strategy to adapt to predicted climate change a 15 decrease in imperviousness would counteract the expected increase in tp load green circle it is interesting to consider the current eutrophication status of the lake into which the river waters flow copetti et al 2017 show that the tp concentrations of pusiano lake over the last 2 winter overturns 23 μg l 1 is below the regional quality target of 30 μg l 1 however as suggested by some authors e g jacquet et al 2005 the lake conditions are near the target threshold of 20 μg l 1 which could decrease the occurrence of algal blooms of the toxic cyanobacterium planktothrix rubescens and improve the general ecological status of the lake applying the vollenweider model vollenweider 1975 salerno et al 2014a to lower the tp concentration in the lake of 5 μg l 1 a reduction in urban tp load point and non point sources of 0 7 t y 1 would be required considering that the tp from csos is estimated to be 34 of the total urban load and maintaining the non point sources as constant we calculated that the tp load from csos should be lowered by 45 corresponding to 0 7 t y 1 fig 5 shows that this ecological target can be reached by just reducing the imperviousness by 20 blue circle 6 5 green infrastructure techniques to reduce imperviousness this case study established the link between the imperviousness of urban surface areas and the cso probability moreover reduction in the degree of imperviousness was predicted to be an efficient mitigation and adaptation strategy with respect to the water quality of receiving water bodies the main green infrastructure techniques that help reduce the entry of stormwater into the sewage system are here discussed however further study of the ample available literature is recommended for a deeper understanding of this subject generally the applicability of green infrastructures is conditioned by local characteristics determining their feasibility to be applied in urban areas the aim of this brief review is only to increase the awareness of how the findings of this study can be easily translated for urban planning while gray infrastructure based solutions exist many cities are looking to use green infrastructure as a way to help mitigate problems with stormwater systems kumar et al 2016 green infrastructure practices among many others include permeable pavements rain gardens bioswales green roofs infiltration trenches and rainwater harvesting e g casal campos et al 2015 green infrastructure practices mimic natural habitats and absorb excess water although all these practices reduce the run off entering sewage systems the use of permeable surfaces can be considered a method that directly reduces the effective impervious area of a watershed e g dietz 2007 kumar et al 2016 permeable pavements are one such green infrastructure technology that is being adopted to manage stormwater in many urban areas in both europe and the united states e g mullaney and lucke 2014 lee et al 2010 conducted a cost effectiveness analysis on best management practices for stormwater and showed that permeable pavements were most cost effective in managing run off when compared to green roofs traditional storage basins and traditional drainage systems prokop et al 2011 provide an overview of most common permeable surfaces with a brief description that includes the benefits recycling options maintenance costs and the most common applications of these surfaces there is a broad range of materials and concepts for permeable surfaces that may be applied in a wide range of situations permeable surfaces of all types are also suitable for private driveways and parking areas fig 6 shows the most common surfaces for artificial open areas the surfaces are presented according to their permeability the first picture shows a conventional lawn which can be considered to be 100 unsealed pictures 2 to 7 present various permeable surfaces and the last picture shows conventional asphalt which is 100 sealed as an example just going from conventional asphalt fig 6 8 to porous asphalt fig 6 7 leads to a reduction of 35 50 in impervious urban surfaces 7 conclusions finding solutions with high adaptability to a variety of uncertain future scenarios is crucial for the establishment of sustainable udss the present work contributes to the advancement of sustainability assessment focusing on the applicability of impervious surface reduction in the face of the deteriorating quality of receiving surface waters induced by urbanization and climate change generally these scenarios consider an increase in impervious urban surfaces induced by predicted population growth and although climate change varies regionally an altered precipitation pattern suggesting an increase in rainfall intensity if realized these changes could present a significant risk to the performance of css infrastructures including efforts to mitigate csos in this case study we found that rainfall events with different intensities generate different cso probabilities moreover during a single rainfall event each cso structure has a different overflow probability depending on the slope and imperviousness of watershed however imperviousness and slope have a different management values while reduction of sewage network slope is not feasible acting on impervious surfaces is a management practice that in the last few decades has been suggested as a fundamental strategy to mitigate the deterioration of water quality in urban environments this relationship is of great importance for novel design and renovation of urban drainage systems to adapt to urbanization and climate change in the future in this regard in this specific case study we observed that a contained increase in imperviousness 35 is able to redouble the cso probability in contrast to redouble the cso probability the rain intensity has to increase four fold according to the literature simulated urbanization and climate change scenarios for 2100 predict an increase of 20 in imperviousness of urban surfaces and rainfall intensity in both cases the effects of these predictions were considered using the tp load from csos as the pollution source we observed the following the climatic scenario leads to a 40 deterioration of water quality while the urbanization scenario leads to a deterioration of 45 however combining the effects of both scenarios exacerbates the deterioration reaching an almost 100 variation in the tp load i e double the current load in spite of a predicted increase in population over the next few decades the urbanization scenario predicts risks associated with water quality a concomitant increase in impervious surfaces should be avoided restricted reduction in imperviousness can be used as a suitable adaptation strategy to prevent the future impact of climate change on water quality a decrease of just 15 in imperviousness would be sufficient to prevent the negative effects of climate change reduction in imperviousness can also be used as mitigation action to restore the current ecological status of surface water bodies as demonstrated here by the 20 reduction in imperviousness with respect to the probability of algal blooms regarding the limitations of this work we note the following the first limitation of this work is that it is based only on a specific case study however we must consider that this study required very intensive and long field monitoring that was difficult to manage several data from the calibration and validation years have been integrated we preferred to consolidate validate the results rather than apply the same approach to another case study which is advisable for future research initiatives we evaluated the effects of the reduction in imperviousness of urban surfaces only on water from point sources i e csos while the corresponding urban planning actions e g increased permeable pavements would decrease even the water from diffuse sources e g urban run off entering directly into the receiving water bodies therefore the benefits of reduction in imperviousness shown here are only relevant for point sources and thus are underestimated green infrastructure techniques feasibility costs etc as a way to help reduce the entry of stormwater into sewage systems have only been introduced to increase the awareness of how the findings of this study can be easily translated for urban planning this study fails to address the uncertainty of the developed urbanization and climate change scenarios a common weakness of studies developing future adaptation strategies e g salerno et al 2017 therefore the findings presented here are theoretical and are not directly implementable for adaptation possible maladaptation due to unaddressed uncertainty must be avoided however the adopted approach aimed to bring together researchers policy makers and managers it bridged the gap between research and management priorities and enabled communication to address the needs of communities while promoting conservation of surface water resources e g amatya et al 2010 acknnowledgements we research was carried out thought the piroga

19383,climate change and urbanization are key factors affecting the future of water quality in urbanized catchments the work reported in this paper is an evaluation of the combined and relative impact of climate change and urbanization on the water quality of receiving water bodies in the context of a highly urbanized watershed served by a combined sewer system css in northern italy the impact is determined by an integrated modelling study involving two years of field campaigns the results obtained from the case study show that impervious urban surfaces and rainfall intensity are significant predictors of combined sewer overflows csos and consequently of the water quality of the receiving water body scenarios for the year 2100 demonstrate that climate change combined with increasing urbanization is likely to lead to severe worsening of river water quality due to a doubling of the total phosphorus load from csos compared to the current load reduction in imperviousness was found to be a suitable strategy to adapt to these scenarios by limiting the construction of new impervious areas and decreasing the existing areas by only 15 this information can be further utilized to develop future designs which in turn should make these systems more resilient to future changes in climate and urbanization graphical abstract image 1 keywords urban drainage system imperviousness climate change combined sewer system combined sewer overflow roc curve 1 introduction despite the development of urban drainage systems udss over the last few centuries there are still many challenges to the effective use of such systems the major objectives for udss remain public hygiene flood protection and in the last few decades environmental protection water quality problems in particular are rapidly emerging as a result of urbanization increasing the variety and amount of microbial pathogens pollutants and nutrients in receiving water bodies us epa 2004 among the major challenges in the maintenance of surface water quality in europe hering et al 2010 and at the global scale e g smith and schindler 2009 is the recovery of deteriorated trophic state eutrophication of surface waters as a consequence of excess external nutrients mainly phosphorus p schindler et al 2008 copetti et al 2017 from highly populated areas e g viviano et al 2014 in this regard we must consider that globally the number of people living in urban areas is increasing each year with urban populations projected to account for 66 of the total global population by 2050 un desa 2014 consequently it is critical that the impact of urbanization on the dynamics of water quality is suitably evaluated and managed the problem is further exacerbated by the current non stationary of climate changes in climatic conditions such as the increase in rainfall intensity shifts in precipitation patterns and more extreme weather events lead to the frequent exposure of udss to heavy rainfall e g bi et al 2017 as a consequence there is growing emphasis on the enhancement of the resilience of urban infrastructures in the face of unprecedented urbanization and climate change e g dong et al 2017 currently the combined sewer system css remains a commonly used uds all types of sewage sanitary sewage and run off stormwater are collected mixed and transported to a wastewater treatment plant wwtp rainfall leads to very high flow rates which exceed the capacities of wwtps hence a fraction of the sewage cannot be treated and is directly discharged into receiving waters combined sewer overflow cso e g viviano et al 2014 viviano et al 2017 in central europe approximately 70 of the sewer system is combined butler and davies 2004 and in the united states there are 860 communities with css serving approximately 40 million people with the majority located in the northeast the great lakes region and new england us epa 2006 in general the construction of csss is no longer permitted in the united states however existing cso sites remain significant sources of contamination for local streams rivers and other bodies of water us epa 2004 the european union highlights the need for member states to control cso pollution under the european urban wastewater treatment directive eu uwwtd 1991 and water framework directive eu wfd 2000 solutions for reducing water pollution from csos include the

stormwater flow has been deemed an effective and flexible strategy for mitigation of and adaption to perturbances generated by climate change and urbanization and thus for the promotion of the sustainability of udss e g dong et al 2017 some studies have evaluated the mitigation properties of such infrastructure on hydrological systems e g meierdiercks et al 2010 kousky et al 2013 and recently other studies have focused on water quality dietz and clausen 2008 casal campos et al 2015 pennino et al 2016 liu et al 2017 in the last decade the resilience of udss has received a great amount of attention e g dong et al 2017 and these studies highlight the increasing interest in providing evidence concerning the magnitude and extent of the beneficial effects of implementing these green strategies at the watershed scale the present study was born in the context of developing an integrated uds river model that considers the functional relationships of features such as meteoric events and overflow structure os basins with cso frequency and receiving water quality the main goal is to provide a quantitative evaluation of the benefits of the reduction of impervious urban surfaces by for instance implementing green practices on the current quality of the receiving waters of the pusiano lake northern italy the lake however suffers from trophic problems and the attainment of high quality will likely require further abatement of the external p load copetti et al 2017 moreover urbanization and climate change scenarios will be developed and the benefits of the reduction of imperviousness will be evaluated as strategies for adapting to climate change which is generally projected to lead to increased rainfall intensities and eventually to higher frequencies of csos 2 site description the lambro river 71 km2 of basin the main tributary of pusiano lake is situated on the southern edge of the alps northern italy between the two branches of lake como lombardy region fig 1 pusiano is a medium sized subalpine lake buraschi et al 2005 the external total phosphorus tp load reached its maximum in middle 80s with values around 21 t y 1 and has progressively decreased since the construction of a wastewater treatment plant wwtp in 1985 and currently it is close 6 t y 1 copetti et al 2017 the strong reduction of the tp load determined a marked decrease of both phosphorus 200 23 μg p l 1 and chlorophyll 18 8 μg l 1 concentrations in lake waters the lake nevertheless suffer the presence of the toxic cyanobacterium planktothrix rubescens carraro et al 2012a 2012b the disappearance of this species and the achievement of a good state of quality will likely require a further abatement of the external phosphorus load copetti et al 2017

transiting in the css a linear reservoir model has been used for calculating the discharge transiting in the css methodological details in supporting information si si2 1 of this paper the model was calibrated and validated thought the discharge measurements collected at canzo2c1 os fig 1 figs si1 and si2 water levels were monitored with a ceramic diaphragm hydrometer dipperiii by seba hydrometrie gmbh by transduction the monitoring period ranged from 1 6 2010 to 1 6 2011 on 30 monitored rainy events occurred during this year 15 were randomly chosen for calibration and the other 15 for validation table 1 it is possible to observe that the two subset of data present on average similar features although the ranges of values are different the discharge was calculated applying the chézy s equation chezy 1775 such features of canzo2c1 os are reported in table 2 it is possible to observe that the canzo2c1 os was selected as its features are closed to the mean of the other 62 active oss 3 4 detection of cso event the cso frequency was monitored over two full years may 2010 may 2011 and february 2014 february 2015 the 2010 2011 year was used as a training period while the 2014 2015 year was a validation period csos were monitored using float switches technical details in si1 connected to a continuous recording device this monitoring system was created for this study and was tested here for the first time fig si1 13 oss out of a total of 62 detected as active were monitored continuously for the two sampling years fig si2 the features of these oss are reported in table 2 it is possible to observe from this table that the selected oss were chosen because these oss are suitably representative of the range of all 62 oss during the calibration 85 cso events were detected while during the validation there were 167 cso events a cso event was identified when 1 overflow occurred in at least 1 os therefore during the same cso event each os may or may not have overflowed depending on the specific hydraulic features of the os a cso was said to have occurred when the data logger connected to the float switch recorded an overflow for at least 10 min 3 5 relative contribution of csos to the river discharge caffeine proved to be a suitable molecule to quantify the volume of wastewater discharged into water bodies buerge et al 2006 it was possible to use this molecule for water mass balance because caffeine is commonly used by humans buerge et al 2006 viviano et al 2014 and viviano et al 2017 used this marker to quantify the volume of wastewater spilled into water bodies in this study the relative contribution of all 62 csos to the river discharge was estimated for 4 rainy events 15 february 2011 27 march 2011 29 april 2015 and 8 may 2015 via a mass balance based on caffeine concentrations detected in the river during these rainy events previously the daily mean per capita caffeine load and the mean untreated wastewater load was defined methodological details in si3 an hourly grab sampling was carried out for 24 h during these 4 rainy events using an automated refrigerated sampler watersam ws porti the location are reported in fig 1 and indicated as monitoring site the starting time of each sampling was selected manually based on the weather forecast each sample was analyzed in the laboratory to determine the caffeine content field procedures caffeine detection methods and mass balance equations are detailed in this case study by viviano et al 2017 and in si2 3 of this paper 3 6 quantity and quality of receiving waters during both calibration and validation years the lambro river was instrumented for the high frequency time step of 1 h collection of water quality and quantity monitoring data the location of the monitoring site is shown in fig 1 the equipment includes one in situ inc troll 9500 multi parametric probe for monitoring water level and turbidity which ranges from 0 to 2830 nephelometric turbidity units ntus the probe was calibrated in the laboratory before installation and regularly tested to ensure calibration daily discharge was calculated from the water levels by using the velocity level curve as described by salerno and tartari 2009 daily tp loads were calculated by multiplying the daily discharge value by the daily tp concentration estimated by the surrogate equations developed for the lambro river in viviano et al 2014 methodological details are provided in si2 4 of this paper 4 modelling design an integrated uds river model was developed as shown in fig 2 the overall model

wastewater that overflowed into the river for each rainy event q c s o i the goodness of this estimate was evaluated by a completely independent approach namely by evaluating the mass balance for 4 rainy events by using caffeine as an anthropogenic marker methodological details in si2 3 a river quality model developed in viviano et al 2014 allows estimation of the mean tp concentration characterizing the total wastewater discharged into the river for each rainy event finally the tp load discharged into the river during each rain event was calculated by multiplying the total volumes of the wastewater that overflowed into the river by the mean tp concentration methodological details in si2 4 4 1 statistical model for linking cso probability with precipitation and basin features the cso frequency has been simulated by means of a statistical model that could establish a relationship between the state of activation of monitored oss 0 deactivated 1 active respect to the features of its basin the sewerage network and precipitation event the parameters related to the precipitation event selected as potential predictors are total cumulated rain maximum rain intensity and duration of the event the maximum rain intensity was calculated by considering the maximum rainfall height of each event the parameters related to the basin features selected as potential predictors are the same considered for estimating the retention constant in equation si3 refer to si2 1 which is a model parameter that describes the run off behavior of the watershed the basin surface area s the sewage network density d parameter related to the basin shape y the mean slope of the sewage network sl the basin imperviousness degree imp we derived logistic multiple regression models considering interactions among all predictors while quadratic terms were not considered the modelling was conducted using stepwise simplification through the evaluation of the aic akaike information criterion index akaike 1974 the aic index calculated using the stepaic function from the mass library in package in r software ripley 2014 is a measure of the relative quality of statistical models for a given set of data at the end of the process the hypothesis that the final model adds significant explanatory value over the model which considers only a single predictor was tested using an anova f test venables and ripley 2002 the marginal effect of predictors in defining the cso probability has been evaluated as suggested for logistic models calculating a probit regression model fernihough 2015 the roc curve receiver operating characteristic was used as indicator of performance of the logistic model roc curves are two dimensional graphs of true positive rate i e right predictions versus false positive rate i e wrong predictions ben david 2008 roc graphs are commonly used in medical decision making and in recent years have been used increasingly in machine learning and data mining research this statistical method is particularly indicated when a binary classification variable i e overflow vs no overflow is estimated based on continuous variables i e features of os basin and rainy event typically roc curves show the proportion of correctly classified negative observations specificity in the x axis and the proportion of correctly classified positive observations sensitivity in the y axis as the continuous variable moves over its range of values this statistical method is described in detail in ben david 2008 the prediction and performance functions from the rocr package in r software have been used sing et al 2015 moreover the cohen s kappa was used here for measuring the degree of agreement between field observations overflow occurrence recorded by the float switches and model predictions while compensating for agreements that can be attributed to chance cohen 1960 ben david 2008 cohen s kappa ranges from 0 to 1 if cohen s kappa 0 4 the concordance is defined as good ben david 2008 5 present and future scenarios once the calibration and validation phases were completed the integrated uds river model was run for all 62 oss and for 20 rainy events from 21 4 2014 to 8 5 2015 the resulting total tp load from the csos was considered representative of the business as usual scenario following the approach proposed by some authors e g semadeni davies et al 2008 ding et al 2017 in this study the changes in urban watershed imperviousness and in the variation of rainfall intensity are used to quantitatively represent urbanization and climate change respectively future scenarios are defined by increasing both the variables by 10 20 and 30 mitigation strategies to meet ecological standards of water quality and strategies to adapt to climate change are explored by reducing the imperviousness by 10 20 and 30 the integrated model was run for each combination of these variations and 28 scenarios were developed with regard to the urbanization scenario dietz et al 2008 demonstrate that the percent impervious area is a valid predictor of urban impact on stream water quality and is a simple indicator to use with regard to the urbanization scenario dietz et al 2008 demonstrate that the percent impervious area is a valid predictor of urban impact on stream water quality and is a simple indicator to use however changes in impervious surfaces have been investigated by few authors across europe e g hamdi et al 2011 kaspersen et al 2017 none in italy with our present knowledge these authors reports for the last decades increases of impervious surfaces ranging between 0 2 and 0 4 y 1 for some european cities assuming these rates constant until the end of this century a change of imperviousness from 18 to 32 could be considered as urbanization scenario for 2100 ding et al 2017 imagine the future land degradation for a big chinese city and predict an increase of 20 in urban imperviousness hamdi et al 2011 predict the same increase of 20 in the urban imperviousness of the brussels capital region at the end of this century in belgium as ding et al 2017 in china and nelson et al 2009 in usa this projection is intrinsically affected by an huge uncertainty level which is amplified if applied at local scale but it allows having a reference to make future scenarios which otherwise would be avoided therefore even in this study a change in urban watershed imperviousness of 20 was used as the urbanization scenario for 2100 assuming its broad uncertainty a limitation of this kind of studies thus in this study a change in urban watershed imperviousness of 20 was considered as the urbanization scenario for 2100 regarding the climate change scenario brugnara et al 2012 performed a high resolution analysis of precipitation trends in the central alps over the last century 1922 2009 and observed an absence of a trend in total precipitation however the average number of rainy days in northern italy during the 1834 1998 period exhibits a significant negative trend in all seasons brunetti et al 2000 as a consequence the precipitation intensity has a positive trend and is estimated to have increased by 15 20 over the last century brunetti et al 2000 salerno et al 2014b regional results for europe predicted increased contribution of heavy precipitation by around 20 in the 21st century semenov and bengtsson 2002 in fig 13 lenderink and meijgaard 2008 found that precipitation intensity will increase at a rate close to 14 per degree of warming in large parts of europe by the 2071 2100 period temperature increases of between 2 5 c and 4 0 c above the pre industrial level are projected currently the temperature increase of european land area is 1 3 c eea 2012 therefore a further increase of about 1 2 c and 2 7 c is predicted considering the two projections together an increase of precipitation intensity between 17 and 38 is expected for the end of 21st century averaging the observed brunetti et al 2000 and predicted semenov and bengtsson 2002 lenderink and meijgaard 2008 changes the climate scenario is simulated in this study by increasing the rainfall intensity by 20 corresponding to the future scenario for 2100 6 results and discussion 6 1 model the css flow for each of the 30 rainy events monitored the rainfall runoff model si2 1 simulated the hydrograph of the canzo2c1 os fig si2 corresponding to the observed hyetograph all simulated hydrographs were added to the mean values of domestic and industrial sanitary waste water 1 93 l s 1 and 0 023 l s 1 respectively provided by the sewage network manager the model was initialized using the parameters table 2 calculated as discussed in the section rainfall runoff model for css the model was run for 15 rainy events and indicators of performance were calculated a time lag between the observed and simulated hydrographs was evident in all model runs by using a cross correlation with a 1 min time step between observed and simulated hydrographs the best combination of performance indicators was established for a time lag of 13 min details regarding indicators of model performance are provided in si2 1 in the following ens is nash sutcliffe index range 0 1 beginning the simulated hydrograph with r2 0 42 and ens 0 04 after a time lag of 13 min values of r2 0 70 and ens 0 05 were reached then the calibration process considered variations of the parameters used for calculating the retention constant k eq si3 the best combination considered a reduction of 25 in the imperviousness bringing the r2 value to 0 75 and ens value to 0 64 the validation process resulted in similar performance related values r2 of 0 71 and ens of 0 60 6 2 dependence of cso frequency the intensive field campaign assured the monitoring of 85 cso events during the 2010 2011 period and 167 events during the 2014 2015 period cleaning activities were necessary every two weeks to ensure that the float switches correctly recorded the occurrence of cso events fig si1 all false activations and ambiguous results mainly due to the blockage of the float switch by solid waste were removed from the dataset descriptive statistics of the monitored events are presented in table 3 we observed that such oss were more prone to malfunctioning than others the mean number of monitored events for each os was 37 during the calibration 44 of the 85 events and 117 during the validation period 70 of the 167 events increasing field inspections ensured the proper functioning of the float switches during the second period increasing the total number of events to 70 although among the oss the numbers are extremely variable e g the os code 58 recorded only 59 events correctly table 3 reports the number of activations csos and the activation rate number of activations number of monitored events for each os the mean activation rate was 43 12 67 during the calibration and 38 2 70 during the validation period these rates can be considered comparable which implies that on average during 40 of the rainy events the oss overflowed however the mean is highly variable and ranges from oss that overflowed less than 10 e g code 2 to oss that overflowed up to 70 e g code 87 a simple linear correlation between the activation rates during the calibration and validation periods not shown here yields an r2 value of 0 74 which indicates that no noteworthy improvement change in the uds occurred between the two periods and that there is a causality in cso occurrence i e the differences in the activation rates depend on specific features of each os subsequently all selected variables associated with rainy events were tested for the ability to predict cso occurrence the logistic model was run with a stepwise simplification via the evaluation of the aic akaike information criterion refer to 4 in the final step we selected the model that simultaneously showed the highest quality of fit and lowest number of variables and equation terms the final model selected according to both these features considered 1 the imperviousness degree imp and 2 sewage network slope sl as features of the basin associated with each os and the 3 rain intensity int the calibration and validation performances were evaluated by the roc receiver operating characteristic curve refer to 4 roc curves are two dimensional graphs of true positives i e successes versus false positives i e wrong predictions as shown in fig 3 a the two curves red for calibration blue for validation are very close to each other i e the validation provided the same good results as the calibration and far from the bisector of the graph which represents the random effect of a logistic distribution ben david 2008 to further explicit these results the cohen s kappa was calculated cohen s kappa is defined as the ratio between the total agreement probability the accuracy and the probability due to chance we obtained a cohen s kappa value of 0 59 for calibration and 0 56 for validation confirming the goodness of fit of the roc curves fig 3a we complete the description of the statistical model by discussing the relative contribution of each predictor fig 3b shows that the cso frequency can be explained by the imperviousness 27 sewage network slope 20 and intensity of the rainy event 53 which are the main significant predictors as shown above by using the aic index urban basins with more impervious surfaces are responsible for more frequent csos in addition steeper basins increase the run off velocities and the probability of a cso occurrence these two features of the os basin alone contribute to the prediction of almost 50 of the cso probability and the other almost 50 is a result of the specific conditions of the rainy event intensity these results contribute to previous descriptions in the literature of relationships between rainfall and csos mailhot et al 2015 for instance determined the minimum thresholds of rainfall intensity for each os which once exceeded lead to significant cso occurrences however this study did not explain why different oss have different thresholds of rainfall intensity and thus a single model for all csss has been developed in contrast while many papers describe a direct relationship between urban impervious surfaces run off entering csss e g semadeni davies and water quality e g brabec et al 2002 kim et al 2016 to our knowledge the relationship between imperviousness and cso probability has never been modeled before interestingly in this case study we have determined modeled a statistical relationship between these features and cso probability rainfall events with different intensities lead to different cso probabilities moreover during a single rainfall event each os has a different overflow probability depending on the slope and imperviousness of the os however imperviousness and slope have a different management value while reducing the sewage network slope is not a feasible action acting on impervious surfaces is a management practice that in the last few decades has been suggested as a fundamental strategy to mitigate the decline in water quality in urban environments brabec et al 2002 kim et al 2016 in this regard with urban areas becoming increasingly widespread an increase in imperviousness is forecasted for the future e g dong et al 2017 based on these considerations the graph in fig 3c expresses the cso probability as a function of imperviousness and rain intensity 6 3 validation of the integrated model with the caffeine mass balance the total volume of wastewater that overflowed into the river for each rainy event q c s o i was estimated as the difference between the discharge simulated by the rainfall runoff model for all 62 active csos and the overflow threshold was defined for each os q t h w fig si3 the goodness of this estimate was evaluated by a completely independent approach the mass balance was evaluated for 4 rainy events by using caffeine as a marker fig 4 shows the results of this comparison viviano et al 2017 describes the methods and results to estimate the fraction of river discharge originating from csos i e the relative contribution of the csos to discharge and consequently the discharge that overflowed during the csos for these 4 rainy events refer also to si2 3 the discharge overflow during the csos qcso range from a maximum of 0 14 m3 s 1 in the third event to a minimum of 0 01 m3 s 1 in the last event during the first and second events we estimated peaks of 0 13 and 0 05 m3 s 1 respectively the fraction of river discharge that overflowed during the csos was 6 6 on average ranging from 1 to 14 in the four observed rainy events a few hours from 1 to 3 after peak precipitation the css capacity was exceeded and a portion of untreated wastewater was discharged directly into the receiving lambro river in this study the total volume of wastewater that overflowed into the river was estimated from the integrated model and compared by the caffeine mass balance approach the comparison showed a mean r2 value of 0 72 ranging from 0 67 to 0 81 and mean ens value of 0 51 ranging from 0 34 to 0 70 the performance indicators were in good agreement among these independent measurements and the integrated model was thus suitable for simulating the overflow of all oss including those that were not directly monitored 6 4 present and future scenarios the business as usual scenario was developed by running the integrated model for all 62 oss and 20 rainy events the tp loads from the csos and the total tp loads in the river were calculated by continuous monitoring of river waters as described above the representativeness of these events was evaluated by comparing the fractions of the tp loads from csos with the total tp load found in the river both for these events and for a longer period 237 days as reported in viviano et al 2014 for the same river section associated errors have been calculated as described in si2 4 table 4 shows that during the 20 events the total tp load found in the river was 162 37 kg the 39 64 22 kg of this load comes from csos and the remaining 61 98 21 kg have a non point source surface run off this fraction was compared with the results of the continuous monitoring for 237 days by viviano et al 2014 showing that the tp load in the river was 1 96 0 45 t of which 0 66 0 23 t i e 34 had a prevailing point source domestic wastewater csos the remaining samples were mainly from non point sources 1 30 0 28 t consequently the observed fractions 39 and 34 respectively are here considered to be similar being increased the uncertainty associated with the estimation furthermore table 4 shows that the mean cso discharge is 0 2 m3 s 1 i e only 17 of the river discharge confirming that csos contribute to the river conditions with small water volumes and high tp loads moreover an important consideration is related to the frequency distribution of the tp overflow from csos in fact it can be seen from the table that three events 26 7 2014 10 08 2014 and 30 4 2015 alone contribute more than 80 of the overall tp load from csos during the 20 selected events this result indicates that very few rainy events with high rain intensity are sufficient to decidedly influence the water quality status of the receiving water body as discussed above urbanization and climate change scenarios have been developed by considering the changes in urban watershed imperviousness and variation of rainfall intensity we found that these two variables are significant predictors of the occurrence of csos in table 4 results for the two scenarios are presented according to the predicted increase in rain intensity by 20 at the end of this century the tp load overflow into the river from oss is estimated to be equal to 89 31 kg i e 40 more than the current tp load from csos 64 22 kg a second scenario shows that the tp load from csos would increase by 45 92 32 kg if the imperviousness increases by 20 the effects of these two future scenarios varying imperviousness and rain intensity by the same percentage on water quality are very similar each other which was also observed by dong et al 2017 although the comparison was conducted by considering the resilience index of the urban system furthermore we provided to calculate the predicted percentage variations of the tp load from csos with respect to the business as usual scenario black circle considering different combinations of possible variations in imperviousness and rain intensity results are graphically represented in fig 5 with a spatial linear interpolation for the future climate change scenario yellow circle and urbanization scenario purple circle we observed the percentage variations presented in table 4 and discussed above however when the effects of the future urbanization and precipitation scenarios are combined the enhancement is exacerbated red circle with variations in the tp load from csos reaching values close to 100 i e if the climatic and urban predictions are realized the tp load from csos would be double the current tp load notably however if further increases in urban surface imperviousness are avoided and land management is used as a strategy to adapt to predicted climate change a 15 decrease in imperviousness would counteract the expected increase in tp load green circle it is interesting to consider the current eutrophication status of the lake into which the river waters flow copetti et al 2017 show that the tp concentrations of pusiano lake over the last 2 winter overturns 23 μg l 1 is below the regional quality target of 30 μg l 1 however as suggested by some authors e g jacquet et al 2005 the lake conditions are near the target threshold of 20 μg l 1 which could decrease the occurrence of algal blooms of the toxic cyanobacterium planktothrix rubescens and improve the general ecological status of the lake applying the vollenweider model vollenweider 1975 salerno et al 2014a to lower the tp concentration in the lake of 5 μg l 1 a reduction in urban tp load point and non point sources of 0 7 t y 1 would be required considering that the tp from csos is estimated to be 34 of the total urban load and maintaining the non point sources as constant we calculated that the tp load from csos should be lowered by 45 corresponding to 0 7 t y 1 fig 5 shows that this ecological target can be reached by just reducing the imperviousness by 20 blue circle 6 5 green infrastructure techniques to reduce imperviousness this case study established the link between the imperviousness of urban surface areas and the cso probability moreover reduction in the degree of imperviousness was predicted to be an efficient mitigation and adaptation strategy with respect to the water quality of receiving water bodies the main green infrastructure techniques that help reduce the entry of stormwater into the sewage system are here discussed however further study of the ample available literature is recommended for a deeper understanding of this subject generally the applicability of green infrastructures is conditioned by local characteristics determining their feasibility to be applied in urban areas the aim of this brief review is only to increase the awareness of how the findings of this study can be easily translated for urban planning while gray infrastructure based solutions exist many cities are looking to use green infrastructure as a way to help mitigate problems with stormwater systems kumar et al 2016 green infrastructure practices among many others include permeable pavements rain gardens bioswales green roofs infiltration trenches and rainwater harvesting e g casal campos et al 2015 green infrastructure practices mimic natural habitats and absorb excess water although all these practices reduce the run off entering sewage systems the use of permeable surfaces can be considered a method that directly reduces the effective impervious area of a watershed e g dietz 2007 kumar et al 2016 permeable pavements are one such green infrastructure technology that is being adopted to manage stormwater in many urban areas in both europe and the united states e g mullaney and lucke 2014 lee et al 2010 conducted a cost effectiveness analysis on best management practices for stormwater and showed that permeable pavements were most cost effective in managing run off when compared to green roofs traditional storage basins and traditional drainage systems prokop et al 2011 provide an overview of most common permeable surfaces with a brief description that includes the benefits recycling options maintenance costs and the most common applications of these surfaces there is a broad range of materials and concepts for permeable surfaces that may be applied in a wide range of situations permeable surfaces of all types are also suitable for private driveways and parking areas fig 6 shows the most common surfaces for artificial open areas the surfaces are presented according to their permeability the first picture shows a conventional lawn which can be considered to be 100 unsealed pictures 2 to 7 present various permeable surfaces and the last picture shows conventional asphalt which is 100 sealed as an example just going from conventional asphalt fig 6 8 to porous asphalt fig 6 7 leads to a reduction of 35 50 in impervious urban surfaces 7 conclusions finding solutions with high adaptability to a variety of uncertain future scenarios is crucial for the establishment of sustainable udss the present work contributes to the advancement of sustainability assessment focusing on the applicability of impervious surface reduction in the face of the deteriorating quality of receiving surface waters induced by urbanization and climate change generally these scenarios consider an increase in impervious urban surfaces induced by predicted population growth and although climate change varies regionally an altered precipitation pattern suggesting an increase in rainfall intensity if realized these changes could present a significant risk to the performance of css infrastructures including efforts to mitigate csos in this case study we found that rainfall events with different intensities generate different cso probabilities moreover during a single rainfall event each cso structure has a different overflow probability depending on the slope and imperviousness of watershed however imperviousness and slope have a different management values while reduction of sewage network slope is not feasible acting on impervious surfaces is a management practice that in the last few decades has been suggested as a fundamental strategy to mitigate the deterioration of water quality in urban environments this relationship is of great importance for novel design and renovation of urban drainage systems to adapt to urbanization and climate change in the future in this regard in this specific case study we observed that a contained increase in imperviousness 35 is able to redouble the cso probability in contrast to redouble the cso probability the rain intensity has to increase four fold according to the literature simulated urbanization and climate change scenarios for 2100 predict an increase of 20 in imperviousness of urban surfaces and rainfall intensity in both cases the effects of these predictions were considered using the tp load from csos as the pollution source we observed the following the climatic scenario leads to a 40 deterioration of water quality while the urbanization scenario leads to a deterioration of 45 however combining the effects of both scenarios exacerbates the deterioration reaching an almost 100 variation in the tp load i e double the current load in spite of a predicted increase in population over the next few decades the urbanization scenario predicts risks associated with water quality a concomitant increase in impervious surfaces should be avoided restricted reduction in imperviousness can be used as a suitable adaptation strategy to prevent the future impact of climate change on water quality a decrease of just 15 in imperviousness would be sufficient to prevent the negative effects of climate change reduction in imperviousness can also be used as mitigation action to restore the current ecological status of surface water bodies as demonstrated here by the 20 reduction in imperviousness with respect to the probability of algal blooms regarding the limitations of this work we note the following the first limitation of this work is that it is based only on a specific case study however we must consider that this study required very intensive and long field monitoring that was difficult to manage several data from the calibration and validation years have been integrated we preferred to consolidate validate the results rather than apply the same approach to another case study which is advisable for future research initiatives we evaluated the effects of the reduction in imperviousness of urban surfaces only on water from point sources i e csos while the corresponding urban planning actions e g increased permeable pavements would decrease even the water from diffuse sources e g urban run off entering directly into the receiving water bodies therefore the benefits of reduction in imperviousness shown here are only relevant for point sources and thus are underestimated green infrastructure techniques feasibility costs etc as a way to help reduce the entry of stormwater into sewage systems have only been introduced to increase the awareness of how the findings of this study can be easily translated for urban planning this study fails to address the uncertainty of the developed urbanization and climate change scenarios a common weakness of studies developing future adaptation strategies e g salerno et al 2017 therefore the findings presented here are theoretical and are not directly implementable for adaptation possible maladaptation due to unaddressed uncertainty must be avoided however the adopted approach aimed to bring together researchers policy makers and managers it bridged the gap between research and management priorities and enabled communication to address the needs of communities while promoting conservation of surface water resources e g amatya et al 2010 acknnowledgements we research was carried out thought the piroga

19384,the endogenous release of nutrients from marine or lacustrine sediment is an important factor in water eutrophication overlying water dynamic actions waves may lead to sediment resuspension and even sediment liquefaction especially under strong wind induced waves which may subsequently lead to the release of nutrients from sediments and contribution to water eutrophication a wave flume simulator was used to study changes in the phosphorus concentrations in the overlying water at different consolidation stages the key factors of which were the changes caused by endogenous release from a liquefied seabed the results showed that the total phosphorus tp total dissolved phosphorus tdp and soluble reactive phosphorus srp found in the liquefaction stage were 59 25 and 31 times greater respectively than those in the consolidation stage and 5 19 and 21 times greater respectively than those in the non liquefaction stage these results indicated that seabed liquefaction may lead to greater phosphorus releases from liquefied sediments into overlying water which may subsequently contribute to water eutrophication graphical abstract image 1 keywords phosphorus liquefaction flume experiments sediment 1 introduction excessive input of nitrogen and phosphorus nutrients into a water body will result in eutrophication with the mass propagation of phytoplankton as the main limiting factor of biological productivity lürling and oosterhout 2013 the variation in phosphorus directly impacts the occurrence of eutrophication or recovery of eutrophic waters schindler 1974 previous studies have found that the endogenous recycling of phosphorus was a decisive factor to break the phosphorus limitation without a sufficient decrease in external loading perkings and underwood 2001 wu et al 2017 the release of nitrogen phosphorus and other pollutants from sediments can be influenced by static diffusion pore water drainage and sediment resuspension fan et al 1998 liu et al 2001 the sediments resuspend with water fluctuations and bioturbation e g by fish or mosquito larvae can play an important role in sediment resuspension in addition there are complex physical and chemical properties on the surface of small sized particles where adsorption and desorption effects exist which have important impacts on phosphorus concentrations in the water system reddy et al 1996 søndergaard et al 2003 qin et al 2003 phosphorous partitions more onto soil particles than in solution therefore the amount released due to resuspension is far greater than that due to static diffusion to study the influence of sediment resuspension on nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations in water researchers have conducted in situ observations james et al 2004 oscillating grid studies reddy et al 1996 and wave flume experiments zhu et al 2005a a case study in taihu lake china demonstrated that the frequent disturbance by large waves was the primary cause of endogenous phosphorus release in lake water and endogenous release plays an important role in the supply of nutrients for cyanobacterial blooms zhu et al 2005b to reduce the sediment phosphorous release waajen et al 2015 employed geoengineering measures in eutrophic ponds and the measures showed efficiency in the restoration of eutrophic waters when external phosphorus was limited previous studies focused on phosphorus concentration changes caused by surface sediment resuspension while seabed sediments are mostly made up of sand silt and clay they are prone to liquefaction under the action of strong waves if sand or silt is dominant zen and yamazaki 1990 on site observations in coastal zones have provided convincing evidence that strong wave action causes seabed liquefaction which refers to the fact that loose fine sediment are saturated with water suddenly break down under vibration and behave as liquids zen and yamazaki 1991 kudella et al 2006 groot et al 2006 mory et al 2007 using wave flume tests tzang and ou 2006 sumer et al 2006 and centrifuge tests robarts et al 1998 researchers described the liquefaction phenomena and measured the pore water pressure the results also confirmed the liquefaction of sand and silty soil under wave loading some researchers even calculated the liquefaction depths for various situations chang et al 2004 indicated that the liquefaction depth caused by a typhoon was 6 1 m for a sandy coastal seabed with relative density of dr 0 35 at a water depth of 8 6 m sun et al 2008 estimated that the liquefaction depth in the yellow river subaqueous delta silty seabed was 4 2 m at an 8 m water depth under a whole gale the liquefied sediments fluctuate with the upper water body and small sized particles such as clay gradually move upward and are finally suspended in the water xu et al 2016 thus nutrients at a certain sediment depth in addition to nutrients at the sediment surface are released into the overlying water due to liquefaction we assume that sediment liquefaction in lakes or gulfs will result in nutrient release from seabed sediments in amounts likely greater than that from sediment resuspension the objective of this study is to use a wave flume simulator to investigate the phosphorus concentration changes in overlying water during sediment liquefaction we have previously used a wave flume to simulate the release of heavy metals from liquefied sediments sun et al 2015 the current experiment tested water samples and sediment samples collected from the three stages to examine the following results 1 changes in the suspended solids ss in overlying water 2 variations in the total phosphorus tp dissolved total phosphorus tdp and soluble reactive phosphorus srp concentrations in overlying water and 3 changes in the tp content in pore water samples and sediment samples the results in this paper show that sediment liquefaction induces substantial release of phosphorus into overlying water and while the main cause of phosphorus release from sediment is pore water drainage 2 material and methods 2 1 experimental equipment a wave flume simulator was used to conduct the indoor study the flume was 14 0 m long 0 5 m wide and 1 5 m high fig 1 a wave maker was located at one end of the flume which was used to generate waves during the experiments while the other end contained riprap constructed from crushed rock with a slope of 14 to dissipate the wave energy and reduce the interference caused by wave reflection the sediment bed was placed in the middle section in the flume and was 0 6 m deep 2 6 m long and 7 5 m away from the wave generator 2 2 experimental design observations of sediment movement especially after liquefaction under waves as well as changes in water were carried out during the experiment meanwhile water and bed sediment samples were collected in turn according to a schedule to analyze the change in phosphorus concentrations and ss content by which the effect of wave action on phosphorus release in sediment could be obtained 2 2 1 preparation of the sediment bed the sediment bed of the flume experiment consisted of remolded soil from the yellow river delta with the main components of silt sand and 10 5 clay the accumulation curve of the sediment bed is shown in fig 2 and table 1 a subset of the bed sediment was predosed with phosphorous fig 3 to accomplish this 142 5 g potassium dihydrogen phosphate kh2po4 was dissolved in 13 5 l of tap water to make a solution this solution was mixed into 90 kg of dry soil to form a phosphorus dosed slurry with a total phosphorus concentration of 0 8 g kg dw the slurry was maintained without disturbance for 7 days so that the potassium dihydrogen phosphate could be incorporated into the soil through adsorption and potentially reach a stable state in which the phosphorus was completely combined with soil particles the rest of the soil was mixed with tap water in an appropriate amount so that the water content was the same 33 as that in the phosphorous dosed soil the non phosphorous dosed soil was first to be introduced into the flume when the sediment bed reached 48 0 cm in thickness the phosphorus dosed soil was transferred into the flume to form a 4 cm thick layer then another 8 cm of non phosphorous dosed soil was laid on top so that the phosphorous dosed soil layer was sandwiched in the middle of the sediment bed the total thickness of the sediment bed was 60 0 cm tap water phosphorus concentration is 0 was slowly added to the flume after completion of the sediment bed preparation until the water depth reached 40 cm slow addition to avoid disturbance of the sediment bed 2 2 2 experiment processing the flume test was conducted in three stages static consolidation stage stage i non liquefied stage stage ii and liquefaction stage stage iii stage i lasted for 8 days without wave action so that the sediment bed was left under water for static consolidation stage ii was a non liquefied stage during which the sediment bed experienced a series of four wave actions with sequential wave heights of 5 cm 8 cm 11 cm and 14 cm each wave action lasted for 180 min stage iii was the liquefaction stage a small range of disturbances was created in the sediment bed to form a local weak area under wave action the weak area would be triggered to develop sediment liquefaction in this stage the same set of four wave actions as in stage ii was also applied in stage iii in stage i water samples were collected in centrifuge tubes at 65 130 and 195 cm from the left side of the sediment bed and 15 cm above the sediment bed in triplicate in stage ii and stage iii the water samples were all collected in centrifuge tubes in triplicate at the same positions as in stage i and at the same time we used an ss sampler to collect water samples wave parameters and test process of the experiment are shown in table 2 the concentrations of each index tp tdp and srp in water were obtained at different time points under each working condition the sediment bed and water sampling sites for centrifuge tubes w1 and the ss sampler w2 are shown in fig 3 sediment core samples with length of 22 cm were collected at the end of each stage at 65 cm 130 cm and 195 cm from the left side of the sediment bed the columnar sediment samples were cut into segments from 0 to 1 cm 1 to 3 cm 19 to 21 cm and 21 to 22 cm each segment was dried and its phosphorus concentration was measured the sediment bed and locations of the sampling points are shown in fig 3 2 3 sample analysis all concentrated extracts were centrifuged at 10 000 r min in a tdl 5 a high speed centrifuge water samples were acidified with nitric acid after centrifugation and then stored at 4 c the tp tdp and srp concentrations in the water samples were analyzed using the molybdenum blue method following standardized treatments ding et al 2015 the tp content of the sediment was determined according to the method described by amit and claude 1998 after drying in air the suspended solid content in water was determined from the residual solids via filtering through whatman grade 2 qualitative filter paper 8 μm drying for 4 h at 105 c and weighing the particle size of the sediment at the bottom of the bed was determined by sieving zhao et al 2010 and by the static water sedimentation densitometer method guo et al 2016 2 4 statistical analysis to obtain the representative concentration for each working condition the analytical concentrations of the water samples were processed by monte carlo 5000 times simulation to obtain the corresponding maximum probable concentrations using the crystal ball software song et al 2012 thus the concentrations corresponding to the maximum probability were used instead as representative concentrations under each working condition the spss16 0 statistical software was used to analyze the correlation between suspended solids ss concentration and tp concentration ss concentration and tdp concentration and ss concentration and srp concentration we averaged 3 replicate water samples and 3 parallel sediment concentrations to obtain the value of every index in the overlying water and the tp in the sediment bed 3 results 3 1 influence of wave loading on the ss concentration as discussed in section 2 the sediment bed experienced two stages ii and iii of wave action under four sequentially different wave heights ss concentrations in the water at different wave heights during stages ii and iii are shown in fig 4 in stage ii the ss concentrations increased at the beginning of each wave action with different wave heights and then reached a steady state at 50 60 min with an increase in wave height the ss concentration also gradually increased for instance the ss concentrations ranged from 0 037 to 0 213 g l and 0 246 0 359 g l under 5 cm and 8 cm wave heights in stage ii respectively the ss concentrations in stage iii were considerably higher than those in stage ii compared to stage ii the ss were 0 339 0 491 g l and 0 634 1 122 g l under 5 cm and 8 cm wave heights respectively overall the ss concentrations ranged 0 037 0 588 g l in stage ii and 0 339 2 320 g l in stage iii 3 2 changes in the phosphorus concentration in water 3 2 1 changes in the tp and tdp concentrations tp concentrations in the water at different wave heights during stages i ii and iii are shown in fig 5 the tp concentration increased slowly in stage i from 0 063 to 0 195 mg l fig 5a in stage ii tp concentrations increased gradually from 0 269 to 1 430 mg l fig 5b in stage iii the tp concentration significantly increased from 0 650 to 10 603 mg l with increasing wave height fig 5c in the same way tdp concentrations in water demonstrated a similar pattern at different wave heights during the three test stages as shown in fig 6 the tdp concentration increased slowly from 0 025 to 0 137 mg l fig 6a in stage i and increased gradually from 0 074 to 0 124 mg l fig 6b in stage ii in stage iii the tdp concentration increased notably also increasing with an increase in the wave height and varying from 0 097 to 1 917 mg l fig 6c 3 2 2 changes in the srp concentration srp concentrations in water at different wave heights during stages i ii and iii are shown in fig 7 srp concentration increased slowly in stage i from 0 020 to 0 088 mg l fig 7a in stage ii the srp concentration gradually increased from 0 061 to 0 105 mg l with an increase in the wave height fig 7b in stage iii the srp concentration increased notably from 0 086 to 2 064 mg l with an increase in the wave height fig 7c 3 3 vertical profile of the phosphorus concentration in the bed sediment the tp concentrations in the sediment during stages i ii and iii are shown in fig 8 tp diffused in only a limited area during stage i but the diffusion was obvious in stage ii and stage iii fig 8 the tp concentrations in sediment during stage i stage ii and stage iii varied in the ranges of 1 32 10 5 1 60 10 4 g kg dw 6 21 10 5 1 33 10 4 g kg dw and 3 41 10 5 1 34 10 4 g kg dw respectively 4 discussion 4 1 drainage pattern of pore water in the flume test the artificial bed with high water content would consolidate due to gravity and cyclic loading during the consolidation process the sediment bed would densify as the pore water was gradually discharged by compression of soil particles leading to a decrease in the pore ratio three consolidation processes may exist that also lead to pore water movement usually out of sediment namely gravity consolidation drainage wave dynamic consolidation drainage and liquefied state drainage the gravity drainage also exists in the wave dynamic consolidation stages the sediment consolidation drainage process during the flume experiment was illustrated in fig 9 marine or lacustrine sediments are composed of solid liquid and gas the sediments have certain strength because of the mutual contact between soil particles with pore water and air in the internal porosity between the soil particles a schematic diagram of the initial sediment at the bottom of the bed prepared for this test was shown in fig 9a the sediment bed in stage i was in the gravity consolidation drainage condition in which the sediment bed was gradually compressed under gravity and pore water gradually discharged into the overlying water the three sides of the sediment bed were impermeable in this experiment and pore water could only seep through the interface of sediment and water into the overlying water fig 9b phosphorus in the pore water entered the overlying water with the movement of the pore water which increased the p concentration in the overlying water at the same time static diffusion of p from the sediment also caused an increase in the phosphorus concentration in the overlying water studies have shown that the self consolidation process is very fast and can be completed in 45 51 h shan et al 2006 as we observed in this experiment the sediment deposition was obvious in the first 1 2 days and became less evident in the following days which meant the consolidation process gradually ceased and the phosphorus concentration in overlying water became stable in stage ii when wave action was applied the bed sediment experienced dynamic consolidation drainage wave crests and troughs formed high and low water heads respectively which would allow water to seep from high levels to low levels and finally enter the overlying water fig 9c with wave circulation the dynamic consolidation drainage process continued pore water with phosphorus entered the overlying water from the sediment circularly rosenberry et al 2013 performed field tests on seepage variation in response to waves and indicated that the permeability was very high in sandy sediments 10 m from shore and was related to the transfer of matter in sediments jeng et al 2001 noted that the amount of water seepage in each wave period was closely related to the migration of pollutants in the sediments in the study of the dynamic response of the seabed to waves jeng and lee 2001 in stage ii the concentration of tp in the overlying water increased by 161 836 compared to stage i baseline conditions table 3 therefore the wave dynamic consolidation process cannot be neglected in the examination of solute transport across the sediment water interface the pore water pressure gradually increased under wave loading in stage iii and when this pressure was equal to or greater than the overlying effective stress the sediment lost its structural strength and liquefaction occurred thus the particles were suspended in pore water and flowed along with pore water fig 9d xu et al 2011 tzang et al 2009 in stage iii the phosphorus concentration in the overlying water significantly increased which was closely related to the large amount of water seeping out of the pores as well as the increase in the amount of fine sediment in the overlying water 4 2 total phosphorus and total dissolved phosphorus release in water wave disturbances in the bed can induce sediment resuspension wave disturbances were enhanced with the increase in the wave height which means more particles were released into the overlying water the resuspension process can be extreme in the liquefaction stage a large amount of fine grained sediment was released into the overlying water with pore water oscillation which had a significant impact on the phosphorus concentration in water as discussed both the tp and tdp concentrations in water increased slowly in stage i figs 5a and 6a though there was no wave action on the undisturbed sediment bed fig 8 this release of phosphorus from sediment may have been caused by both gravity consolidation drainage fig 9b and diffusion driven by the concentration gradient between pore water and overlying water as discussed by others wen et al 2008 zhang et al 2012 because the sediment was dosed with phosphorous both processes caused tp and tdp concentrations in water to increase over time the consolidation process of the bed ended and the tp and tdp concentrations in water reached a steady state which meant that after the consolidation state there was only slight discharge of water from the sediments thus the concentration of phosphorus in water scarcely changed little which we interpret as a steady state the tp and tdp concentrations in water showed gradual increases with an increase in the wave height in stage ii figs 5b and 6b the tp and tdp concentrations were low in stage i while the tp concentration increased by 1 61 3 86 times and the tdp concentrations increased by only 0 08 0 31 times in stage ii over those in stage i under experimental wave conditions table 3 indicating that the wave loading on the non liquefied sediment bed had a certain impact on the tp and tdp concentrations compared to that in the liquefaction stage under wave cycle actions the sediment bed was in the dynamic drainage consolidation state fig 9c causing phosphorus in the pore water to transfer into the overlying water meanwhile with an increase in the wave height the ss content gradually increased which had weak positive correlations with tp r 0 525 n 32 p 0 01 and tdp r 0 325 n 32 p 0 01 both factors caused the increases in the tp and tdp concentrations in water however during the non liquefaction stage the action of waves on the bed was relatively small thus the ss content in water was not enough to generate large increases in the tp and tdp concentrations the tp and tdp concentrations in water increased significantly with increases in the wave height in stage iii figs 5c and 6c the tp and tdp concentrations under the 14 cm wave height in stage iii were 59 times and 26 times higher than those in stage i respectively table 3 which indicated that liquefaction significantly enhanced the release of phosphorus causing tp and tdp concentrations to greatly increase this phenomenon can be explained from two aspects on the one hand the sediment bed was in the liquefaction drainage state fig 9d when phosphorus flowed into the overlying water with substantial pore water on the other hand the concentration of ss increased significantly in the overlying water due to liquefaction and the fine grains with large specific surface areas enhanced the contact area and the substance exchange between the overlying water and ss fan et al 2003 causing the tp and tdp concentrations in water to increase significantly there was a significant positive correlation between tp and ss r 0 939 n 44 p 0 01 as well as between tdp and ss r 0 938 n 44 p 0 01 indicating that the tp and tdp concentrations in water were mainly affected by the ss content similar to the results of research by xia et al 2014 a concentration increase in stage ii compared to stage i b concentration increase in stage iii compared to stage i and stage ii tp and tdp indicate total phosphorus and total dissolved phosphorus 4 3 release of srp in water srp concentrations in water increased slowly in stage i fig 7a the main srp release mode in the static state was gravity consolidation drainage fig 9b and the concentration gradient in the pore water which meant srp entered overlying water through pore water seepage and static diffusion jeng and lee 2001 zhang et al 2012 causing an increase in the srp concentration in water the srp concentration showed a slowly increasing trend and did not change significantly with increasing wave height in stage ii fig 7b the srp concentration in stage ii was on average only 0 3 larger than that in stage i table 4 indicating that non liquefaction had slight influence on the srp concentration compared to that in the liquefaction stage there was a weak correlation r 0 176 n 32 p 0 01 between the concentrations of ss and srp which meant that an increase in the ss content in water had little influence on the srp concentration although the sediment bed was in the dynamic drainage consolidation stage with increasing ss content the increase in the srp concentration was not significant under relatively weak wave loading the srp concentration in water increased gradually with an increase in the wave height in stage iii fig 7c and was 0 9 31 times higher than that in stage i and 0 7 21 times higher than that in stage ii table 4 at 14 cm wave height these results indicated that sediment liquefaction significantly promoted the release of srp from the bed greatly increase the srp concentration in water the sediment bed was in the liquefaction drainage state fig 9d in which srp transported from the pore water increasing the srp concentration in water on the other hand the ss concentration increased significantly together with the fine particles in the overlying water due to liquefaction which had a significant positive correlation with srp r 0 958 n 44 p 0 01 leading to a substantial increase in the srp concentration at this stage a concentration increase in stage ii compared to stage i b concentration increase in stage iii compared to stage i and stage ii srp indicates soluble reactive phosphorus 4 4 wave influence on the tp release from sediments the tp concentration in sediments above the phosphorus layer increased and the concentration below this layer decreased after stage i fig 8 diffusion gradually occurred from the high phosphorus concentration layer to the rest brian et al 2016 meanwhile the sediment gravity consolidation drainage process also promoted the migration of phosphorus in the sediment the two factors created a high concentration area near the nutrient layer and a potential concentration gradient for phosphorus release from sediments to water the tp in the sediments underwent movement after stage ii and stage iii the effect of dynamic drainage consolidation during stage ii fig 9c and liquefied drainage during stage iii fig 9d promoted the migration and release of tp in addition sediment resuspension caused by wave action created extensive substance exchange liu 2009 especially in the liquefied state fine particles were separated out with pore water oscillation and moved into the overlying water xu et al 2011 the distribution of tp in sediments during stage ii and stage iii was obvious as shown in fig 8 5 conclusions a wave flume simulation test was carried out to study the phosphorus release from the deposition layer at a certain depth in a sediment bed under wave action the sediment bed underwent a static consolidation stage a non liquefaction stage and a liquefaction stage during which different phosphorus distribution and speciation in water and sediment were measured including tp tdp srp and the concentration of ss in water according to the comparative analysis of all stages in the wave flume test the main conclusions are as follows phosphorus in the sediment was released mainly through sediment consolidation drainage and static diffusion when the sediment bed was under static conditions with no wave action and no suspended solids and the tp tdp and srp concentrations in water were at their lowest levels when the sediment bed was in the non liquefaction state under wave loading the dynamic consolidation drainage process and the suspended sediment particles in water influence the concentration of phosphorus in water the tp concentration in water multiplies compared to that in the consolidation stage the tdp concentration increased slightly and the average srp concentration was only 0 07 times higher when the sediment bed was in the liquefaction stage under wave action the liquefaction consolidation drainage process and the suspended sediment particles in water enhanced both the phosphorus release and the phosphorus concentration in water the tp tdp and srp concentrations were 59 times 25 times and 32 times larger respectively than those in the static consolidation stage when the sediment bed was in the liquefaction state tp tdp and srp in water were greatly affected by ss and the correlations with the ss concentration were significant based on the flume test it was found that a high phosphorus concentration in the sediment layer at a certain depth caused the substantial release of phosphorus during the liquefaction stage a nitrogen study was conducted in the same setting to determine the tn tdn no3 n no2 n and nh4 n concentrations as well as the distribution of tn in the deposition layer whose results showed the same release parton as phosphorus sun 2015 sediment bed liquefaction induced

19384,the endogenous release of nutrients from marine or lacustrine sediment is an important factor in water eutrophication overlying water dynamic actions waves may lead to sediment resuspension and even sediment liquefaction especially under strong wind induced waves which may subsequently lead to the release of nutrients from sediments and contribution to water eutrophication a wave flume simulator was used to study changes in the phosphorus concentrations in the overlying water at different consolidation stages the key factors of which were the changes caused by endogenous release from a liquefied seabed the results showed that the total phosphorus tp total dissolved phosphorus tdp and soluble reactive phosphorus srp found in the liquefaction stage were 59 25 and 31 times greater respectively than those in the consolidation stage and 5 19 and 21 times greater respectively than those in the non liquefaction stage these results indicated that seabed liquefaction may lead to greater phosphorus releases from liquefied sediments into overlying water which may subsequently contribute to water eutrophication graphical abstract image 1 keywords phosphorus liquefaction flume

factor of biological productivity lürling and oosterhout 2013 the variation in phosphorus directly impacts the occurrence of eutrophication or recovery of eutrophic waters schindler 1974 previous studies have found that the endogenous recycling of phosphorus was a decisive factor to break the phosphorus limitation without a sufficient decrease in external loading perkings and underwood 2001 wu et al 2017 the release of nitrogen phosphorus and other pollutants from sediments can be influenced by static diffusion pore water drainage and sediment resuspension fan et al 1998 liu et al 2001 the sediments resuspend with water fluctuations and bioturbation e g by fish or mosquito larvae can play an important role in sediment resuspension in addition there are complex physical and chemical properties on the surface of small sized particles where adsorption and desorption effects exist which have important impacts on phosphorus concentrations in the water system reddy et al 1996 søndergaard et al 2003 qin et al 2003 phosphorous partitions more onto soil particles than in solution therefore the amount released due to resuspension is far greater than that due to static diffusion to study the influence of sediment resuspension on nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations in water researchers have conducted in situ observations james et al 2004 oscillating grid studies reddy et al 1996 and wave flume experiments zhu et al 2005a a case study in taihu lake china demonstrated that the frequent disturbance by large waves was the primary cause of endogenous phosphorus release in lake water and endogenous release plays an important role in the supply of nutrients for cyanobacterial blooms zhu et al 2005b to reduce the sediment phosphorous release waajen et al 2015 employed geoengineering measures in eutrophic ponds and the measures showed efficiency in the restoration of eutrophic waters when external phosphorus was limited previous studies focused on phosphorus concentration changes caused by surface sediment resuspension while seabed sediments are mostly made up of sand silt and clay they are prone to liquefaction under the action of strong waves if sand or silt is dominant zen and yamazaki 1990 on site observations in coastal zones have provided convincing evidence that strong wave action causes seabed liquefaction which refers to the fact that loose fine sediment are saturated with water suddenly break down under vibration and behave as liquids zen and yamazaki 1991 kudella et al 2006 groot et al 2006 mory et al 2007 using wave flume tests tzang and ou 2006 sumer et al 2006 and centrifuge tests robarts et al 1998 researchers described the liquefaction phenomena and measured the pore water pressure the results also confirmed the liquefaction of sand and silty soil under wave loading some researchers even calculated the liquefaction depths for various situations chang et al 2004 indicated that the liquefaction depth caused by a typhoon was 6 1 m for a sandy coastal seabed with relative density of dr 0 35 at a water depth of 8 6 m sun et al 2008 estimated that the liquefaction depth in the yellow river subaqueous delta silty seabed was 4 2 m at an 8 m water depth under a whole gale the liquefied sediments fluctuate with the upper water body and small sized particles such as clay gradually move upward and are finally suspended in the water xu et al 2016 thus nutrients at a certain sediment depth in addition to nutrients at the sediment surface are released into the overlying water due to liquefaction we assume that sediment liquefaction in lakes or gulfs will result in nutrient release from seabed sediments in amounts likely greater than that from sediment resuspension the objective of this study is to use a wave flume simulator to investigate the phosphorus concentration changes in overlying water during sediment liquefaction we have previously used a wave flume to simulate the release of heavy metals from liquefied sediments sun et al 2015 the current experiment tested water samples and sediment samples collected from the three stages to examine the following results 1 changes in the suspended solids ss in overlying water 2 variations in the total phosphorus tp dissolved total phosphorus tdp and soluble reactive phosphorus srp concentrations in overlying water and 3 changes in the tp content in pore water samples and sediment samples the results in this paper show that sediment liquefaction induces substantial release of phosphorus into overlying water and while the main cause of phosphorus release from sediment is pore water drainage 2 material and methods 2 1 experimental equipment a wave flume simulator was used to conduct the indoor study the flume was 14 0 m long 0 5 m wide and 1 5 m high fig 1 a wave maker was located at one end of the flume which was used to generate waves during the experiments while the other end contained riprap constructed from crushed rock with a slope of 14 to dissipate the wave energy and reduce the interference caused by wave reflection the sediment bed was placed in the middle section in the flume and was 0 6 m deep 2 6 m long and 7 5 m away from the wave generator 2 2 experimental design observations of sediment movement especially after liquefaction under waves as well as changes in water were carried out during the experiment meanwhile water and bed sediment samples were collected in turn according to a schedule to analyze the change in phosphorus concentrations and ss content by which the effect of wave action on phosphorus release in sediment could be obtained 2 2 1 preparation of the sediment bed the sediment bed of the flume experiment consisted of remolded soil from the yellow river delta with the main components of silt sand and 10 5 clay the accumulation curve of the sediment bed is shown in fig 2 and table 1 a subset of the bed sediment was predosed with phosphorous fig 3 to accomplish this 142 5 g potassium dihydrogen phosphate kh2po4 was dissolved in 13 5 l of tap water to make a solution this solution was mixed into 90 kg of dry soil to form a phosphorus dosed slurry with a total phosphorus concentration of 0 8 g kg dw the slurry was maintained without disturbance for 7 days so that the potassium dihydrogen phosphate could be incorporated into the soil through adsorption and potentially reach a stable state in which the phosphorus was completely combined with soil particles the rest of the soil was mixed with tap water in an appropriate amount so that the water content was the same 33 as that in the phosphorous dosed soil the non phosphorous dosed soil was first to be introduced into the flume when the sediment bed reached 48 0 cm in thickness the phosphorus dosed soil was transferred into the flume to form a 4 cm thick layer then another 8 cm of non phosphorous dosed soil was laid on top so that the phosphorous dosed soil layer was sandwiched in the middle of the sediment bed the total thickness of the sediment bed was 60 0 cm tap water phosphorus concentration is 0 was slowly added to the flume after completion of the sediment bed preparation until the water depth reached 40 cm slow addition to avoid disturbance of the sediment bed 2 2 2 experiment processing the flume test was conducted in three stages static consolidation stage stage i non liquefied stage stage ii and liquefaction stage stage iii stage i lasted for 8 days without wave action so that the sediment bed was left under water for static consolidation stage ii was a non liquefied stage during which the sediment bed experienced a series of four wave actions with sequential wave heights of 5 cm 8 cm 11 cm and 14 cm each wave action lasted for 180 min stage iii was the liquefaction stage a small range of disturbances was created in the sediment bed to form a local weak area under wave action the weak area would be triggered to develop sediment liquefaction in this stage the same set of four wave actions as in stage ii was also applied in stage iii in stage i water samples were collected in centrifuge tubes at 65 130 and 195 cm from the left side of the sediment bed and 15 cm above the sediment bed in triplicate in stage ii and stage iii the water samples were all collected in centrifuge tubes in triplicate at the same positions as in stage i and at the same time we used an ss sampler to collect water samples wave parameters and test process of the experiment are shown in table 2 the concentrations of each index tp tdp and srp in water were obtained at different time points under each working condition the sediment bed and water sampling sites for centrifuge tubes w1 and the ss sampler w2 are shown in fig 3 sediment core samples with length of 22 cm were collected at the end of each stage at 65 cm 130 cm and 195 cm from the left side of the sediment bed the columnar sediment samples were cut into segments from 0 to 1 cm 1 to 3 cm 19 to 21 cm and 21 to 22 cm each segment was dried and its phosphorus concentration was measured the sediment bed and locations of the sampling points are shown in fig 3 2 3 sample analysis all concentrated extracts were centrifuged at 10 000 r min in a tdl 5 a high speed centrifuge water samples were acidified with nitric acid after centrifugation and then stored at 4 c the tp tdp and srp concentrations in the water samples were analyzed using the molybdenum blue method following standardized treatments ding et al 2015 the tp content of the sediment was determined according to the method described by amit and claude 1998 after drying in air the suspended solid content in water was determined from the residual solids via filtering through whatman grade 2 qualitative filter paper 8 μm drying for 4 h at 105 c and weighing the particle size of the sediment at the bottom of the bed was determined by sieving zhao et al 2010 and by the static water sedimentation densitometer method guo et al 2016 2 4 statistical analysis to obtain the representative concentration for each working condition the analytical concentrations of the water samples were processed by monte carlo 5000 times simulation to obtain the corresponding maximum probable concentrations using the crystal ball software song et al 2012 thus the concentrations corresponding to the maximum probability were used instead as representative concentrations under each working condition the spss16 0 statistical software was used to analyze the correlation between suspended solids ss concentration and tp concentration ss concentration and tdp concentration and ss concentration and srp concentration we averaged 3 replicate water samples and 3 parallel sediment concentrations to obtain the value of every index in the overlying water and the tp in the sediment bed 3 results 3 1 influence of wave loading on the ss concentration as discussed in section 2 the sediment bed experienced two stages ii and iii of wave action under four sequentially different wave heights ss concentrations in the water at different wave heights during stages ii and iii are shown in fig 4 in stage ii the ss concentrations increased at the beginning of each wave action with different wave heights and then reached a steady state at 50 60 min with an increase in wave height the ss concentration also gradually increased for instance the ss concentrations ranged from 0 037 to 0 213 g l and 0 246 0 359 g l under 5 cm and 8 cm wave heights in stage ii respectively the ss concentrations in stage iii were considerably higher than those in stage ii compared to stage ii the ss were 0 339 0 491 g l and 0 634 1 122 g l under 5 cm and 8 cm wave heights respectively overall the ss concentrations ranged 0 037 0 588 g l in stage ii and 0 339 2 320 g l in stage iii 3 2 changes in the phosphorus concentration in water 3 2 1 changes in the tp and tdp concentrations tp concentrations in the water at different wave heights during stages i ii and iii are shown in fig 5 the tp concentration increased slowly in stage i from 0 063 to 0 195 mg l fig 5a in stage ii tp concentrations increased gradually from 0 269 to 1 430 mg l fig 5b in stage iii the tp concentration significantly increased from 0 650 to 10 603 mg l with increasing wave height fig 5c in the same way tdp concentrations in water demonstrated a similar pattern at different wave heights during the three test stages as shown in fig 6 the tdp concentration increased slowly from 0 025 to 0 137 mg l fig 6a in stage i and increased gradually from 0 074 to 0 124 mg l fig 6b in stage ii in stage iii the tdp concentration increased notably also increasing with an increase in the wave height and varying from 0 097 to 1 917 mg l fig 6c 3 2 2 changes in the srp concentration srp concentrations in water at different wave heights during stages i ii and iii are shown in fig 7 srp concentration increased slowly in stage i from 0 020 to 0 088 mg l fig 7a in stage ii the srp concentration gradually increased from 0 061 to 0 105 mg l with an increase in the wave height fig 7b in stage iii the srp concentration increased notably from 0 086 to 2 064 mg l with an increase in the wave height fig 7c 3 3 vertical profile of the phosphorus concentration in the bed sediment the tp concentrations in the sediment during stages i ii and iii are shown in fig 8 tp diffused in only a limited area during stage i but the diffusion was obvious in stage ii and stage iii fig 8 the tp concentrations in sediment during stage i stage ii and stage iii varied in the ranges of 1 32 10 5 1 60 10 4 g kg dw 6 21 10 5 1 33 10 4 g kg dw and 3 41 10 5 1 34 10 4 g kg dw respectively 4 discussion 4 1 drainage pattern of pore water in the flume test the artificial bed with high water content would consolidate due to gravity and cyclic loading during the consolidation process the sediment bed would densify as the pore water was gradually discharged by compression of soil particles leading to a decrease in the pore ratio three consolidation processes may exist that also lead to pore water movement usually out of sediment namely gravity consolidation drainage wave dynamic consolidation drainage and liquefied state drainage the gravity drainage also exists in the wave dynamic consolidation stages the sediment consolidation drainage process during the flume experiment was illustrated in fig 9 marine or lacustrine sediments are composed of solid liquid and gas the sediments have certain strength because of the mutual contact between soil particles with pore water and air in the internal porosity between the soil particles a schematic diagram of the initial sediment at the bottom of the bed prepared for this test was shown in fig 9a the sediment bed in stage i was in the gravity consolidation drainage condition in which the sediment bed was gradually compressed under gravity and pore water gradually discharged into the overlying water the three sides of the sediment bed were impermeable in this experiment and pore water could only seep through the interface of sediment and water into the overlying water fig 9b phosphorus in the pore water entered the overlying water with the movement of the pore water which increased the p concentration in the overlying water at the same time static diffusion of p from the sediment also caused an increase in the phosphorus concentration in the overlying water studies have shown that the self consolidation process is very fast and can be completed in 45 51 h shan et al 2006 as we observed in this experiment the sediment deposition was obvious in the first 1 2 days and became less evident in the following days which meant the consolidation process gradually ceased and the phosphorus concentration in overlying water became stable in stage ii when wave action was applied the bed sediment experienced dynamic consolidation drainage wave crests and troughs formed high and low water heads respectively which would allow water to seep from high levels to low levels and finally enter the overlying water fig 9c with wave circulation the dynamic consolidation drainage process continued pore water with phosphorus entered the overlying water from the sediment circularly rosenberry et al 2013 performed field tests on seepage variation in response to waves and indicated that the permeability was very high in sandy sediments 10 m from shore and was related to the transfer of matter in sediments jeng et al 2001 noted that the amount of water seepage in each wave period was closely related to the migration of pollutants in the sediments in the study of the dynamic response of the seabed to waves jeng and lee 2001 in stage ii the concentration of tp in the overlying water increased by 161 836 compared to stage i baseline conditions table 3 therefore the wave dynamic consolidation process cannot be neglected in the examination of solute transport across the sediment water interface the pore water pressure gradually increased under wave loading in stage iii and when this pressure was equal to or greater than the overlying effective stress the sediment lost its structural strength and liquefaction occurred thus the particles were suspended in pore water and flowed along with pore water fig 9d xu et al 2011 tzang et al 2009 in stage iii the phosphorus concentration in the overlying water significantly increased which was closely related to the large amount of water seeping out of the pores as well as the increase in the amount of fine sediment in the overlying water 4 2 total phosphorus and total dissolved phosphorus release in water wave disturbances in the bed can induce sediment resuspension wave disturbances were enhanced with the increase in the wave height which means more particles were released into the overlying water the resuspension process can be extreme in the liquefaction stage a large amount of fine grained sediment was released into the overlying water with pore water oscillation which had a significant impact on the phosphorus concentration in water as discussed both the tp and tdp concentrations in water increased slowly in stage i figs 5a and 6a though there was no wave action on the undisturbed sediment bed fig 8 this release of phosphorus from sediment may have been caused by both gravity consolidation drainage fig 9b and diffusion driven by the concentration gradient between pore water and overlying water as discussed by others wen et al 2008 zhang et al 2012 because the sediment was dosed with phosphorous both processes caused tp and tdp concentrations in water to increase over time the consolidation process of the bed ended and the tp and tdp concentrations in water reached a steady state which meant that after the consolidation state there was only slight discharge of water from the sediments thus the concentration of phosphorus in water scarcely changed little which we interpret as a steady state the tp and tdp concentrations in water showed gradual increases with an increase in the wave height in stage ii figs 5b and 6b the tp and tdp concentrations were low in stage i while the tp concentration increased by 1 61 3 86 times and the tdp concentrations increased by only 0 08 0 31 times in stage ii over those in stage i under experimental wave conditions table 3 indicating that the wave loading on the non liquefied sediment bed had a certain impact on the tp and tdp concentrations compared to that in the liquefaction stage under wave cycle actions the sediment bed was in the dynamic drainage consolidation state fig 9c causing phosphorus in the pore water to transfer into the overlying water meanwhile with an increase in the wave height the ss content gradually increased which had weak positive correlations with tp r 0 525 n 32 p 0 01 and tdp r 0 325 n 32 p 0 01 both factors caused the increases in the tp and tdp concentrations in water however during the non liquefaction stage the action of waves on the bed was relatively small thus the ss content in water was not enough to generate large increases in the tp and tdp concentrations the tp and tdp concentrations in water increased significantly with increases in the wave height in stage iii figs 5c and 6c the tp and tdp concentrations under the 14 cm wave height in stage iii were 59 times and 26 times higher than those in stage i respectively table 3 which indicated that liquefaction significantly enhanced the release of phosphorus causing tp and tdp concentrations to greatly increase this phenomenon can be explained from two aspects on the one hand the sediment bed was in the liquefaction drainage state fig 9d when phosphorus flowed into the overlying water with substantial pore water on the other hand the concentration of ss increased significantly in the overlying water due to liquefaction and the fine grains with large specific surface areas enhanced the contact area and the substance exchange between the overlying water and ss fan et al 2003 causing the tp and tdp concentrations in water to increase significantly there was a significant positive correlation between tp and ss r 0 939 n 44 p 0 01 as well as between tdp and ss r 0 938 n 44 p 0 01 indicating that the tp and tdp concentrations in water were mainly affected by the ss content similar to the results of research by xia et al 2014 a concentration increase in stage ii compared to stage i b concentration increase in stage iii compared to stage i and stage ii tp and tdp indicate total phosphorus and total dissolved phosphorus 4 3 release of srp in water srp concentrations in water increased slowly in stage i fig 7a the main srp release mode in the static state was gravity consolidation drainage fig 9b and the concentration gradient in the pore water which meant srp entered overlying water through pore water seepage and static diffusion jeng and lee 2001 zhang et al 2012 causing an increase in the srp concentration in water the srp concentration showed a slowly increasing trend and did not change significantly with increasing wave height in stage ii fig 7b the srp concentration in stage ii was on average only 0 3 larger than that in stage i table 4 indicating that non liquefaction had slight influence on the srp concentration compared to that in the liquefaction stage there was a weak correlation r 0 176 n 32 p 0 01 between the concentrations of ss and srp which meant that an increase in the ss content in water had little influence on the srp concentration although the sediment bed was in the dynamic drainage consolidation stage with increasing ss content the increase in the srp concentration was not significant under relatively weak wave loading the srp concentration in water increased gradually with an increase in the wave height in stage iii fig 7c and was 0 9 31 times higher than that in stage i and 0 7 21 times higher than that in stage ii table 4 at 14 cm wave height these results indicated that sediment liquefaction significantly promoted the release of srp from the bed greatly increase the srp concentration in water the sediment bed was in the liquefaction drainage state fig 9d in which srp transported from the pore water increasing the srp concentration in water on the other hand the ss concentration increased significantly together with the fine particles in the overlying water due to liquefaction which had a significant positive correlation with srp r 0 958 n 44 p 0 01 leading to a substantial increase in the srp concentration at this stage a concentration increase in stage ii compared to stage i b concentration increase in stage iii compared to stage i and stage ii srp indicates soluble reactive phosphorus 4 4 wave influence on the tp release from sediments the tp concentration in sediments above the phosphorus layer increased and the concentration below this layer decreased after stage i fig 8 diffusion gradually occurred from the high phosphorus concentration layer to the rest brian et al 2016 meanwhile the sediment gravity consolidation drainage process also promoted the migration of phosphorus in the sediment the two factors created a high concentration area near the nutrient layer and a potential concentration gradient for phosphorus release from sediments to water the tp in the sediments underwent movement after stage ii and stage iii the effect of dynamic drainage consolidation during stage ii fig 9c and liquefied drainage during stage iii fig 9d promoted the migration and release of tp in addition sediment resuspension caused by wave action created extensive substance exchange liu 2009 especially in the liquefied state fine particles were separated out with pore water oscillation and moved into the overlying water xu et al 2011 the distribution of tp in sediments during stage ii and stage iii was obvious as shown in fig 8 5 conclusions a wave flume simulation test was carried out to study the phosphorus release from the deposition layer at a certain depth in a sediment bed under wave action the sediment bed underwent a static consolidation stage a non liquefaction stage and a liquefaction stage during which different phosphorus distribution and speciation in water and sediment were measured including tp tdp srp and the concentration of ss in water according to the comparative analysis of all stages in the wave flume test the main conclusions are as follows phosphorus in the sediment was released mainly through sediment consolidation drainage and static diffusion when the sediment bed was under static conditions with no wave action and no suspended solids and the tp tdp and srp concentrations in water were at their lowest levels when the sediment bed
