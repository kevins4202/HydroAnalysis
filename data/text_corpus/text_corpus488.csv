2440,the first aim of the present paper is the determination of the magnitude annual variation and spatial distribution of skill in seasonal hindcasts of runoff and discharge in the entire continent of south america we evaluated 35 years of hindcasts generated with the variable infiltration capacity vic hydrological model forced with seas5 hindcasts initial conditions of terrestrial water and so called pseudo observations were computed with a reference i e historic simulation skill was determined with monthly temporal resolution for the entire annual cycle and mostly using the pseudo observations for verification the second aim of the paper is the explanation of skill in terms of its sources namely meteorological forcing and the initial conditions therefore two sets of restricted hindcasts which isolate the sources of skill were analysed the seas5 precipitation hindcasts exhibit significant skill even at the longest lead times 7 months beyond the first lead month we found significant skill in 13 43 of the grid cells depending on target and lead month levels of skill are higher in the full hindcasts significant skill in 31 89 of the grid cells at the continental scale more of the skill is caused by the forcing than by the initial conditions the runoff hindcasts are skilful in large parts of the continent in a 1000 km wide band along the north coast of the continent and in southeast south america most of the skill is due to the forcing a typical feature of these regions is an increase of skill with lead time during specific parts of the year which is against the common tendency in argentina and north chile most of the skill in the runoff hindcasts can be attributed to the initial conditions of soil moisture verification with real observations of discharge broadly confirmed the skill pattern obtained with pseudo observations keywords modelling seasonal forecasts precipitation streamflow south america skill 1 introduction the water flowing through south america s rivers is extensively exploited for the generation of hydropower in the following eight countries more than 40 of the electricity production comes from hydroelectric sources in 2015 paraguay 100 colombia 65 venezuela 64 brazil 62 uruguay 60 suriname 60 ecuador 51 and peru 49 index mundi 2015 hence in this continent hydrological forecasting can potentially be very useful for the optimisation of energy generation canales et al 2017 but also for other purposes like the mitigation of the impact of floods for irrigation management for crop selection and for optimising navigability of rivers in low flow conditions hydrological forecasting practices in brazil are summarised in fan et al 2016 these authors state that most systems in brazil limit the forecast horizon to that of the short and medium range continental scale streamflow hindcasts for these time ranges were evaluated by siqueira et al 2020 and siqueira et al 2021 the topic of the present study are seasonal streamflow forecasts which have a temporal range between more than two weeks and about a year doblas reyes et al 2013 a number of scientific studies deal with seasonal hydrological forecast systems developed for parts of south america and their skill tucci et al 2003 generated seasonal forecasts with a rainfall runoff model forced with bias corrected forecasts of rainfall produced by the global climate model of the brazilian agency for climate prediction cptec they compared their forecasts for a part of the catchment of the uruguay river with a benchmark of climatological forecasts and found reductions in the mean square error of 37 for monthly and 54 for 3 monthly flows a seasonal forecast system for discharge within the amazon catchment was described by paiva et al 2013 they forced a distributed hydrological model mgb iph in forecast mode with an ensemble of historical precipitation data and assimilated in situ discharge data to optimise the initial state of the model based on a skill analysis for a 2 year period they demonstrated the potential for developing streamflow forecasts with long lead times in the large brazilian river basins quedi and fan 2020 generated two sets of sub seasonal hindcasts up to lead day 46 with mgb iph forced by ensembles of historical observations and climate model european centre for medium range weather forecasts i e ecmwf hindcasts respectively for six locations in the catchment of the paraná river they demonstrated that skill was larger for ensemble hindcasts than for deterministic hindcasts and that up to forecast day 30 skill was higher for hindcasts forced with climate model output than for hindcasts forced with historical observations other authors developed statistical models to generate seasonal hydrological forecasts an example is the study by uvo and graham 1998 who developed statistical models to forecast austral autumn discharge in north eastern south america from sea surface temperature sst north of the amazon river model skill was higher than south of this river according to uvo and graham 1998 pacific ssts were found to be generally better predictors than atlantic ssts and the lag between sst and discharge anomalies measured 3 9 months souza filho and lall 2003 used sst fields for the pacific and atlantic ocean as predictor to forecast discharge at six gaging locations in ceara northeast brazil they found that their streamflow forecasts were useful for lead times of up to 18 months significant skill at such long leads was confirmed by the statistical models of lima and lall 2010 who predicted hydro energy flow electrical energy that would be produced if the inflow to reservoirs was converted into energy without efficiency losses in brazil on the basis of ssts and the thermocline structure of the pacific ocean these models were shown to have significant skill in brazil south of about 22 s for lead times up to 20 months all of these papers on seasonal streamflow forecasts only consider parts of south america so papers on forecasts for the entire continent are missing however assuming that skill in streamflow forecasts may at least partly be caused by skill in precipitation forecasts it is useful to summarise some results of continental scale precipitation studies coelho et al 2006 osman and vera 2017 bombardi et al 2018 and gubler et al 2019 all find that precipitation forecasts have skill in at least two regions namely the northern part of the continent and southeast south america roughly the southernmost part of brazil and adjacent parts of paraguay and argentina there are slight differences between these studies though according to coelho et al 2006 who combined a statistical with several dynamical models resolution skill in austral summer rainfall in the north is confined to the guianas osman and vera 2017 analysed the output from nine climate models the skill that they found in the north covered in austral summer a larger area extending along the entire north coast of the continent whereas in austral winter is was more or less confined to the guianas they also found skill in west ecuador both in summer and in winter bombardi et al 2018 investigated skill in sets of austral summer precipitation hindcasts produced by the ecmwf at several different spatial resolutions which all show skill in the mentioned regions and in west equador gubler et al 2019 evaluated the performance of ecmwf s seas5 precipitation hindcasts for south america using carefully selected observations for verification they found a maximum of skill in west ecuador followed in sequence of decreasing skill by southwest colombia the lower part of the catchment of the amazon northwest colombia the north eastern tip of brazil and south brazil most if not all of this skill is linked to the el niño southern oscillation enso e g coelho et al 2006 stated that skill in precipitation forecasts occurs in regions and seasons with a strong enso signal in local precipitation according to manzanas et al 2014 the predictability of enso and its teleconnection has been identified as the main source of predictability at the seasonal scale in south america the present paper has two aims the first is to determine the levels annual variation and spatial distribution of skill in seasonal hindcasts of streamflow in the entire continent of south america the second aim is to explain existing skill in terms of its potential sources namely meteorological forcing and the initial conditions of terrestrial water to achieve these goals we will use a fully dynamical system called wushp wageningen university seamless hydrological prediction system consisting of two elements namely a hydrological model vic the variable infiltration capacity model and its meteorological forcing which are ensembles of hindcasts generated by a seasonal forecast system in this case ecmwf s seas5 johnson et al 2019 wushp has been the major tool in an earlier study of skill in hydrological hindcasts for europe greuell et al 2018 and 2019 the main difference with the current study being the meteorological forcing used system 4 in the earlier study instead of its successor seas5 in the current one conclusion from greuell et al 2019 was the dominance of the initial conditions and hence a small role of the forcing in the explanation of skill in european river flow indeed in europe precipitation itself was shown to have a very low level of predictability however global studies e g manzanas et al 2014 demonstrate that compared to europe skill in precipitation hindcasts is much higher in large parts of the tropics among which a substantial part of the south american continent it is hence expected that forcing will contribute more to skill in river flow forecasts in south america than in europe the present study will quantify this contribution another difference with europe is a much larger spatial variation in precipitation across the south american continent ranging between almost no precipitation in parts of northern chile and approx 11 m y locally in west columbia fig 1 the structure of the paper is as follows section 2 describes the discharge observations the model system and the methods of analysis and for the isolation of sources of skill the magnitude annual variation and spatial distribution of skill in the different sets of hindcasts are determined in sect 3 using so called pseudo observations i e data generated during a historic simulation for verification the section concludes with the determination of actual skill in discharge i e the skill found by using real discharge observations a discussion sect 4 and a conclusions sect 5 section finish the paper 2 observations and methods 2 1 observations of river discharge for the assessment of skill with real discharge observations we acquired all data available at the global runoff data centre 56068 koblenz germany grdc in march 2019 these data were completed with data from five stations in brazil made available by the brazilian national electricity system operator ons there was no spatial overlap between the data from these two sources we filled these observations into a netcdf file with a lat lon grid identical to that of the vic grid with its resolution of 0 5 0 5 the location of each station was matched to the routing network incorporated in vic ddm30 see döll and lehner 2002 on the basis of its geographical location and the area of the catchment if more than one observation station matched with the same model grid cell the station with the largest catchment area according to the meta data of the observations was selected see greuell et al 2018 for more details for the evaluation of the reference simulation and of the hindcasts with these observations sect 3 2 data were selected for the period of the hindcasts 1981 2015 a minimum number of 21 observations i e years was set resulting in 338 cells with observations 2 2 the model system in wushp greuell et al 2018 terrestrial hydrology is simulated with the variable infiltration capacity model vic see hamman et al 2018 developed at the university of washington seattle usa for the current study we used a branch of vic developed at wageningen university vic wur 1 0 1 2019 see droppers et al 2020 the model was run across a domain extending from 32 5 to 83 5 w and from 58 s to 14 5 n including 6526 land based cells of 0 5 0 5 see maps in e g fig 2 for the present study we run vic with a three hourly simulation step forcing it with a gridded data set of three hourly meteorological data 7 variables precipitation atmospheric temperature and vapor pressure wind speed incoming short and long wave radiation and surface pressure water may leave the vic soil either along the surface surface runoff or at the bottom baseflow or sub surface runoff the model computes the sum of surface and sub surface runoff which is simply termed runoff in this paper the transport of runoff to the largest river in each cell is then taken into account with a unit hydrograph lohmann et al 1996 finally the flow of the water through the river routing network connecting the model cells is termed discharge here and simulated with the linearised st venant equation floodplains see paiva et al 2013 are not considered in vic vic was calibrated by nijssen et al 2001 in a crude way in the sense that they sub divided south america into two parts with internally constant values of the parameters set by calibration we used their calibration parameters for this study wushp consists of two simulation branches a single reference simulation and the hindcasts the reference simulation is an attempt to produce an optimal simulation of historic conditions this run serves the dual aim of creating the pseudo observations for the skill analysis see sect 2 3 and of creating a best estimate of the temporally varying model state of terrestrial water i e of soil moisture snow and surface water those states are then used to initialise the hindcasts in the reference simulation vic was forced by the watch forcing data era interim wfdei weedon et al 2014 a gridded data set based on observations which are interpolated in time and space using era interim re analyses dee et al 2011 the wfdei data include two versions for precipitation based on different sets of observations among which we selected the gpcc data schneider et al 2014 the reference simulation covers the period 1979 2016 of which the first two years were not used in the skill analyses since these only served to spin up the state of terrestrial water the reference simulation was validated using the discharge observations in analogy with the skill evaluation of the hindcasts see sect 3 we focused on interannual variations in summary it was found that these were very well simulated for all months of the year in southeast south america in the region around rio de janeiro and in a part of west ecuador the reference simulation was least successful in the southwestern part of amazonia while other parts of brazil show an intermediate quality details of this analysis are reported in the supplementary material figs s1 s3 the second simulation branch of the system consists of the hindcasts their forcing was derived from seasonal hindcasts of meteorological variables from the fifth generation of ecmwf s seasonal forecasting system seas5 hereafter see johnson et al 2019 we downloaded data with mainly daily resolution and then disaggregated the result to 3 hourly data in order to consider daily variations in incoming short wave radiation and atmospheric temperature for short wave radiation this is done by computing the ratio between daily radiation at the surface and the top of atmosphere and then for each 3 hourly interval multiplying the radiation at the top of atmosphere with that ratio the amplitude of the daily temperature cycle is assumed to be linear in the short wave radiation flux other variables were assumed to be constant during each day the seas5 hindcasts consist of 25 members they have a forecast horizon of 7 months start and are initialised on the first day of every month and for the present study the initialisation dates cover the period from 1981 to 2015 the hydrological hindcasts exactly reproduce the scheme of the available seas5 hindcasts since the downloaded seas5 hindcasts cover 35 years with 12 initialisation dates each and consist of 25 members each set of hydrological hindcasts consisted of 10 500 simulations vic was run in natural flow mode i e river regulation irrigation and other anthropogenic influences were not considered a re evaluation of our earlier and similar work for europe greuell et al 2018 showed that bias correction of the meteorological forcing in this case sys4 the predecessor of seas5 had a negligible effect on association skill because in the present study the evaluation of skill is limited to association skill because biases in seas5 are significantly smaller than in sys4 stockdale et al 2018 and because bias correction methods are mathematical techniques that are not based on physics and may hence harm the physical consistency of hydrological simulations using bias corrected forcing ehret et al 2012 we forced vic with the uncorrected seas5 output 2 3 method of analysis the analysis is restricted to runoff and discharge whereas runoff represents only local hydrological processes discharge aggregates hydrological processes occurring in the entire basin upstream of a particular cell see the definitions of runoff and discharge in the previous sub section from the observations and the saved model output consisting both of daily means monthly means were computed skill analyses were performed by first collecting all monthly mean values for a single target and lead month then computing the metrics for that collection and finally repeating this procedure for all combinations of the 12 target and 7 lead months by separating the data this way effects of seasonality i e predictable and regular changes that recur every year do not affect the computed skill unlike many studies that compute skill per target season consisting of three consecutive months e g coelho et al 2006 and doblas reyes et al 2013 we analysed skill per target and lead month the higher temporal resolution of the skill metrics thus achieved enables a more accurate determination of the beginning and end of periods of skill moreover skill at a monthly resolution provides the possibility to determine the consistency of the skill we define robust skill as skill that persists during at least two consecutive target months in hindcasts starting in the same month or skill for a single target month during at least two consecutive lead months hence with different but consecutive initialisation months in accordance with e g infanti and kirtman 2016 we designated the first month of the hindcasts as lead month zero so target month number is equal to the number of the month of initialisation plus the lead month number in the analyses of this paper we mostly exclude lead month 0 since it is more the domain of medium range and extended range weather forecasts rather than that of seasonal forecasts while the seas5 precipitation hindcasts were verified with the wfdei the hydrological hindcasts were not only verified with real observations but also with so called pseudo observations i e the output of the reference simulation this approach was discussed in some detail by greuell et al 2018 pseudo observations would be the observations in a virtual world in which physical properties of the land surface were exactly equal to those of the hydrological model and in which the temporal and spatial distributions of the meteorological forcing variables were exactly equal to the forcing of the reference simulation pseudo observations have the advantages of being complete in the spatial and in the temporal domain and are available for all model variables the use of pseudo observations for verification is widespread see e g bierkens and van beek 2009 shukla and lettenmaier 2011 singla et al 2011 shukla et al 2014 and quedi and fan 2020 van dijk et al 2013 introduced the terms theoretical and actual skill for skill assessed with pseudo and real observations respectively in this paper the assessment of hydrological skill focusses on the assessment of association skill defined by murphy 1993 as the overall strength of the linear relationship between individual pairs of forecasts and observations this is done by computing the pearson correlation coefficient between the observations and the median values of the hindcasts which will be referred to hereafter as correlation coefficient or r the r of climatological hindcasts versus observations is 0 so if such hindcasts are taken as benchmark r of the investigated hindcasts is equal to its own skill score a skill score is 0 for benchmark forecasts and 1 when all forecasts are equal to the observations hence technically speaking r measures both association and association skill in this paper the term skill full will be used to mean skill that is significant at the 95 confidence level 2 4 method for the isolation of sources of skill the sources of skill in hydrological variables were determined with a method that essentially is a copy of the strategy used by greuell et al 2019 two sources are distinguished namely meteorological forcing and initial conditions the latter consists of the states of soil moisture snow and water in the rivers resolved by the routing network at the beginning of the simulations for a good understanding of the method it is useful to realise that if the forcing and the initial conditions are identical for all years the streamflow hindcasts are identical for all years such hindcasts would have no association skill r 0 to isolate the skill due to the two different sources two extra sets of hindcasts called restricted hindcasts hereafter were generated in addition to the full streamflow hindcasts fullsh described above sect 2 2 these restricted hindcasts each consisting of 10 500 computer runs like the fullsh are the initsh in which the meteorological forcing is identical for all years hence skill due to forcing is eliminated and all skill is due only to the initial conditions which are identical to the initial conditions in the fullsh the meteosh in which the initial conditions are identical for all years hence skill due to the initial conditions is eliminated and all skill is due to the forcing which is identical to the forcing in the fullsh the initsh and the meteosh are then compared to the fullsh in which skill may originate from both sources of skill and can be considered as sensitivity experiments the following details should be noted like in the fullsh the forcing of the initsh consists of an ensemble of 25 seas5 hindcast members more specifically from the 1981 hindcast we took its member 1 1981 m1 and then continued with 1982 m2 and 1983 m3 we then skipped a year went on with 1985 m4 and 1986 m5 and skipped a year again then five members were taken similarly from the next 7 years 1988 1994 their members 6 10 etc in the meteosh the initial conditions are equal to the 35 year average of the initial conditions in the reference simulation in the construction of the restricted hindcasts the twelve calendar months were separately considered so the terms identical for all years and 35 year average refer to quantities for a single calendar month 3 results 3 1 analysis of skill in runoff hindcasts this section presents the skill of the runoff hindcasts using the pseudo observations for verification to attribute the skill to its sources skill obtained with the full hindcasts fullsh is compared with the skill of the two sets of restricted hindcasts to enhance understanding of the causes of skill skill in the seas5 precipitation hindcasts is also evaluated 3 1 1 skill in the fullsh for initialisation in february maps of the association skill of the hindcasts were produced for all combinations of the 12 initialisation months and the 7 lead months to provide some examples the seven panels of fig 2 show the skill of the fullsh runoff hindcasts initialised on february 1 as a function of lead time similar graphs for all dates of initialisation are presented in figs s4 s15 of the supplementary material in lead month 0 significant skill is found across almost the entire domain 98 of the cells after that there is an overall trend of decreasing skill with lead time both in terms of magnitude and regional extent a good example of this trend is the coastal area of the pacific from ecuador southward there are however also some remarkable exceptions to this trend when regionally skill increases with lead time examples are found in south brazil south of 25 s and the caatinga the north easternmost part of brazil where skill increases with lead time when the hindcasts proceed from target month june to july and from march to april respectively this also occurs at the continental scale where significant skill increases from april 51 of the cells to may 55 at the longest lead time lead month 6 the fraction of cells with significant skill reaches 38 3 1 2 temporal variation of spatially aggregated skill fig 3 provides a continental scale summary of the skill in runoff in each of the different hindcast types and in the precipitation hindcasts for all target and lead months fig 3a which presents the fullsh shows that many conclusions drawn from the evaluation of the hindcasts initialised in february fig 2 hold for hindcasts starting in other months as well in lead month 0 the hindcasts have skill in almost the entire domain 88 100 depending on the target month there is an overall trend of decreasing skill with lead time and the expected fraction of cells with falsely detected significant skill in the case of random hindcasts 5 is substantially exceeded even at the longest lead time at the hindcast horizon a useable signal can still be found over 31 42 of the continent depending on the target month like the hindcasts starting on february 1st fig 2 the increase in skill with increasing lead time from april to may occurs also for the initialisation dates november december and january 1st which makes this feature robust considering that hindcasts starting at different times of the year are independent black lines in fig 3a show annual cycles of skill for lead times between one and four months there is an annual maximum of the spatial extent of skill for target months from may to july since the reference simulation provides the initial state for both the fullsh and the initsh as well as the pseudo observations for their verification hydrological output computed with these two types of hindcasts is perfect at the time of initialisation this explains the high levels of skill in the initsh fig 3b during the first lead month in these restricted hindcasts skill then gradually degrades with lead time due to the decaying memory of the initial conditions to almost reach the expected level in the case of random hindcasts 5 at the end of the hindcasts in the relatively dry half of the year from may to october for the continental mean precipitation the initial conditions have a longer lasting influence so the rate of decay in skill is smaller and the limit of 5 is not approached because by construction they cannot contain any skill due to initial conditions the meteosh fig 3c exhibit much less skill in the first lead month than the fullsh and the initsh however after the first lead month the skill in the meteosh decays at a relatively small rate which suggests a relatively small rate of decay in the skill of the meteorological forcing indeed fig 3d shows a considerable amount of skill in the seas5 precipitation hindcasts at all leads beyond lead month 0 we found skill in precipitation in 13 43 of the grid cells depending on target and lead month in fact both the meteosh and the precipitation hindcasts show many of the typical features of the fullsh the expected fraction of cells with falsely detected significant skill in the case of random hindcasts 5 is substantially exceeded even at the longest lead time skill increases with lead time from april to may for each initialisation date from november 1 to february 1 and also march 1 in the meteosh and for lead times between one and four months there is an annual maximum of the spatial extent of skill from may to july only in may in the precipitation hindcasts we conclude that these three skill features in the fullsh are at least partly caused by corresponding skill features in the hindcasts of precipitation fig 4 enables a direct comparison of the different hindcasts the highest levels of skill are exhibited by the fullsh in which 52 of the continent has significant skill when averaged over all combinations of target and lead months beyond lead month 0 the fullsh have more skill than either the initsh or the meteosh for all individual combinations of target and lead months not shown here during the first two lead months the initial conditions initsh cause more skill than the meteorological forcing meteosh for leads beyond lead month 2 the reverse is true when averaged over all combinations of target and lead months beyond lead month 0 a higher percentage of the continent has significant skill in the meteosh 38 than the initsh 34 so at the continental scale more of the seasonal forecast skill in the fullsh is due to meteorological forcing than to initial conditions this is in sharp contract with the conclusions from our earlier study with wushp for europe greuell et al 2019 where initial conditions of soil moisture form the dominant source of skill in runoff snow contributes significantly to skill from april to july and forcing is relatively unimportant also see prodhomme et al 2016 the meteosh have more significant skill than the hindcasts of precipitation 38 against 25 of the continent when averaged over all combinations of target and lead months beyond lead month 0 several factors may contribute to this difference skill in the meteosh may be enhanced by skill in forcing variables other than precipitation also an indirect effect plays a role i e the storage of skill due to skill in the forcing at leads before that of the considered lead month into the hydrological state snow and or soil moisture at the beginning of the considered lead month which then contributes to skill in runoff see greuell et al 2019 finally skill in runoff is enhanced because it is determined with pseudo observations which leads to more skill than verification with real observations as for precipitation 3 1 3 spatial variation of temporally aggregated skill the spatial distribution of skill in the different types of runoff hindcasts and in the precipitation hindcasts is mapped in fig 5 as the fraction of all combinations of the 12 target and the 6 lead months beyond lead month 0 for which skill is significant in the fullsh fig 5a spatial variation in skill is large a sharp contrast exists in ecuador where the crest of the andes separates an area to its west with significant skill for all combinations of target and lead months from an area to its east where some model cells have no skill for almost any combination a target and a lead month west ecuador forms the beginning of a zone with substantial skill that runs from there southward along the coast of the pacific in peru and north chile and continues then to patagonia crossing the continent from west to the east at about 37 s this zone more or less coincides with the driest part of the continent fig 1 a second area exhibiting a large fraction of skill consists of large parts of paraguay and south brazil south of 20 s an area roughly coinciding with a region that is often called southeast south america this area is relatively wet fig 1 large parts of north and middle argentina also show relatively much skill there is however little skill in the wet part of chile south of about 37 s and in uruguay within the tropical north eastern half of the continent the spatial distribution of skill does not seem to be related to the precipitation climate for this part of the continent the map shows two distinct zones fractions of cases with significant skill are large in a band following the entire north coast of south america and extending some 1000 km inland parallel to this band and to its south lies a band of little skill also some 1000 km wide and running from the atlantic to the pacific with a branch into the part of colombia southeast of this country s cordilleras only the coastal area of ecuador breaks this band of little skill fig 5b and c depict the spatial distributions of the contributions to runoff skill due to the initial conditions and the meteorological forcing respectively the following conclusions can be drawn forcing explains most of the skill along the north coast of the continent and in southeast south america in both of these regions initial conditions hardly contribute to skill with the exception of the caatinga along the coasts of ecuador and north peru forcing dominates but initial conditions also contribute to skill in argentina most of the skill in runoff can be attributed to the initial conditions however some parts of patagonia have skill due to both of its sources while in the region along the border with brazil most of the skill is due to the forcing a complex pattern emerged in peru bolivia and chile where almost all skill along the coast in south peru and north chile is due to initial conditions forcing dominates on the altiplano of peru and bolivia and both initial conditions and forcing are important in central chile the patterns of skill in the restricted hindcasts are linked to other spatial patterns whereas most of the areas with much skill in the initsh fig 5b have a relatively dry climate fig 1 the patterns of skill in the meteosh fig 5c largely resemble those of the skill in the precipitation hindcasts fig 5d the latter resemblance supports the assumption that precipitation is the most important among the meteorological forcing variables causing interannual variations in runoff except in regions such as west ecuador where fractions of cases with skill in the precipitation hindcasts approach or reach their maximum possible value 1 0 in most of the continent fractions of cases with skill are larger in the meteosh than in the precipitation hindcasts possible reasons for this were discussed in the previous sub section 3 1 4 analysis of regional skill to complement the evaluation of temporal variations in skill for the entire continent sect 3 1 2 skill is analysed in some detail for two selected regions these are illustrative examples of extreme cases in which skill is mainly caused by the meteorological forcing amazonia guianas and by the initial conditions north chile respectively in addition the supplement fig s16 presents the evaluation for a third region southeast south america where the dominant source of skill also resides in the forcing selection of the regions was made based on two criteria namely 1 most cells in the region have a large amount of significant skill in the fullsh fig 5a and 2 a region must have a relatively homogeneous climate the selected regions are depicted in the maps e g fig 5 the regional evaluation was conducted by first averaging monthly values of the relevant variables across the region and then computing the skill metrics on the basis of these regional means hence variations within each region were not considered in the evaluation fig 6 depicts relevant results for a region called the amazonia guianas here including most of the catchment of the amazon river north of the main river itself branco trombetas paru and jari branches the guiana highlands and the areas north of this elevated region this is an example of a region where virtually all of the skill in the runoff hindcasts is due to skill in the meteorological forcing the region is characterised by wet mean annual precipitation is 2246 mm tropical climates a climates according to köppen for this region seas5 predicts precipitation with significant skill for all combinations of lead and target months with the exception of lead times longer than 2 months for target month april fig 6b two periods have extremely high association skill in the precipitation hindcasts for all lead times namely january and february all r 0 68 and september and october all r 0 58 like in the continental scale evaluation we found increases in skill with lead time these occur here from target month april to may from august to september and from december to january and are found in hindcasts with different dates of initialisation which makes this feature robust patterns of temporal variation in skill for fullsh runoff fig 6c closely follow those for precipitation indicating a causal link for instance all three mentioned increases in skill with lead time in precipitation are also found for runoff however for runoff the correlation coefficient is higher than for precipitation for 83 of all combinations of target months and lead months beyond lead month 0 this is visualised in fig 6d which compares the skills of the different sets of hydrological hindcasts and the precipitation hindcasts for two lead months 1 and 4 the initsh quickly loose skill with increasing lead time as a result in lead month 4 only three target months have a correlation coefficient above the significance level in the initsh skill is least from april to august independent of the lead month this period coincides almost with the wettest part of the year the explanation is that the skill due to initial conditions is eroded by unpredicted interannual variations in precipitation and that larger interannual variations in precipitation lead to faster erosion the meteosh are much more skillful than the initsh for all leads except for lead month 0 comparing the meteosh with the fullsh these exhibit year around almost identical skill for lead month 1 and even identical skill at longer leads we hence conclude that in amazonia guianas knowledge of interannual variations in the initial conditions do not enhance the quality of the runoff hindcasts beyond the second lead month fig 7 depicts relevant results for north chile between 25 and 31 s north chile is an example of a region where most of the skill in the runoff hindcasts is due to skill in the initial hydrological state the region has an arid mean annual precipitation is 66 mm cold climate bwk climate according to köppen most of the annual precipitation 80 falls in the austral winter from may to august during these 4 months 29 of the precipitation falls as snow because this snow partly melts after the winter and because most of the runoff occurs with long delays through basal flow the mean annual cycle of model runoff has a small amplitude fig 7a hindcasts of precipitation exhibit poor skill but levels of skill tend to be somewhat higher though mostly not above the level of significance during the local wet season fig 7b runoff hindcasts fig 7c keep excellent skill r 0 71 for all leads as long as the forecast period runs entirely within the local dry season from september to april this demonstrates that the system maintains a high performance as long as rain fall rates are small which causes the initial states of soil moisture and snow to almost entirely determine interannual variations in runoff and river discharge hindcasts initialised between february 1 and may 1 loose skill during the wet season when skill due to initial conditions quickly decreases due to the interannually varying and hardly predictable amounts of rainfall here the word hardly matters as this is the only season with small amounts of skill in the precipitation hindcasts due to these small amounts of skill the fullsh are mostly better than the initsh as long as the hindcasts partly run during the rainy season which is for lead month 1 from june to september and for lead month 4 from june to december fig 7d it is remarkable though that if the runoff hindcasts run entirely outside the rainy season the initsh have more skill than the fullsh in all cases for lead month 1 all seven dry season cases show this tendency since these have different dates of initialisation these are 7 independent cases making the superior skill in the initsh robust we explain the effect as follows both in the fullsh and in the initsh the forcing has no skill i e no signal however in the fullsh the forcing varies interannually which acts as noise leading to loss of skill while in the initsh the forcing is identical each year so skill is not affected the same effect initsh having more association skill than the fullsh was also found in the study of greuell et al 2019 for europe at longer leads we conclude that in this region for some combinations of lead and target month the fullsh should be preferred while in other cases the initsh should be preferred 3 2 actual skill of the hindcasts for the theoretical skill evaluation of section 3 1 pseudo observations of runoff were used to better assess the value of these results the skill of the hindcasts was also determined with real observations i e actual skill since real observations quantify discharge it is necessary to first switch from runoff to discharge so fig 8 a summarises the theoretical skill of discharge in the same way as skill in runoff was summarised in fig 5a the two figures show a high degree of similarity in terms of the patterns and the magnitude of the skill there are however subtle differences which were also found and explained in our earlier study for europe greuell et al 2018 firstly the continental mean fraction of cases with skill is slightly higher for discharge 0 543 in fig 8a than for runoff 0 519 in fig 5a this difference occurs due to the general tendency of decreasing skill with lead time and because discharge is delayed with respect to runoff and hence has a level of skill at a particular lead time corresponding to the level of skill in runoff at an earlier lead time the second difference occurs because rivers aggregate the skill or lack of skill in runoff from the whole upstream part of their basin as a result in the discharge skill map fig 8a cells containing rivers with large basins may contrast against adjacent cells if these contain rivers with a small local basin examples of more skill than their surroundings are the lower reaches of the amazon river and parts of the purus and the madeira river both in the southwestern part of the amazon catchment some examples of rivers with less skill than their surroundings are found east of the andes in patagonia where local rivers have considerable skill while rivers originating in the andes hardly have skill as they collect most of their water in the andes where local rivers have little skill fig 8b summarises skill in discharge using real observations setting a minimum number of 21 observations i e years unfortunately the observations are not well spread across the continent almost all were collected in brazil west ecuador and north and west argentina however within the limitation of no information from the blind regions within the domain the skill pattern obtained with pseudo observations fig 8a is confirmed three out of five stations in west ecuador have skill in at least 90 of the cases while in brazil there is more skill in the north and the south and less skill in a zone that runs in mid brazil from the western border of the country to the shore of the atlantic while the patterns of theoretical and actual skill are similar actual skill is generally less a station mean fraction of cases with significant skill of 0 415 than theoretical skill a continental mean fraction of 0 543 the reasons were analysed in some detail by van dijk et al 2013 and greuell et al 2018 the spatial pattern of actual skill of our seasonal hindcasts differs largely from that at the short to medium range found by siqueira et al 2021 the latter their fig 5 shows more skill in east brazil and northwest colombia and less in west brazil the cause of the small amount of skill in mid brazil differs between the western and the eastern part of this zone from the araguaia river to the shore of the atlantic the performance of the reference simulation see the supplement figs s1 s3 is relatively good meaning that when forced with meteorological observations the model has substantial skill in simulating interannual variations in discharge however skill in the precipitation hindcasts for this region is quite poor fig 5d hence we suggest that east of the araguaia river the lack of theoretical and actual skill in the discharge hindcasts resides in a lack of skill in the forcing and not so much in deficiencies in the hydrological model however in the part of amazonia to the west of the araguaia river model simulations of interannual variations in historical discharge are generally poor see the supplement figs s1 s3 suggesting substantial flaws in the model this must affect the hindcasts in addition for this region the performance of the hydrological hindcasts is low due to the small amount of skill in the precipitation hindcasts obviously these conclusions disregard seasonal and spatial details but they could provide a guideline for future developments of wushp in mid brazil 4 discussion fig 9 summarises the results of the present study by distinguishing between cells with different potential of making successful seasonal forecasts of runoff and by distinguishing between cells where different strategies for the production of the forecasts fullsh meteosh or initsh could or should be applied this was determined by evaluating the differences in skill between the three sets of streamflow hindcasts the confidence level at which correlation coefficients from two different sets of hindcasts really differed was determined with a t test using the paired function from the r package psych revelle 2019 if two correlation coefficients were according to the test different with a confidence level of 95 the two values were classified as less and greater than each other for each cell 72 cases were considered all combinations of target and lead months beyond lead month 0 the following four types of cells are distinguished beige cells with a relatively small potential for forecasts these are cells with a low fraction of cases with significant skill 40 in the fullsh issuing seasonal hydrological forecasts is less meaningful or is meaningful in part of the year only other colours cells with a relatively high potential for forecasts these are cells with a high fraction of cases with significant skill 40 in the fullsh blue cells for which forecasts based on meteosh could be issued instead of the fullsh these are cells for which in 75 of the cases with significant skill in the fullsh the skill in the meteosh is not less than the skill in the fullsh orange cells for which forecasts based on initsh could be issued instead of the fullsh these are cells for which in 75 of the cases with significant skill in the fullsh the skill in the initsh is not less than the skill in the fullsh brown cells for which forecasts based on fullsh should be issued these are cells for which in 25 of the cases with significant skill in the fullsh that skill is statistically superior to the skill in both the meteosh and the initsh from the point of view of high association skill thus neglecting aspects like the potential economic or social value of the forecasts the most promising regions for the production of seasonal forecasts of streamflow are those with a high concentration of blue orange or brown cells in blue cells abundant in the northern part of the continent and in southeast south america skill is not or hardly affected by replacing the interannually varying initial conditions fullsh by their mean over the whole 35 year period meteosh in other words the initial conditions hardly contribute to the skill so efforts to improve the initial conditions of snow soil moisture or surface water e g by assimilation of measurements or satellite data have a small potential of improving the forecasts note however that the computational burden of creating the interannually varying initial conditions with the model is low since only a single simulation is needed to achieve this in orange cells abundant in dry parts of argentina chile bolivia and paraguay forcing hardly contributes to skill here skill is not or hardly affected by replacing the interannually varying seas5 forcing as in fullsh by a selected ensemble of seas5 forcings as in initsh that is identical for all years for operational purposes in regions with many orange cells initsh could be issued which avoids the need to download operational seasonal forecasts produced by a climate model and couple these to a hydrological model as discussed in section 3 1 4 skill in the initsh may be even superior to skill in the fullsh in cases when the forcing contains no skill at all hence in those cases initsh are not just preferable because their production is easier but also because they have more skill than fullsh it is worth noting that the initsh can be replaced by ensemble streamflow predictions esp which are identical to the initsh except that their forcing is selected from meteorological observations and not from meteorological hindcasts greuell et al 2019 found that the association skill of esp is virtually identical to that of the initsh which is essentially due to the fact that forcings of both types of hindcasts do not vary from year to year finally in brown cells abundant in the caatinga on the altiplano of bolivia and peru in the coastal region of rio de janeiro and são paulo in east argentina and in mid chile there is a considerable increase in skill both by prescribing the interannually varying initial conditions generated by the hydrological model and by forcing the model with climate model forecasts so for operational purposes forecasts based on the fullsh should be issued fig 9 presents the opportunities of making seasonal forecasts of runoff which is similar to streamflow in sub grid scale rivers a similar figure for discharge is compared to fig 9 in the supplement fig s17 the figures for runoff and discharge show a high degree of similarity in terms of their patterns several limitations of fig 9 should be mentioned first these results are strictly speaking only valid for wushp however we expect that maps like fig 9 produced by other systems would roughly look similar since basically the distribution shown is linked to the spatial distribution of the climate and to teleconnections which determine the skill of the meteorological forecasts the second limitation is that the results depend on the thresholds chosen which is somewhat similar to stating that the presence of skill and the difference of the various sets of hindcasts relative to each other depend on the target and the lead month so while for example fig 9 might suggest that in north chile initsh could replace the fullsh without loss of skill this is not true for all combinations of target and lead month as shown in section 3 1 4 the patchiness of the map in fig 9 is among others due to these limitations and the limited number of hindcast years used for the evaluation we suggest interpreting the related recommendations for operational forecast systems with care in vic the initial hydrological conditions include the water stored in three components namely the soil the snow pack and surface water contained in rivers that are resolved in the routing network because of the large computational costs of each set of restricted hindcasts the effects on skill of the three water components were not separated however we argue that mostly soil moisture is the dominant component in our reference simulation almost all snow packs with a depth above 10 mm water equivalent occur in the andes south of 25 s hence in this region the initial amount of snow may have contributed to skill in the hindcasts but in the rest of the continent snow should be a negligible factor as to the surface water component most of our results are presented in terms of runoff because runoff comprises only water before it flows into the rivers of the routing network initial amounts of surface water do not affect runoff they have an effect on modelled discharge though in vic river flow is simulated with the linearised st venant s equation setting the flow speed equal to a constant 1 m s consequently in our simulations for south america maximum travel times of surface water from source to ocean are about 2 months so the effect of the initial state of the surface water on modelled discharge is erased across the entire domain within 2 months we conclude that in the hindcasts presented here all of the initial state skill in runoff and discharge beyond the first lead month is due to soil moisture with a possible contribution by snow to runoff and discharge hindcasts in the andes south of 25 s and a likely contribution by surface water to discharge hindcasts for lead month 1 in river sections further than 2500 km from their source a remarkable and robust feature found during the present study are increases in skill with lead time for two of the regions that were highlighted in sect 3 1 4 and in the supplement fig s16 the feature is remarkable since skill usually decreases with lead time and it is robust since it appears for the same target months in hindcasts starting with different initialisation dates the increases occur both in amazonia guianas and in southeast south america at times of the year that differ between these two regions increases in skill with lead time in europe found by greuell et al 2018 have been linked to snow melt but since that process is negligible in amazonia guianas and in southeast south america the increases in skill must have another explanation obviously the explanation resides in the precipitation hindcasts as these also show this feature trends in the data form a possible explanation of increases in skill with lead time namely at times of the year when they become more statistically significant than before to investigate the effect of trends we detrended the time series of both precipitation and runoff underlying figs 6 and s13 with the method described in greuell et al 2019 the relevant panels of figs 6 and s16 were then redrawn with the detrended data supplement fig s18 and the figures before and after detrending were compared differences were negligible and in particular the increases in skill with lead time were almost identical so we conclude that the increases are not due to trends in the data we speculate that the discussed local increases in skill with lead time are due to monthly variations in the strength of relevant teleconnections between the mentioned regions and ocean areas with strong enso signals in the sst for the detection of this feature evaluation of the skill with monthly resolution instead of the common 3 monthly resolution was crucial a detailed analysis of the spatial and temporal extent of this feature and of the mechanism causing it are outside the scope of this study in the present study hindcast skill was assessed by the evaluation of association between observations and forecasts it is important to mention that association is closely related to discrimination and resolution since all three properties quantify though in different ways whether higher or lower observations correspond to higher lower forecasts other desired components of the runoff and discharge forecasts namely no bias and a correct amount of spread of the ensemble members as well as the aggregate effect of all components are considered in the appendix there are two reasons why we focus on a discrimination type metric firstly forecasts lacking association discrimination resolution are useless by principle free after weigel and mason 2011 because they are not better than climatological forecasts secondly by post processing the hydrological output see e g gneiting et al 2005 and boucher et al 2015 bias and incorrect amount of spread can to a considerable extent be corrected for this is not possible for discrimination type limitations citing barnston et al 2012 case to case discrimination as indicated by correlation skill is often considered the most important component of final skill since many calibration bias related problems are correctable while discrimination reflects a more fundamental ability of the prediction model in the appendix we evaluate part of our hindcasts in terms of other metrics namely the bias the continuous ranked probability skill crps and its skill score version crpss which are measures of aggregate skill and alpha a measure of reliability it is shown that the raw i e non post processed streamflow hindcasts generally have large biases and spread errors and therefore hardly have significant skill in terms of the crps and generally possess very low levels of reliability we demonstrate that meaningful values of the crpss are only obtained after post processing after post processing with the method proposed by gneiting et al 2005 values of the crpss and the level of reliability are much higher showing the effectiveness of the post processing and the necessity to post process streamflow forecasts if these are to be issued in terms of absolute values most importantly we found a narrow relation between association r before post processing and aggregate skill crpss after post processing similar relations between r and roc a measure of discrimination for categorical forecasts based on theoretical considerations have been identified by yang et al 2021 therefore if discharge could have been post processed for all grid cells results evaluated with either r or crpss would have been qualitatively very similar the implication is that r is a suitable indicator of the aggregate skill or lack of skill of post processed streamflow hindcasts the advantage of using r is that it can easily be computed for all cells of the domain whereas a meaningful evaluation in terms of the crpss requires postprocessing which is time consuming and restricted to the small fraction of cells with observations in summary by only computing r and hence analysing association skill a useful indication of the potential total skill of post processed seasonal forecasts is obtained thanks to the functional relationship between r and the crpss we further believe that r or other metrics quantifying discrimination skill are more suitable than the crps for comparing different types of hindcasts like the fullsh with the restricted hindcasts because they exclude the effect of largely removable biases and spread errors while only quantifying the effect of the most fundamental property of forecasts deeper investigations concerning the suitability of different metrics for the evaluation of sensitivity experiments could be the topic of future studies basically multiple roads towards improving the hindcasts made with wushp i e producing hindcasts with more actual skill exist these can be subdivided into improving the meteorological forcing and improving the hydrological simulations the ecmwf hindcasts could be replaced by multi model hindcasts see e g hagedorn et al 2005 or despite being of high quality guimarães et al 2021 be improved themselves an important aspect to consider in the context of improved seasonal meteorological forecasts is a realistic quantification of moisture recycling for their precipitation large parts of the amazon basin and regions to the south of it depend considerably on recycling of rainfall through evaporation of intercepted and transpired water from vegetation zemp et al 2014 this means that precipitation is controlled in a complex way by vegetation and changes therein staal et al 2018 zemp et al 2014 the recycling is quantitatively not well understood yet and impacted by land use change i e deforestation it is tempting to speculate that the region of intense moisture recycling coincides with the zone of little skill in the hindcasts that crosses the continent from colombia to east brazil fig 5a and 9 advances in parameterizing processes related to recycling e g sakschewski et al 2020 might improve seasonal forecasts of precipitation in this zone hydrological simulations may be improved by a more thorough calibration of vic by assimilation of soil moisture e g retrieved from satellite data see alvarez garreton et al 2015 and or of surface water measurements mazrooei and sankarasubramanian 2019 into the initial state and by making structural changes to vic wur we consider among others replacing the routing scheme the current scheme of vic wur assumes a constant flow speed and hence misses the simulation of an important aspect of river routing namely the storage of surface water in floodplains floodplains cause considerable attenuation and delay of flood waves and may add considerable memory to many south american rivers paiva et al 2013 however parameterisation of flood plains as described by e g paiva et al 2013 and siqueira et al 2018 is computationally expensive within the framework of seasonal hindcasts for the whole continent of course our suggestions for improving evapotranspiration from the amazon forest in the ecmwf forecast model also apply to vic 5 conclusions in this paper we presented a study on seasonal streamflow forecasts for south america by assessing the association skill of hindcasts produced by a dynamical system wushp consisting of meteorological forcing with seas5 hindcasts and the hydrological model vic we also computed the contributions by the meteorological forcing and the initial conditions to the skill of the complete system we found significant skill in the runoff hindcasts even at the forecast horizon 7 months in large parts of the south american continent 31 43 depending on the target month a zone of substantial skill roughly coincides with the driest part of the continent running from west ecuador to patagonia in these regions most of the skill tends to arise from the initial conditions two other regions with high amounts of skill are southeast south america and a band following the entire north coast of south america and extending some 1000 km inland in these two regions most of the skill is due to the forcing this paper ends with two recommendations the first is to evaluate skill of seasonal forecasts with monthly instead of the often applied seasonal resolution in the present study the enhanced temporal resolution was shown to be essential for the accurate determination of the beginnings and endings of periods of skill the finer temporal resolution also resulted in the detection of sudden local increases of skill with lead time the present study also leads to the recommendation that in some specific regions and parts of the year parts of a dynamical forecast system like wushp are redundant or at least hardly increase skill when and where skill is hardly determined by the initial conditions their calculation with a reference simulation becomes superfluous when and where skill is hardly determined by the forcing seasonal forecasts of the forcing computed with a climate model could be replaced by a selection of historical forcings from the climate model each year the same or by observations each year the same as in esp data availability statement monthly means of the streamflow hindcasts are stored at https doi org 10 17026 dans zqw ubx4 and scripts used for the analysis of

the hindcasts with the crpss to complement the evaluation of the hindcasts in terms of association runoff skill was also assessed by means of the continuous ranked probability score crps and its skill score version the crpss see mason and stephenson 2008 which are aggregate measures of performance meaning that they are sensitive to bias spread and association for perfect forecasts crps 0 and crpss 1 with decreasing performance the crps increases and the crpss decreases for benchmark forecasts climatological hindcasts in this study crpss 0 fig a1 maps the fraction of all 72 combinations of the 12 target and the 6 lead months beyond lead month 0 for which skill of the fullsh determined with the crpss is significant at the 95 confidence level the continental mean fraction is 0 08 much less than the same fraction for significant association skill 0 52 see fig 5a and not much more than the expected fraction of cells with falsely detected significant skill in the case of random hindcasts 0 05 the large difference between skill quantified by r and by the crpss is due to the uncorrected biases and spread errors in the hindcasts the effect of post processing the hydrological output is demonstrated by applying the regression method of gneiting et al 2005 to the hindcasts of inflow into the itaipu reservoir at the border of brazil and paraguay see fig 1 results are shown in fig a2 for lead months 1 2 and 3 while a similar figure for longer leads can be found in the supplement fig s19 for all combinations of lead and target months the method is very effective in reducing the bias figs a2a and s18a and increasing reliability figs a2b and s18b where we notice that forecasts become more reliable if both biases and dispersion errors are reduced here reliability is quantified by alpha renard et al 2010 an index that may range between 0 and 1 and increases with increasing reliability whereas the raw hindcasts have a mean alpha of 0 335 across all combinations of target and lead months beyond lead month 0 the mean value increased to 0 911 after post processing the latter value is less than the value for perfectly reliable hindcasts 1 but almost identical to the mean alpha of our climatological hindcasts 0 909 the reduced biases and increased reliability have a huge effect on the crpss figs a2c and s18c which is negative for all but 1 out of 72 raw hindcasts after post processing the crpss is positive in 53 cases out of 72 of which 6 cases are significantly better at 95 confidence than the benchmark the lowest panel figs a2d and s18d shows that r and hence association skill decrease slightly due post processing we found that this was entirely due to the leave one year out strategy applied during the post processing more importantly comparison of panels c and d suggests that cases with significant aggregate skill after post processing as indicated by the crpss tend to correspond to cases with significant association skill as indicated by r the relation between r and the crpss is further investigated by post processing the fullsh hindcasts using all of the observations in the catchments of the paraná and the são francisco rivers that were available for the present study 38 stations with time series 21 years this provided a total 2693 post processed cases all 472 cases with significant skill in terms of r before and in terms of the crpss after post processing were plotted fig a3 the scatter plot suggests a functional relationship in which the crpss rises monotonically with r the relatively small amount of scatter around the indicated functional relationship suggests that after post processing the crpss does not provide much additional information to the information already provided by r and vice versa hence r is suitable as indicator of the aggregate skill or lack of skill of post processed streamflow hindcasts and possesses the advantage that it can be computed without the need to actually perform any post processing

2440,the first aim of the present paper is the determination of the magnitude annual variation and spatial distribution of skill in seasonal hindcasts of runoff and discharge in the entire continent of south america we evaluated 35 years of hindcasts generated with the variable infiltration capacity vic hydrological model forced with seas5 hindcasts initial conditions of terrestrial water and so called pseudo observations were computed with a reference i e historic simulation skill was determined with monthly temporal resolution for the entire annual cycle and mostly using the pseudo observations for verification the second aim of the paper is the explanation of skill in terms of its sources namely meteorological forcing and the initial conditions therefore two sets of restricted hindcasts which isolate the sources of skill were analysed the seas5 precipitation hindcasts exhibit significant skill even at the longest lead times 7 months beyond the first lead month we found significant skill in 13 43 of the grid cells depending on target and lead month levels of skill are higher in the full hindcasts significant skill in 31 89 of the grid cells at the continental scale more of the skill is caused by the forcing than by the initial conditions the runoff hindcasts are skilful in large parts of the continent in a 1000 km wide band along the north coast of the continent and in southeast south america most of the skill is due to the forcing a typical feature of these regions is an increase of skill with lead time during specific parts of the year which is against the common tendency in argentina and north chile most of the skill in the runoff hindcasts can be attributed to the initial conditions of soil moisture verification with real observations of discharge broadly confirmed the skill pattern obtained with pseudo observations keywords modelling seasonal forecasts precipitation streamflow south america skill 1 introduction the water flowing through south america s rivers is extensively exploited for the generation of hydropower in the following eight countries more than 40 of the electricity production comes from hydroelectric sources in 2015 paraguay 100 colombia 65 venezuela 64 brazil 62 uruguay 60 suriname 60 ecuador 51 and peru 49 index mundi 2015 hence in this continent hydrological forecasting can potentially be very useful for the optimisation of energy generation canales et al 2017 but also for other purposes like the mitigation of the impact of floods for irrigation management for crop selection and for optimising navigability of rivers in low flow conditions hydrological forecasting practices in brazil are summarised in fan et al 2016 these authors state that most systems in brazil limit the forecast horizon to that of the short and medium range continental scale streamflow hindcasts for these time ranges were evaluated by siqueira et al 2020 and siqueira et al 2021 the topic of the present study are seasonal streamflow forecasts which have a temporal range between more than two weeks and about a year doblas reyes et al 2013 a number of scientific studies deal with seasonal hydrological forecast systems developed for parts of south america and their skill tucci et al 2003 generated seasonal forecasts with a rainfall runoff model forced with bias corrected forecasts of rainfall produced by the global climate model of the brazilian agency for climate prediction cptec they compared their forecasts for a part of the catchment of the uruguay river with a benchmark of climatological forecasts and found reductions in the mean square error of 37 for monthly and 54 for 3 monthly flows a seasonal forecast system for discharge within the amazon catchment was described by paiva et al 2013 they forced a distributed hydrological model mgb iph in forecast mode with an ensemble of historical precipitation data and assimilated in situ discharge data to optimise the initial state of the model based on a skill analysis for a 2 year period they demonstrated the potential for developing streamflow forecasts with long lead times in the large brazilian river basins quedi and fan 2020 generated two sets of sub seasonal hindcasts up to lead day 46 with mgb iph forced by ensembles of historical observations and climate model european centre for medium range weather forecasts i e ecmwf hindcasts respectively for six locations in the catchment of the paraná river they demonstrated that skill was larger for ensemble hindcasts than for deterministic hindcasts and that up to forecast day 30 skill was higher for hindcasts forced with climate model output than for hindcasts forced with historical observations other authors developed statistical models to generate seasonal hydrological forecasts an example is the study by uvo and graham 1998 who developed statistical models to forecast austral autumn discharge in north eastern south america from sea surface temperature sst north of the amazon river model skill was higher than south of this river according to uvo and graham 1998 pacific ssts were found to be generally better predictors than atlantic ssts and the lag between sst and discharge anomalies measured 3 9 months souza filho and lall 2003 used sst fields for the pacific and atlantic ocean as predictor to forecast discharge at six gaging locations in ceara northeast brazil they found that their streamflow forecasts were useful for lead times of up to 18 months significant skill at such long leads was confirmed by the statistical models of lima and lall 2010 who predicted hydro energy flow electrical energy that would be produced if the inflow to reservoirs was converted into energy without efficiency losses in brazil on the basis of ssts and the thermocline structure of the pacific ocean these models were shown to have significant skill in brazil south of about 22 s for lead times up to 20 months all of these papers on seasonal streamflow forecasts only consider parts of south america so papers on forecasts for the entire continent are missing however assuming that skill in streamflow forecasts may at least partly be caused by skill in precipitation forecasts it is useful to summarise some results of continental scale precipitation studies coelho et al 2006 osman and vera 2017 bombardi et al 2018 and gubler et al 2019 all find that precipitation forecasts have skill in at least two regions namely the northern part of the continent and southeast south america roughly the southernmost part of brazil and adjacent parts of paraguay and argentina there are slight differences between these studies though according to coelho et al 2006 who combined a statistical with several dynamical models resolution skill in austral summer rainfall in the north is confined to the guianas osman and vera 2017 analysed the output from nine climate models the skill that they found in the north covered in austral summer a larger area extending along the entire north coast of the continent whereas in austral winter is was more or less confined to the guianas they also found skill in west ecuador both in summer and in winter bombardi et al 2018 investigated skill in sets of austral summer precipitation hindcasts produced by the ecmwf at several different spatial resolutions which all show skill in the mentioned regions and in west equador gubler et al 2019 evaluated the performance of ecmwf s seas5 precipitation hindcasts for south america using carefully selected observations for verification they found a maximum of skill in west ecuador followed in sequence of decreasing skill by southwest colombia the lower part of the catchment of the amazon northwest colombia the north eastern tip of brazil and south brazil most if not all of this skill is linked to the el niño southern oscillation enso e g coelho et al 2006 stated that skill in precipitation forecasts occurs in regions and seasons with a strong enso signal in local precipitation according to manzanas et al 2014 the predictability of enso and its teleconnection has been identified as the main source of predictability at the seasonal scale in south america the present paper has two aims the first is to determine the levels annual variation and spatial distribution of skill in seasonal hindcasts of streamflow in the entire continent of south america the second aim is to explain existing skill in terms of its potential sources namely meteorological forcing and the initial conditions of terrestrial water to achieve these goals we will use a fully dynamical system called wushp wageningen university seamless hydrological prediction system consisting of two elements namely a hydrological model vic the variable infiltration capacity model and its meteorological forcing which are ensembles of hindcasts generated by a seasonal forecast system in this case ecmwf s seas5 johnson et al 2019 wushp has been the major tool in an earlier study of skill in hydrological hindcasts for europe greuell et al 2018 and 2019 the main difference with the current study being the meteorological forcing used system 4 in the earlier study instead of its successor seas5 in the current one conclusion from greuell et al 2019 was the dominance of the initial conditions and hence a small role of the forcing in the explanation of skill in european river flow indeed in europe precipitation itself was shown to have a very low level of predictability however global studies e g manzanas et al 2014 demonstrate that compared to europe skill in precipitation hindcasts is much higher in large parts of the tropics among which a substantial part of the south american continent it is hence expected that forcing will contribute more to skill in river flow forecasts in south america than in europe the present study will quantify this contribution another difference with europe is a much larger spatial variation in precipitation across the south american continent ranging between almost no precipitation in parts of northern chile and approx 11 m y locally in west columbia fig 1 the structure of the paper is as follows section 2 describes the discharge observations the model system and the methods of analysis and for the isolation of sources of skill the magnitude annual variation and spatial distribution of skill in the different sets of hindcasts are determined in sect 3 using so called pseudo observations i e data generated during a historic simulation for verification the section concludes with the determination of actual skill in discharge i e the skill found by using real discharge observations a discussion sect 4 and a conclusions sect 5 section finish the paper 2 observations and methods 2 1 observations of river discharge for the assessment of skill with real discharge observations we acquired all data available at the global runoff data centre 56068 koblenz germany grdc in march 2019 these data were completed with data from five stations in brazil made available by the brazilian national electricity system operator ons there was no spatial overlap between the data from these two sources we filled these observations into a netcdf file with a lat lon grid identical to that of the vic grid with its resolution of 0 5 0 5 the location of each station was matched to the routing network incorporated in vic ddm30 see döll and lehner 2002 on the basis of its geographical location and the area of the catchment if more than one observation station matched with the same model grid cell the station with the largest catchment area according to the meta data of the observations was selected see greuell et al 2018 for more details for the evaluation of the reference simulation and of the hindcasts with these observations sect 3 2 data were selected for the period of the hindcasts 1981 2015 a minimum number of 21 observations i e years was set resulting in 338 cells with observations 2 2 the model system in wushp greuell et al 2018 terrestrial hydrology is simulated with the variable infiltration capacity model vic see hamman et al 2018 developed at the university of washington seattle usa for the current study we used a branch of vic developed at wageningen university vic wur 1 0 1 2019 see droppers et al 2020 the model was run across a domain extending from 32 5 to 83 5 w and from 58 s to 14 5 n including 6526 land based cells of 0 5 0 5 see maps in e g fig 2 for the present study we run vic with a three hourly simulation step forcing it with a gridded data set of three hourly meteorological data 7 variables precipitation atmospheric temperature and vapor pressure wind speed incoming short and long wave radiation and surface pressure water may leave the vic soil either along the surface surface runoff or at the bottom baseflow or sub surface runoff the model computes the sum of surface and sub surface runoff which is simply termed runoff in this paper the transport of runoff to the largest river in each cell is then taken into account with a unit hydrograph lohmann et al 1996 finally the flow of the water through the river routing network connecting the model cells is termed discharge here and simulated with the linearised st venant equation floodplains see paiva et al 2013 are not considered in vic vic was calibrated by nijssen et al 2001 in a crude way in the sense that they sub divided south america into two parts with internally constant values of the parameters set by calibration we used their calibration parameters for this study wushp consists of two simulation branches a single reference simulation and the hindcasts the reference simulation is an attempt to produce an optimal simulation of historic conditions this run serves the dual aim of creating the pseudo observations for the skill analysis see sect 2 3 and of creating a best estimate of the temporally varying model state of terrestrial water i e of soil moisture snow and surface water those states are then used to initialise the hindcasts in the reference simulation vic was forced by the watch forcing data era interim wfdei weedon et al 2014 a gridded data set based on observations which are interpolated in time and space using era interim re analyses dee et al 2011 the wfdei data include two versions for precipitation based on different sets of observations among which we selected the gpcc data schneider et al 2014 the reference simulation covers the period 1979 2016 of which the first two years were not used in the skill analyses since these only served to spin up the state of terrestrial water the reference simulation was validated using the discharge observations in analogy with the skill evaluation of the hindcasts see sect 3 we focused on interannual variations in summary it was found that these were very well simulated for all months of the year in southeast south america in the region around rio de janeiro and in a part of west ecuador the reference simulation was least successful in the southwestern part of amazonia while other parts of brazil show an intermediate quality details of this analysis are reported in the supplementary material figs s1 s3 the second simulation branch of the system consists of the hindcasts their forcing was derived from seasonal hindcasts of meteorological variables from the fifth generation of ecmwf s seasonal forecasting system seas5 hereafter see johnson et al 2019 we downloaded data with mainly daily resolution and then disaggregated the result to 3 hourly data in order to consider daily variations in incoming short wave radiation and atmospheric temperature for short wave radiation this is done by computing the ratio between daily radiation at the surface and the top of atmosphere and then for each 3 hourly interval multiplying the radiation at the top of atmosphere with that ratio the amplitude of the daily temperature cycle is assumed to be linear in the short wave radiation flux other variables were assumed to be constant during each day the seas5 hindcasts consist of 25 members they have a forecast horizon of 7 months start and are initialised on the first day of every month and for the present study the initialisation dates cover the period from 1981 to 2015 the hydrological hindcasts exactly reproduce the scheme of the available seas5 hindcasts since the downloaded seas5 hindcasts cover 35 years with 12 initialisation dates each and consist of 25 members each set of hydrological hindcasts consisted of 10 500 simulations vic was run in natural flow mode i e river regulation irrigation and other anthropogenic influences were not considered a re evaluation of our earlier and similar work for europe greuell et al 2018 showed that bias correction of the meteorological forcing in this case sys4 the predecessor of seas5 had a negligible effect on association skill because in the present study the evaluation of skill is limited to association skill because biases in seas5 are significantly smaller than in sys4 stockdale et al 2018 and because bias correction methods are mathematical techniques that are not based on physics and may hence harm the physical consistency of hydrological simulations using bias corrected forcing ehret et al 2012 we forced vic with the uncorrected seas5 output 2 3 method of analysis the analysis is restricted to runoff and discharge whereas runoff represents only local hydrological processes discharge aggregates hydrological processes occurring in the entire basin upstream of a particular cell see the definitions of runoff and discharge in the previous sub section from the observations and the saved model output consisting both of daily means monthly means were computed skill analyses were performed by first collecting all monthly mean values for a single target and lead month then computing the metrics for that collection and finally repeating this procedure for all combinations of the 12 target and 7 lead months by separating the data this way effects of seasonality i e predictable and regular changes that recur every year do not affect the computed skill unlike many studies that compute skill per target season consisting of three consecutive months e g coelho et al 2006 and doblas reyes et al 2013 we analysed skill per target and lead month the higher temporal resolution of the skill metrics thus achieved enables a more accurate determination of the beginning and end of periods of skill moreover skill at a monthly resolution provides the possibility to determine the consistency of the skill we define robust skill as skill that persists during at least two consecutive target months in hindcasts starting in the same month or skill for a single target month during at least two consecutive lead months hence with different but consecutive initialisation months in accordance with e g infanti and kirtman 2016 we designated the first month of the hindcasts as lead month zero so target month number is equal to the number of the month of initialisation plus the lead month number in the analyses of this paper we mostly exclude lead month 0 since it is more the domain of medium range and extended range weather forecasts rather than that of seasonal forecasts while the seas5 precipitation hindcasts were verified with the wfdei the hydrological hindcasts were not only verified with real observations but also with so called pseudo observations i e the output of the reference simulation this approach was discussed in some detail by greuell et al 2018 pseudo observations would be the observations in a virtual world in which physical properties of the land surface were exactly equal to those of the hydrological model and in which the temporal and spatial distributions of the meteorological forcing variables were exactly equal to the forcing of the reference simulation pseudo observations have the advantages of being complete in the spatial and in the temporal domain and are available for all model variables the use of pseudo observations for verification is widespread see e g bierkens and van beek 2009 shukla and lettenmaier 2011 singla et al 2011 shukla et al 2014 and quedi and fan 2020 van dijk et al 2013 introduced the terms theoretical and actual skill for skill assessed with pseudo and real observations respectively in this paper the assessment of hydrological skill focusses on the assessment of association skill defined by murphy 1993 as the overall strength of the linear relationship between individual pairs of forecasts and observations this is done by computing the pearson correlation coefficient between the observations and the median values of the hindcasts which will be referred to hereafter as correlation coefficient or r the r of climatological hindcasts versus observations is 0 so if such hindcasts are taken as benchmark r of the investigated hindcasts is equal to its own skill score a skill score is 0 for benchmark forecasts and 1 when all forecasts are equal to the observations hence technically speaking r measures both association and association skill in this paper the term skill full will be used to mean skill that is significant at the 95 confidence level 2 4 method for the isolation of sources of skill the sources of skill in hydrological variables were determined with a method that essentially is a copy of the strategy used by greuell et al 2019 two sources are distinguished namely meteorological forcing and initial conditions the latter consists of the states of soil moisture snow and water in the rivers resolved by the routing network at the beginning of the simulations for a good understanding of the method it is useful to realise that if the forcing and the initial conditions are identical for all years the streamflow hindcasts are identical for all years such hindcasts would have no association skill r 0 to isolate the skill due to the two different sources two extra sets of hindcasts called restricted hindcasts hereafter were generated in addition to the full streamflow hindcasts fullsh described above sect 2 2 these restricted hindcasts each consisting of 10 500 computer runs like the fullsh are the initsh in which the meteorological forcing is identical for all years hence skill due to forcing is eliminated and all skill is due only to the initial conditions which are identical to the initial conditions in the fullsh the meteosh in which the initial conditions are identical for all years hence skill due to the initial conditions is eliminated and all skill is due to the forcing which is identical to the forcing in the fullsh the initsh and the meteosh are then compared to the fullsh in which skill may originate from both sources of skill and can be considered as sensitivity experiments the following details should be noted like in the fullsh the forcing of the initsh consists of an ensemble of 25 seas5 hindcast members more specifically from the 1981 hindcast we took its member 1 1981 m1 and then continued with 1982 m2 and 1983 m3 we then skipped a year went on with 1985 m4 and 1986 m5 and skipped a year again then five members were taken similarly from the next 7 years 1988 1994 their members 6 10 etc in the meteosh the initial conditions are equal to the 35 year average of the initial conditions in the reference simulation in the construction of the restricted hindcasts the twelve calendar months were separately considered so the terms identical for all years and 35 year average refer to quantities for a single calendar month 3 results 3 1 analysis of skill in runoff hindcasts this section presents the skill of the runoff hindcasts using the pseudo observations for verification to attribute the skill to its sources skill obtained with the full hindcasts fullsh is compared with the skill of the two sets of restricted hindcasts to enhance understanding of the causes of skill skill in the seas5 precipitation hindcasts is also evaluated 3 1 1 skill in the fullsh for initialisation in february maps of the association skill of the hindcasts were produced for all combinations of the 12 initialisation months and the 7 lead months to provide some examples the seven panels of fig 2 show the skill of the fullsh runoff hindcasts initialised on february 1 as a function of lead time similar graphs for all dates of initialisation are presented in figs s4 s15 of the supplementary material in lead month 0 significant skill is found across almost the entire domain 98 of the cells after that there is an overall trend of decreasing skill with lead time both in terms of magnitude and regional extent a good example of this trend is the coastal area of the pacific from ecuador southward there are however also some remarkable exceptions to this trend when regionally skill increases with lead time examples are found in south brazil south of 25 s and the caatinga the north easternmost part of brazil where skill increases with lead time when the hindcasts proceed from target month june to july and from march to april respectively this also occurs at the continental scale where significant skill increases from april 51 of the cells to may 55 at the longest lead time lead month 6 the fraction of cells with significant skill reaches 38 3 1 2 temporal variation of spatially aggregated skill fig 3 provides a continental scale summary of the skill in runoff in each of the different hindcast types and in the precipitation hindcasts for all target and lead months fig 3a which presents the fullsh shows that many conclusions drawn from the evaluation of the hindcasts initialised in february fig 2 hold for hindcasts starting in other months as well in lead month 0 the hindcasts have skill in almost the entire domain 88 100 depending on the target month there is an overall trend of decreasing skill with lead time and the expected fraction of cells with falsely detected significant skill in the case of random hindcasts 5 is substantially exceeded even at the longest lead time at the hindcast horizon a useable signal can still be found over 31 42 of the continent depending on the target month like the hindcasts starting on february 1st fig 2 the increase in skill with increasing lead time from april to may occurs also for the initialisation dates november december and january 1st which makes this feature robust considering that hindcasts starting at different times of the year are independent black lines in fig 3a show annual cycles of skill for lead times between one and four months there is an annual maximum of the spatial extent of skill for target months from may to july since the reference simulation provides the initial state for both the fullsh and the initsh as well as the pseudo observations for their verification hydrological output computed with these two types of hindcasts is perfect at the time of initialisation this explains the high levels of skill in the initsh fig 3b during the first lead month in these restricted hindcasts skill then gradually degrades with lead time due to the decaying memory of the initial conditions to almost reach the expected level in the case of random hindcasts 5 at the end of the hindcasts in the relatively dry half of the year from may to october for the continental mean precipitation the initial conditions have a longer lasting influence so the rate of decay in skill is smaller and the limit of 5 is not approached because by construction they cannot contain any skill due to initial conditions the meteosh fig 3c exhibit much less skill in the first lead month than the fullsh and the initsh however after the first lead month the skill in the meteosh decays at a relatively small rate which suggests a relatively small rate of decay in the skill of the meteorological forcing indeed fig 3d shows a considerable amount of skill in the seas5 precipitation hindcasts at all leads beyond lead month 0 we found skill in precipitation in 13 43 of the grid cells depending on target and lead month in fact both the meteosh and the precipitation hindcasts show many of the typical features of the fullsh the expected fraction of cells with falsely detected significant skill in the case of random hindcasts 5 is substantially exceeded even at the longest lead time skill increases with lead time from april to may for each initialisation date from november 1 to february 1 and also march 1 in the meteosh and for lead times between one and four months there is an annual maximum of the spatial extent of skill from may to july only in may in the precipitation hindcasts we conclude that these three skill features in the fullsh are at least partly caused by corresponding skill features in the hindcasts of precipitation fig 4 enables a direct comparison of the different hindcasts the highest levels of skill are exhibited by the fullsh in which 52 of the continent has significant skill when averaged over all combinations of target and lead months beyond lead month 0 the fullsh have more skill than either the initsh or the meteosh for all individual combinations of target and lead months not shown here during the first two lead months the initial conditions initsh cause more skill than the meteorological forcing meteosh for leads beyond lead month 2 the reverse is true when averaged over all combinations of target and lead months beyond lead month 0 a higher percentage of the continent has significant skill in the meteosh 38 than the initsh 34 so at the continental scale more of the seasonal forecast skill in the fullsh is due to meteorological forcing than to initial conditions this is in sharp contract with the conclusions from our earlier study with wushp for europe greuell et al 2019 where initial conditions of soil moisture form the dominant source of skill in runoff snow contributes significantly to skill from april to july and forcing is relatively unimportant also see prodhomme et al 2016 the meteosh have more significant skill than the hindcasts of precipitation 38 against 25 of the continent when averaged over all combinations of target and lead months beyond lead month 0 several factors may contribute to this difference skill in the meteosh may be enhanced by skill in forcing variables other than precipitation also an indirect effect plays a role i e the storage of skill due to skill in the forcing at leads before that of the considered lead month into the hydrological state snow and or soil moisture at the beginning of the considered lead month which then contributes to skill in runoff see greuell et al 2019 finally skill in runoff is enhanced because it is determined with pseudo observations which leads to more skill than verification with real observations as for precipitation 3 1 3 spatial variation of temporally aggregated skill the spatial distribution of skill in the different types of runoff hindcasts and in the precipitation hindcasts is mapped in fig 5 as the fraction of all combinations of the 12 target and the 6 lead months beyond lead month 0 for which skill is significant in the fullsh fig 5a spatial variation in skill is large a sharp contrast exists in ecuador where the crest of the andes separates an area to its west with significant skill for all combinations of target and lead months from an area to its east where some model cells have no skill for almost any combination a target and a lead month west ecuador forms the beginning of a zone with substantial skill that runs from there southward along the coast of the pacific in peru and north chile and continues then to patagonia crossing the continent from west to the east at about 37 s this zone more or less coincides with the driest part of the continent fig 1 a second area exhibiting a large fraction of skill consists of large parts of paraguay and south brazil south of 20 s an area roughly coinciding with a region that is often called southeast south america this area is relatively wet fig 1 large parts of north and middle argentina also show relatively much skill there is however little skill in the wet part of chile south of about 37 s and in uruguay within the tropical north eastern half of the continent the spatial distribution of skill does not seem to be related to the precipitation climate for this part of the continent the map shows two distinct zones fractions of cases with significant skill are large in a band following the entire north coast of south america and extending some 1000 km inland parallel to this band and to its south lies a band of little skill also some 1000 km wide and running from the atlantic to the pacific with a branch into the part of colombia southeast of this country s cordilleras only the coastal area of ecuador breaks this band of little skill fig 5b and c depict the spatial distributions of the contributions to runoff skill due to the initial conditions and the meteorological forcing respectively the following conclusions can be drawn forcing explains most of the skill along the north coast of the continent and in southeast south america in both of these regions initial conditions hardly contribute to skill with the exception of the caatinga along the coasts of ecuador and north peru forcing dominates but initial conditions also contribute to skill in argentina most of the skill in runoff can be attributed to the initial conditions however some parts of patagonia have skill due to both of its sources while in the region along the border with brazil most of the skill is due to the forcing a complex pattern emerged in peru bolivia and chile where almost all skill along the coast in south peru and north chile is due to initial conditions forcing dominates on the altiplano of peru and bolivia and both initial conditions and forcing are important in central chile the patterns of skill in the restricted hindcasts are linked to other spatial patterns whereas most of the areas with much skill in the initsh fig 5b have a relatively dry climate fig 1 the patterns of skill in the meteosh fig 5c largely resemble those of the skill in the precipitation hindcasts fig 5d the latter resemblance supports the assumption that precipitation is the most important among the meteorological forcing variables causing interannual variations in runoff except in regions such as west ecuador where fractions of cases with skill in the precipitation hindcasts approach or reach their maximum possible value 1 0 in most of the continent fractions of cases with skill are larger in the meteosh than in the precipitation hindcasts possible reasons for this were discussed in the previous sub section 3 1 4 analysis of regional skill to complement the evaluation of temporal variations in skill for the entire continent sect 3 1 2 skill is analysed in some detail for two selected regions these are illustrative examples of extreme cases in which skill is mainly caused by the meteorological forcing amazonia guianas and by the initial conditions north chile respectively in addition the supplement fig s16 presents the evaluation for a third region southeast south america where the dominant source of skill also resides in the forcing selection of the regions was made based on two criteria namely 1 most cells in the region have a large amount of significant skill in the fullsh fig 5a and 2 a region must have a relatively homogeneous climate the selected regions are depicted in the maps e g fig 5 the regional evaluation was conducted by first averaging monthly values of the relevant variables across the region and then computing the skill metrics on the basis of these regional means hence variations within each region were not considered in the evaluation fig 6 depicts relevant results for a region called the amazonia guianas here including most of the catchment of the amazon river north of the main river itself branco trombetas paru and jari branches the guiana highlands and the areas north of this elevated region this is an example of a region where virtually all of the skill in the runoff hindcasts is due to skill in the meteorological forcing the region is characterised by wet mean annual precipitation is 2246 mm tropical climates a climates according to köppen for this region seas5 predicts precipitation with significant skill for all combinations of lead and target months with the exception of lead times longer than 2 months for target month april fig 6b two periods have extremely high association skill in the precipitation hindcasts for all lead times namely january and february all r 0 68 and september and october all r 0 58 like in the continental scale evaluation we found increases in skill with lead time these occur here from target month april to may from august to september and from december to january and are found in hindcasts with different dates of initialisation which makes this feature robust patterns of temporal variation in skill for fullsh runoff fig 6c closely follow those for precipitation indicating a causal link for instance all three mentioned increases in skill with lead time in precipitation are also found for runoff however for runoff the correlation coefficient is higher than for precipitation for 83 of all combinations of target months and lead months beyond lead month 0 this is visualised in fig 6d which compares the skills of the different sets of hydrological hindcasts and the precipitation hindcasts for two lead months 1 and 4 the initsh quickly loose skill with increasing lead time as a result in lead month 4 only three target months have a correlation coefficient above the significance level in the initsh skill is least from april to august independent of the lead month this period coincides almost with the wettest part of the year the explanation is that the skill due to initial conditions is eroded by unpredicted interannual variations in precipitation and that larger interannual variations in precipitation lead to faster erosion the meteosh are much more skillful than the initsh for all leads except for lead month 0 comparing the meteosh with the fullsh these exhibit year around almost identical skill for lead month 1 and even identical skill at longer leads we hence conclude that in amazonia guianas knowledge of interannual variations in the initial conditions do not enhance the quality of the runoff hindcasts beyond the second lead month fig 7 depicts relevant results for north chile between 25 and 31 s north chile is an example of a region where most of the skill in the runoff hindcasts is due to skill in the initial hydrological state the region has an arid mean annual precipitation is 66 mm cold climate bwk climate according to köppen most of the annual precipitation 80 falls in the austral winter from may to august during these 4 months 29 of the precipitation falls as snow because this snow partly melts after the winter and because most of the runoff occurs with long delays through basal flow the mean annual cycle of model runoff has a small amplitude fig 7a hindcasts of precipitation exhibit poor skill but levels of skill tend to be somewhat higher though mostly not above the level of significance during the local wet season fig 7b runoff hindcasts fig 7c keep excellent skill r 0 71 for all leads as long as the forecast period runs entirely within the local dry season from september to april this demonstrates that the system maintains a high performance as long as rain fall rates are small which causes the initial states of soil moisture and snow to almost entirely determine interannual variations in runoff and river discharge hindcasts initialised between february 1 and may 1 loose skill during the wet season when skill due to initial conditions quickly decreases due to the interannually varying and hardly predictable amounts of rainfall here the word hardly matters as this is the only season with small amounts of skill in the precipitation hindcasts due to these small amounts of skill the fullsh are mostly better than the initsh as long as the hindcasts partly run during the rainy season which is for lead month 1 from june to september and for lead month 4 from june to december fig 7d it is remarkable though that if the runoff hindcasts run entirely outside the rainy season the initsh have more skill than the fullsh in all cases for lead month 1 all seven dry season cases show this tendency since these have different dates of initialisation these are 7 independent cases making the superior skill in the initsh robust we explain the effect as follows both in the fullsh and in the initsh the forcing has no skill i e no signal however in the fullsh the forcing varies interannually which acts as noise leading to loss of skill while in the initsh the forcing is identical each year so skill is not affected the same effect initsh having more association skill than the fullsh was also found in the study of greuell et al 2019 for europe at longer leads we conclude that in this region for some combinations of lead and target month the fullsh should be preferred while in other cases the initsh should be preferred 3 2 actual skill of the hindcasts for the theoretical skill evaluation of section 3 1 pseudo observations of runoff were used to better assess the value of these results the skill of the hindcasts was also determined with real observations i e actual skill since real observations quantify discharge it is necessary to first switch from runoff to discharge so fig 8 a summarises the theoretical skill of discharge in the same way as skill in runoff was summarised in fig 5a the two figures show a high degree of similarity in terms of the patterns and the magnitude of the skill there are however subtle differences which were also found and explained in our earlier study for europe greuell et al 2018 firstly the continental mean fraction of cases with skill is slightly higher for discharge 0 543 in fig 8a than for runoff 0 519 in fig 5a this difference occurs due to the general tendency of decreasing skill with lead time and because discharge is delayed with respect to runoff and hence has a level of skill at a particular lead time corresponding to the level of skill in runoff at an earlier lead time the second difference occurs because rivers aggregate the skill or lack of skill in runoff from the whole upstream part of their basin as a result in the discharge skill map fig 8a cells containing rivers with large basins may contrast against adjacent cells if these contain rivers with a small local basin examples of more skill than their surroundings are the lower reaches of the amazon river and parts of the purus and the madeira river both in the southwestern part of the amazon catchment some examples of rivers with less skill than their surroundings are found east of the andes in patagonia where local rivers have considerable skill while rivers originating in the andes hardly have skill as they collect most of their water in the andes where local rivers have little skill fig 8b summarises skill in discharge using real observations setting a minimum number of 21 observations i e years unfortunately the observations are not well spread across the continent almost all were collected in brazil west ecuador and north and west argentina however within the limitation of no information from the blind regions within the domain the skill pattern obtained with pseudo observations fig 8a is confirmed three out of five stations in west ecuador have skill in at least 90 of the cases while in brazil there is more skill in the north and the south and less skill in a zone that runs in mid brazil from the western border of the country to the shore of the atlantic while the patterns of theoretical and actual skill are similar actual skill is generally less a station mean fraction of cases with significant skill of 0 415 than theoretical skill a continental mean fraction of 0 543 the reasons were analysed in some detail by van dijk et al 2013 and greuell et al 2018 the spatial pattern of actual skill of our seasonal hindcasts differs largely from that at the short to medium range found by siqueira et al 2021 the latter their fig 5 shows more skill in east brazil and northwest colombia and less in west brazil the cause of the small amount of skill in mid brazil differs between the western and the eastern part of this zone from the araguaia river to the shore of the atlantic the performance of the reference simulation see the supplement figs s1 s3 is relatively good meaning that when forced with meteorological observations the model has substantial skill in simulating interannual variations in discharge however skill in the precipitation hindcasts for this region is quite poor fig 5d hence we suggest that east of the araguaia river the lack of theoretical and actual skill in the discharge hindcasts resides in a lack of skill in the forcing and not so much in deficiencies in the hydrological model however in the part of amazonia to the west of the araguaia river model simulations of interannual variations in historical discharge are generally poor see the supplement figs s1 s3 suggesting substantial flaws in the model this must affect the hindcasts in addition for this region the performance of the hydrological hindcasts is low due to the small amount of skill in the precipitation hindcasts obviously these conclusions disregard seasonal and spatial details but they could provide a guideline for future developments of wushp in mid brazil 4 discussion fig 9 summarises the results of the present study by distinguishing between cells with different potential of making successful seasonal forecasts of runoff and by distinguishing between cells where different strategies for the production of the forecasts fullsh meteosh or initsh could or should be applied this was determined by evaluating the differences in skill between the three sets of streamflow hindcasts the confidence level at which correlation coefficients from two different sets of hindcasts really differed was determined with a t test using the paired function from the r package psych revelle 2019 if two correlation coefficients were according to the test different with a confidence level of 95 the two values were classified as less and greater than each other for each cell 72 cases were considered all combinations of target and lead months beyond lead month 0 the following four types of cells are distinguished beige cells with a relatively small potential for forecasts these are cells with a low fraction of cases with significant skill 40 in the fullsh issuing seasonal hydrological forecasts is less meaningful or is meaningful in part of the year only other colours cells with a relatively high potential for forecasts these are cells with a high fraction of cases with significant skill 40 in the fullsh blue cells for which forecasts based on meteosh could be issued instead of the fullsh these are cells for which in 75 of the cases with significant skill in the fullsh the skill in the meteosh is not less than the skill in the fullsh orange cells for which forecasts based on initsh could be issued instead of the fullsh these are cells for which in 75 of the cases with significant skill in the fullsh the skill in the initsh is not less than the skill in the fullsh brown cells for which forecasts based on fullsh should be issued these are cells for which in 25 of the cases with significant skill in the fullsh that skill is statistically superior to the skill in both the meteosh and the initsh from the point of view of high association skill thus neglecting aspects like the potential economic or social value of the forecasts the most promising regions for the production of seasonal forecasts of streamflow are those with a high concentration of blue orange or brown cells in blue cells abundant in the northern part of the continent and in southeast south america skill is not or hardly affected by replacing the interannually varying initial conditions fullsh by their mean over the whole 35 year period meteosh in other words the initial conditions hardly contribute to the skill so efforts to improve the initial conditions of snow soil moisture or surface water e g by assimilation of measurements or satellite data have a small potential of improving the forecasts note however that the computational burden of creating the interannually varying initial conditions with the model is low since only a single simulation is needed to achieve this in orange cells abundant in dry parts of argentina chile bolivia and paraguay forcing hardly contributes to skill here skill is not or hardly affected by replacing the interannually varying seas5 forcing as in fullsh by a selected ensemble of seas5 forcings as in initsh that is identical for all years for operational purposes in regions with many orange cells initsh could be issued which avoids the need to download operational seasonal forecasts produced by a climate model and couple these to a hydrological model as discussed in section 3 1 4 skill in the initsh may be even superior to skill in the fullsh in cases when the forcing contains no skill at all hence in those cases initsh are not just preferable because their production is easier but also because they have more skill than fullsh it is worth noting that the initsh can be replaced by ensemble streamflow predictions esp which are identical to the initsh except that their forcing is selected from meteorological observations and not from meteorological hindcasts greuell et al 2019 found that the association skill of esp is virtually identical to that of the initsh which is essentially due to the fact that forcings of both types of hindcasts do not vary from year to year finally in brown cells abundant in the caatinga on the altiplano of bolivia and peru in the coastal region of rio de janeiro and são paulo in east argentina and in mid chile there is a considerable increase in skill both by prescribing the interannually varying initial conditions generated by the hydrological model and by forcing the model with climate model forecasts so for operational purposes forecasts based on the fullsh should be issued fig 9 presents the opportunities of making seasonal forecasts of runoff which is similar to streamflow in sub grid scale rivers a similar figure for discharge is compared to fig 9 in the supplement fig s17 the figures for runoff and discharge show a high degree of similarity in terms of their patterns several limitations of fig 9 should be mentioned first these results are strictly speaking only valid for wushp however we expect that maps like fig 9 produced by other systems would roughly look similar since basically the distribution shown is linked to the spatial distribution of the climate and to teleconnections which determine the skill of the meteorological forecasts the second limitation is that the results depend on the thresholds chosen which is somewhat similar to stating that the presence of skill and the difference of the various sets of hindcasts relative to each other depend on the target and the lead month so while for example fig 9 might suggest that in north chile initsh could replace the fullsh without loss of skill this is not true for all combinations of target and lead month as shown in section 3 1 4 the patchiness of the map in fig 9 is among others due to these limitations and the limited number of hindcast years used for the evaluation we suggest interpreting the related recommendations for operational forecast systems with care in vic the initial hydrological conditions include the water stored in three components namely the soil the snow pack and surface water contained in rivers that are resolved in the routing network because of the large computational costs of each set of restricted hindcasts the effects on skill of the three water components were not separated however we argue that mostly soil moisture is the dominant component in our reference simulation almost all snow packs with a depth above 10 mm water equivalent occur in the andes south of 25 s hence in this region the initial amount of snow may have contributed to skill in the hindcasts but in the rest of the continent snow should be a negligible factor as to the surface water component most of our results are presented in terms of runoff because runoff comprises only water before it flows into the rivers of the routing network initial amounts of surface water do not affect runoff they have an effect on modelled discharge though in vic river flow is simulated with the linearised st venant s equation setting the flow speed equal to a constant 1 m s consequently in our simulations for south america maximum travel times of surface water from source to ocean are about 2 months so the effect of the initial state of the surface water on modelled discharge is erased across the entire domain within 2 months we conclude that in the hindcasts presented here all of the initial state skill in runoff and discharge beyond the first lead month is due to soil moisture with a possible contribution by snow to runoff and discharge hindcasts in the andes south of 25 s and a likely contribution by surface water to discharge hindcasts for lead month 1 in river sections further than 2500 km from their source a remarkable and robust feature found during the present study are increases in skill with lead time for two of the regions that were highlighted in sect 3 1 4 and in the supplement fig s16 the feature is remarkable since skill usually decreases with lead time and it is robust since it appears for the same target months in hindcasts starting with different initialisation dates the increases occur both in amazonia guianas and in southeast south america at times of the year that differ between these two regions increases in skill with lead time in europe found by greuell et al 2018 have been linked to snow melt but since that process is negligible in amazonia guianas and in southeast south america the increases in skill must have another explanation obviously the explanation resides in the precipitation hindcasts as these also show this feature trends in the data form a possible explanation of increases in skill with lead time namely at times of the year when they become more statistically significant than before to investigate the effect of trends we detrended the time series of both precipitation and runoff underlying figs 6 and s13 with the method described in greuell et al 2019 the relevant panels of figs 6 and s16 were then redrawn with the detrended data supplement fig s18 and the figures before and after detrending were compared differences were negligible and in particular the increases in skill with lead time were almost identical so we conclude that the increases are not due to trends in the data we speculate that the discussed local increases in skill with lead time are due to monthly variations in the strength of relevant teleconnections between the mentioned regions and ocean areas with strong enso signals in the sst for the detection of this feature evaluation of the skill with monthly resolution instead of the common 3 monthly resolution was crucial a detailed analysis of the spatial and temporal extent of this feature and of the mechanism causing it are outside the scope of this study in the present study hindcast skill was assessed by the evaluation of association between observations and forecasts it is important to mention that association is closely related to discrimination and resolution since all three properties quantify though in different ways whether higher or lower observations correspond to higher lower forecasts other desired components of the runoff and discharge forecasts namely no bias and a correct amount of spread of the ensemble members as well as the aggregate effect of all components are considered in the appendix there are two reasons why we focus on a discrimination type metric firstly forecasts lacking association discrimination resolution are useless by principle free after weigel and mason 2011 because they are not better than climatological forecasts secondly by post processing the hydrological output see e g gneiting et al 2005 and boucher et al 2015 bias and incorrect amount of spread can to a considerable extent be corrected for this is not possible for discrimination type limitations citing barnston et al 2012 case to case discrimination as indicated by correlation skill is often considered the most important component of final skill since many calibration bias related problems are correctable while discrimination reflects a more fundamental ability of the prediction model in the appendix we evaluate part of our hindcasts in terms of other metrics namely the bias the continuous ranked probability skill crps and its skill score version crpss which are measures of aggregate skill and alpha a measure of reliability it is shown that the raw i e non post processed streamflow hindcasts generally have large biases and spread errors and therefore hardly have significant skill in terms of the crps and generally possess very low levels of reliability we demonstrate that meaningful values of the crpss are only obtained after post processing after post processing with the method proposed by gneiting et al 2005 values of the crpss and the level of reliability are much higher showing the effectiveness of the post processing and the necessity to post process streamflow forecasts if these are to be issued in terms of absolute values most importantly we found a narrow relation between association r before post processing and aggregate skill crpss after post processing similar relations between r and roc a measure of discrimination for categorical forecasts based on theoretical considerations have been identified by yang et al 2021 therefore if discharge could have been post processed for all grid cells results evaluated with either r or crpss would have been qualitatively very similar the implication is that r is a suitable indicator of the aggregate skill or lack of skill of post processed streamflow hindcasts the advantage of using r is that it can easily be computed for all cells of the domain whereas a meaningful evaluation in terms of the crpss requires postprocessing which is time consuming and restricted to the small fraction of cells with observations in summary by only computing r and hence analysing association skill a useful indication of the potential total skill of post processed seasonal forecasts is obtained thanks to the functional relationship between r and the crpss we further believe that r or other metrics quantifying discrimination skill are more suitable than the crps for comparing different types of hindcasts like the fullsh with the restricted hindcasts because they exclude the effect of largely removable biases and spread errors while only quantifying the effect of the most fundamental property of forecasts deeper investigations concerning the suitability of different metrics for the evaluation of sensitivity experiments could be the topic of future studies basically multiple roads towards improving the hindcasts made with wushp i e producing hindcasts with more actual skill exist these can be subdivided into improving the meteorological forcing and improving the hydrological simulations the ecmwf hindcasts could be replaced by multi model hindcasts see e g hagedorn et al 2005 or despite being of high quality guimarães et al 2021 be improved themselves an important aspect to consider in the context of improved seasonal meteorological forecasts is a realistic quantification of moisture recycling for their precipitation large parts of the amazon basin and regions to the south of it depend considerably on recycling of rainfall through evaporation of intercepted and transpired water from vegetation zemp et al 2014 this means that precipitation is controlled in a complex way by vegetation and changes therein staal et al 2018 zemp et al 2014 the recycling is quantitatively not well understood yet and impacted by land use change i e deforestation it is tempting to speculate that the region of intense moisture recycling coincides with the zone of little skill in the hindcasts that crosses the continent from colombia to east brazil fig 5a and 9 advances in parameterizing processes related to recycling e g sakschewski et al 2020 might improve seasonal forecasts of precipitation in this zone hydrological simulations may be improved by a more thorough calibration of vic by assimilation of soil moisture e g retrieved from satellite data see alvarez garreton et al 2015 and or of surface water measurements mazrooei and sankarasubramanian 2019 into the initial state and by making structural changes to vic wur we consider among others replacing the routing scheme the current scheme of vic wur assumes a constant flow speed and hence misses the simulation of an important aspect of river routing namely the storage of surface water in floodplains floodplains cause considerable attenuation and delay of flood waves and may add considerable memory to many south american rivers paiva et al 2013 however parameterisation of flood plains as described by e g paiva et al 2013 and siqueira et al 2018 is computationally expensive within the framework of seasonal hindcasts for the whole continent of course our suggestions for improving evapotranspiration from the amazon forest in the ecmwf forecast model also apply to vic 5 conclusions in this paper we presented a study on seasonal streamflow forecasts for south america by assessing the association skill of hindcasts produced by a dynamical system wushp consisting of meteorological forcing with seas5 hindcasts and the hydrological model vic we also computed the contributions by the meteorological forcing and the initial conditions to the skill of the complete system we found significant skill in the runoff hindcasts even at the forecast horizon 7 months in large parts of the south american continent 31 43 depending on the target month a zone of substantial skill roughly coincides with the driest part of the continent running from west ecuador to patagonia in these regions most of the skill tends to arise from the initial conditions two other regions with high amounts of skill are southeast south america and a band following the entire north coast of south america and extending some 1000 km inland in these two regions most of the skill is due to the forcing this paper ends with two recommendations the first is to evaluate skill of seasonal forecasts with monthly instead of the often applied seasonal resolution in the present study the enhanced temporal resolution was shown to be essential for the accurate determination of the beginnings and endings of periods of skill the finer temporal resolution also resulted in the detection of sudden local increases of skill with lead time the present study also leads to the recommendation that in some specific regions and parts of the year parts of a dynamical forecast system like wushp are redundant or at least hardly increase skill when and where skill is hardly determined by the initial conditions their calculation with a reference simulation becomes superfluous when and where skill is hardly determined by the forcing seasonal forecasts of the forcing computed with a climate model could be replaced by a selection of historical forcings from the climate model each year the same or by observations each year the same as in esp data availability statement monthly means of the streamflow hindcasts are stored at https doi org 10 17026 dans zqw ubx4 and scripts used for the analysis of

the hindcasts with the crpss to complement the evaluation of the hindcasts in terms of association runoff skill was also assessed by means of the continuous ranked probability score crps and its skill score version the crpss see mason and stephenson 2008 which are aggregate measures of performance meaning that they are sensitive to bias spread and association for perfect forecasts crps 0 and crpss 1 with decreasing performance the crps increases and the crpss decreases for benchmark forecasts climatological hindcasts in this study crpss 0 fig a1 maps the fraction of all 72 combinations of the 12 target and the 6 lead months beyond lead month 0 for which skill of the fullsh determined with the crpss is significant at the 95 confidence level the continental mean fraction is 0 08 much less than the same fraction for significant association skill 0 52 see fig 5a and not much more than the expected fraction of cells with falsely detected significant skill in the case of random hindcasts 0 05 the large difference between skill quantified by r and by the crpss is due to the uncorrected biases and spread errors in the hindcasts the effect of post processing the hydrological output is demonstrated by applying the regression method of gneiting et al 2005 to the hindcasts of inflow into the itaipu reservoir at the border of brazil and paraguay see fig 1 results are shown in fig a2 for lead months 1 2 and 3 while a similar figure for longer leads can be found in the supplement fig s19 for all combinations of lead and target months the method is very effective in reducing the bias figs a2a and s18a and increasing reliability figs a2b and s18b where we notice that forecasts become more reliable if both biases and dispersion errors are reduced here reliability is quantified by alpha renard et al 2010 an index that may range between 0 and 1 and increases with increasing reliability whereas the raw hindcasts have a mean alpha of 0 335 across all combinations of target and lead months beyond lead month 0 the mean value increased to 0 911 after post processing the latter value is less than the value for perfectly reliable hindcasts 1 but almost identical to the mean alpha of our climatological hindcasts 0 909 the reduced biases and increased reliability have a huge effect on the crpss figs a2c and s18c which is negative for all but 1 out of 72 raw hindcasts after post processing the crpss is positive in 53 cases out of 72 of which 6 cases are significantly better at 95 confidence than the benchmark the lowest panel figs a2d and s18d shows that r and hence association skill decrease slightly due post processing we found that this was entirely due to the leave one year out strategy applied during the post processing more importantly comparison of panels c and d suggests that cases with significant aggregate skill after post processing as indicated by the crpss tend to correspond to cases with significant association skill as indicated by r the relation between r and the crpss is further investigated by post processing the fullsh hindcasts using all of the observations in the catchments of the paraná and the são francisco rivers that were available for the present study 38 stations with time series 21 years this provided a total 2693 post processed cases all 472 cases with significant skill in terms of r before and in terms of the crpss after post processing were plotted fig a3 the scatter plot suggests a functional relationship in which the crpss rises monotonically with r the relatively small amount of scatter around the indicated functional relationship suggests that after post processing the crpss does not provide much additional information to the information already provided by r and vice versa hence r is suitable as indicator of the aggregate skill or lack of skill of post processed streamflow hindcasts and possesses the advantage that it can be computed without the need to actually perform any post processing

2441,coastal ecosystems are sensitive to the input of chemicals originating from submarine groundwater discharge sgd the mixing zone between freshwater and saltwater in beach aquifers promotes biogeochemical transformations affecting nutrient fluxes into the coastal ocean macropores affect groundwater flow leading to a more complicated mixing process and greatly promoting nitrogen transformations laboratory scale experiments and numerical modeling were employed in this study to investigate how macropores affect freshwater saltwater mixing and terrestrial solute transport a numerical investigation is presented demonstrating the influence of macropores on the transport and transformation of nitrate no3 in a homogeneous unconfined nearshore aquifer under spring neap tide action using comsol the results indicate that macropores modify the groundwater discharge pathway of terrestrial no3 by changing nearshore groundwater flow dynamics the denitrification zone expanded from the low tide mark to the high tide mark extended downward to the base of the upper saline plume usp and expanded with increasing macropore depth and quantity macropores increased no3 removal by creating larger mixing zones which increased with the macropore depth and quantity lower freshwater levels enhanced denitrification and weakened the impact of macropores on denitrification the deep burial dissolved organic matter db dom simulation results demonstrated that dissolved organic matter dom could stimulate denitrifiers to increase the denitrification zone by fully consuming o2 along longer flow paths resulting in up to 85 higher no3 removal the findings provide notable implications for management design engineering to protect coastal ecosystems and decrease no3 fluxes into the ocean keywords macropores mixing zone nitrate denitrification removal efficiency data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction no3 and ammonium nh4 concentrations are often significantly elevated in nearshore aquifers due to pharmaceuticals agricultural and industrial pollutants and urban development in coastal areas pan et al 2022 sun et al 2019 heiss et al 2017 moore 2010 sgd is a primary transport pathway of freshwater may contain high concentrations of terrestrial nutrients and can significantly contribute new nutrients to the coastal zone heiss 2020 zheng et al 2020 spiteri et al 2008b slomp and van cappellen 2004 for example globally the sgd pathway is deemed to be responsible for the transfer of 1 4 tg no3 per year beusen et al 2013 saltwater intrusion introduces substrates for biogeochemical reactions such as dom chemical formula is ch2o 106 nh3 11 h3po4 and dissolved oxygen do jiang et al 2018 due to the different chemical compositions and redox conditions of groundwater and saltwater the mixing zone of these pore waters under saltwater recirculation through coastal aquifers can create strong chemical reactions santos et al 2021 heiss et al 2017 mcallister et al 2015 anwar et al 2014 these sgd borne solutes and chemical reactions could reduce groundwater quality result in seagrass habitat loss and species diversity reduction and affect human health heiss et al 2017 anwar et al 2014 slomp and van cappellen 2004 therefore it is very important to characterize and quantify the interplay between physical and biogeochemical processes via sgd of nearshore aquifers which is critical for the effective management and protection of marine ecosystems groundwater flow and solute transport and freshwater saltwater mixing in coastal aquifers are complex luo et al 2021 kong et al 2016 heiss and michael 2014 abarca et al 2013 befus et al 2013 in the presence of tides a saltwater wedge sw may exist due to density driven saltwater recirculation and an usp due to tide induced saltwater recirculation fang et al 2022 santos et al 2021 heiss et al 2020 fig 1 groundwater driven by inland hydraulic gradients bypasses usp and sw flows into nearshore aquifers and mixes with saltwater infiltrating across seabeaches heiss and michael 2014 abarca et al 2013 previous studies have indicated that the usp and mixing zone exhibit characteristics of high biogeochemical activity such as tide induced saltwater recirculation with high flow rates providing a rapidly abundant supply of marine solute to aquifers fang et al 2022 charbonnier et al 2013 santos et al 2009 for example fang et al 2022 found that the extent of no3 contamination increased with higher tidal amplitudes whereas the increment was more evident for a large tidal amplitude in recent years field studies and numerous numerical studies have demonstrated no3 cycling in the intertidal zone and have demonstrated the reactions and chemical solute forms of nutrients in nearshore aquifers santos et al 2021 heiss et al 2017 kim et al 2017 beck et al 2017 mcallister et al 2015 anwar et al 2014 biogeochemical processes affecting nutrient cycling in aquifers are complex and include dom degradation dd aerobic respiration ar denitrification no3 transformation into n2 dni and nitrification nh4 transformation to no3 ni kim et al 2017 shuai et al 2017 anwar et al 2014 spiteri et al 2008a these reactions modify solute concentrations in groundwater prior to discharge such as benthic microorganisms respiring dom and this process is coupled with the reduction of electron acceptors jiang et al 2018 the nitrification process occurs in the shallow layer while the denitrification process occurs in the deeper anaerobic layer driven by anaerobic bacteria shuai et al 2017 infiltrated o2 is rapidly consumed by aerobic respiration and nitrification charbonnier et al 2013 such a feature is also found by kim et al 2017 who collected pore water samples from a beach near cape henlopen delaware and analyzed solute and particulate concentrations for quantitative analysis of this feature a numerical model was employed to support field and laboratory interpretations their results indicated that the highest respiration rates were found in the mixing zone between freshwater and saltwater supported by dissolved organic carbon doc some prior studies assumed the main factor that constrains no3 reduction rates to be the limited availability of dom kim et al 2020 crawshaw et al 2019 rivett et al 2008 a higher doc concentrations and higher carbon reaction rates increase denitrification within the intertidal zone kim et al 2020 spiteri et al 2008a 2008b investigated the fate of nutrients no3 nh4 and po4 3 in idealized subterranean estuaries using a coupled groundwater flow and reactive transport model and revealed that denitrification could remove large quantities of no3 with a low groundwater flow rate and high dom oxidation rate anwar et al 2014 studied solute transport and transformation in homogeneous aquifers under the action of tides and waves and the results demonstrated that tides and waves significantly modified the subsurface discharge pathway for nutrients and enhanced the transformation of these nutrients due to greater freshwater saltwater mixing in nearshore aquifers these studies have indicated no3 transformation into n2 via denitrification which is often considered to play the main role in no3 removal from groundwater to coastal areas kim et al 2017 ocean forcing tides and waves heiss et al 2020 kim et al 2017 anwar et al 2014 hydraulic conductivity heiss et al 2017 kim et al 2017 terrestrial freshwater flux kim et al 2017 beach slope kim et al 2017 and dom kim et al 2020 anwar et al 2014 spiteri et al 2008a 2008b significantly modify the discharge pathway for nutrients and affect the denitrification rate in nearshore aquifers in addition denitrification increases and no3 discharge into coastal water decreases with the dom input anwar et al 2014 this occurs because doc dom not only provides the reactant for denitrification but also provides an anaerobic environment doc and dom oxidation hence understanding dom distributions and the impact of dom on no3 removal constitutes an important step to understanding the cycling of other chemicals in intertidal aquifers the above studies were based on homogeneous aquifers in reality macroporous sediments macropores are defined as pores that have a diameter larger than 50 μm mud or silt loam are found to overlie sands or sandy deposits in systems heiss et al 2020 geng et al 2020 guimond et al 2020 kim et al 2019 kim et al 2017 hughes et al 1998 for instance kim et al 2019 found that inherent reaction rate heterogeneity is inevitable within geological formation reaction rates in intertidal aquifers heiss et al 2020 assessed the influence of heterogeneity on denitrification in intertidal mixing zones based on variable density groundwater flow and reactive transport simulations with geostatistical representations of sedimentary structures and the results indicated that no3 removal may be 80 higher in heterogeneous aquifers than in homogeneous aquifers the simulation results of gao et al 2022 indicated that aquifer heterogeneities are a primary factor in regulating no3 contamination in addition another type of heterogeneity can be attributed to macropores produced by a wide range of flora and fauna from invertebrates to vertebrates commonly found in nearshore aquifers ying 2021 during a yancheng coastal beach in china survey found that from the tidal creek zone to the vegetation zone the macropore density gradually decreased from 28 to 18 m 2 and found that macropores were mainly concentrated in the upper supratidal and intertidal zones similar survey results were also reported by fanjul et al 2008 previous studies have demonstrated that macropores can effectively alter the texture of sediments and oxygen content wang et al 2020 bertics and ziebis 2010 wang et al 2010 and can promote dom oxidation fanjul et al 2015 fanjul et al 2011 kristensen et al 2000 thereby altering the no3 cycle li et al 2021 fanjul et al 2011 fanjul et al 2011 studied the effects of macropores on nitrogen dynamics in a southwestern atlantic intertidal zone and found that bioturbated macropores significantly impacted the soil oxygen content li et al 2021 performed a laboratory experiment and indicated that macropores significantly affected nh4 and no3 concentrations and greatly promoted the nitrogen exchange flux at the sediment water interface to our knowledge the effects of macropores on no3 attenuation in spring neap tidally influenced beach aquifers remain unclear additionally changes in the distribution of denitrification rates and no3 removal efficiency beneath the intertidal zone are influenced by various factors including the macropore depth and quantity and dom concentration db dom which have not been investigated in this study we applied laboratory experiments and numerical analysis to investigate the influence of macropores on groundwater flow freshwater saltwater mixing and denitrification in nearshore aquifers under spring neap tidal influence a series of sensitivity analyses of the macropore depth and quantity and terrestrial freshwater level were performed to assess the macropore impact of denitrification hotspots in beach aquifers finally we simulated how db dom could greatly promote denitrification and no3 removal these results provide a theoretical reference and guidance for the design of engineering measures to decrease no3 contamination and groundwater quality management 2 methodology 2 1 laboratory tracer experiments lab experiments were designed to simulate the groundwater flow and solute transport shown in fig 2 the experimental system comprised two tanks and a thin center with dimensions of 4 0 m long 0 8 m high 0 02 m wide the left side tanks contained simulated saltwater and to visualize the salinity distribution red food coloring e129 allura red ac granular was mixed with saltwater salinity of 35 ppt parts per thousand mass fraction with the associated density at 1 025 kg m3 a tide generator was used to control time varying saltwater levels eq 1 the right side tanks representing the inland boundary were supplied with freshwater a density of 1000 kg m3 and salinity of 0 ppt and a fixed flow 80 ml min the flow generator comprised eight flow inlets evenly distributed along the boundary the thin central flume was packed with quartz sand to simulate an unconfined coastal aquifer quartz sand 0 7 m high with a beach surface slope of 1 4 in these experiments we considered a simple sinusoidal tide as follows 1 h t h 0 a sin 2 π t t where h t m is the tidal level at time t s h 0 is the mean sea level 0 5 m a is the tidal amplitude set to 0 04 m and t is the tidal period set to 240 s pore water was sampled for salinity along a shore perpendicular transect of 12 multilevel samplers the sampler was constructed from the diameter of 0 2 mm and length of 50 cm od stainless steel needle mounted to a syringe stainless steel needle tubes were marked every 1 cm to accurately measure the pore water depth the samplers were installed along the intertidal transect into the beach aquifer when the experiment reached the quasi steady state toe constant the saltwater wedge toe see table 1 for detail location to compared with the experimental results we also calculated the salinity of 12 numerical samplers see table 2 the sampling procedure began with the shallowest layer of the farthest landward sampler and continued seaward along the transect ending on the aquifer for a total of 24 pore water samples a complete location took no less than 30 min to complete and to ensure that each sampling reached quasi steady state salinity was measured as electrical conductivity ysi ec300 and the average value of three samplings at each position is reported as ppt the experiment reached the quasi steady state again after the pore water was sampled we used a syringe 0 2 mm pore size to introduce into 4 ml blue food coloring e129 allura blue ac granular by setting an initial tracer concentration c0 of 0 1 kg m3 at the injection location of x 2 3 m and z 0 6 m as shown in fig 3 to study the solute transport process of a terrestrial conservative solute the quartz sand used was relatively uniform with d 50 median diameter 0 5 mm and d 100 d 10 2 4 the measured saturated hydraulic conductivity using freshwater and the darcy column test method was 3 10 3 m s the sand porosity was 0 46 using the imbibition method collins 1961 four base experiments were conducted as follows 1 case 1 without macropores under tidal action 2 case 2 with macropores under tidal action whereby macropores were inserted at the location of x 0 68 m and the penetration depth i e the distance from the macropore bottom to the aquifer surface reached 0 05 m stainless steel mesh screens with 1 mm openings with a diameter of 10 mm were used to recreate aquifer macropores fig 2 c in the experiments the experimental aquifer was essentially a two dimensional structure focusing on the salinity distribution and inland solute transport path throughout an unconfined aquifer 2 2 numerical simulations the physical experiment cannot fully take into account more complicated influence factors and embody large scale water and mass movement in filed we further conducted numerical simulations to extend above

interface including the intertidal zone please refer to shen et al 2019 and cardenas et al 2015 for details and to apply a spring neap tidal signal to the interface nodes as a time varying dirichlet

concentrations occur below the limiting concentration as adopted from bardini et al 2012 and spiteri et al 2008b and kim et al 2017 validated this reaction network by comparing simulation results with field data from the cape shores beach adjacent to delaware bay dom rich and oxic saltwater infiltrating the aquifer at the sea boundary contain dom and o2 respectively the concentrations of chemical

concentrations were assigned to the inflowing freshwater no3 occurred in the top 4 5 m of the freshwater zone and nh4 occurred in the lower 5 5 m of the aquifer these parameters and boundaries are consistent with those reported previous studies heiss et al 2020 anwar et al 2014 and no3 attenuation as a percentage of the total inflowing terrestrial no3 was defined as the no3 removal efficiency

cno3 is the no3 concentration and lout is the total length of the sea boundary all simulations were run with a time step of 100 s and used the same numerical mesh comprising 90 434 nodes and 90 216 elements the mesh density increased in macropores zones and along the beach with a minimum δx value of 7 cm the courant and péclet number values did not exceed 1 and 2 respectively which satisfies the stability criterion and avoids numerical oscillation we conducted three steps i we considered experimental scale groundwater flow and solute transport processes for verification ii solute transport and reactions occurred in large scale model iii solute transport and reactions simulation considering the effect of db dom for comparison on the denitrification and no3 removal 3 results and analysis 3 1 salinity distribution and solute transport lab scale first from the experimental results depicted in fig 3 tidal forcing created an intertidal circulation cell where saltwater infiltrated near the high tide mark and was discharged near the low tide mark a freshwater discharge zone separated the circulation cell from the lower interface located at the base of the beach formed an usp and sw in the intertidal zone which is consistent with previous field and numerical modeling studies santos et al 2021 fang et al 2021 shen et al 2020 heiss et al 2020 abarca et al 2013 robinson et al 2006 as to the measured salinity we found that the salinity decreased with depth and distance seaward from the mean tide mark as shown in table 1 e g the measured salinity from x 0 48 m and z 0 52 m is 35 ppt while that from x 0 48 m and z 0 48 m is 0 11 ppt and the measured salinity from x 0 72 m and z 0 56 m is 34 6 ppt table 1 owing to the existence of macropores the saltwater plumes usp more deeply penetrated into the aquifer e g the measured salinity at x 0 60 m and z 0 48 m is 0 34 ppt larger than that in the case without macropores 0 2 ppt table 1 simulated salt concentrations and solute transport are compared to the experimental results to ensure consistency the simulated results matched the experimental in all cases well fig 3 the salinity distribution formation process of a usp and sw under tidal action saltwater infiltration near the high tide mark and discharge near the low tide mark and freshwater discharge between the usp and sw which is consistent with previous studies santos et al 2021 fang et al 2021 shen et al 2020 heiss et al 2020 under the impact of macropores the usp vertical enhancement and toe reduction from 1 83 m to 1 79 m e g the measured salinity at x 0 60 m and z 0 48 m is 1 9 ppt larger than that in the case without macropores 0 8 ppt table 2 thus decreasing the sw length and salinity as expected the simulated salinity decreased with the depth and distance seaward from the mean tide mark table 2 e g the simulated salinity from x 0 48 m and z 0 52 m is 35 ppt while that from x 0 48 m and z 0 48 m is 0 15 ppt and the measured salinity from x 0 72 m and z 0 56 m is 33 2 ppt table 2 these model simulations of the laboratory experiments provided a good match with the experimental observations the solute plume moved toward the sea driven by inland freshwater and was discharged from the drainage channel between the usp and sw fig 3 also shows that the solute plume in the numerical results exhibited the same trends as those observed in the laboratory results the solute plume migrates faster and discharges earlier from the aquifer in the absence of macropores than those observed in the presence of macropores along shorter paths e g the solute plume was located at x 1 63 m and migrates faster than that in the case with macropores x 1 85 m 1 h after injection the plume traveled predominantly seaward discharging across the lower beachface 5 h after injection and faster than that in the case with macropores 5 h 40 min both the experimental and numerical results consistently demonstrated that macropores could impact the salinity distribution and solute transport in coastal environments in other words macropores could increase the usp and mixing zone and yield a longer residence time and longer path in aquifers for terrestrial solute transport these results have important implications for intertidal biogeochemical transformations between freshwater and saltwater in beach aquifers 3 2 macropore effects on no3 attenuation and reaction distributions based on the solute and reactivity distributions are shown in fig 4 spring neap tidal forcing formed an usp in the intertidal zone and generated a freshwater saltwater mixing zone fig 4 a1 consistent with the above results and previous studies heiss et al 2020 zheng et al 2020 heiss and michael 2014 robinson et al 2006 infiltrating saltwater served as a dom source in the intertidal zone leading to dom distribution in the intertidal usp and sw fig 4 b1 which was elevated in the shallow beach subsurface and decreased with depth due to dom degradation dd aerobic respiration ar and denitrification dni under aerobic bacterial action dom oxidation was coupled with aerobic respiration so o2 concentrations decreased in the deep part of the aquifer fig 4 d1 the o2 concentration distribution closely resembles that measured by kim et al 2017 decreasing with depth and distance seaward from the high tide mark once o2 was completely consumed the remaining dom continuously moved along the flow paths and entered the mixing zone along the boundary of the usp and interface of the sw where it encountered no3 the presence of denitrifiers maintains the function of denitrification gao et al 2010 no3 and dom originated in different waters this led to the denitrification being mixing dependent note that no3 and nh4 were abundant throughout the reaction fig 4 c1 e1 the discharge of land derived species occurred in a narrow zone between the usp and sw the usp was characterized by low no3 and nh4 concentrations due to high flow rates in the recirculating saltwater as seen from the simulation results fig 4 nitrification fig 4 f1 and denitrification fig 4 g1 hotspots occurred in the usp and interface between saltwater and freshwater in the sw forming an arc shaped denitrification zone at the boundary of the usp along the anaerobic zone rich in dom and no3 under spring neap tidal forcing nh4 is derived from freshwater and denitrification and mixing with o2 leads to nitrification however the nitrification rate was the highest at the low tide mark due to o2 and nh4 discharge and enrichment it is noteworthy that nitrification and denitrification coexist between salinity contours of 1 and 50 fig 4 f1 g1 nitrification creates an anaerobic environment and reactants no3 for the next step of denitrification while denitrification provides nh4 for subsequent nitrification the denitrification rate was lowest beneath the high tide mark and increased along circulating flow paths toward the low tide mark at sw denitrification reaches the highest which is due to the longer transport path and travel time of solute driven by density where dom and no3 can fully react fig 4 a1 b1 c1 g1 macropores altered the local hydraulic gradient and further enhanced the mixing process near the usp e g the particle starting from x 0 m and z 3 m took 215 d also longer than that in the case without macropores 210 d fig 4 a1 a2 the 1 salinity contour z 3 95 m is deeper than that without macropores z 5 m fig 4 b1 b2 it was evident that the species and reaction rate distributions in the nearshore aquifer were significantly altered by macropores due to transport pathway modification and saltwater recirculation the size of the reaction zone increases with the increase in the size of the freshwater saltwater mixing zone at usp the denitrification zone expanded from the low tide mark to the high tide mark and extended downward to the base of the usp which led to denitrification increases fig 4 g2 however at sw the solute residue time and denitrification slightly decreased as the usp pushed the sw seaward e g the toe 59 2 m was larger than that with macropores 59 1 m fig 4 a1 a2 in addition macropores increase the infiltration of o2 and dom nitrification and aerobic respiration deplete more o2 in the deep layer fig 4 d2 f2 a large amount of dom along pore water flow paths to the anaerobic deeper layer led to denitrification increases to further explore the impact of macropores on the fate of no3 we calculated the no3 discharge and no3 attenuation degree macropores altered the percentage of no3 removed prior to discharge no3 removal increased from 1 69 to 2 05 under macropore action creating larger mixing zones and no3 discharge consequently decreased 3 3 terrestrial freshwater level effects the exchange of saltwater and freshwater mixing zone size and reaction zone extent decreased with freshwater level for both the macropore and without macropore models e g the particle released from x 0 m and z 3 m is 304 d of low head hf 10 2 m without macropores and longer than that high head hf 10 8 m 174 d fig 5 a1 a3 we calculated the no3 removal efficiency and no3 discharge level to assess the impact of the water level fig 6 a significant negative relationship was found between rn and hf for both the macropore r2 0 913 and without macropore r2 0 934 models e g the no3 removal efficiency decreased from 2 91 to 1 24 with increasing high head up to 10 8 m without macropore conditions the no3 discharge level was negatively correlated with increasing head r2 0 958 e g the no3 discharge was 2 675 g m for the low head hf 10 2 m without macropore and less than that for the high head hf 10 8 m of 5 87 g m this is most likely because the infiltration of o2 and dom increases with decreasing freshwater head nitrification reactions and aerobic respiration deplete more o2 in the deep layer denitrification increases and no3 discharge decrease under low head conditions hf 10 2 m there was a similar value of no3 removal efficiency for both the macropore and without macropore models fig 6a the macropores altered the no3 removal efficiency with increasing head e g the no3 removal efficiency increased from 1 24 to 1 75 under a high head hf 10 8 m in the presence of macropores in addition the macropore altered the no3 discharge level with the head increase e g the no3 discharge level is 5 87 g m of high head hf 10 8 m without macropores and large than that with macropores 4 73 g m and the no3 discharge level is 2 68 g m of low head hf 10 2 m without macropores and with macropores is 2 64 g m this is because a low freshwater input will increase the area of usp the impact of macropores on the size of the mixing zone and solute transport are limited 3 4 macropore depth effects the size of the freshwater saltwater mixing zone was the most sensitive to the macropore depth h fig 7 because macropores enhanced the exchange of freshwater and saltwater e g the particle released from x 0 m and z 3 m is 220 d of macropores depth was 3 8 m and longer than that in the case with h 1 8 m 212 d fig 7 a1 a3 the size of the reaction zone increased with the macropore depth the denitrification zone expanded from the high tide mark to the low tide mark extending downward to the base of the usp the denitrification zone expanded with increasing macropore depth e g the denitrification extended to z 1 7 m when the macropores depth was 3 8 m which is deeper than that in the case with h 1 8 m z 2 7 m in the usp zone fig s1 in detail when the macropores depth was large fig 7 a3 b3 c3 the solute residue time and denitrification showed increase as the usp further pushed the sw seaward although nitrification zone expansion was mainly concentrated at the bottom of the macropores and low tide marks and slightly expanded with increasing macropore depth in the mixing zones nitrification and aerobic respiration also depleted more o2 in the deep layer and denitrification increased significantly fig 7 c1 c3 fig 8 a shows the no3 attenuation degree and fig 8 b shows no3 discharge for the different macropore depths a significant positive relationship was found between rn and h r2 0 918 as shown in fig 8 a and the no3 discharge level was negatively correlated with macropore depth r2 0 974 fig 8b macropore depth altered the no3 removal efficiency prior to discharge the no3 removal efficiency increased from 1 69 to 2 38 with increasing macropore depth up to 3 8 m as the greater depth created larger mixing zones the no3 discharge level decreases with macropore depth 3 5 macropore quantity effects we further analyzed the impact of the macropore quantity n on the size of the freshwater saltwater mixing zone fig 9 as expected the exchange of saltwater and freshwater mixing zone size and reaction zone extent increased with the macropore quantity e g the particle released from x 0 m and z 3 m is 225 d of macropores quantity was 3 and longer than that in the case with single macropore 220 d fig 9 a1 a3 in other words the denitrification zone expanded with increasing macropore quantity the denitrification zone extended downward to the base of the usp and expanded with increasing macropore quantity e g the denitrification extends to z 1 2 m of macropores quantity was 3 and deeper than that in the case with quantity is 1 z 1 7 m at usp zone fig s2 in detail when the macropore quantity was large fig 9 a3 b3 c3 the solute residue time and denitrification showed a slight increase as the usp further pushed the sw seaward nitrification and aerobic respiration deplete more o2 in the deep layer and denitrification increases significantly fig 9 c1 c3 we calculated the no3 removal efficiency and no3 discharge level to assess the impact of the macropore quantity fig 10 a significant positive relationship was found between rn and n r2 0 81 the macropore quantity altered the no3 removal efficiency the no3 removal efficiency increased from 2 38 to 2 62 with increasing macropore quantity up to 3 which could be attributed to the creation of larger mixing zones under the influence of a larger number of macropores and the no3 discharge level decreased as the denitrification zone expanded with increasing macropore quantity i e we found that the no3 discharge level was negatively correlated with macropore quantity r2 0 939 fig 10b from sections 3 2 3 3 3 4 and 3 5 we found that macropores altered denitrification and solute distribution macropores led to deeper dom infiltration and greater denitrification the deeper dom occurred the greater the resulting anaerobic zone expansion and the more sufficient the denitrification reactants consequently the effect of db dom on denitrification is studied and described in section 3 6 3 6 effects of the db dom reactivity the dom concentration altered the chemical composition of pore water in the beach aquifer fig 11 a c shows the impact of various db dom concentrations concentrations were 1 m 5 m and 10 m respectively on the dom distribution and denitrification rate injection of dom a dom source led to elevated dom concentrations at the bottom of macropore localized areas which decreased along flow paths owing to dom oxidation db dom concentrations also influenced dom spatial patterns the variability in dom concentrations at the different db dom levels could be attributed to the dom stimulated aerobic respiration and denitrification relationship within the intertidal circulation cell respiration triggered by the oversupply of db dom reduced the o2 in the pore water and created a larger anaerobic zone deep in the aquifer depressing the activity of aerobic reactions a large amount of dom along the flow paths to the anaerobic deeper layer led to the denitrification increasing significantly and dom greatly accumulated at the bottom of the aquifer a higher db dom value produced greater dom discharge and resulted in a higher downward gradient dom concentration gradient fig 12 shows that the no3 removal efficiency increased with db dom the no3 removal efficiency increased from 2 38 to 85 with an increase in db dom from 0 to 10 m however the discharge of land derived no3 decreased with db dom and ranged from 4 35 to 1 13 m m reaching a minimum value at a db dom value of 10 m moreover statistical correlation analysis demonstrated a significant positive relationship between rn and dom r2 0 997 fig 12a and the no3 discharge level was negatively correlated with dom r2 0 969 fig 12b these results demonstrate the importance of the dom reactivity on no3 cycling in the intertidal zone and illustrate the influence of db dom on no3 transport and fate in beach aquifers db dom promotes greater no3 removal hence the magnitude of outgoing no3 fluxes is dependent on the intensities of both removal and supply 4 discussion 4 1 implication of macropores for the salinity distribution no3 discharge and no3 removal efficiency under tidal action our experimental laboratory results demonstrated that macropores could change the salinity distribution and solute transport of land sources and macropores could increase the usp and mixing zone leading to longer paths in the aquifer for terrestrial solute transport fig 3 and fig 4 1a 2a some previous studies found similar results for example shen et al 2020 found that under tidal action landward particles bypassed the usp prior to discharging to the sea and the associated travel time increased in contrast under nontidal conditions xin et al 2010 carried out a numerical simulation and found that the inland particle travel time increased with usp macropores yield uneven sediment layers thereby changing the structure and composition of the beach aquifer in addition the macropore depth and quantity influenced the salinity distribution and solute transport in the terrestrial usp and mixing zones in other words macropores can increase the size of the mixing zone and usp in the circulation cell which increases with the macropore depth and quantity thereby increase the land solutes no3 and dom transport paths and residue time sgd is an important transport pathway of terrestrial chemical species into coastal water and macropores decrease freshwater and land sourced chemical discharge levels compared to the absence of macropores the main reason for the decrease in terrestrial no3 discharge is the increase in the usp driven by macropores extending land no3 transport paths and residue time fig 3 and fig 41a 2a thereby increasing denitrification by increasing the solutes no3 and dom contact time e g the particle starting from x 0 m and z 3 m took 215 d also longer than that in the case without macropores 210 d fig 4 a1 a2 in other studies such as the hyporheic zone can create anoxic microzones owing to variability in residence time briggs et al 2015 at the coastal environments denitrification in beach aquifers is more efficient where residence time and contact time between reactive solutes is longer heiss et al 2020 and kim et al 2020 reported that the relative balance between advective doc supply and denitrification modified due to expansion and contraction of the circulation cell and associated changes to the residence time of circulating groundwater another important reason may be that the denitrification rate increases with increasing mixing zone size under macropore action as a result greater no3 transformation results in n2 discharge into the atmosphere heiss et al 2017 found similar results no3 removal increased from 0 to 100 with increasing usp in larger mixing zones inland freshwater controls interact to affect residence time and the size of mixing zone thus the processing time and zone of nitrogen in the system in fact the groundwater level can changes due to groundwater over exploitation with increasing population and economic development kong et al 2015 werner 2013 and oceanic oscillations and evaporation luo et al 2022 zhang et al 2014 a low freshwater input low head will increase the area of usp and promotes denitrification by increase the mixing zone spiteri et al 2008a 2008b demonstrated that denitrification was able to remove large quantities of no3 in systems with low groundwater velocities and significantly reduced no3 fluxes across the aquifer ocean interface and heiss et al 2017 found similar results that the size of the mixing zone and solute residence time dependent denitrification are negatively correlated to groundwater flux this study under a low freshwater input we found that the impact of macropore on the size of mixing zone and solute transport have limited and weaken the impact of macropore on denitrification the results suggest that combination of physical factors may be a useful approach for further understanding biogeochemical these simulations revealed relationships between the macropores and chemical characteristics of the beach aquifer under spring neap tide action the size of the mixing zone and usp increased with the macropore depth and quantity the denitrification zone also increased with the size of the mixing zone which is consistent with previous studies heiss et al 2017 robinson et al 2009 spiteri et al 2008a for example heiss et al 2017 demonstrated that tide driven freshwater saltwater mixing could promote denitrification along the boundary of the intertidal zone robinson et al 2009 and spiteri et al 2008a showed that the net production and removal of no3 increased due to more intense freshwater saltwater mixing in the aquifer in addition although the existence of macropores in sediments affected the oxygen content the nitrification zone slightly expanded with increasing macropore depth and quantity in the mixing zones macropores increase the infiltration of o2 and dom and nitrification and aerobic respiration deplete more o2 in the deep layer dom moved to the deeper layer and encountered more no3 leading to denitrification increases significantly at the bottom of macropores at low tide combined with the decrease in no3 inflow therefore the no3 removal efficiency increased with macropore depth and quantity macropores such as burrowing benthic animals and plant roots found in coastal wetlands worldwide function as ecosystem engineers for example observations at the pan et al 2022 highlighted that macropores improved oxic conditions and significantly improved sediment redox conditions the oxidation zone indicated was deeper in mangrove than mudflat and salt marsh both in zhangjiang estuary mangrove national nature reserve and hailing island national mangrove wetland park in china indicating that large mangrove roots lead to deeper oxidation xiao et al 2022 the interactions between macropores and soil also drive geochemical processes plays a key role in wetland hydrology and biogeochemistry therefore the macropores on biogeochemical transformations is what we should pay more attention to 4 2 implication of db dom for no3 transformation fig 11 shows the dom and denitrification rates to reveal the impact of db dom and fig 12 shows the no3 removal and discharge levels for the various db dom concentrations these results suggest that a dom source can promote the denitrification rate and no3 removal efficiency and that the denitrification rate and no3 removal efficiency increase with the db dom concentration in addition these results support field observations of the role of dom in moderating no3 fluxes in coastal ecosystems kim et al 2017 rossi and underwood 2002 denitrification rates were spatially discontinuous and highest farther along circulating flow paths where dom accumulated consistent with the observed denitrification patterns resulting from scattered pools of carbon within beach sediments kim et al 2019 kim et al 2017 this phenomenon yields important implications for beach managers and the results are expected to provide a theoretical reference for the ecological restoration of coastal tidal flat wetlands and groundwater quality management enhancement therefore we can deeply input dom in a given aquifer through macropores to promote the denitrification rate and no3 removal efficiency leading to higher no3 attenuation figs 11 and 12 show that the size of the denitrification zone and no3 removal efficiency increased with the db dom level and reached a maximum value at a db dom value of 10 m it should be noted that the no3 removal efficiency remained at 85 and the denitrification zone decreased along circulating flow paths landward from the low tide mark in the circulation cell as the higher db dom concentration completely mitigated the area of no3 many marine animals are stranded on beaches under ocean forcing and animal carcass strandings could potentially impact local tourist economies and the ecosystem due to the generation of odors and unattractive sights during decomposition tulloch et al 2018 prado et al 2016 to date coastal managers are increasingly faced with the challenge of disposing of stranded animal carcasses on beaches heiss 2020 to solve these issues coastal managers implement several disposal methods to remove animal carcasses from beaches heiss 2020 undoubtedly the most efficient and energy saving measure is animal carcass beach burial at the bottom of intertidal macropores this approach not only yields considerable cost savings but also yields an important db dom source to promote more no3 transformation into n2 however the design of the beach burial process of animal carcasses should carefully consider the location depth and geochemical environment and characteristics of hydrological dynamics and thus balance the effectiveness and engineering cost 4 3 model simplifications and assumptions tides and waves are important components of ocean forcing these processes can induce saltwater circulations in shallow and seaward aquifers and physical and chemical activities are extremely complex fang et al 2022 xin et al 2010 robinson et al 2007 the extent of tidal modification is expected to depend on the tidal conditions amplitudes and periods in a real system robinson et al 2018 werner 2013 anwar et al 2014 indicated that waves modify the subsurface discharge pathway for terrestrial nutrients and enhance the transformation of these nutrients and fang et al 2022 who presented the tides was found to increase no3 contamination in upstream aquifers and the extent of no3 contamination increased with higher tidal amplitudes in addition we used a fixed inland water table in our study and focused on the interplay between inland water and denitrification in addition other hydrological and biogeochemical factors such as the availability and ratio of nutrients temperature sediment heterogeneity and aquifer geometry were not considered here but could potentially impact the geochemical process and no3 removal efficiency gao et al 2022 kim et al 2017 kong et al 2016 spiteri et al 2008a b future models should therefore consider there factors and the combination of tides and waves the findings in this study are a function of the reaction network which was informed using published literature of observed measurements and modeling of the same hydrologic and biogeochemical processes investigated santos et al 2021 kim et al 2019 kim et al 2017 therefore the results are likely a reasonable approximation of reactivity in the ecological environments of coastal wetlands in our study the numerical model accounted for dom oxidation nitrification and denitrification we considered denitrification as the primary process for no3 removal however other no3 transformation mechanisms and nitrogen cycling pathways may play an important role in determining no3 fluxes into coastal water observed in beach aquifers such as anaerobic ammonium oxidation slomp and van cappellen 2004 and pyrite denitrification spiteri et al 2008a b although anaerobic ammonium oxidation and pyrite denitrification could provide additional no3 removal processes significantly different results would unlikely be obtained if we incorporated these processes into our study thus the results are likely a reasonable approximation for reactivity in natural beach systems 5 conclusion we examined the effect of macropores on the salinity distribution and no3 transformation in unconfined aquifers based on a 2 d coupled variable saturation transient flow and biogeochemical model we assessed the importance of the macropore depth and quantity and dom on the denitrification rate and no3 removal efficiency in the aquifer the following conclusions could be drawn in this study both the experimental and numerical analysis results demonstrated that macropores can affect the salinity distribution increase the usp and mixing zone and lead to longer paths in the aquifer for inland solute transport into the ocean macropores and freshwater levels altered the no3 discharge and transformation processes by freshwater and dispersion along circulating flow paths no3 transformation and no3 removal increased with macropore depth and quantity and decreased with freshwater level as greater depths and quantities and lower freshwater levels created larger mixing zones and enhanced denitrification and weaken the impact of macropore on denitrification dom was a key factor controlling denitrification rates and distributions and db dom promoted a higher no3 removal efficiency and increased with the db dom concentration the no3 removal efficiency can increase to a high level with increasing db dom value it should be noted that this study assumed that the aquifer is a homogeneous and isotropic body containing uniformly distributed macropores while real aquifers are heterogeneous and anisotropic bodies and macropores are randomly distributed which will be the focus of future research this study revealed the influence of macropores and exogenous dom on no3 transformation and highlighted the importance of the depth and quantity which could provide guidance for the removal of no3 contamination in the ecological environments of coastal wetlands credit

2441,coastal ecosystems are sensitive to the input of chemicals originating from submarine groundwater discharge sgd the mixing zone between freshwater and saltwater in beach aquifers promotes biogeochemical transformations affecting nutrient fluxes into the coastal ocean macropores affect groundwater flow leading to a more complicated mixing process and greatly promoting nitrogen transformations laboratory scale experiments and numerical modeling were employed in this study to investigate how macropores affect freshwater saltwater mixing and terrestrial solute transport a numerical investigation is presented demonstrating the influence of macropores on the transport and transformation of nitrate no3 in a homogeneous unconfined nearshore aquifer under spring neap tide action using comsol the results indicate that macropores modify the groundwater discharge pathway of terrestrial no3 by changing nearshore groundwater flow dynamics the denitrification zone expanded from the low tide mark to the high tide mark extended downward to the base of the upper saline plume usp and expanded with increasing macropore depth and quantity macropores increased no3 removal by creating larger mixing zones which increased with the macropore depth and quantity lower freshwater levels enhanced denitrification and weakened the impact of macropores on denitrification the deep burial dissolved organic matter db dom simulation results demonstrated that dissolved organic matter dom could stimulate denitrifiers to increase the denitrification zone by fully consuming o2 along longer flow paths resulting in up to 85 higher no3 removal the findings provide notable implications for management design engineering to protect coastal ecosystems and decrease no3 fluxes into the

conditions of groundwater and saltwater the mixing zone of these pore waters under saltwater recirculation through coastal aquifers can create strong chemical reactions santos et al 2021 heiss et al 2017 mcallister et al 2015 anwar et al 2014 these sgd borne solutes and chemical reactions could reduce groundwater quality result in seagrass habitat loss and species diversity reduction and affect human health heiss et al 2017 anwar et al 2014 slomp and van cappellen 2004 therefore it is very important to characterize and quantify the interplay between physical and biogeochemical processes via sgd of nearshore aquifers which is critical for the effective management and protection of marine ecosystems groundwater flow and solute transport and freshwater saltwater mixing in coastal aquifers are complex luo et al 2021 kong et al 2016 heiss and michael 2014 abarca et al 2013 befus et al 2013 in the presence of tides a saltwater wedge sw may exist due to density driven saltwater recirculation and an usp due to tide induced saltwater recirculation fang et al 2022 santos et al 2021 heiss et al 2020 fig 1 groundwater driven by inland hydraulic gradients bypasses usp and sw flows into nearshore aquifers and mixes with saltwater infiltrating across seabeaches heiss and michael 2014 abarca et al 2013 previous studies have indicated that the usp and mixing zone exhibit characteristics of high biogeochemical activity such as tide induced saltwater recirculation with high flow rates providing a rapidly abundant supply of marine solute to aquifers fang et al 2022 charbonnier et al 2013 santos et al 2009 for example fang et al 2022 found that the extent of no3 contamination increased with higher tidal amplitudes whereas the increment was more evident for a large tidal amplitude in recent years field studies and numerous numerical studies have demonstrated no3 cycling in the intertidal zone and have demonstrated the reactions and chemical solute forms of nutrients in nearshore aquifers santos et al 2021 heiss et al 2017 kim et al 2017 beck et al 2017 mcallister et al 2015 anwar et al 2014 biogeochemical processes affecting nutrient cycling in aquifers are complex and include dom degradation dd aerobic respiration ar denitrification no3 transformation into n2 dni and nitrification nh4 transformation to no3 ni kim et al 2017 shuai et al 2017 anwar et al 2014 spiteri et al 2008a these reactions modify solute concentrations in groundwater prior to discharge such as benthic microorganisms respiring dom and this process is coupled with the reduction of electron acceptors jiang et al 2018 the nitrification process occurs in the shallow layer while the denitrification process occurs in the deeper anaerobic layer driven by anaerobic bacteria shuai et al 2017 infiltrated o2 is rapidly consumed by aerobic respiration and nitrification charbonnier et al 2013 such a feature is also found by kim et al 2017 who collected pore water samples from a beach near cape henlopen delaware and analyzed solute and particulate concentrations for quantitative analysis of this feature a numerical model was employed to support field and laboratory interpretations their results indicated that the highest respiration rates were found in the mixing zone between freshwater and saltwater supported by dissolved organic carbon doc some prior studies assumed the main factor that constrains no3 reduction rates to be the limited availability of dom kim et al 2020 crawshaw et al 2019 rivett et al 2008 a higher doc concentrations and higher carbon reaction rates increase denitrification within the intertidal zone kim et al 2020 spiteri et al 2008a 2008b investigated the fate of nutrients no3 nh4 and po4 3 in idealized subterranean estuaries using a coupled groundwater flow and reactive transport model and revealed that denitrification could remove large quantities of no3 with a low groundwater flow rate and high dom oxidation rate anwar et al 2014 studied solute transport and transformation in homogeneous aquifers under the action of tides and waves and the results demonstrated that tides and waves significantly modified the subsurface discharge pathway for nutrients and enhanced the transformation of these nutrients due to greater freshwater saltwater mixing in nearshore aquifers these studies have indicated no3 transformation into n2 via denitrification which is often considered to play the main role in no3 removal from groundwater to coastal areas kim et al 2017 ocean forcing tides and waves heiss et al 2020 kim et al 2017 anwar et al 2014 hydraulic conductivity heiss et al 2017 kim et al 2017 terrestrial freshwater flux kim et al 2017 beach slope kim et al 2017 and dom kim et al 2020 anwar et al 2014 spiteri et al 2008a 2008b significantly modify the discharge pathway for nutrients and affect the denitrification rate in nearshore aquifers in addition denitrification increases and no3 discharge into coastal water decreases with the dom input anwar et al 2014 this occurs because doc dom not only provides the reactant for denitrification but also provides an anaerobic environment doc and dom oxidation hence understanding dom distributions and the impact of dom on no3 removal constitutes an important step to understanding the cycling of other chemicals in intertidal aquifers the above studies were based on homogeneous aquifers in reality macroporous sediments macropores are defined as pores that have a diameter larger than 50 μm mud or silt loam are found to overlie sands or sandy deposits in systems heiss et al 2020 geng et al 2020 guimond et al 2020 kim et al 2019 kim et al 2017 hughes et al 1998 for instance kim et al 2019 found that inherent reaction rate heterogeneity is inevitable within geological formation reaction rates in intertidal aquifers heiss et al 2020 assessed the influence of heterogeneity on denitrification in intertidal mixing zones based on variable density groundwater flow and reactive transport simulations with geostatistical representations of sedimentary structures and the results indicated that no3 removal may be 80 higher in heterogeneous aquifers than in homogeneous aquifers the simulation results of gao et al 2022 indicated that aquifer heterogeneities are a primary factor in regulating no3 contamination in addition another type of heterogeneity can be attributed to macropores produced by a wide range of flora and fauna from invertebrates to vertebrates commonly found in nearshore aquifers ying 2021 during a yancheng coastal beach in china survey found that from the tidal creek zone to the vegetation zone the macropore density gradually decreased from 28 to 18 m 2 and found that macropores were mainly concentrated in the upper supratidal and intertidal zones similar survey results were also reported by fanjul et al 2008 previous studies have demonstrated that macropores can effectively alter the texture of sediments and oxygen content wang et al 2020 bertics and ziebis 2010 wang et al 2010 and can promote dom oxidation fanjul et al 2015 fanjul et al 2011 kristensen et al 2000 thereby altering the no3 cycle li et al 2021 fanjul et al 2011 fanjul et al 2011 studied the effects of macropores on nitrogen dynamics in a southwestern atlantic intertidal zone and found that bioturbated macropores significantly impacted the soil oxygen content li et al 2021 performed a laboratory experiment and indicated that macropores significantly affected nh4 and no3 concentrations and greatly promoted the nitrogen exchange flux at the sediment water interface to our knowledge the effects of macropores on no3 attenuation in spring neap tidally influenced beach aquifers remain unclear additionally changes in the distribution of denitrification rates and no3 removal efficiency beneath the intertidal zone are influenced by various factors including the macropore depth and quantity and dom concentration db dom which have not been investigated in this study we applied laboratory experiments and numerical analysis to investigate the influence of macropores on groundwater flow freshwater saltwater mixing and denitrification in nearshore aquifers under spring neap tidal influence a series of sensitivity analyses of the macropore depth and quantity and terrestrial freshwater level were performed to assess the macropore impact of denitrification hotspots in beach aquifers finally we simulated how db dom could greatly promote denitrification and no3 removal these results provide a theoretical reference and guidance for the design of engineering measures to decrease no3 contamination and groundwater quality management 2 methodology 2 1 laboratory tracer experiments lab experiments were designed to simulate the groundwater flow and solute transport shown in fig 2 the experimental system comprised two tanks and a thin center with dimensions of 4 0 m long 0 8 m high 0 02 m wide the left side tanks contained simulated saltwater and to visualize the salinity distribution red food coloring e129 allura red ac granular was mixed with saltwater salinity of 35 ppt parts per thousand mass fraction with the associated density at 1 025 kg m3 a tide generator was used to control time varying saltwater levels eq 1 the right side tanks representing the inland boundary were supplied with freshwater a density of 1000 kg m3 and salinity of 0 ppt and a fixed flow 80 ml min the flow generator comprised eight flow inlets evenly distributed along the boundary the thin central flume was packed with quartz sand to simulate an unconfined coastal aquifer quartz sand 0 7 m high with a beach surface slope of 1 4 in these experiments we considered a simple sinusoidal tide as follows 1 h t h 0 a sin 2 π t t where h t m is the tidal level at time t s h 0 is the mean sea level 0 5 m a is the tidal amplitude set to 0 04 m and t is the tidal period set to 240 s pore water was sampled for salinity along a shore perpendicular transect of 12 multilevel samplers the sampler was constructed from the diameter of 0 2 mm and length of 50 cm od stainless steel needle mounted to a syringe stainless steel needle tubes were marked every 1 cm to accurately measure the pore water depth the samplers were installed along the intertidal transect into the beach aquifer when the experiment reached the quasi steady state toe constant the saltwater wedge toe see table 1 for detail location to compared with the experimental results we also calculated the salinity of 12 numerical samplers see table 2 the sampling procedure began with the shallowest layer of the farthest landward sampler and continued seaward along the transect ending on the aquifer for a total of 24 pore water samples a complete location took no less than 30 min to complete and to ensure that each sampling reached quasi steady state salinity was measured as electrical conductivity ysi ec300 and the average value of three samplings at each position is reported as ppt the experiment reached the quasi steady state again after the pore water was sampled we used a syringe 0 2 mm pore size to introduce into 4 ml blue food coloring e129 allura blue ac granular by setting an initial tracer concentration c0 of 0 1 kg m3 at the injection location of x 2 3 m and z 0 6 m as shown in fig 3 to study the solute transport process of a terrestrial conservative solute the quartz sand used was relatively uniform with d 50 median diameter 0 5 mm and d 100 d 10 2 4 the measured saturated hydraulic conductivity using freshwater and the darcy column test method was 3 10 3 m s the sand porosity was 0 46 using the imbibition method collins 1961 four base experiments were conducted as follows 1 case 1 without macropores under tidal action 2 case 2 with macropores under tidal action whereby macropores were inserted at the location of x 0 68 m and the penetration depth i e the distance from the macropore bottom to the aquifer surface reached 0 05 m stainless steel mesh screens with 1 mm openings with a diameter of 10 mm were used to recreate aquifer macropores fig 2 c in the experiments the experimental aquifer was essentially a two dimensional structure focusing on the salinity distribution and inland solute transport path throughout an unconfined aquifer 2 2 numerical simulations the physical experiment cannot fully take into account more complicated influence factors and embody large scale water and mass movement in filed we further conducted numerical simulations to extend above

interface including the intertidal zone please refer to shen et al 2019 and cardenas et al 2015 for details and to apply a spring neap tidal signal to the interface nodes as a time varying dirichlet boundary condition the following formula was used 4 h t h m s l a s s i n 2 π t t s a n s i n 2 π t t n where h t is the tidal head m determined by time t h msl is the mean sea level 10 m a s and a n

in previous studies shuai et al 2017 anwar et al 2014 this model represented a homogeneous and isotropic coastal aquifer with a thickness of 12 m fig 1 the porosity is 0 45 the longitudinal dispersivity al is 0 5 m and the transverse dispersivity at is al 10 in addition the saltwater concentration is 35 ppt mass fraction which was adopted from robinson et al 2018 and shen et al 2019 the landward vertical boundary was set as a constant head hf 10 5 m the macropore width is 0 05 m with a high permeability 1000 m d and porosity of 1 etsias et al 2021 xiao et al 2019 xin et al 2016 xin et al 2009 this technology not only enables simulations of the preferential flow rapid responses to tidal water level fluctuations but also does not affect the simulation results xiao et al 2019 xin et al 2009 to study the transformation of marine nutrients we used a reaction network of four reactive species in the reaction model the model could consider nitrification denitrification aerobic

concentrations occur above the limiting concentration and the reaction rate is independent of the concentration otherwise the electron acceptor inhibits the reaction rate when the o2 and no3 concentrations occur below the limiting concentration as adopted from bardini et al 2012 and spiteri et al 2008b and kim et al 2017 validated this reaction network by comparing simulation results with field data from the cape shores beach adjacent to delaware bay dom rich and oxic saltwater infiltrating the aquifer at the sea boundary contain dom and o2 respectively the concentrations of chemical species remained constant and dom 0 3 m o2 0 2 m no3 0 25 m and nh4 0 2 m were characteristic of the concentrations encountered in coastal sediments at the landward boundary constant no3 and nh4 concentrations were assigned to the inflowing freshwater no3 occurred in the top 4 5 m of the freshwater zone and nh4 occurred in the lower 5 5 m of the aquifer these parameters and boundaries are consistent with those reported previous studies heiss et al 2020 anwar et al 2014 and no3 attenuation as a percentage of the total inflowing terrestrial no3 was defined as the no3 removal efficiency

cno3 is the no3 concentration and lout is the total length of the sea boundary all simulations were run with a time step of 100 s and used the same numerical mesh comprising 90 434 nodes and 90 216 elements the mesh density increased in macropores zones and along the beach with a minimum δx value of 7 cm the courant and péclet number values did not exceed 1 and 2 respectively which satisfies the stability criterion and avoids numerical oscillation we conducted three steps i we considered experimental scale groundwater flow and solute transport processes for verification ii solute transport and reactions occurred in large scale model iii solute transport and reactions simulation considering the effect of db dom for comparison on the denitrification and no3 removal 3 results and analysis 3 1 salinity distribution and solute transport lab scale first from the experimental results depicted in fig 3 tidal forcing created an intertidal circulation cell where saltwater infiltrated near the high tide mark and was discharged near the low tide mark a freshwater discharge zone separated the circulation cell from the lower interface located at the base of the beach formed an usp and sw in the intertidal zone which is consistent with previous field and numerical modeling studies santos et al 2021 fang et al 2021 shen et al 2020 heiss et al 2020 abarca et al 2013 robinson et al 2006 as to the measured salinity we found that the salinity decreased with depth and distance seaward from the mean tide mark as shown in table 1 e g the measured salinity from x 0 48 m and z 0 52 m is 35 ppt while that from x 0 48 m and z 0 48 m is 0 11 ppt and the measured salinity from x 0 72 m and z 0 56 m is 34 6 ppt table 1 owing to the existence of macropores the saltwater plumes usp more deeply penetrated into the aquifer e g the measured salinity at x 0 60 m and z 0 48 m is 0 34 ppt larger than that in the case without macropores 0 2 ppt table 1 simulated salt concentrations and solute transport are compared to the experimental results to ensure consistency the simulated results matched the experimental in all cases well fig 3 the salinity distribution formation process of a usp and sw under tidal action saltwater infiltration near the high tide mark and discharge near the low tide mark and freshwater discharge between the usp and sw which is consistent with previous studies santos et al 2021 fang et al 2021 shen et al 2020 heiss et al 2020 under the impact of macropores the usp vertical enhancement and toe reduction from 1 83 m to 1 79 m e g the measured salinity at x 0 60 m and z 0 48 m is 1 9 ppt larger than that in the case without macropores 0 8 ppt table 2 thus decreasing the sw length and salinity as expected the simulated salinity decreased with the depth and distance seaward from the mean tide mark table 2 e g the simulated salinity from x 0 48 m and z 0 52 m is 35 ppt while that from x 0 48 m and z 0 48 m is 0 15 ppt and the measured salinity from x 0 72 m and z 0 56 m is 33 2 ppt table 2 these model simulations of the laboratory experiments provided a good match with the experimental observations the solute plume moved toward the sea driven by inland freshwater and was discharged from the drainage channel between the usp and sw fig 3 also shows that the solute plume in the numerical results exhibited the same trends as those observed in the laboratory results the solute plume migrates faster and discharges earlier from the aquifer in the absence of macropores than those observed in the presence of macropores along shorter paths e g the solute plume was located at x 1 63 m and migrates faster than that in the case with macropores x 1 85 m 1 h after injection the plume traveled predominantly seaward discharging across the lower beachface 5 h after injection and faster than that in the case with macropores 5 h 40 min both the experimental and numerical results consistently demonstrated that macropores could impact the salinity distribution and solute transport in coastal environments in other words macropores could increase the usp and mixing zone and yield a longer residence time and longer path in aquifers for terrestrial solute transport these results have important implications for intertidal biogeochemical transformations between freshwater and saltwater in beach aquifers 3 2 macropore effects on no3 attenuation and reaction distributions based on the solute and reactivity distributions are shown in fig 4 spring neap tidal forcing formed an usp in the intertidal zone and generated a freshwater saltwater mixing zone fig 4 a1 consistent with the above results and previous studies heiss et al 2020 zheng et al 2020 heiss and michael 2014 robinson et al 2006 infiltrating saltwater served as a dom source in the intertidal zone leading to dom distribution in the intertidal usp and sw fig 4 b1 which was elevated in the shallow beach subsurface and decreased with depth due to dom degradation dd aerobic respiration ar and denitrification dni under aerobic bacterial action dom oxidation was coupled with aerobic respiration so o2 concentrations decreased in the deep part of the aquifer fig 4 d1 the o2 concentration distribution closely resembles that measured by kim et al 2017 decreasing with depth and distance seaward from the high tide mark once o2 was completely consumed the remaining dom continuously moved along the flow paths and entered the mixing zone along the boundary of the usp and interface of the sw where it encountered no3 the presence of denitrifiers maintains the function of denitrification gao et al 2010 no3 and dom originated in different waters this led to the denitrification being mixing dependent note that no3 and nh4 were abundant throughout the reaction fig 4 c1 e1 the discharge of land derived species occurred in a narrow zone between the usp and sw the usp was characterized by low no3 and nh4 concentrations due to high flow rates in the recirculating saltwater as seen from the simulation results fig 4 nitrification fig 4 f1 and denitrification fig 4 g1 hotspots occurred in the usp and interface between saltwater and freshwater in the sw forming an arc shaped denitrification zone at the boundary of the usp along the anaerobic zone rich in dom and no3 under spring neap tidal forcing nh4 is derived from freshwater and denitrification and mixing with o2 leads to nitrification however the nitrification rate was the highest at the low tide mark due to o2 and nh4 discharge and enrichment it is noteworthy that nitrification and denitrification coexist between salinity contours of 1 and 50 fig 4 f1 g1 nitrification creates an anaerobic environment and reactants no3 for the next step of denitrification while denitrification provides nh4 for subsequent nitrification the denitrification rate was lowest beneath the high tide mark and increased along circulating flow paths toward the low tide mark at sw denitrification reaches the highest which is due to the longer transport path and travel time of solute driven by density where dom and no3 can fully react fig 4 a1 b1 c1 g1 macropores altered the local hydraulic gradient and further enhanced the mixing process near the usp e g the particle starting from x 0 m and z 3 m took 215 d also longer than that in the case without macropores 210 d fig 4 a1 a2 the 1 salinity contour z 3 95 m is deeper than that without macropores z 5 m fig 4 b1 b2 it was evident that the species and reaction rate distributions in the nearshore aquifer were significantly altered by macropores due to transport pathway modification and saltwater recirculation the size of the reaction zone increases with the increase in the size of the freshwater saltwater mixing zone at usp the denitrification zone expanded from the low tide mark to the high tide mark and extended downward to the base of the usp which led to denitrification increases fig 4 g2 however at sw the solute residue time and denitrification slightly decreased as the usp pushed the sw seaward e g the toe 59 2 m was larger than that with macropores 59 1 m fig 4 a1 a2 in addition macropores increase the infiltration of o2 and dom nitrification and aerobic respiration deplete more o2 in the deep layer fig 4 d2 f2 a large amount of dom along pore water flow paths to the anaerobic deeper layer led to denitrification increases to further explore the impact of macropores on the fate of no3 we calculated the no3 discharge and no3 attenuation degree macropores altered the percentage of no3 removed prior to discharge no3 removal increased from 1 69 to 2 05 under macropore action creating larger mixing zones and no3 discharge consequently decreased 3 3 terrestrial freshwater level effects the exchange of saltwater and freshwater mixing zone size and reaction zone extent decreased with freshwater level for both the macropore and without macropore models e g the particle released from x 0 m and z 3 m is 304 d of low head hf 10 2 m without macropores and longer than that high head hf 10 8 m 174 d fig 5 a1 a3 we calculated the no3 removal efficiency and no3 discharge level to assess the impact of the water level fig 6 a significant negative relationship was found between rn and hf for both the macropore r2 0 913 and without macropore r2 0 934 models e g the no3 removal efficiency decreased from 2 91 to 1 24 with increasing high head up to 10 8 m without macropore conditions the no3 discharge level was negatively correlated with increasing head r2 0 958 e g the no3 discharge was 2 675 g m for the low head hf 10 2 m without macropore and less than that for the high head hf 10 8 m of 5 87 g m this is most likely because the infiltration of o2 and dom increases with decreasing freshwater head nitrification reactions and aerobic respiration deplete more o2 in the deep layer denitrification increases and no3 discharge decrease under low head conditions hf 10 2 m there was a similar value of no3 removal efficiency for both the macropore and without macropore models fig 6a the macropores altered the no3 removal efficiency with increasing head e g the no3 removal efficiency increased from 1 24 to 1 75 under a high head hf 10 8 m in the presence of macropores in addition the macropore altered the no3 discharge level with the head increase e g the no3 discharge level is 5 87 g m of high head hf 10 8 m without macropores and large than that with macropores 4 73 g m and the no3 discharge level is 2 68 g m of low head hf 10 2 m without macropores and with macropores is 2 64 g m this is because a low freshwater input will increase the area of usp the impact of macropores on the size of the mixing zone and solute transport are limited 3 4 macropore depth effects the size of the freshwater saltwater mixing zone was the most sensitive to the macropore depth h fig 7 because macropores enhanced the exchange of freshwater and saltwater e g the particle released from x 0 m and z 3 m is 220 d of macropores depth was 3 8 m and longer than that in the case with h 1 8 m 212 d fig 7 a1 a3 the size of the reaction zone increased with the macropore depth the denitrification zone expanded from the high tide mark to the low tide mark extending downward to the base of the usp the denitrification zone expanded with increasing macropore depth e g the denitrification extended to z 1 7 m when the macropores depth was 3 8 m which is deeper than that in the case with h 1 8 m z 2 7 m in the usp zone fig s1 in detail when the macropores depth was large fig 7 a3 b3 c3 the solute residue time and denitrification showed increase as the usp further pushed the sw seaward although nitrification zone expansion was mainly concentrated at the bottom of the macropores and low tide marks and slightly expanded with increasing macropore depth in the mixing zones nitrification and aerobic respiration also depleted more o2 in the deep layer and denitrification increased significantly fig 7 c1 c3 fig 8 a shows the no3 attenuation degree and fig 8 b shows no3 discharge for the different macropore depths a significant positive relationship was found between rn and h r2 0 918 as shown in fig 8 a and the no3 discharge level was negatively correlated with macropore depth r2 0 974 fig 8b macropore depth altered the no3 removal efficiency prior to discharge the no3 removal efficiency increased from 1 69 to 2 38 with increasing macropore depth up to 3 8 m as the greater depth created larger mixing zones the no3 discharge level decreases with macropore depth 3 5 macropore quantity effects we further analyzed the impact of the macropore quantity n on the size of the freshwater saltwater mixing zone fig 9 as expected the exchange of saltwater and freshwater mixing zone size and reaction zone extent increased with the macropore quantity e g the particle released from x 0 m and z 3 m is 225 d of macropores quantity was 3 and longer than that in the case with single macropore 220 d fig 9 a1 a3 in other words the denitrification zone expanded with increasing macropore quantity the denitrification zone extended downward to the base of the usp and expanded with increasing macropore quantity e g the denitrification extends to z 1 2 m of macropores quantity was 3 and deeper than that in the case with quantity is 1 z 1 7 m at usp zone fig s2 in detail when the macropore quantity was large fig 9 a3 b3 c3 the solute residue time and denitrification showed a slight increase as the usp further pushed the sw seaward nitrification and aerobic respiration deplete more o2 in the deep layer and denitrification increases significantly fig 9 c1 c3 we calculated the no3 removal efficiency and no3 discharge level to assess the impact of the macropore quantity fig 10 a significant positive relationship was found between rn and n r2 0 81 the macropore quantity altered the no3 removal efficiency the no3 removal efficiency increased from 2 38 to 2 62 with increasing macropore quantity up to 3 which could be attributed to the creation of larger mixing zones under the influence of a larger number of macropores and the no3 discharge level decreased as the denitrification zone expanded with increasing macropore quantity i e we found that the no3 discharge level was negatively correlated with macropore quantity r2 0 939 fig 10b from sections 3 2 3 3 3 4 and 3 5 we found that macropores altered denitrification and solute distribution macropores led to deeper dom infiltration and greater denitrification the deeper dom occurred the greater the resulting anaerobic zone expansion and the more sufficient the denitrification reactants consequently the effect of db dom on denitrification is studied and described in section 3 6 3 6 effects of the db dom reactivity the dom concentration altered the chemical composition of pore water in the beach aquifer fig 11 a c shows the impact of various db dom concentrations concentrations were 1 m 5 m and 10 m respectively on the dom distribution and denitrification rate injection of dom a dom source led to elevated dom concentrations at the bottom of macropore localized areas which decreased along flow paths owing to dom oxidation db dom concentrations also influenced dom spatial patterns the variability in dom concentrations at the different db dom levels could be attributed to the dom stimulated aerobic respiration and denitrification relationship within the intertidal circulation cell respiration triggered by the oversupply of db dom reduced the o2 in the pore water and created a larger anaerobic zone deep in the aquifer depressing the activity of aerobic reactions a large amount of dom along the flow paths to the anaerobic deeper layer led to the denitrification increasing significantly and dom greatly accumulated at the bottom of the aquifer a higher db dom value produced greater dom discharge and resulted in a higher downward gradient dom concentration gradient fig 12 shows that the no3 removal efficiency increased with db dom the no3 removal efficiency increased from 2 38 to 85 with an increase in db dom from 0 to 10 m however the discharge of land derived no3 decreased with db dom and ranged from 4 35 to 1 13 m m reaching a minimum value at a db dom value of 10 m moreover statistical correlation analysis demonstrated a significant positive relationship between rn and dom r2 0 997 fig 12a and the no3 discharge level was negatively correlated with dom r2 0 969 fig 12b these results demonstrate the importance of the dom reactivity on no3 cycling in the intertidal zone and illustrate the influence of db dom on no3 transport and fate in beach aquifers db dom promotes greater no3 removal hence the magnitude of outgoing no3 fluxes is dependent on the intensities of both removal and supply 4 discussion 4 1 implication of macropores for the salinity distribution no3 discharge and no3 removal efficiency under tidal action our experimental laboratory results demonstrated that macropores could change the salinity distribution and solute transport of land sources and macropores could increase the usp and mixing zone leading to longer paths in the aquifer for terrestrial solute transport fig 3 and fig 4 1a 2a some previous studies found similar results for example shen et al 2020 found that under tidal action landward particles bypassed the usp prior to discharging to the sea and the associated travel time increased in contrast under nontidal conditions xin et al 2010 carried out a numerical simulation and found that the inland particle travel time increased with usp macropores yield uneven sediment layers thereby changing the structure and composition of the beach aquifer in addition the macropore depth and quantity influenced the salinity distribution and solute transport in the terrestrial usp and mixing zones in other words macropores can increase the size of the mixing zone and usp in the circulation cell which increases with the macropore depth and quantity thereby increase the land solutes no3 and dom transport paths and residue time sgd is an important transport pathway of terrestrial chemical species into coastal water and macropores decrease freshwater and land sourced chemical discharge levels compared to the absence of macropores the main reason for the decrease in terrestrial no3 discharge is the increase in the usp driven by macropores extending land no3 transport paths and residue time fig 3 and fig 41a 2a thereby increasing denitrification by increasing the solutes no3 and dom contact time e g the particle starting from x 0 m and z 3 m took 215 d also longer than that in the case without macropores 210 d fig 4 a1 a2 in other studies such as the hyporheic zone can create anoxic microzones owing to variability in residence time briggs et al 2015 at the coastal environments denitrification in beach aquifers is more efficient where residence time and contact time between reactive solutes is longer heiss et al 2020 and kim et al 2020 reported that the relative balance between advective doc supply and denitrification modified due to expansion and contraction of the circulation cell and associated changes to the residence time of circulating groundwater another important reason may be that the denitrification rate increases with increasing mixing zone size under macropore action as a result greater no3 transformation results in n2 discharge into the atmosphere heiss et al 2017 found similar results no3 removal increased from 0 to 100 with increasing usp in larger mixing zones inland freshwater controls interact to affect residence time and the size of mixing zone thus the processing time and zone of nitrogen in the system in fact the groundwater level can changes due to groundwater over exploitation with increasing population and economic development kong et al 2015 werner 2013 and oceanic oscillations and evaporation luo et al 2022 zhang et al 2014 a low freshwater input low head will increase the area of usp and promotes denitrification by increase the mixing zone spiteri et al 2008a 2008b demonstrated that denitrification was able to remove large quantities of no3 in systems with low groundwater velocities and significantly reduced no3 fluxes across the aquifer ocean interface and heiss et al 2017 found similar results that the size of the mixing zone and solute residence time dependent denitrification are negatively correlated to groundwater flux this study under a low freshwater input we found that the impact of macropore on the size of mixing zone and solute transport have limited and weaken the impact of macropore on denitrification the results suggest that combination of physical factors may be a useful approach for further understanding biogeochemical these simulations revealed relationships between the macropores and chemical characteristics of the beach aquifer under spring neap tide action the size of the mixing zone and usp increased with the macropore depth and quantity the denitrification zone also increased with the size of the mixing zone which is consistent with previous studies heiss et al 2017 robinson et al 2009 spiteri et al 2008a for example heiss et al 2017 demonstrated that tide driven freshwater saltwater mixing could promote denitrification along the boundary of the intertidal zone robinson et al 2009 and spiteri et al 2008a showed that the net production and removal of no3 increased due to more intense freshwater saltwater mixing in the aquifer in addition although the existence of macropores in sediments affected the oxygen content the nitrification zone slightly expanded with increasing macropore depth and quantity in the mixing zones macropores increase the infiltration of o2 and dom and nitrification and aerobic respiration deplete more o2 in the deep layer dom moved to the deeper layer and encountered more no3 leading to denitrification increases significantly at the bottom of macropores at low tide combined with the decrease in no3 inflow therefore the no3 removal efficiency increased with macropore depth and quantity macropores such as burrowing benthic animals and plant roots found in coastal wetlands worldwide function as ecosystem engineers for example observations at the pan et al 2022 highlighted that macropores improved oxic conditions and significantly improved sediment redox conditions the oxidation zone indicated was deeper in mangrove than mudflat and salt marsh both in zhangjiang estuary mangrove national nature reserve and hailing island national mangrove wetland park in china indicating that large mangrove roots lead to deeper oxidation xiao et al 2022 the interactions between macropores and soil also drive geochemical processes plays a key role in wetland hydrology and biogeochemistry therefore the macropores on biogeochemical transformations is what we should pay more attention to 4 2 implication of db dom for no3 transformation fig 11 shows the dom and denitrification rates to reveal the impact of db dom and fig 12 shows the no3 removal and discharge levels for the various db dom concentrations these results suggest that a dom source can promote the denitrification rate and no3 removal efficiency and that the denitrification rate and no3 removal efficiency increase with the db dom concentration in addition these results support field observations of the role of dom in moderating no3 fluxes in coastal ecosystems kim et al 2017 rossi and underwood 2002 denitrification rates were spatially discontinuous and highest farther along circulating flow paths where dom accumulated consistent with the observed denitrification patterns resulting from scattered pools of carbon within beach sediments kim et al 2019 kim et al 2017 this phenomenon yields important implications for beach managers and the results are expected to provide a theoretical reference for the ecological restoration of coastal tidal flat wetlands and groundwater quality management enhancement therefore we can deeply input dom in a given aquifer through macropores to promote the denitrification rate and no3 removal efficiency leading to higher no3 attenuation figs 11 and 12 show that the size of the denitrification zone and no3 removal efficiency increased with the db dom level and reached a maximum value at a db dom value of 10 m it should be noted that the no3 removal efficiency remained at 85 and the denitrification zone decreased along circulating flow paths landward from the low tide mark in the circulation cell as the higher db dom concentration completely mitigated the area of no3 many marine animals are stranded on beaches under ocean forcing and animal carcass strandings could potentially impact local tourist economies and the ecosystem due to the generation of odors and unattractive sights during decomposition tulloch et al 2018 prado et al 2016 to date coastal managers are increasingly faced with the challenge of disposing of stranded animal carcasses on beaches heiss 2020 to solve these issues coastal managers implement several disposal methods to remove animal carcasses from beaches heiss 2020 undoubtedly the most efficient and energy saving measure is animal carcass beach burial at the bottom of intertidal macropores this approach not only yields considerable cost savings but also yields an important db dom source to promote more no3 transformation into n2 however the design of the beach burial process of animal carcasses should carefully consider the location depth and geochemical environment and characteristics of hydrological dynamics and thus balance the effectiveness and engineering cost 4 3 model simplifications and assumptions tides and waves are important components of ocean forcing these processes can induce saltwater circulations in shallow and seaward aquifers and physical and chemical activities are extremely complex fang et al 2022 xin et al 2010 robinson et al 2007 the extent of tidal modification is expected to depend on the tidal conditions amplitudes and periods in a real system robinson et al 2018 werner 2013 anwar et al 2014 indicated that waves modify the subsurface discharge pathway for terrestrial nutrients and enhance the transformation of these nutrients and fang et al 2022 who presented the tides was found to increase no3 contamination in upstream aquifers and the extent of no3 contamination increased with higher tidal amplitudes in addition we used a fixed inland water table in our study and focused on the interplay between inland water and denitrification in addition other hydrological and biogeochemical factors such as the availability and ratio of nutrients temperature sediment heterogeneity and aquifer geometry were not considered here but could potentially impact the geochemical process and no3 removal efficiency gao et al 2022 kim et al 2017 kong et al 2016 spiteri et al 2008a b future models should therefore consider there factors and the combination of tides and waves the findings in this study are a function of the reaction network which was informed using published literature of observed measurements and modeling of the same hydrologic and biogeochemical processes investigated santos et al 2021 kim et al 2019 kim et al 2017 therefore the results are likely a reasonable approximation of reactivity in the ecological environments of coastal wetlands in our study the numerical model accounted for dom oxidation nitrification and denitrification we considered denitrification as the primary process for no3 removal however other no3 transformation mechanisms and nitrogen cycling pathways may play an important role in determining no3 fluxes into coastal water observed in beach aquifers such as anaerobic ammonium oxidation slomp and van cappellen 2004 and pyrite denitrification spiteri et al 2008a b although anaerobic ammonium oxidation and pyrite denitrification could provide additional no3 removal processes significantly different results would unlikely be obtained if we incorporated these processes into our study thus the results are likely a reasonable approximation for reactivity in natural beach systems 5 conclusion we examined the effect of macropores on the salinity distribution and no3 transformation in unconfined aquifers based on a 2 d coupled variable saturation transient flow and biogeochemical model we assessed the importance of the macropore depth and quantity and dom on the denitrification rate and no3 removal efficiency in the aquifer the following conclusions could be drawn in this study both the experimental and numerical analysis results demonstrated that macropores can affect the salinity distribution increase the usp and mixing zone and lead to longer paths in the aquifer for inland solute transport into the ocean macropores and freshwater levels altered the no3 discharge and transformation processes by freshwater and dispersion along circulating flow paths no3 transformation and no3 removal increased with macropore depth and quantity and decreased with freshwater level as greater depths and quantities and lower freshwater levels created larger mixing zones and enhanced denitrification and weaken the impact of macropore on denitrification dom was a key factor controlling denitrification rates and distributions and db dom promoted a higher no3 removal efficiency and increased with the db dom concentration the no3 removal efficiency can increase to a high level with increasing db dom value it should be noted that this study assumed that the aquifer is a homogeneous and isotropic body containing uniformly distributed macropores while real aquifers are heterogeneous and anisotropic bodies and macropores are randomly distributed which will be the focus of future research this study revealed the influence of macropores and exogenous dom on no3 transformation and highlighted the importance of the depth and quantity which could provide guidance for the removal of no3 contamination in the ecological environments of coastal wetlands credit

2442,the crop water footprint wf refers to the water consumption per unit grain production which can reflect the quantity and types of water consumption over the entire growth period providing a comprehensive view that is useful for agricultural water resources management generally crop water consumption and crop yield are the main component of wf but there are inconsistencies in their spatial resolution thus it is difficult to effectively evaluate agricultural water usage under complex and variable planting structures this study quantified crop yield and crop water consumption at fine resolution 250 m using remote sensing methods and evaluated the spatiotemporal variability of the green water footprint wfg and blue water footprint wfb of chinese baojixia irrigation district bid specifically we firstly mapped the spatial distribution of the wheat and maize field using a remote sensing based support vector machine svm method then the partial least squares regression plsr method was used to construct the yield estimation model based on multi temporal remote sensing data and a remote sensing based water balance assessment tool rwbat model were constructed to quantify water consumption finally the spatiotemporal variability of wfg and wfb at 250 m resolution was analyzed the results show that the average annual wfg of wheat and maize in bid is 0 525 and 0 469 m3 kg accounting for 81 and 93 of the total wf respectively from the perspective of spatial distribution the low values of the total wf are concentrated in the central bid while the high values are distributed in northwest part the remote sensing based method can effectively reflect the wf at high spatial and temporal resolution under complex planting structures which can provide a basis for guaranteeing the efficient use and regulation of agricultural water resources keywords water footprint irrigation district water consumption crop yield remote sensing data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the pressure on regional freshwater resources is gradually increasing with the continuous increase in agricultural irrigation industrial production and domestic water use hoekstra et al 2011 vörösmarty et al 2015 agriculture water consumption accounts for more than 63 of the total water consumption in china which is primarily used for irrigation luan et al 2018b agriculture as the greatest water user has great potential for saving water population expansion in the coming decades is expected in turn to raise food demand while water supplies will continue to be a major constraint for food production rosa et al 2020 thus to ensure food security agricultural water management must be strengthened and agricultural water usage efficiency must be improved the main prerequisites for enhancing agricultural water management in irrigated areas are the accurate calculations of the water consumption of field crops and the evaluations of water use efficiency under various management approaches the crop water footprint wf has gradually evolved as an efficient tool to improve the management and sustainability of water resources luan et al 2018a the wf serves as an indicator of the quantity of freshwater use across the full crop production cycle and is the ratio of a crop s water consumption per unit area to its yield throughout the whole growth period hoekstra et al 2011 for rain fed crops the green water footprint or the effective rainfall consumed in crop production is the main factor in the wf for irrigated crops the wf comprises both the green water footprint and the blue water footprint the blue water footprint is the amount of irrigation water consumed in crop production groundwater volume and loss of transmission and distribution water in general the water footprint of crop production is a comprehensive indicator for measuring water use in crop agriculture which can be used to consistently evaluate the water use efficiency in both rain fed crops and irrigated crops based on the wf quantification method framework proposed by hoekstra et al 2011 methods to measure the two main component of crop water consumption and crop yield were designed currently there are three primary methods 1 the crop model method in which the crop yield is calculated and crop water consumption estimated mainly based on the point scale crop water productivity models such as aquacrop wang et al 2019 cropwat sun et al 2013 shi et al 2015 epic shi et al 2017 though it is difficult to consider the hydrological effects caused by complex environmental changes and changes in the underlying surface of the region 2 the empirical formula method which is based on an empirical formula to calculate the water consumption combined with the statistical yearbook of yield data to calculate the wf on the regional scale han et al 2021 feng et al 2017 but this method does not consider the physical mechanism of crop water consumption and cannot reflect the difference in the crop water footprint within the region 3 the hydrological model method distributed hydrological models have been employed to simulate the evapotranspiration et of crops and combined with yield data to calculate the wf on the basin scale luan et al 2018b gao et al 2021 the hydrological model method uses the hydrological response unit hru as a basis for quantifying the wf the hru however cannot reflect the water footprint of crops under complex planting structure changes crop yield data are primarily taken from statistical yearbooks which do not account for yield disparities between hrus agriculture in china has been dominated by farmers who are smallholders meaning that the farmland is divided into small parcels belonging to different families zhang et al 2020 smallholdings vary in irrigation fertilizer and crop types which can lead to differences in yields and water use across fields the geographic resolution mismatch between yield and crop water consumption unit will affect the accuracy of water footprint estimation however in irrigated areas with complex and variable crop structures calculation of a high resolution crop water footprint is critical for water resource planning with the maturity and development of remote sensing technology remote sensing data with high temporal and spatial resolutions have become a promising tool to assess crop yield and evapotranspiration at the regional scale han et al 2020 wu et al 2015 over the past few decades studies on crop yield estimate using remote sensing data focused on developing statistical correlations between yield and vegetation indicators and yield estimation models based on multi temporal remote sensing data are superior to those based on only one particular time period aghighi et al 2018 zhu et al 2018 han et al 2020 moreover studies on remote sensing based evapotranspiration models have consistently progressed from empirical formula carter and liang 2019 wang et al 2022 to mechanistic model bastiaanssen et al 1998 norman et al 1995 shuttleworth and wallace 1985 and mechanistic model has been widely used due to its low requirements for input parameters and good simulation performance hu et al 2009 both the remote sensing methods of crop yield and evapotranspiration provide the possibility of quantifying the remote sensing based water footprint tampouratzi et al 2015 quinteiro et al 2018 romaguera et al 2010 the wf of crop production and the crop water productivity cwp has a close relationship which are reciprocal of each other mathematically although remote sensing quantification of water footprint is in its infancy currently the cwp assessment using remote sensing data has attracted much attention in many researches before bastiaanssen and steduto 2017 de oliveira costa et al 2020 wu et al 2015 according to the concept of cwp the crop yield and actual et are the key parameters for cwp assessment most remote sensing based cwp studies focused on quantification regional crop et by various models with remote sensing data without contributing to the estimation of crop yield li et al 2008 immerzeel et al 2008 wu et al 2015 de oliveira costa et al 2020 the crop yield data used in these studies are mainly from official statistics and the spatial scales of crop yield and evapotranspiration are always mismatched while the complex and variable crop structures of the farmland underlying surface is also ignored which will both affect the accuracy of the cwp assessment in this context it is necessary to consider the complex planting structure unify the spatial temporal scales of the input parameters and develop finer spatial resolution of crop water footprint quantification method the aim of this study is to estimate crop yield and simulate crop water consumption at 250 m resolution using remote sensing methods and to accurately quantify the wf of wheat and maize under a complex planting structure the research described in this paper can be organized as follows a identification of the spatial distribution of wheat and maize in irrigated areas and estimation of crop yield at 250 m resolution based on sentinel 2a and modis data b constructing of a remote sensing based water balance assessment tool rwbat model to quantify the water consumption of rain fed and irrigated wheat and maize c quantification of the wf of wheat and maize at high spatial resolution in chinese baojixia irrigated district bid rapid and accurate quantification of wf in complex planting farmland can provided fast and targeted countermeasures regarding the efficient use of water resources and optimal regulation of planting structure which is of great significance to synergically ensure food and water security in arid and semi arid areas 2 study area and data collection 2 1 study area baojixia irrigation district bid is located in the western part of guanzhong plain shaanxi province china fig 1 which is one of the top 10 largest irrigated districts in china the cultivated area of bid at 194 400 hm2 accounts for about 82 of the total land area and the irrigation area is 128 000 hm2 cheng et al 2019 bid has typical continental monsoon climate characteristics with an annual average temperature of 13 1 and an average annual rainfall of 615 mm the rainfall is unevenly distributed across seasons and occurs mainly in summer and autumn the major crops are wheat maize rape and economically important orchards e g of kiwifruit apple etc this area is the largest grain irrigated area in shaanxi province which is of great significance to the food security of shaanxi province agriculture in bid has always been smallholder based with scattered farmland different farmland management methods and therefore characterized by a complex planting structure which creates difficulties for accurately calculating the water footprint of crop production 2 2 data for crop identification and yield estimation this study mapped the spatial distribution of the wheat and maize and estimated crop yields based on remote sensing methods and totally four types of data were used for this analysis including from flc10 product sentinel 2a images ground sample data crop types and yield and statistical yearbook data and the detailed data are described as follows

the data were obtained from baojixia irrigation district administration mainly including the irrigation schedule and the net irrigation quota as shown in table 1 3 methods 3 1 overall framework this study aimed to propose a technique based on remote sensing for quantifying the wf of wheat and maize under a complex planting structure and the general roadmap of the study is shown in fig 2 the first step was to obtain all the input data needed for yield estimation and water balance model construction the second step was to calculate the crop yield and the crop water consumption on the one hand we identified the spatial distribution of wheat and maize using the support vector machine svm method and constructed a yield estimation model to estimate crop yield with a resolution of 250 m in bid on the other hand we constructed the rwbat model to calculate the crop water consumption under rain and irrigation scenarios the third step was to quantify the blue water and green water footprints of wheat and maize at a 250 m resolution 3 2 crop identification and yield estimation using remote sensing methods 3 2 1 crop identification based on multispectral data support vector machine svm is a nonparametric machine learning technique based on statistical learning theory slt mountrakis et al 2011 this method basically establishes the optimal decision hyperplane which maximizes the distance between the nearest samples on both sides of the hyperplane and achieves better separation between the classified samples barrett et al 2014 currently this method is commonly used to classify land cover garg et al 2022 the classification experiment in this study was based on the support vector machine module in envi 5 3 based on this module radial basic function was used as the inner product kernel function and the formula was as follows jin et al 2022 1 k x i x j e x p x i x j 2 2 σ 2 where the inner product kernel k x i x j with width σ 2 is the same for all kernels the input of gamma in the kernel function is the reciprocal of the number of bands in the input image which is set as 0 10 the penalty parameter value is used to balance the contradiction between the training error and the target boundary which is set as 100 pyramid level is used to set the number of classifications in the sample training and classification process set to 0 classification probability threshold is used to set the probability size of svm classifier to classify a single pixel set to 0 in this study based on the cropland of from flc10 product and combined with the phenological information on crops we used the svm method to extract the maps of wheat and maize in bid to determine the accuracy we used an obfuscation matrix that compared the classification to the ground truth data at certain points the accuracy evaluation indexes of the confusion matrix include the overall accuracy and the kappa coefficient foody 2002 sim and wright 2005 3 2 2 yield estimation method crop yield data are critical for accurately calculating the water footprint previous studies have shown that the use of ndvi to estimate spatial yield is appropriate ren et al 2008 son et al 2014 since there is a statistical relationship between ndvi and crop yield during the crop s critical growth period 4 8 weeks before harvest rembold et al 2013 becker reshef et al 2010 nagy et al 2018 ndvi of crop critical growth periods can be considered for yield estimation however there is multicollinearity of ndvi in yield estimation model of multi temporal ndvi the partial least squares regression plsr method has advantages in data dimensionality reduction information synthesis and solving co linear problems and provide quantitative modeling of complex relationships with predictors and response variables of complex problems wold et al 2001 zhang et al 2021 a set of correlated variables are transformed into several independent principal components which is then used with multiple linear regression for regression analysis the plsr method is an extension of a multiple linear regression model shawul et al 2019 but the performance is more robust geladi and kowalski 1986 zhou et al 2020 therefore in this study the plsr method was used to constructed the yield estimation model based on multi temporal ndvi and yield 3 3 model construction and validation 3 3 1 basic principle of the water balance model to calculate the water consumed by the crops under rain and irrigation scenarios this study constructed the remote sensing based water balance assessment tool rwbat model in the water balance model the canopy interception method was used to calculate interception evaporation the scs curve method was used to calculate runoff the swh model hu et al 2009 principle was used to calculate the soil evaporation and plant transpiration and soil divided into three layers to calculate infiltration the simulation framework in the rwbat model as shown in fig 3 this water balance model required almost nine input parameters including pre precipitation ig net irrigation depth ndvi normalized difference vegetation index lai leaf area index ws wind speed par photo synthetically active radiation vpd vapor pressure deficit ta average temperature of the surface and rh relative humidity the square grid was chosen as the basic simulation unit in the rwbat model and the model s basic water balance theory is as follows 2 δ s w i n r i s f i p e i s e i l f i s e p i where δ s w i is the variation in soil water mm on day i n r i is the total rainfall and irrigation excluding canopy interception

determining the possible ranges of the six parameters we performed parameter calibration using the following three steps to minimize the uncertainty of modeling 1 on the basis of previous research findings we specified a rough range for each parameter and ran 5 million monte carlo simulations with parameter sets randomly sampled from the given ranges hu et al 2009 2 we compared the simulated et and the measured data with a linear regression function to obtain the determinant coefficient r2 and the slope k 3 we selected the 20 highest r2 simulation values with the k in the range of 0 95 1 05 as the best simulations the best fit parameter set was determined by taking the average of the 20 parameter sets and driving the water balance model with the best parameter to get the final simulation data to calibrate and verify the water balance model performance the root mean square error rmse and the correlation coefficient r2 were used to compare and analyze the actual and simulated data hu et al 2017 3 4 calculation of green water and blue water footprint the scenario simulation method liu and yang 2010 luan et al 2018b msigwa et al 2022 was used to distinguish the green and blue water consumption of the irrigated cropland and the two scenarios were set in the rwbat model 1 rain fed and 2 rain fed irrigation then according to the water footprint calculation method hoekstra et al 2011 the water footprint of crop production in the irrigated area is calculated as follows 24 w f w f g w f b w c 1 y w c 2 w c 1 y where w f g is the green water footprint m3 kg of crop production w f b is the blue water footprint m3 kg of crop production w f is the total water footprint m3 kg of crop production y is the crop yield kg m2 w c 1 is the water consumed mm by crops in scenario 1 of the rwbat model and w c 2 is the water consumed mm by crops in scenario 2 of the rwbat model 4 results 4 1 crop identification and yield estimation 4 1 1 crop identification the water footprint for crop production is mainly affected by water consumption and yield during the crop growth period and the spatial distribution of typical crops is the basis for accurate quantification of the crop production water footprint therefore this study firstly extracted the cultivated land based on the land use data from flc10 product of bid in 2017 and then used the svm classification method to identify the spatial distribution of wheat and maize in 2017 2020 on the basis of the cultivated land in 2017 the results are as follows the confusion matrix was calculated using the validation points 3 10 sample points as shown in fig 4 a and 4b the overall accuracy and the kappa coefficient were both more than 80 0 which shows a good performance in the classification of these two crops as shown in fig 4c and 4d a comparison of statistical records and the calculated planting area of wheat and maize show that the change trends in the calculated and statistical planting areas are consistent in 2017 2020 the relative error of wheat and maize during 2017 2020 was between 0 39 1 92 and 1 22 4 11 respectively in 2019 the identification results of wheat and maize are relatively inaccurate which with relative error 1 55 and 4 11 it probably owing to heavy rainfall throughout the growth phase that year and the low quality of remote sensing images to sum up the wheat and maize maps of bid in 2017 2020 are credible furthermore the map was upscaled to 250 m using the nearest neighborhood method to guarantee equal resolution for the water footprint computation 4 1 2 yield estimation crop yield is strongly affected by the growth conditions in each stage of crop growth and vegetation indexes are condensed information and may efficiently and economically reflect growth conditions ren et al 2008 modis ndvi data have been widely used in crop yield estimation due to their high resolution and superior radiation calibration meanwhile the dry matter mass produced by photosynthesis in green plants is the maximum from the jointing stage to the maturing stage and ndvi and crop yields during the jointing and maturing period reportedly have a higher correlation salazar et al 2007 zhao et al 2012 therefore the jointing heading and maturing stages were selected for crop yield estimation in this study to establish the yield estimation model 138 of wheat yield and 135 of maize yield dates were selected and to verify the model 60 of wheat yield and 60 of maize yield dates were selected the results are shown below as shown in table 3 the plsr method converted three original factors converted into two linearly uncorrelated variables with cumulative contribution rates greater than 90 the correlation coefficients r2 of wheat and maize yield estimation models were both greater than 0 8 and the rmse values were 0 78 and 0 53 t ha respectively the verification results are shown in fig 5 the correlation coefficient r2 values between the two datasets for wheat and maize are 0 76 and 0 83 and the rmse values of wheat and maize 0 25 and 0 18 t ha in general the yield estimation model established based on the ndvi and yield of the key growth period has a high simulation accuracy within the irrigated area which can simulate yield and identify the spatial distribution of crop yield based on the yield estimation model and the map of wheat and maize the spatial distribution of wheat and maize yields in the irrigated area from 2017 to 2020 are shown in fig 6 wheat and maize are mainly planted in the central region of bid and their yields estimated at 5 5 6 0 and 6 5 7 0 t ha respectively in addition maize yields outperform wheat yields according to the spatial distribution the yield was larger in the core section and lower in the surrounding region which is mainly because the central section with more plentiful rainfall more flat arable land and better tillage management the spatial distribution map of crop yields data can provide basic data support for the water footprint of crop production in bid 4 2 model calibration and validation the measured evapotranspiration data of wheat and maize were collected from the irrigation test station of the key laboratory of agricultural water and soil engineering of the ministry of education in arid regions of northwest a f university in this study the periods 2018 and 2019 were selected as the calibration period and the validation period respectively for scenario 1 rain fed and under scenario 2 irrigation monthly et data of wheat and maize pixels were used for verification the data used included pml v2 evapotranspiration product zhang et al 2019 and mod16 evapotranspiration product as shown in fig 7 in the calibration period the r2 and rmse of wheat were 0 86 and 0 48 mm d respectively while the r2 and rmse of maize were 0 88 and 0 91 mm d during the validation period r2 and rmse of wheat were 0 72 and 0 68 mm day while the r2 and rmse of maize were 0 81 and 1 04 mm day there is a strong correlation between the measured et data and the model simulated et data in both calibration and validation periods and the average r2 of wheat and maize was better than 0 70 which is acceptable according to the performance standards of moriasi et al 2007 as shown in fig 8 comparison of et data of rwbat model pml v2 data and mod16 data the results show that r2 were both greater than 0 90 rmse is 9 56 mm and 9 33 mm respectively moreover the rwbat simulations et were higher than the pmlv2 and mod16 products there are some studies have pointed out that mod16 data show different degrees of underestimation of et in different regions tang et al 2015 cheng et al 2021 and this study has carried out a more detailed modeling and considered the real irrigation water in bid which allows for a more accurate simulate of et in general model s simulation accuracy in bid is trustworthy and adequate for both scenario 1 rain fed and scenario 2 irrigation 4 3 water footprint of crop production in bid area 4 3 1 temporal variation in the water footprint of crop production the blue water footprint wfb and the green water footprint wfg of wheat and maize in 2017 2020 were evaluated at different time scales using the proposed high resolution crop wf quantification method fig 9 depicts the annual variation in the wf for the annual wf of wheat the total wf of wheat over the growing season is mostly influenced by wfg which accounts for 81 of the total wf the average annual wfg and wfb are 0 525 and 0 120 m3 kg respectively for the annual wf of maize the total wf of maize in the growing period is also mainly affected by the wfg which accounts for 93 of the total wf the average annual wfg and wfb are 0 469 and 0 035 m3 kg respectively comparing the annual wf of wheat and maize the wfg of maize is larger than that of wheat and the wfb of maize is less than that of wheat the main reason might be that high temperatures and rainfall are not coordinated during wheat growth the important growth phase for wheat has less rainfall and the wheat is increasingly reliant on irrigation water the opposite is true for maize this study further analyzed the daily wf of crop production in bid as shown in fig 10 a large percentage of the total wf of wheat is wfg from the seeding to wintering stages the wfg of wheat gradually decreased until it reached the overwintering period when the weather turned cold and the crop activity and water consumption reduced therefore the wfg remained at a low during the wintering stage the life activity of wheat intensified from the jointing stage onwards with increases in rainfall and temperature accompanied by increases in water consumption for wheat and the wfg thus exhibited a growing trend at the heading stage the wheat wfg reached its greatest value the wfb grew following the irrigation event with the most noticeable rise during the jointing stage in march as shown in fig 11 the wf based on the daily scale of maize growing time is mostly represented by wfg throughout the growing period the wfg displays an initial tendency to increase and then to decrease the wfg reaches a peak at the heading stage the wfb of maize also increases after irrigation but does not increase appreciably after irrigation at the booting stage this may be because the rainfall in the study area is mainly concentrated in july and the interval between the jointing and heading irrigation is relatively short and therefore during the study period the soil moisture remained abundant and increased irrigation did not promote crop water consumption in general the total wf of wheat and maize over the growing period were both mostly represented by the wfg and the wfb increased after irrigation the maximum wfg was in the heading stage during which crops have abundant water resources frequent life activities and maximum water consumption 4 3 2 spatial variation characteristics of the water footprint of crop production the wf of wheat and maize at a 250 m resolution as well as their spatial variability in bid are shown in figs 12 and 13 as shown in fig 12 according to the spatial distribution of wfg of wheat wfg is higher in the middle area and lower in the surrounding area the areas with a high wfg value coincide with a higher yield indicating that wheat has the ability to translate the green water consumption to higher productivity in the center of bid wfb has a low spatial distribution in the center and a high spatial distribution in the northwest according to the spatial distribution of the total water footprint wft of wheat wft has a lower value in the central region and a high value in the northwest region in 2017 wheat had a higher wft value mostly spread at 0 693 0 730 m3 kg as shown in fig 13 the spatial distribution of wfg of maize is lower in the central region and higher in the surrounding area grids with high wfg values and low yield overlap because rainfall is more abundant during the growing season of maize it is probably unable to convert the increased green water consumption into production wfb shown a higher value in the middle and a lower value in the northeast wft has a lower spatial distribution in the middle region and a higher spatial distribution in the northwest similar to wfg in 2017 maize had a higher wft value mostly spread between 0 548 0 569 m3 kg in summary as per the regional distribution pattern of wft in wheat and maize low values were found in the center of bid while high values were found in the northwest the main reason may be the higher concentration of cultivated land in the middle of bid as well as quality and water content together with the area being well equipped with irrigation equipment which can ensure an adequate supply of irrigation water during the growth period of crops efficient water and fertility management have thus resulted in a low wft in the central region 5 discussion 5 1 comparison with other studies in this study we used a remote sensing based method to quantify the crop water footprint crop water consumption was calculated using the rwbat model which has a physical mechanism and can take into account a variety of factors such as soil type planting structure and irrigated water in addition crop yields were calculated using yield estimation models based on remote sensing data overall the remote sensing based method can effectively reflect the blue and green water footprint at high spatial and temporal scales under complex planting structures as per the results of this study the average wfg and wfb of wheat in bid were 0 525 and 0 120 m3 kg respectively and the average wfg and wfb of maize in bid were 0 469 and 0 035 m3 kg respectively the results were compared with those of other scholars shi et al 2015 quantified the water footprint of crop production in shaanxi province based on the cropwat model as shown in table 4 where crop water consumption is all based on soil water balance under optimal conditions simulating the actual et throughout the crop growing season which will result in high crop water consumption baojixia irrigation district is the main grain production area in shaanxi province with better irrigation facilities and higher grain yield than the average grain yield in shaanxi province at the same time our study focused only on the consumption of blue water and green water and did not consider the loss of irrigation water therefore the total water footprint of bid calculated in this study is lower than that calculated by shi feng et al 2017 used the empirical formula method to calculate the green water footprint of wheat in bid as shown in table 4 the empirical formula lacks physical principles and its applicability in the bid is questionable and the blue water footprint was computed using irrigation quotas without taking into account the crop s real blue water consumption including all net irrigation water in blue water consumption would result in a bigger blue water footprint gao et al 2021 calculated the water footprint of wheat and maize production in bid from 2008 to 2017 based on the swat model the green and blue water footprints of wheat were 0 55 and 0 114 m3 kg and that of maize were 0 457 and 0 058 m3 kg respectively the difference between the two results may be due to differences of input data gao used the data of two meteorological stations and the more accurate meteorological grid data with one day and 0 0625 0 0625 resolution were used in our study at the same time gao s study also did not consider changes in the planting structure of the underlying surface overall there was little difference between the results our study was more comprehensive the input data was more accurate and the conclusions were more reliable 5 2 strategies for adjusting the crop production water footprint the water footprint of crop production reflects the efficiency of green and blue water uses during the crop growth cycle accurate assessment of crop production s water footprint is the underpinning for improving agricultural water use efficiency and strengthening regional water resource management this study used remote sensing methods to quantify crop yield and crop water consumption at the same 250 m resolution and evaluated the spatiotemporal variability in the green water footprint wfg and wfb of bid in order to rationally plan regional water resources and improve the efficiency of agricultural water use the following suggestions are put forward to bid administration bureau and farmers respectively for bid administration bureau 1 reasonable water tariff setting irrigation areas have different water shortages in different areas due to uneven rainfall distribution and irrigation water use should be graded by region according to crop water requirements simultaneously water charges in areas with a large blue water footprint will be increased with additional water charges for the north eastern part of bid during the wheat growing season and for the central part of bid during the maize growing season which can raise farmers awareness of water conservation and improve blue water use efficiency 2 reasonable planning of irrigation systems for the wheat growing season it is recommended to increase the frequency of irrigation during the jointing stage and heading stage while increasing the amount of irrigation water for maize growing season irrigation water at jointing stage and booting stage should be appropriately reduced when there is more rainfall in the future different irrigation schemes can also be simulated based on remote sensing water footprint quantification method combined with future climate scenarios to select a better irrigation system 3 improve the construction of channel lining and improve the utilization coefficient of irrigation water the utilization coefficient of irrigation water in bid is about 54 which is still a big gap compared with 70 90 in developed countries the construction of channel lining should be improved to reduce the loss of irrigation water transfer to improve the utilization rate of irrigation water for farmers 1 adjust the planting structure according to local conditions it is suggested to increase the crop planting area consistent with the growing period and the precipitation period which can improve the utilization rate of green water and reduce the consumption of blue water precipitation in bid is mainly concentrated from june to october and it is suggested to increase the planting area of maize and soybean 2 improve the efficiency of water use for field irrigation flood irrigation is mostly used in bid while precision irrigation techniques such as micro irrigation and drip irrigation can improve the utilization efficiency of field irrigation water it is suggested that farmers give priority to precision irrigation methods 3 improve crop yields it is suggested that farmers select high yield crop varieties combined with more perfect agricultural management measures such as appropriate fertilizer application rates and time and advanced farming practices to improve the level of crop yield per unit area the increase in crop yield per unit area will reduce the water footprint of crop production 5 3 limitations and future improvements finally there are still some deficiencies in this study we calculated the wf with a resolution of 250 m and a higher resolution crop production water footprint was also considered although sentinel 2a data can provide higher spatial resolution the temporal resolution is lower and the presence of turbidity and narrow strips makes it difficult to apply the data over large areas moreover the simulation of remote sensing models requires ndvi and lai data of continuous time series and modis data can meet this requirement at the same time rodriguez et al 2021 used modis data to calculate the green water footprint of soybean crops with a spatial resolution of 250 m which demonstrated the rationality of these data in calculating the water footprint future studies should consider the integration and use of higher resolution remote sensing data this study quantifies the blue green water footprint at the field scale but does not consider channel water losses in future studies more detailed channel data and irrigation water use data should be collected to quantify irrigation channel water losses furthermore expand the experimental monitoring stations of crop water consumption in the research region to gather more plentiful experimental data to calibrate the model allowing for more scientifically guided production practice 6 conclusions this study used a remote sensing based method to quantify crop yield and crop water consumption at the same 250 m resolution and evaluated the spatiotemporal variability in the green water footprint wfg and blue water footprint wfb of baojixia irrigation district bid the results show the following 1 the yield estimation model based on the critical growth period of ndvi can accurately estimate the yield of wheat and maize in irrigated area and the yields of wheat and maize were 5 5 6 0 and 6 5 7 0 t ha respectively 2 the constructed rwbat model is suitable for simulating crop water consumption on an irrigation area scale with the rmse of 0 91 and 1 04 mm day for the wheat and maize at the field scale 3 the average annual wfg of wheat and maize is 0 525 and 0 469 m3 kg accounting for 81 and 93 of the total wf respectively the spatial distribution pattern of total wf of wheat and maize demonstrated that low values occur in the middle part of bid which is characterized by effective water and fertilizer management 4 suggestions are provided for the efficient use of water resources in bid to further improve crop water efficiency it is necessary to improve the utilization efficiency of irrigation water through water saving technologies at the same time the planting structure of maize should be adjusted by increasing the planting area and ensuring the consumption of green water resources it is critical to ensure irrigation water availability in the key growth period of wheat and reasonable allocation and management of irrigation water in irrigated areas to achieve efficient use of water resources and long term development of food security in irrigated areas funding the

2442,the crop water footprint wf refers to the water consumption per unit grain production which can reflect the quantity and types of water consumption over the entire growth period providing a comprehensive view that is useful for agricultural water resources management generally crop water consumption and crop yield are the main component of wf but there are inconsistencies in their spatial resolution thus it is difficult to effectively evaluate agricultural water usage under complex and variable planting structures this study quantified crop yield and crop water consumption at fine resolution 250 m using remote sensing methods and evaluated the spatiotemporal variability of the green water footprint wfg and blue water footprint wfb of chinese baojixia irrigation district bid specifically we firstly mapped the spatial distribution of the wheat and maize field using a remote sensing based support vector machine svm method then the partial least squares regression plsr method was used to construct the yield estimation model based on multi temporal remote sensing data and a remote sensing based water balance assessment tool rwbat model were constructed to quantify water consumption finally the spatiotemporal variability of wfg and wfb at 250 m resolution was analyzed the results show that the average annual wfg of wheat and maize in bid is 0 525 and 0 469 m3 kg accounting for 81 and 93 of the total wf respectively from the perspective of spatial distribution the low values of the total wf are concentrated in the central bid while the high values are distributed in northwest part the remote sensing based method can effectively reflect the wf at high spatial and temporal resolution under complex planting structures which can provide a basis for guaranteeing the efficient use and regulation of agricultural water resources keywords water footprint irrigation district water consumption crop yield remote sensing data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the pressure on regional freshwater resources is gradually increasing with the continuous increase in agricultural irrigation industrial production and domestic water use hoekstra et al 2011 vörösmarty et al 2015 agriculture water consumption accounts for more than 63 of the total water consumption in china which is primarily used for irrigation luan et al 2018b agriculture as the greatest water user has great potential for saving water population expansion in the coming decades is expected in turn to raise food demand while water supplies will continue to be a major constraint for food production rosa et al 2020 thus to ensure food security agricultural water management must be strengthened and agricultural water usage efficiency must be improved the main prerequisites for enhancing agricultural water management in irrigated areas are the accurate calculations of the water consumption of field crops and the evaluations of water use efficiency under various management approaches the crop water footprint wf has gradually evolved as an efficient tool to improve the management and sustainability of water resources luan et al 2018a the wf serves as an indicator of the quantity of freshwater use across the full crop production cycle and is the ratio of a crop s water consumption per unit area to its yield throughout the whole growth period hoekstra et al 2011 for rain fed crops the green water footprint or the effective rainfall consumed in crop production is the main factor in the wf for irrigated crops the wf comprises both the green water footprint and the blue water footprint the blue water footprint is the amount of irrigation water consumed in crop production groundwater volume and loss of transmission and distribution water in general the water footprint of crop production is a comprehensive indicator for measuring water use in crop agriculture which can be used to consistently evaluate the water use efficiency in both rain fed crops and irrigated crops based on the wf quantification method framework proposed by hoekstra et al 2011 methods to measure the two main component of crop water consumption and crop yield were designed currently there are three primary methods 1 the crop model method in which the crop yield is calculated and crop water consumption estimated mainly based on the point scale crop water productivity models such as aquacrop wang et al 2019 cropwat sun et al 2013 shi et al 2015 epic shi et al 2017 though it is difficult to consider the hydrological effects caused by complex environmental changes and changes in the underlying surface of the region 2 the empirical formula method which is based on an empirical formula to calculate the water consumption combined with the statistical yearbook of yield data to calculate the wf on the regional scale han et al 2021 feng et al 2017 but this method does not consider the physical mechanism of crop water consumption and cannot reflect the difference in the crop water footprint within the region 3 the hydrological model method distributed hydrological models have been employed to simulate the evapotranspiration et of crops and combined with yield data to calculate the wf on the basin scale luan et al 2018b gao et al 2021 the hydrological model method uses the hydrological response unit hru as a basis for quantifying the wf the hru however cannot reflect the water footprint of crops under complex planting structure changes crop yield data are primarily taken from statistical yearbooks which do not account for yield disparities between hrus agriculture in china has been dominated by farmers who are smallholders meaning that the farmland is divided into small parcels belonging to different families zhang et al 2020 smallholdings vary in irrigation fertilizer and crop types which can lead to differences in yields and water use across fields the geographic resolution mismatch between yield and crop water consumption unit will affect the accuracy of water footprint estimation however in irrigated areas with complex and variable crop structures calculation of a high resolution crop water footprint is critical for water resource planning with the maturity and development of remote sensing technology remote sensing data with high temporal and spatial resolutions have become a promising tool to assess crop yield and evapotranspiration at the regional scale han et al 2020 wu et al 2015 over the past few decades studies on crop yield estimate using remote sensing data focused on developing statistical correlations between yield and vegetation indicators and yield estimation models based on multi temporal remote sensing data are superior to those based on only one particular time period aghighi et al 2018 zhu et al 2018 han et al 2020 moreover studies on remote sensing based evapotranspiration models have consistently progressed from empirical formula carter and liang 2019 wang et al 2022 to mechanistic model bastiaanssen et al 1998 norman et al 1995 shuttleworth and wallace 1985 and mechanistic model has been widely used due to its low requirements for input parameters and good simulation performance hu et al 2009 both the remote sensing methods of crop yield and evapotranspiration provide the possibility of quantifying the remote sensing based water footprint tampouratzi et al 2015 quinteiro et al 2018 romaguera et al 2010 the wf of crop production and the crop water productivity cwp has a close relationship which are reciprocal of each other mathematically although remote sensing quantification of water footprint is in its infancy currently the cwp assessment using remote sensing data has attracted much attention in many researches before bastiaanssen and steduto 2017 de oliveira costa et al 2020 wu et al 2015 according to the concept of cwp the crop yield and actual et are the key parameters for cwp assessment most remote sensing based cwp studies focused on quantification regional crop et by various models with remote sensing data without contributing to the estimation of crop yield li et al 2008 immerzeel et al 2008 wu et al 2015 de oliveira costa et al 2020 the crop yield data used in these studies are mainly from official statistics and the spatial scales of crop yield and evapotranspiration are always mismatched while the complex and variable crop structures of the farmland underlying surface is also ignored which will both affect the accuracy of the cwp assessment in this context it is necessary to consider the complex planting structure unify the spatial temporal scales of the input parameters and develop finer spatial resolution of crop water footprint quantification method the aim of this study is to estimate crop yield and simulate crop water consumption at 250 m resolution using remote sensing methods and to accurately quantify the wf of wheat and maize under a complex planting structure the research described in this paper can be organized as follows a identification of the spatial distribution of wheat and maize in irrigated areas and

synergically ensure food and water security in arid and semi arid areas 2 study area and data collection 2 1 study area baojixia irrigation district bid is located in the western part of guanzhong plain shaanxi province china fig 1 which is one of the top 10 largest irrigated districts in china the cultivated area of bid at 194 400 hm2 accounts for about 82 of the total land area and the irrigation area is 128 000 hm2 cheng et al 2019 bid has typical continental monsoon climate characteristics with an annual average temperature of 13 1 and an average annual rainfall of 615 mm the rainfall is unevenly distributed across seasons and occurs mainly in summer and autumn the major crops are wheat maize rape and economically important orchards e g of kiwifruit apple etc this area is the largest grain irrigated area in shaanxi province which is of great significance to the food security of shaanxi province agriculture in bid has always been smallholder based with scattered farmland different farmland management methods and therefore characterized by a complex planting structure which creates difficulties for accurately calculating the water footprint of crop production

study aimed to propose a technique based on remote sensing for quantifying the wf of wheat and maize under a complex planting structure and the general roadmap of the study is shown in fig 2 the first step was to obtain all the input data needed for yield estimation and water balance model construction the second step was to calculate the crop yield and the crop water consumption on the one hand we identified the spatial distribution of wheat and maize using the support vector machine svm method and constructed a yield estimation model to estimate crop yield with a resolution of 250 m in bid on the other hand we constructed the rwbat model to calculate the crop water consumption under rain and irrigation scenarios the third step was to quantify the blue water and green water footprints of wheat and maize at a 250 m resolution 3 2 crop identification and yield estimation using remote sensing methods 3 2 1 crop identification based on multispectral data support vector machine svm is a nonparametric machine learning technique based on statistical learning theory slt mountrakis et al 2011 this method basically establishes the optimal decision hyperplane which maximizes the distance between the nearest samples on both sides of the hyperplane and achieves better separation between the classified samples barrett et al 2014 currently this method is commonly used to classify land cover garg et al 2022 the classification experiment in this study was based on the support vector machine module in envi 5 3 based on this module radial basic function was used as the inner product kernel function and the formula was as follows jin et al 2022 1 k x i x j e x p x i x j 2 2 σ 2 where the inner product kernel k x i x j with width σ 2 is the same for all kernels the input of gamma in the kernel function is the reciprocal of the number of bands in the input image which is set as 0 10 the penalty parameter value is used to balance the contradiction between the training error and the target boundary which is set as 100 pyramid level is used to set the number of classifications in the sample training and classification process set to 0 classification probability threshold is used to set the probability size of svm classifier to classify a single pixel set to 0 in this study based on the cropland of from flc10 product and combined with the phenological information on crops we used the svm method to extract the maps of wheat and maize in bid to determine the accuracy we used an obfuscation matrix that compared the classification to the ground truth data at certain points the accuracy evaluation indexes of the confusion matrix include the overall accuracy and the kappa coefficient foody 2002 sim and wright 2005 3 2 2 yield estimation method crop yield data are critical for accurately calculating the water footprint previous studies have shown that the use of ndvi to estimate spatial yield is appropriate ren et al 2008 son et al 2014 since there is a statistical relationship between ndvi and crop yield during the crop s critical growth period 4 8 weeks before harvest rembold et al 2013 becker reshef et al 2010 nagy et al 2018 ndvi of crop critical growth periods can be considered for yield estimation however there is multicollinearity of ndvi in yield estimation model of multi temporal ndvi the partial least squares regression plsr method has advantages in data dimensionality reduction information synthesis and solving co linear problems and provide quantitative modeling of complex relationships with predictors and response variables of complex problems wold et al 2001 zhang et al 2021 a set of correlated variables are transformed into several independent principal components which is then used with multiple linear regression for regression analysis the plsr method is an extension of a multiple linear regression model shawul et al 2019 but the performance is more robust geladi and kowalski 1986 zhou et al 2020 therefore in this study the plsr method was used to constructed the yield estimation model based on multi temporal ndvi and yield 3 3 model construction and validation 3 3 1 basic principle of the water balance

determining the possible ranges of the six parameters we performed parameter calibration using the following three steps to minimize the uncertainty of modeling 1 on the basis of previous research findings we specified a rough range for each parameter and ran 5 million monte carlo simulations with parameter sets randomly sampled from the given ranges hu et al 2009 2 we compared the simulated et and the measured data with a linear regression function to obtain the determinant coefficient r2 and the slope k 3 we selected the 20 highest r2 simulation values with the k in the range of 0 95 1 05 as the best simulations the best fit parameter set was determined by taking the average of the 20 parameter sets and driving the water balance model with the best parameter to get the final simulation data to calibrate and verify the water balance model performance the root mean square error rmse and the correlation coefficient r2 were used to compare and analyze the actual and simulated data hu et al 2017 3 4 calculation of green water and blue water footprint the scenario simulation method liu and yang 2010 luan et al 2018b msigwa et al 2022 was used to distinguish the green and blue water consumption of the irrigated cropland and the two scenarios were set in the rwbat model 1 rain fed and 2 rain fed irrigation then according to the water footprint calculation method hoekstra et al 2011 the water footprint of crop production in the irrigated area is calculated as follows 24 w f w f g w f b w c 1 y w c 2 w c 1 y where w f g is the green water footprint m3 kg of crop production w f b is the blue water footprint m3 kg of crop production w f is the total water footprint m3 kg of crop production y is the crop yield kg m2 w c 1 is the water consumed mm by crops in scenario 1 of the rwbat model and w c 2 is the water consumed mm by crops in scenario 2 of the rwbat model 4 results 4 1 crop identification and yield estimation 4 1 1 crop identification the water footprint for crop production is mainly affected by water consumption and yield during the crop growth period and the spatial distribution of typical crops is the basis for accurate quantification of the crop production water footprint therefore this study firstly extracted the cultivated land based on the land use data from flc10 product of bid in 2017 and then used the svm classification method to identify the spatial distribution of wheat and maize in 2017 2020 on the basis of the cultivated land in 2017 the results are as follows the confusion matrix was calculated using the validation points 3 10 sample points as shown in fig 4 a and 4b the overall accuracy and the kappa coefficient were both more than 80 0 which shows a good performance in the classification of these two crops as shown in fig 4c and 4d a comparison of statistical records and the calculated planting area of wheat and maize show that the change trends in the calculated and statistical planting areas are consistent in 2017 2020 the relative error of wheat and maize during 2017 2020 was between 0 39 1 92 and 1 22 4 11 respectively in 2019 the identification results of wheat and maize are relatively inaccurate which with relative error 1 55 and 4 11 it probably owing to heavy rainfall throughout the growth phase that year and the low quality of remote sensing images to sum up the wheat and maize maps of bid in 2017 2020 are credible furthermore the map was upscaled to 250 m using the nearest neighborhood method to guarantee equal resolution for the water footprint computation 4 1 2 yield estimation crop yield is strongly affected by the growth conditions in each stage of crop growth and vegetation indexes are condensed information and may efficiently and economically reflect growth conditions ren et al 2008 modis ndvi data have been widely used in crop yield estimation due to their high resolution and superior radiation calibration meanwhile the dry matter mass produced by photosynthesis in green plants is the maximum from the jointing stage to the maturing stage and ndvi and crop yields during the jointing and maturing period reportedly have a higher correlation salazar et al 2007 zhao et al 2012 therefore the jointing heading and maturing stages were selected for crop yield estimation in this study to establish the yield estimation model 138 of wheat yield and 135 of maize yield dates were selected and to verify the model 60 of wheat yield and 60 of maize yield dates were selected the results are shown below as shown in table 3 the plsr method converted three original factors converted into two linearly uncorrelated variables with cumulative contribution rates greater than 90 the correlation coefficients r2 of wheat and maize yield estimation models were both greater than 0 8 and the rmse values were 0 78 and 0 53 t ha respectively the verification results are shown in fig 5 the correlation coefficient r2 values between the two datasets for wheat and maize are 0 76 and 0 83 and the rmse values of wheat and maize 0 25 and 0 18 t ha in general the yield estimation model established based on the ndvi and yield of the key growth period has a high simulation accuracy within the irrigated area which can simulate yield and identify the spatial distribution of crop yield based on the yield estimation model and the map of wheat and maize the spatial distribution of wheat and maize yields in the irrigated area from 2017 to 2020 are shown in fig 6 wheat and maize are mainly planted in the central region of bid and their yields estimated at 5 5 6 0 and 6 5 7 0 t ha respectively in addition maize yields outperform wheat yields according to the spatial distribution the yield was larger in the core section and lower in the surrounding region which is mainly because the central section with more plentiful rainfall more flat arable land and better tillage management the spatial distribution map of crop yields data can provide basic data support for the water footprint of crop production in bid 4 2 model calibration and validation the measured evapotranspiration data of wheat and maize were collected from the irrigation test station of the key laboratory of agricultural water and soil engineering of the ministry of education in arid regions of northwest a f university in this study the periods 2018 and 2019 were selected as the calibration period and the validation period respectively for scenario 1 rain fed and under scenario 2 irrigation monthly et data of wheat and maize pixels were used for verification the data used included pml v2 evapotranspiration product zhang et al 2019 and mod16 evapotranspiration product as shown in fig 7 in the calibration period the r2 and rmse of wheat were 0 86 and 0 48 mm d respectively while the r2 and rmse of maize were 0 88 and 0 91 mm d during the validation period r2 and rmse of wheat were 0 72 and 0 68 mm day while the r2 and rmse of maize were 0 81 and 1 04 mm day there is a strong correlation between the measured et data and the model simulated et data in both calibration and validation periods and the average r2 of wheat and maize was better than 0 70 which is acceptable according to the performance standards of moriasi et al 2007 as shown in fig 8 comparison of et data of rwbat model pml v2 data and mod16 data the results show that r2 were both greater than 0 90 rmse is 9 56 mm and 9 33 mm respectively moreover the rwbat simulations et were higher than the pmlv2 and mod16 products there are some studies have pointed out that mod16 data show different degrees of underestimation of et in different regions tang et al 2015 cheng et al 2021 and this study has carried out a more detailed modeling and considered the real irrigation water in bid which allows for a more accurate simulate of et in general model s simulation accuracy in bid is trustworthy and adequate for both scenario 1 rain fed and scenario 2 irrigation 4 3 water footprint of crop production in bid area 4 3 1 temporal variation in the water footprint of crop production the blue water footprint wfb and the green water footprint wfg of wheat and maize in 2017 2020 were evaluated at different time scales using the proposed high resolution crop wf quantification method fig 9 depicts the annual variation in the wf for the annual wf of wheat the total wf of wheat over the growing season is mostly influenced by wfg which accounts for 81 of the total wf the average annual wfg and wfb are 0 525 and 0 120 m3 kg respectively for the annual wf of maize the total wf of maize in the growing period is also mainly affected by the wfg which accounts for 93 of the total wf the average annual wfg and wfb are 0 469 and 0 035 m3 kg respectively comparing the annual wf of wheat and maize the wfg of maize is larger than that of wheat and the wfb of maize is less than that of wheat the main reason might be that high temperatures and rainfall are not coordinated during wheat growth the important growth phase for wheat has less rainfall and the wheat is increasingly reliant on irrigation water the opposite is true for maize this study further analyzed the daily wf of crop production in bid as shown in fig 10 a large percentage of the total wf of wheat is wfg from the seeding to wintering stages the wfg of wheat gradually decreased until it reached the overwintering period when the weather turned cold and the crop activity and water consumption reduced therefore the wfg remained at a low during the wintering stage the life activity of wheat intensified from the jointing stage onwards with increases in rainfall and temperature accompanied by increases in water consumption for wheat and the wfg thus exhibited a growing trend at the heading stage the wheat wfg reached its greatest value the wfb grew following the irrigation event with the most noticeable rise during the jointing stage in march as shown in fig 11 the wf based on the daily scale of maize growing time is mostly represented by wfg throughout the growing period the wfg displays an initial tendency to increase and then to decrease the wfg reaches a peak at the heading stage the wfb of maize also increases after irrigation but does not increase appreciably after irrigation at the booting stage this may be because the rainfall in the study area is mainly concentrated in july and the interval between the jointing and heading irrigation is relatively short and therefore during the study period the soil moisture remained abundant and increased irrigation did not promote crop water consumption in general the total wf of wheat and maize over the growing period were both mostly represented by the wfg and the wfb increased after irrigation the maximum wfg was in the heading stage during which crops have abundant water resources frequent life activities and maximum water consumption 4 3 2 spatial variation characteristics of the water footprint of crop production the wf of wheat and maize at a 250 m resolution as well as their spatial variability in bid are shown in figs 12 and 13 as shown in fig 12 according to the spatial distribution of wfg of wheat wfg is higher in the middle area and lower in the surrounding area the areas with a high wfg value coincide with a higher yield indicating that wheat has the ability to translate the green water consumption to higher productivity in the center of bid wfb has a low spatial distribution in the center and a high spatial distribution in the northwest according to the spatial distribution of the total water footprint wft of wheat wft has a lower value in the central region and a high value in the northwest region in 2017 wheat had a higher wft value mostly spread at 0 693 0 730 m3 kg as shown in fig 13 the spatial distribution of wfg of maize is lower in the central region and higher in the surrounding area grids with high wfg values and low yield overlap because rainfall is more abundant during the growing season of maize it is probably unable to convert the increased green water consumption into production wfb shown a higher value in the middle and a lower value in the northeast wft has a lower spatial distribution in the middle region and a higher spatial distribution in the northwest similar to wfg in 2017 maize had a higher wft value mostly spread between 0 548 0 569 m3 kg in summary as per the regional distribution pattern of wft in wheat and maize low values were found in the center of bid while high values were found in the northwest the main reason may be the higher concentration of cultivated land in the middle of bid as well as quality and water content together with the area being well equipped with irrigation equipment which can ensure an adequate supply of irrigation water during the growth period of crops efficient water and fertility management have thus resulted in a low wft in the central region 5 discussion 5 1 comparison with other studies in this study we used a remote sensing based method to quantify the crop water footprint crop water consumption was calculated using the rwbat model which has a physical mechanism and can take into account a variety of factors such as soil type planting structure and irrigated water in addition crop yields were calculated using yield estimation models based on remote sensing data overall the remote sensing based method can effectively reflect the blue and green water footprint at high spatial and temporal scales under complex planting structures as per the results of this study the average wfg and wfb of wheat in bid were 0 525 and 0 120 m3 kg respectively and the average wfg and wfb of maize in bid were 0 469 and 0 035 m3 kg respectively the results were compared with those of other scholars shi et al 2015 quantified the water footprint of crop production in shaanxi province based on the cropwat model as shown in table 4 where crop water consumption is all based on soil water balance under optimal conditions simulating the actual et throughout the crop growing season which will result in high crop water consumption baojixia irrigation district is the main grain production area in shaanxi province with better irrigation facilities and higher grain yield than the average grain yield in shaanxi province at the same time our study focused only on the consumption of blue water and green water and did not consider the loss of irrigation water therefore the total water footprint of bid calculated in this study is lower than that calculated by shi feng et al 2017 used the empirical formula method to calculate the green water footprint of wheat in bid as shown in table 4 the empirical formula lacks physical principles and its applicability in the bid is questionable and the blue water footprint was computed using irrigation quotas without taking into account the crop s real blue water consumption including all net irrigation water in blue water consumption would result in a bigger blue water footprint gao et al 2021 calculated the water footprint of wheat and maize production in bid from 2008 to 2017 based on the swat model the green and blue water footprints of wheat were 0 55 and 0 114 m3 kg and that of maize were 0 457 and 0 058 m3 kg respectively the difference between the two results may be due to differences of input data gao used the data of two meteorological stations and the more accurate meteorological grid data with one day and 0 0625 0 0625 resolution were used in our study at the same time gao s study also did not consider changes in the planting structure of the underlying surface overall there was little difference between the results our study was more comprehensive the input data was more accurate and the conclusions were more reliable 5 2 strategies for adjusting the crop production water footprint the water footprint of crop production reflects the efficiency of green and blue water uses during the crop growth cycle accurate assessment of crop production s water footprint is the underpinning for improving agricultural water use efficiency and strengthening regional water resource management this study used remote sensing methods to quantify crop yield and crop water consumption at the same 250 m resolution and evaluated the spatiotemporal variability in the green water footprint wfg and wfb of bid in order to rationally plan regional water resources and improve the efficiency of agricultural water use the following suggestions are put forward to bid administration bureau and farmers respectively for bid administration bureau 1 reasonable water tariff setting irrigation areas have different water shortages in different areas due to uneven rainfall distribution and irrigation water use should be graded by region according to crop water requirements simultaneously water charges in areas with a large blue water footprint will be increased with additional water charges for the north eastern part of bid during the wheat growing season and for the central part of bid during the maize growing season which can raise farmers awareness of water conservation and improve blue water use efficiency 2 reasonable planning of irrigation systems for the wheat growing season it is recommended to increase the frequency of irrigation during the jointing stage and heading stage while increasing the amount of irrigation water for maize growing season irrigation water at jointing stage and booting stage should be appropriately reduced when there is more rainfall in the future different irrigation schemes can also be simulated based on remote sensing water footprint quantification method combined with future climate scenarios to select a better irrigation system 3 improve the construction of channel lining and improve the utilization coefficient of irrigation water the utilization coefficient of irrigation water in bid is about 54 which is still a big gap compared with 70 90 in developed countries the construction of channel lining should be improved to reduce the loss of irrigation water transfer to improve the utilization rate of irrigation water for farmers 1 adjust the planting structure according to local conditions it is suggested to increase the crop planting area consistent with the growing period and the precipitation period which can improve the utilization rate of green water and reduce the consumption of blue water precipitation in bid is mainly concentrated from june to october and it is suggested to increase the planting area of maize and soybean 2 improve the efficiency of water use for field irrigation flood irrigation is mostly used in bid while precision irrigation techniques such as micro irrigation and drip irrigation can improve the utilization efficiency of field irrigation water it is suggested that farmers give priority to precision irrigation methods 3 improve crop yields it is suggested that farmers select high yield crop varieties combined with more perfect agricultural management measures such as appropriate fertilizer application rates and time and advanced farming practices to improve the level of crop yield per unit area the increase in crop yield per unit area will reduce the water footprint of crop production 5 3 limitations and future improvements finally there are still some deficiencies in this study we calculated the wf with a resolution of 250 m and a higher resolution crop production water footprint was also considered although sentinel 2a data can provide higher spatial resolution the temporal resolution is lower and the presence of turbidity and narrow strips makes it difficult to apply the data over large areas moreover the simulation of remote sensing models requires ndvi and lai data of continuous time series and modis data can meet this requirement at the same time rodriguez et al 2021 used modis data to calculate the green water footprint of soybean crops with a spatial resolution of 250 m which demonstrated the rationality of these data in calculating the water footprint future studies should consider the integration and use of higher resolution remote sensing data this study quantifies the blue green water footprint at the field scale but does not consider channel water losses in future studies more detailed channel data and irrigation water use data should be collected to quantify irrigation channel water losses furthermore expand the experimental monitoring stations of crop water consumption in the research region to gather more plentiful experimental data to calibrate the model allowing for more scientifically guided production practice 6 conclusions this study used a remote sensing based method to quantify crop yield and crop water consumption at the same 250 m resolution and evaluated the spatiotemporal variability in the green water footprint wfg and blue water footprint wfb of baojixia irrigation district bid the results show the following 1 the yield estimation model based on the critical growth period of ndvi can accurately estimate the yield of wheat and maize in irrigated area and the yields of wheat and maize were 5 5 6 0 and 6 5 7 0 t ha respectively 2 the constructed rwbat model is suitable for simulating crop water consumption on an irrigation area scale with the rmse of 0 91 and 1 04 mm day for the wheat and maize at the field scale 3 the average annual wfg of wheat and maize is 0 525 and 0 469 m3 kg accounting for 81 and 93 of the total wf respectively the spatial distribution pattern of total wf of wheat and maize demonstrated that low values occur in the middle part of bid which is characterized by effective water and fertilizer management 4 suggestions are provided for the efficient use of water resources in bid to further improve crop water efficiency it is necessary to improve the utilization efficiency of irrigation water through water saving technologies at the same time the planting structure of maize should be adjusted by increasing the planting area and ensuring the consumption of green water resources it is critical to ensure irrigation water availability in the key growth period of wheat and reasonable allocation and management of irrigation water in irrigated areas to achieve efficient use of water resources and long term development of food security in irrigated areas funding the

2443,hydraulic conductivity is crucial to revealing the mechanisms of frost damage in cold regions while the hydraulic conductivity of coarse grained soils during freezing process has rarely been considered in this study a new pattern that ice grows from the pore wall is used to describe ice formation in coarse grained soils in this pattern unfrozen water confined in the pore center provides flow channels for liquid water migration the relationship between distribution characteristics of flow channels and hydraulic conductivity can be established by redefining parameters such as porosity ϕ e hydraulic radius r h and tortuosity γ in the kozeny carman equation it thus generates a new hydraulic conductivity model for frozen coarse grained soils comparing with measured result in the literature it shows that the proposed model gives a better prediction than existing models especially for sand the proposed model can provide a useful tool for simulating water heat transfer process of coarse grained soils in cold regions keywords hydraulic conductivity coarse grained soils ice formation pattern kozeny carman equation data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction unfrozen liquid water migration in frozen coarse grained soils can significantly affect the hydro mechanical properties of railway subgrades which can lead to frost heave or thaw weakening in cold regions sheng et al 2014 zhang et al 2016 teng et al 2020 meanwhile snowmelt infiltration into frozen coarse grained soils can significantly reduce the stability of slopes and cause landslides in seasonally frozen soil areas osawa et al 2017 chen et al 2022 hydraulic conductivity is a key parameter to indicate water transfer process in frozen soils teng et al 2019 teng et al 2022 compared to hydraulic conductivity under super freezing conditions zhai and rahardjo 2015 measurement and prediction of hydraulic conductivity of frozen soils is much more difficult niu et al 2015 watanabe and osada 2017 tan et al 2020 this is attributed to the complex pore structure that controlled by pore ice formation in soils kralj and pande 1996 therefore a better understanding of pore ice formation is crucial for describing hydraulic conductivity of frozen coarse grained soils the models of hydraulic conductivity for frozen soils in the literature can be divided into two categories as shown in table 1 the first category is empirical formulas based on the fitting of experimental data taylor and luthin 1978 horiguchi and miller 1983 o neill and miller 1985 although these empirical formulas are simple and easy to use they lack logical derivation to establish the relationship between hydraulic conductivity and soil properties thus this kind of formulas is difficult to be generalized the second category is physical models that consider morphology of pore ice in soils stahli et al 1996 watanabe and flury 2008 lebeau and konrad 2012 teng et al 2021 zhang et al 2021 for example watanabe and flury 2008 considered soil pores as a bundle of capillary tubes with unfrozen water flowing through tubular and annular channels lebeau and konrad 2012 proposed that unfrozen water films flow between two infinite horizontal parallel plates ice soil where the thickness of the water film is controlled by both london van der waals and ionic electrostatic forces it is noted that the functions of hydraulic conductivity mentioned above contain some microscopic parameters that hard to determine teng et al 2021 developed a concise hydraulic conductivity model of frozen soils by generalizing the kozeny carman equation kc equation it can provide reasonable predictions for fine grained soils such as silt but may not be appliable for coarse grained soils such as sand hydraulic conductivity of frozen soils is known to be related to the morphology of pore ice in soils fourie et al 2007 lebeau and konrad 2012 however almost all the above mentioned theoretical models assume that pore ice grows from the pore center which lacks consideration on the variability of ice growth locations based on the nucleation theory petrov and furó 2009 suggested that microparticles in either the pore center or the pore wall could provide sites for phase transitions when the soil is fine grained silt or clay there is always an unfrozen water film on the surface of soil particles anderson and hoekstra 1965 konrad and morgenstern 1980 this is due to the strong adsorption van der waals and ionic electrostatic forces at the particle surface where the ice water phase transition requires more energy and therefore it starts at the pore center however arenson and sego 2006 observed the ice growth process during freezing of coarse grained soils using a fluorescent tracer and found that unfrozen water is distributed in the pore center rather than being present as a unfrozen water film on the particle surface fourie et al 2007 found that liquid water on the particle surface is first to be frozen in the infiltration tests on frozen coarse grained soils which reduces the pore size watanabe and kugisaki 2017 concluded that the ice in large pore spaces of soils grows from the surface towards the center impeding the flow of water in the large pores the above findings imply that pore ice growth along the particle surface does exist in coarse grained soils coarse grained soils have a larger pore structure and weak ionic electrostatic forces thus capillary and adsorption on the particle surface are weak which reduces the impediment to occurring ice water phase transitions moreover thermal conductivity of quartz is greater than that of water thus particle surface cools more rapidly than liquid water in the pore center which contributes to ice growth from the particle surface andersland and ladanyi 2004 it should be noted that the location and morphology of pore ice will affect the water flow channels resulting in changes in hydraulic conductivity of frozen soils however few previous researches have pay attention to the effect of this ice formation pattern on hydraulic conductivity in coarse grained soils therefore an in depth study is required to clarify the relationship between hydraulic conductivity and this ice formation pattern as well as to develop a new model for frozen coarse grained soils in this study a theoretical study was performed to develop a new model for frozen coarse grained soils the rationality and validity of the new model were verified by experimental data and the existing methods in the literature 2 materials and methods 2 1 basic assumptions based on the capillary bundle model watanabe and flury 2008 soil pores can be generalized as a bundle of curved capillaries with different pore radii arranged as r 0 r 1 r j r min where r j is the jth pore radius and r 0 and r min are the maximum and minimum pore sizes respectively the gibbs thomson equation describes the relationship between the freezing temperature t f and the critical freezing pore size r c when the soil temperature is t f pore ice appears in the pores larger than r c while the pores smaller than r c remain unfrozen according to arenson and sego 2006 pore ice grows inwards along the pore wall during freezing in coarse grained soils while unfrozen water is remained in the pore center until it is completely frozen as shown in fig 1 in a single larger pore r r c liquid water begins to change into ice phase along the pore wall towards the center at a particular freezing temperature t f in addition the radius of curvature of the ice water interface is decreasing indicating that further phase transition will require lower temperature effects at that time a portion of unfrozen water is retained in the pore center as the soil temperature decreases further the pore ice continues to grow inwards and eventually fills the entire pore space the following assumptions are made to develop the new model 1 the soil is assumed to be saturated i e the air phase in the void is neglected 2 the soil pores are considered to be a collection of curved cylindrical tubes with similar lengths but different radii 3 the effect of the pore ice on the liquid water flow is assumed to be the same as that of soil particles i e only viscous force between the pore ice and liquid water is considered 2 2 theoretical derivation the kc equation has been widely used to predict hydraulic conductivity of coarse grained soils kozeny 1927 carman 1937 as follows 1 k c s 1 γ 2 ρ s 2 s s 2 e 3 1 e where k is the intrinsic permeability of soils m2 c s is the shape factor γ is the tortuosity defined as the ratio of the length of the actual flow channel to the height of the soil sample ρs is the density of solid particles kg m3 s s is the specific surface area of soils m2 kg and e is the void ratio based on the hagen poiseuille equation teng et al 2021 showed that the kc equation can be written in the form of an average hydraulic radius as follows 2 k c s ϕ e r h 2 γ 2 where ϕ eis the effective porosity representing the volume of pore space available for the liquid water flow and can be approximated as porosity ϕ when the soil is unfrozen and saturated r h is the average hydraulic radius m for soils r h can be expressed as the ratio of the volume of the flow channels v f to the surface area a f ren et al 2016 if the soil is unfrozen and saturated r h is equal to the ratio of the pore volume v v to the pore surface area a v which is equal to the surface area of the soil particles a sp 3 r h v v a v e v s a sp e s s ρ s where v s is the volume of the soil particles m3 hydraulic conductivity of soils k can be determined by a combination of the intrinsic permeability and fluid properties as follows 4 k ρ w g η w k where ρw is the density of water kg m3 g is the gravitational acceleration m s2 and ηw is the dynamic viscosity of water pa s because pore ice grows continuously on the soil particle surface the effective pore space structure available for liquid water flow decreases gradually therefore when applying eq 2 to determine hydraulic conductivity of frozen coarse grained soils the effective porosity ϕ e the average hydraulic radius r h and the tortuosity γ should be changed liquid water cannot flow in the pore space occupied by the ice phase it can only flow in the unfrozen pore space thus the effective porosity ϕ e can be expressed as 5 ϕ e v f v t v w v w v i v w v i v t s u ϕ where v f is the volume of flow channels m3 v t is the total volume of the soil m3 v w is the volume of unfrozen water m3 v i is the volume of ice m3 and s u is the unfrozen water saturation which is defined as the ratio of v w to the sum of v w and v i as follows 6 s u v w v w v i θ u θ s where θu is the unfrozen water content and θs is the saturated water content the average hydraulic radius r h contains two parameters the volume v f and area a f of flow channels which refer to the volume v w and area a w of unfrozen water in the case of freezing the unfrozen water volume v w can be determined from the definition of unfrozen water saturation in eq 6 7 v w s u v w v i s u e v s as shown in fig 1 there are two types of channels for liquid water flowing in the pore space 1 water soil interface and 2 water ice interface for the first case when the pore radius r r c there is no ice in the pore the radius of the unfrozen water flow channel is r and the interface area is a w s for the second case when the pore radius r r c the pore ice grows along the soil particles unfrozen water flow channels are confined in the pore center according to the assumptions a decrease in t f leads to a decrease in r c and a simultaneous decrease of unfrozen water flow channel radius r w the pore r is completely frozen when r c r min i e r w 0 thus the variation process of r w for pore r can be considered to be controlled by r c which can be simplified as r w r r c r 0 and the interface area is a w i the methods of cary 1994 and niemet et al 2002 were used to determine the variation of the two interface areas versus the unfrozen water saturation in frozen soils the empirical relationship between the pore radius r and the corresponding pore volume fraction θ can be expressed as follows 8 r r 0 θ θ 0 λ where θ0 is the pore volume fraction at pore size r 0 which is equal to θs and θ θ0 is equal to s u in frozen soils λ is a parameter that can reflect the pore size distribution of soil and it decreases with the concentration degree of pore size distribution brooks and corey 1964 the differential form of the pore number can be expressed as 9 dn v t d θ π r 2 l t v t θ s π r 2 l t d s u where dn and v tdθ are the number and volume changes of soil pores caused by changing the pore radius from r to r dr respectively l t is the true length of the pore channel m the two parameters for interface area a w s and a w i can be determined by introducing eqs 8 and 9 into the integral expressions 10 a w s n m n c 2 π r l t d n 0 s u 2 v t θ s r d t 2 v t θ s r 0 1 λ s u 1 λ 11 a w i n c n 0 2 π r r c r 0 l t d n s u 1 2 v t θ s s u λ r d t 2 v t θ s r 0 1 λ s u λ 1 s u 1 λ where n m n c and n 0 are the number of pores corresponding to r min r c and r 0 respectively t is the integration variable in the integral equation where it refers to s u in the integral term the surface area of soil particles can be expressed by integrating 12 a sp 0 1 2 v t θ s r d t 2 v t θ s r 0 1 λ thus the surface area of unfrozen water can be expressed as 13 a w a w s a w i s u 1 λ s u λ s u a sp the average hydraulic radius can be obtained by substituting eqs 7 and 13 into eq 3 14 r h v w a w e ρ s s s 1 s u λ 1 s u λ 1 the tortuosity γ has been considered a function of porosity koponen et al 1997 srisutthiyakorn and mavko 2017 15 γ ϕ e γ s u ϕ substituting eqs 5 14 and 15 into eq 2 a new expression for the intrinsic permeability of saturated frozen soils k can be obtained as 16 k c s 1 ρ s 2 s s 2 γ 2 s u ϕ ϕ 3 1 ϕ 2 s u s u λ 1 s u λ 1 2 the corresponding expressions for hydraulic conductivity k and relative hydraulic conductivity k r of frozen soils are 17 k c s ρ w g η w 1 ρ s 2 s s 2 γ 2 s u ϕ ϕ 3 1 ϕ 2 s u s u λ 1 s u λ 1 2 18 k r k k s η w t 0 γ 2 ϕ η w t γ 2 ϕ s u s u s u λ 1 s u λ 1 2 where k s is the saturated hydraulic conductivity of soils m s it should be noted that the proposed model is similar to the empirical model of o neill and miller 1985 which is expressed as a power function in the literature with the denominator term s u λ 1 s u λ 1 2 representing the effect of ice growth from the pore wall the parameter λ decreases as the concentration degree of the pore size distribution increases the unfrozen water saturation s u can be obtained from the measured soil freezing characteristic curve sfcc some related parameters are presented in table 2 it is noted that the determination method of λ is key to dominate the prediction performance of the proposed model here a discussion on λ is given since no clear consensus has been reached in the literature brooks and corey 1964 suggested that λ could be obtained by taking the negative value of the slope of the double logarithmic soil water characteristic curve water content versus matrix suction swcc and suggested that λ could be taken to a positive number greater than 0 skopp 1985 obtained from a parameter analysis of λ and found that λ is less than 1 for sand and may take values greater than 1 for finer materials this study summarized the relationship between λ and the grain size composition of soils campbell 1985 proposed that λ could be determined by the geometric mean particle diameter and the geometric standard deviation of particle diameter but the minimum value of λ obtained according to this formula is greater than 1 which indicates that the formula is not applicable for soil samples with 100 sand particles but is only convenient for the mixed soil samples containing a part of fine particles in addition cary 1994 determined the parameter λ by fitting several pairs of capillary pressure versus water content data at the high water content in summary the value of λ equal to the negative of the slope in the double log swcc seems more reasonable in this study because its rationality has been verified by a number of experiments in the literature 3 results and discussions the literature on the hydraulic conductivity of frozen soils is relatively limited especially for coarse grained soils according to the astm criteria astm d2487 17 soils containing more than 50 of particles larger than 0 075 mm are classified as coarse grained soils and fine grained soils vice versa when a coarse grained soil containing a small proportion of fine particles freezes the ice condensed on the particle surface in the large pores spreads along the particle surface which will induce ice formation in the small pores to start from the pore wall as well therefore we believe that when a soil sample is classified as coarse grained soil the predominant ice formation pattern is ice growing from the pore wall three coarse grained soils with a sand proportion greater than 50 are used to validate the proposed model as shown in table 3 the λ values in table 3 are determined by swcc in double logarithmic coordinates the swcc data and λ for fine sand were not given in burt 1974 which are referred to brooks and corey 1964 in this study tottori dune sand and andisol sandy loam were provided in watanabe and osada 2016 for swcc data λ values can be determined directly from the above method when the measured data don t show a significant linear relationship in a double logarithmic swcc the slope is determined by taking the high water content portion according to cary 1994 e g fine sand and andisol sandy loam the λ values determined for the three soils are shown in fig 2 the measured and fitted sfccs for the three soil samples are shown in fig 3 it should be noted that the sfcc result for fine sand is obtained based on the sfcc prediction curve from tarnawski and wagner 1996 the nmr technique was used to measure the unfrozen water content of tottori dune sand and andisol sandy loam and it has an accuracy of 0 5 c for temperature measurement the variations of tortuosity and dynamic viscosity of the water versus temperature are shown in fig 4 it shows that the tortuosity gradually stabilises as the temperature decreases while the dynamic viscosity of water is relatively stable from 0 to 1 and then increases significantly by substituting the values of the soil properties and the sfcc parameters into eq 18 the value of k r can be predicted two existing models in the literature are used for comparisons to verify the applicability of the proposed model the empirical model proposed by o neill and miller 1985 and the theoretical model proposed by teng et al 2021 the parameters of the models are obtained by using least squares estimation to fit the experimental data within their respective ranges the parameter γ in the o neill and miller 1985 model is a negotiable constant between 7 and 9 the parameter ε in the teng et al 2021 model reflects the difference between the shape of ice particles and soil particles the smaller the difference the closer the ε is to 1 and its recommended range is 0 2 50 the predicted result and the measured data are shown in fig 5 three indexes r 2 mae and rmse are chosen to evaluate the prediction of different models their values are given in table 4 fig 5 shows that the predicted results of the proposed model agree well with the experimental data for the three soils compared with the results of the existing models the proposed model based on ice formation from the pore wall performs better the results of o neill and miller 1985 deviate significantly from the measured values only the andisol sandy loam in fig 5 c has a satisfactory prediction it indicates that such empirical formulas are unreliable by fitting measured values alone which is hard to satisfy the requirements of different soils the predictions of teng et al 2021 model are slightly better than o neill and miller 1985 but still show a tendency to under predict compared to the proposed model especially for fine sand and tottori dune sand in fig 5 a and b this is attributed to the differences in flow channels caused by the assumption of different ice formation patterns the cross section of flow channels in the proposed model can be simplified to be circles however the flow channels formed by ice growth from the pore center include the annular cross section formed by the liquid film which provides a larger contact area for flow i e a greater significant resistance resulting in lower predictions for the existing models fig 5 c shows that all three models have a good prediction of k r for andisol sandy loam while the performance of the proposed model may be slightly worse this might attribute to the large proportion of fine particles in andisol sandy loam if they fill in the pores of coarse particles which may change the original ice formation pattern of coarse grained soil it reflects a limitation of the proposed model that the proportion of fine particles cannot be too large otherwise it will affect the prediction performance of the proposed model the results in table 4 show that the correlation coefficients r 2 of the proposed model are above 0 85 and the values of mae and rmse are smaller than two reference models which indicates that the proposed model performs better in predicting the hydraulic conductivity of coarse grained soils it should be noted that the parameter λ is a key input parameter in the proposed model a parametric analysis was performed to clarify the role of λ the influence of λ on the hydraulic conductivity of frozen soils is shown in fig 6 where λ was set as 0 5 1 0 2 5 and 5 0 and the other parameters were the same as in andisol sandy loam the slope of the curve increases as λ increases which is consistent with existing empirical models the reason for this may be as follows a greater dispersion of the pore size distribution means that the surface area of the flow channel varies more significantly resulting in a steeper hydraulic conductivity curve according to brooks and corey 1964 and campbell 1985 λ may be taken as 0 1 for gravel or coarse grained sand and 1 5 for sandy loam 4 conclusions the hydraulic conductivity of frozen coarse grained soils has been difficult to predict reasonably this study considered the ice formation patterns in frozen coarse grained soils and established a new hydraulic conductivity model some new findings are summarized as follows 1 pore ice grows inward from the pore wall in coarse grained soils and unfrozen water is retained in the pores which has a considerable influence on the flow channels and thus the hydraulic conductivity of frozen coarse grained soils 2 the proposed model can more realistically reflect the ice formation pattern in coarse grained soils the model can be considered an extension of the kc equation for frozen conditions which has a simple form and with parameters that can reflect the soil properties 3 the predicted results of the proposed model agree well with the experimental data in the literature compared with the existing models this model shows better predictions for frozen coarse grained soils the parameter λ is the only unknown parameter which is suggested to be 0 1 for gravel or sand and 1 5 for sandy loam

introduction unfrozen liquid water migration in frozen coarse grained soils can significantly affect the hydro mechanical properties of railway subgrades which can lead to frost heave or thaw weakening in cold regions sheng et al 2014 zhang et al 2016 teng et al 2020 meanwhile snowmelt infiltration into frozen coarse grained soils can significantly reduce the stability of slopes and cause landslides in seasonally frozen soil areas osawa et al 2017 chen et al 2022 hydraulic conductivity is a key parameter to indicate water transfer process in frozen soils teng et al 2019 teng et al 2022 compared to hydraulic conductivity under super freezing conditions zhai and rahardjo 2015 measurement and prediction of hydraulic conductivity of frozen soils is much more difficult niu et al 2015 watanabe and osada 2017 tan et al 2020 this is attributed to the complex pore structure that controlled by pore ice formation in soils kralj and pande 1996 therefore a better understanding of pore ice formation is crucial for describing hydraulic conductivity of frozen coarse grained soils the models of hydraulic conductivity for frozen soils in the literature can be divided into two categories as shown in table 1 the first category is empirical formulas based on the fitting of experimental data taylor and luthin 1978 horiguchi and miller 1983 o neill and miller 1985 although these empirical formulas are simple and easy to use they lack logical derivation to establish the relationship between hydraulic conductivity and soil properties thus this kind of formulas is difficult to be generalized the second category is physical models that consider morphology of pore ice in soils stahli et al 1996 watanabe and flury 2008 lebeau and konrad 2012 teng et al 2021 zhang et al 2021 for example watanabe and flury 2008 considered soil pores as a bundle of capillary tubes with unfrozen water flowing through tubular and annular channels lebeau and konrad 2012 proposed that unfrozen water films flow between two infinite horizontal parallel plates ice soil where the thickness of the water film is controlled by both london van der waals and ionic electrostatic forces it is noted that the functions of hydraulic conductivity mentioned above contain some microscopic parameters that hard to determine teng et al 2021 developed a concise hydraulic conductivity model of frozen soils by generalizing the kozeny carman equation kc equation it can provide reasonable predictions for fine grained soils such as silt but may not be appliable for coarse grained soils such as sand hydraulic conductivity of frozen soils is known to be related to the morphology of pore ice in soils fourie et al 2007 lebeau and konrad 2012 however almost all the above mentioned theoretical models assume that pore ice grows from the pore center which lacks consideration on the variability of ice growth locations based on the nucleation theory petrov and furó 2009 suggested that microparticles in either the pore center or the pore wall could provide sites for phase transitions when the soil is fine grained silt or clay there is always an unfrozen water film on the surface of soil particles anderson and hoekstra 1965 konrad and morgenstern 1980 this is due to the strong adsorption van der waals and ionic electrostatic forces at the particle surface where the ice water phase transition requires more energy and therefore it starts at the pore center however arenson and sego 2006 observed the ice growth process during freezing of coarse grained soils using a fluorescent tracer and found that unfrozen water is distributed in the pore center rather than being present as a unfrozen water film on the particle surface fourie et al 2007 found that liquid water on the particle surface is first to be frozen in the infiltration tests on frozen coarse grained soils which reduces the pore size watanabe and kugisaki 2017 concluded that the ice in large pore spaces of soils grows from the surface towards the center impeding the flow of water in the large pores the above findings imply that pore ice growth along the particle surface does exist in coarse grained soils coarse grained soils have a larger pore structure and weak ionic electrostatic forces thus capillary and adsorption on the particle surface are weak which reduces the impediment to occurring ice water phase transitions moreover thermal conductivity of quartz is greater than that of water thus particle surface cools more rapidly than liquid water in the pore center which contributes to ice growth from the particle surface andersland and ladanyi 2004 it should be noted that the location and morphology of pore ice will affect the water flow channels resulting in changes in hydraulic conductivity of frozen soils however few previous researches have pay attention to the effect of this ice formation pattern on hydraulic conductivity in coarse grained soils therefore an in depth study is required to clarify the relationship between hydraulic conductivity and this ice formation pattern as well as to develop a new model for frozen coarse grained soils in this study a theoretical study was performed to develop a new model for frozen coarse grained soils the rationality and validity of the new model were verified by experimental data and the existing methods in the literature 2 materials and methods 2 1 basic assumptions based on the capillary bundle model watanabe and flury 2008 soil pores can be generalized as a bundle of curved capillaries with different pore radii arranged as r 0 r 1 r j r min where r j is the jth pore radius and r 0 and r min are the maximum and minimum pore sizes respectively the gibbs thomson equation describes the relationship between the freezing temperature t f and the critical freezing pore size r c when the soil temperature is t f pore ice appears in the pores larger than r c while the pores smaller than r c remain unfrozen according to arenson and sego 2006 pore ice grows inwards along the pore wall during freezing in coarse grained soils while unfrozen water is remained in the pore center until it is completely frozen as shown in fig 1 in a single larger pore r r c liquid water begins to change into ice phase along the pore wall towards the center at a particular freezing temperature t f in addition the radius of curvature of the ice water interface is decreasing indicating that further phase transition will require lower temperature effects at that time a portion of unfrozen water is retained in the pore center as the soil temperature decreases further the pore ice continues to grow inwards and eventually fills the entire pore space the following assumptions are made to develop the new model 1 the soil is assumed to be saturated i e the air phase in the void is neglected 2 the soil pores are considered to be a collection of curved cylindrical tubes with similar lengths but different radii 3 the effect of the pore ice on the liquid water flow is assumed to be the same as that of soil particles i e only viscous force between the pore ice and liquid water is considered 2 2 theoretical derivation the kc equation has been widely used to predict hydraulic conductivity of coarse grained soils kozeny 1927 carman 1937 as follows 1 k c s 1 γ 2 ρ s 2 s s 2 e 3 1 e where k is the intrinsic permeability of soils m2 c s is the shape factor γ is the tortuosity defined as the ratio of the length of the actual flow channel to the height of the soil sample ρs is the density of solid particles kg m3 s s is the specific surface area of soils m2 kg and e is the void ratio based on the hagen poiseuille equation teng et al 2021 showed that the kc equation can be written in the form of an average hydraulic radius as follows 2 k c s ϕ e r h 2 γ 2 where ϕ eis the effective porosity representing the volume of pore space available for the liquid water flow and can be approximated as porosity ϕ when the soil is unfrozen and saturated r h is the average hydraulic radius m for soils r h can be expressed as the ratio of the volume of the flow channels v f to the surface area a f ren et al 2016 if the soil is unfrozen and saturated r h is equal to the ratio of the pore volume v v to the pore surface area a v which is equal to the surface area of the soil particles a sp 3 r h v v a v e v s a sp e s s ρ s where v s is the volume of the soil particles m3 hydraulic conductivity of soils k can be determined by a combination of the intrinsic permeability and fluid properties as follows 4 k ρ w g η w k where ρw is the density of water kg m3 g is the gravitational acceleration m s2 and ηw is the dynamic viscosity of water pa s because pore ice grows continuously on the soil particle surface the effective pore space structure available for liquid water flow decreases gradually therefore when applying eq 2 to determine hydraulic conductivity of frozen coarse grained soils the effective porosity ϕ e the average hydraulic radius r h and the tortuosity γ should be changed liquid water cannot flow in the pore space occupied by the ice phase it can only flow in the unfrozen pore space thus the effective porosity ϕ e can be expressed as 5 ϕ e v f v t v w v w v i v w v i v t s u ϕ where v f is the volume of flow channels m3 v t is the total volume of the soil m3 v w is the volume of unfrozen water m3 v i is the volume of ice m3 and s u is the unfrozen water saturation which is defined as the ratio of v w to the sum of v w and v i as follows 6 s u v w v w v i θ u θ s where θu is the unfrozen water content and θs is the saturated water content the average hydraulic radius r h contains two parameters the volume v f and area a f of flow channels which refer to the volume v w and area a w of unfrozen water in the case of freezing the unfrozen water volume v w can be determined from the definition of unfrozen water saturation in eq 6 7 v w s u v w v i s u e v s as shown in fig 1 there are two types of channels for liquid water flowing in the pore space 1 water soil interface and 2 water ice interface for the first case when the pore radius r r c there is no ice in the pore the radius of the unfrozen water flow channel is r and the interface area is a w s for the second case when the pore radius r r c the pore ice grows along the soil particles unfrozen water flow channels are confined in the pore center according to the assumptions a decrease in t f leads to a decrease in r c and a simultaneous decrease of unfrozen water flow channel radius r w the pore r is completely frozen when r c r min i e r w 0 thus the variation process of r w for pore r can be considered to be controlled by r c which can be simplified as r w r r c r 0 and the interface area is a w i the methods of cary 1994 and niemet et al 2002 were used to determine the variation of the two interface areas versus the unfrozen water saturation in frozen soils the empirical relationship between the pore radius r and the corresponding pore volume fraction θ can be expressed as follows 8 r r 0 θ θ 0 λ where θ0 is the pore volume fraction at pore size r 0 which is equal to θs and θ θ0 is equal to s u in frozen soils λ is a parameter that can reflect the pore size distribution of soil and it decreases with the concentration degree of pore size distribution brooks and corey 1964 the differential form of the pore number can be expressed as 9 dn v t d θ π r 2 l t v t θ s π r 2 l t d s u where dn and v tdθ are the number and volume changes of soil pores caused by changing the pore radius from r to r dr respectively l t is the true length of the pore channel m the two parameters for interface area a w s and a w i can be determined by introducing eqs 8 and 9 into the integral expressions 10 a w s n m n c 2 π r l t d n 0 s u 2 v t θ s r d t 2 v t θ s r 0 1 λ s u 1 λ 11 a w i n c n 0 2 π r r c r 0 l t d n s u 1 2 v t θ s s u λ r d t 2 v t θ s r 0 1 λ s u λ 1 s u 1 λ where n m n c and n 0 are the number of pores corresponding to r min r c and r 0 respectively t is the integration variable in the integral equation where it refers to s u in the integral term the surface area of soil particles can be expressed by integrating 12 a sp 0 1 2 v t θ s r d t 2 v t θ s r 0 1 λ thus the surface area of unfrozen water can be expressed as 13 a w a w s a w i s u 1 λ s u λ s u a sp the average hydraulic radius can be obtained by substituting eqs 7 and 13 into eq 3 14 r h v w a w e ρ s s s 1 s u λ 1 s u λ 1 the tortuosity γ has been considered a function of porosity koponen et al 1997 srisutthiyakorn and mavko 2017 15 γ ϕ e γ s u ϕ substituting eqs 5 14 and 15 into eq 2 a new expression for the intrinsic permeability of saturated frozen soils k can be obtained as 16 k c s 1 ρ s 2 s s 2 γ 2 s u ϕ ϕ 3 1 ϕ 2 s u s u λ 1 s u λ 1 2 the corresponding expressions for hydraulic conductivity k and relative hydraulic conductivity k r of frozen soils are 17 k c s ρ w g η w 1 ρ s 2 s s 2 γ 2 s u ϕ ϕ 3 1 ϕ 2 s u s u λ 1 s u λ 1 2 18 k r k k s η w t 0 γ 2 ϕ η w t γ 2 ϕ s u s u s u λ 1 s u λ 1 2 where k s is the saturated hydraulic conductivity of soils m s it should be noted that the proposed model is similar to the empirical model of o neill and miller 1985 which is expressed as a power function in the literature with the denominator term s u λ 1 s u λ 1 2 representing the effect of ice growth from the pore wall the parameter λ decreases as the concentration degree of the pore size distribution increases the unfrozen water saturation s u can be obtained from the measured soil freezing characteristic curve sfcc some related parameters are presented in table 2 it is noted that the determination method of λ is key to dominate the prediction performance of the proposed model here a discussion on λ is given since no clear consensus has been reached in the literature brooks and corey 1964 suggested that λ could be obtained by taking the negative value of the slope of the double logarithmic soil water characteristic curve water content versus matrix suction swcc and suggested that λ could be taken to a positive number greater than 0 skopp 1985 obtained from a parameter analysis of λ and found that λ is less than 1 for sand and may take values greater than 1 for finer materials this study summarized the relationship between λ and the grain size composition of soils campbell 1985 proposed that λ could be determined by the geometric mean particle diameter and the geometric standard deviation of particle diameter but the minimum value of λ obtained according to this formula is greater than 1 which indicates that the formula is not applicable for soil samples with 100 sand particles but is only convenient for the mixed soil samples containing a part of fine particles in addition cary 1994 determined the parameter λ by fitting several pairs of capillary pressure versus water content data at the high water content in summary the value of λ equal to the negative of the slope in the double log swcc seems more reasonable in this study because its rationality has been verified by a number of experiments in the literature 3 results and discussions the literature on the hydraulic conductivity of frozen soils is relatively limited especially for coarse grained soils according to the astm criteria astm d2487 17 soils containing more than 50 of particles larger than 0 075 mm are classified as coarse grained soils and fine grained soils vice versa when a coarse grained soil containing a small proportion of fine particles freezes the ice condensed on the particle surface in the large pores spreads along the particle surface which will induce ice formation in the small pores to start from the pore wall as well therefore we believe that when a soil sample is classified as coarse grained soil the predominant ice formation pattern is ice growing from the pore wall three coarse grained soils with a sand proportion greater than 50 are used to validate the proposed model as shown in table 3 the λ values in table 3 are determined by swcc in double logarithmic coordinates the swcc data and λ for fine sand were not given in burt 1974 which are referred to brooks and corey 1964 in this study tottori dune sand and andisol sandy loam were provided in watanabe and osada 2016 for swcc data λ values can be determined directly from the above method when the measured data don t show a significant linear relationship in a double logarithmic swcc the slope is determined by taking the high water content portion according to cary 1994 e g fine sand and andisol sandy loam the λ values determined for the three soils are shown in fig 2 the measured and fitted sfccs for the three soil samples are shown in fig 3 it should be noted that the sfcc result for fine sand is obtained based on the sfcc prediction curve from tarnawski and wagner 1996 the nmr technique was used to measure the unfrozen water content of tottori dune sand and andisol sandy loam and it has an accuracy of 0 5 c for temperature measurement the variations of tortuosity and dynamic viscosity of the water versus temperature are shown in fig 4 it shows that the tortuosity gradually stabilises as the temperature decreases while the dynamic viscosity of water is relatively stable from 0 to 1 and then increases significantly by substituting the values of the soil properties and the sfcc parameters into eq 18 the value of k r can be predicted two existing models in the literature are used for comparisons to verify the applicability of the proposed model the empirical model proposed by o neill and miller 1985 and the theoretical model proposed by teng et al 2021 the parameters of the models are obtained by using least squares estimation to fit the experimental data within their respective ranges the parameter γ in the o neill and miller 1985 model is a negotiable constant between 7 and 9 the parameter ε in the teng et al 2021 model reflects the difference between the shape of ice particles and soil particles the smaller the difference the closer the ε is to 1 and its recommended range is 0 2 50 the predicted result and the measured data are shown in fig 5 three indexes r 2 mae and rmse are chosen to evaluate the prediction of different models their values are given in table 4 fig 5 shows that the predicted results of the proposed model agree well with the experimental data for the three soils compared with the results of the existing models the proposed model based on ice formation from the pore wall performs better the results of o neill and miller 1985 deviate significantly from the measured values only the andisol sandy loam in fig 5 c has a satisfactory prediction it indicates that such empirical formulas are unreliable by fitting measured values alone which is hard to satisfy the requirements of different soils the predictions of teng et al 2021 model are slightly better than o neill and miller 1985 but still show a tendency to under predict compared to the proposed model especially for fine sand and tottori dune sand in fig 5 a and b this is attributed to the differences in flow channels caused by the assumption of different ice formation patterns the cross section of flow channels in the proposed model can be simplified to be circles however the flow channels formed by ice growth from the pore center include the annular cross section formed by the liquid film which provides a larger contact area for flow i e a greater significant resistance resulting in lower predictions for the existing models fig 5 c shows that all three models have a good prediction of k r for andisol sandy loam while the performance of the proposed model may be slightly worse this might attribute to the large proportion of fine particles in andisol sandy loam if they fill in the pores of coarse particles which may change the original ice formation pattern of coarse grained soil it reflects a limitation of the proposed model that the proportion of fine particles cannot be too large otherwise it will affect the prediction performance of the proposed model the results in table 4 show that the correlation coefficients r 2 of the proposed model are above 0 85 and the values of mae and rmse are smaller than two reference models which indicates that the proposed model performs better in predicting the hydraulic conductivity of coarse grained soils it should be noted that the parameter λ is a key input parameter in the proposed model a parametric analysis was performed to clarify the role of λ the influence of λ on the hydraulic conductivity of frozen soils is shown in fig 6 where λ was set as 0 5 1 0 2 5 and 5 0 and the other parameters were the same as in andisol sandy loam the slope of the curve increases as λ increases which is consistent with existing empirical models the reason for this may be as follows a greater dispersion of the pore size distribution means that the surface area of the flow channel varies more significantly resulting in a steeper hydraulic conductivity curve according to brooks and corey 1964 and campbell 1985 λ may be taken as 0 1 for gravel or coarse grained sand and 1 5 for sandy loam 4 conclusions the hydraulic conductivity of frozen coarse grained soils has been difficult to predict reasonably this study considered the ice formation patterns in frozen coarse grained soils and established a new hydraulic conductivity model some new findings are summarized as follows 1 pore ice grows inward from the pore wall in coarse grained soils and unfrozen water is retained in the pores which has a considerable influence on the flow channels and thus the hydraulic conductivity of frozen coarse grained soils 2 the proposed model can more realistically reflect the ice formation pattern in coarse grained soils the model can be considered an extension of the kc equation for frozen conditions which has a simple form and with parameters that can reflect the soil properties 3 the predicted results of the proposed model agree well with the experimental data in the literature compared with the existing models this model shows better predictions for frozen coarse grained soils the parameter λ is the only unknown parameter which is suggested to be 0 1 for gravel or sand and 1 5 for sandy loam

2444,dynamics in long term evapotranspiration et and its controlling variables are essential for understanding how a high altitude wetlands ecosystem responds to climate change the rising temperature is expected to agitate the regional hydrological cycle and water balance particularly in the subalpine wetland valley of jiuzhaigou located in the transition zone between the northeast qinghai tibet plateau and the sichuan basin southwest china here we used growing season multi year 2013 2021 bowen ratio data to assess the variability in et and its key controlling parameters at different timescales in jiuzhaigou valley this study also explored the ratio of et to precipitation p the wetland daily mean et varied from 0 06 to 6 77 mm d 1 with a mean value of 2 64 mm d 1 for the nine years fluctuations in daily et were primarily driven by available energy net radiation rn explaining 86 of the variation seasonal patterns in et were largely similar to environmental parameters i e rn air temperature ta and vapor pressure deficit vpd peaking in august with an interannual monthly mean value of 3 48 mm d 1 interannual monthly mean et had a strong positive linear relationship with rn ta and vpd while there was no significant correlation with p on a growing season basis furthermore monthly et was shown to be regulated by ta largely in high temperature months and minimally in low temperature months the growing season et varied interannually and the et to p ratio i e et p ranged between 0 52 and 1 16 interannual variation in annual et was controlled by ta and p which individually explained 73 and 61 of the variation respectively the multiple regression model indicated that ta and p together elucidated 92 of the variation in annual et the increased sensitivity e g regression slopes of et to p over 2014 2021 indicates that et consumed most of p which leads to decreasing runoff and streams drying up this study clarifies the temporal dynamics in et for wetlands and its environmental controls at multiple timescales it is demonstrated that the proportion of et could increase in response to increasing temperature without an associated increase in p affecting local water balance these results could potentially contribute to sustainable water management in high altitude wetlands and environmental planning under future climate change keywords bowen ratio evapotranspiration high altitude wetlands multiple timescales rising temperature water balance data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the high altitude wetland services including flood mitigation determining water balance providing ecological habitats and lessening storm damage mainly rely on climatic features which regulate either water recharge or discharge of the regions aber et al 2012 therefore quantifying the water budgets of wetlands is of great interest to determine the requirements of water usage and hydrological regimes drexler et al 2004 with the acceleration of global warming the high altitude wetlands are expected to experience more incredible climate changes shen et al 2014 as these wetlands are more susceptible to variations in temperature and precipitation zhang et al 2016a generally over the period 1951 2012 the global surface temperature increased by 0 49 0 89 c where the warming rate in high altitudes and latitudes was significantly larger than the average global trend ipcc 2013 furthermore the forecasted increase in surface warming is expected to be the most obvious at high altitudes and latitudes in the upcoming decades based on long term observation 1956 2014 the annual air temperature has significantly increased by 0 0220 c year 1 during the past two decades 1994 2014 as compared to the period 1956 1993 0 0090 c year 1 over the subalpine wetland valley of jiuzhaigou yan et al 2017 located in the transition zone between the northeast qinghai tibet plateau and the sichuan basin since 1956 the region s annual precipitation p has usually not changed while evapotranspiration et was observed to increase leading to a reduction in runoff and drying up in streams gan and zheng 2007 yang et al 2011 yan et al 2020 the wetland area in the region decreased from 2 34 km2 to 1 61 km2 from 1983 to 2002 di et al 2011 it is also documented that the water area in jiuzhaigou valley reduced by 30 liu et al 2011 which is believed to be caused mainly by climatic factors however many aspects of water dynamics in the wetland area primarily concerning the quantitative understanding of multiple scale variations in et remain inadequate goulden et al 2007 yan et al 2020 as et is an essential part of high altitude wetlands hydrological processes thus it is crucial to investigate how et responds to environmental drivers particularly climatic warming for a better understanding of the water management practices with future climate change the long term e g several years measurements by the bowen ratio system provide an opportunity to investigate the wetland ecosystem processes and et regime response to ongoing climatic changes the wetland et is still arguably the most uncertain ecohydrological parameter in ecosystem water budgets development and understanding of ecological influences accredited to episodic climatic events zhang et al 2016a many researchers have reported the et and energy fluxes over different types of wetland such as boreal zones devito et al 2005 zha et al 2010 runkle et al 2014 northern zones mackay et al 2007 arctic zones liljedahl et al 2011 and temperate wetlands eichelmann et al 2018 which are mainly confined to the areas with latitude higher than 38 n furthermore these investigations were primarily based on short term data sets with few annual comparisons recent discerning about ecosystem level et responses to occurrences of warming or episodic climatic events are mixed in the pieces of literature given a resemblance during warming conditions the plant transpiration and photosynthesis responses to stomatal closure hayat et al 2020 the wetland ecosystem et should also be responsive to the rise in temperature previous studies documented substantial increases in the wetland et during climate warming without an associated increase in precipitation which may be subject to change in the wetland water balance winter 2000 yang et al 2014 zhang et al 2016a in addition zhao and running 2010 have revealed that high air temperature can lead to increases in et and water stress the et regime of the wetland ecosystem under higher temperatures is critical for the energy and water fluxes and thus to the onset continuation of climate warming therefore accurate estimation of the et and energy fluxes between the land surface and the atmosphere over the wetlands on the tibetan plateau is essential for predicting the temperature and precipitation regimes the complex interactions of environmental parameters controlled the et differently across temporal scales i e daily interannually rouse 2000 ma et al 2018 hayat et al 2022 it is documented that available energy i e net radiation rn air temperature ta vapor pressure deficit vpd wind speed ws and precipitation p which all vary over a range of spatiotemporal scales are the most important variables affecting the water vapor exchange processes between the land surface and atmosphere wang et al 2006 xie et al 2016a chen et al 2018 however comprehensive information about these regulating mechanisms is still lacking especially for wetlands during climate warming even though the role of environmental parameters in driving ecosystem et in wetland areas is challenging and complicated to investigate the improved understanding of ecosystem level et and identification of its critical regulating parameters at interannual timescales is a vital research objective with ongoing climate change rocha and goulden 2008 the additional complications when scaling from short term hourly to long term annually intervals may affect the response of et to environmental associations chen et al 2008 prior studies have revealed that et has considerable variations over seasonal interannual and regional timescales restrepo and arain 2005 mao et al 2002 lafleur 2008 qiu et al 2017 jia et al 2018 over short timescales e g intra annually the variations in et along with environmental parameters have been reported reasonably well for many ecosystems worldwide peacock and hess 2004 sun et al 2008 helman et al 2017 zou et al 2021 however over longer timescales e g interannually the comprehensive assessment of the dynamics in et and its controlling mechanisms is currently inadequate xu et al 2014 yan et al 2020 iqbal et al 2021 the intra annual variations of the hydrological cycle are generally different from the interannual dynamics with changing climate however they could explain the seasonal and year to year differences in ecosystem et to a large extent respectively ma et al 2019 hayat et al 2022 previous studies documented that interannual dynamics in et are significant which could not be ignored barr et al 2007 liu et al 2019 therefore a better understanding of et variability and its controlling mechanisms over long term is basic to accurately predict future hydrological cycling in high altitude wetlands and address the consequences of management decisions usually the annual et p ratio is associated with vegetation types land uses and environmental conditions hence widely used to examine the influences of landscape changes and climate on the regional water cycle donohue et al 2007 li et al 2013 yan et al 2017 it is demonstrated that the transferring of grassland to forestland land use changes related to afforestation and reforestation would lead to more et p ratio which caused a decrease in runoff zhang et al 2015 the forest coverage of minjiang valley next to the jiuzhaigou has only increased from 18 85 to roughly 30 and the et p ratio was observed at 30 40 zhang et al 2008 in comparison the jiuzhaigou valley forest coverage increased to approximately 65 bossard et al 2015 which can be supposed to make the et p ratio higher however it remained uninvestigated due to a lack of comprehensive observing data in the current study we analyzed a nine year record 2013 2021 of continuous et data collected by the bowen ratio system over a typical subalpine river valley in jiuzhaigou the water of this valley is the source of the jialing river a major tributary of the yangtze river like tibetan plateau the jiuzhaigou valley has fragile ecosystems sensitive to climate change our particular objectives of this research were to 1 quantify the long term variability in et and hydrological response to climate warming over the wetland and 2 determine the major regulatory variables and the controlling mechanism of et at multiple timescales 2 materials and methods 2 1 site descriptions we conducted this study in jiuzhaigou valley at a horizontal flow wetland of nuorilang lakes 33 09 71 n 103 54 38 e fig 1 which is the research station of peking university shenzhen graduate school the study site elevation is 2365 m above mean sea level and is located in the upper reach of jialing river sichuan province southwest china the site has a prevailing highland temperate monsoon climate and is situated in a transition zone between the warm temperate region and the northern subtropical region of the tibetan plateau based on long term data i e 1951 2009 from nearby songpan meteorological station about 30 km from the observation site the mean annual air temperature is 7 3 with the lowest average monthly ta varying from 3 7 in january to the highest mean monthly ta of 16 8 in july hao et al 2009 precipitation is the primary source of the regional water budget and episodic rainfall events are expected the mean annual rainfall is 762 mm most of which falls during the growing season between the months of april and october qiao 2012 the islands are distributed on the sloping downstream sides by travertine dams with a longwinded border at nuorilang lakes florsheim et al 2013 generally the surface water flow fluctuates in response to rainfall amounts and patterns causing differences in water levels over seasonal scales above the soil the lowest water table i e 5 cm occurred in april whereas the largest water table about 15 cm occurred in august liu et al 2011 revealed that jiuzhaigou has a visible allocation of landscape characteristics attributed to distinct vegetation composition and types across the altitude the dominant plant species growing above the water surface at the site are salix linearistipularis with scattered abies fabri pinus tabuliformis sorbaria arborea carex obscura and betula utilis while the islands submerged portions are dominated by equisetum fluvitalie and equisetum arvense 2 2 meteorological measurements meteorological measurements correspondingly with et estimations were continuously attained from the bowen ratio tower about 3 m height established over the canopy in the experimental area of the wetland the variables included net radiation rn in w m 2 240 100 novalynx usa air temperature ta in cs215 l campbell usa relative humidity rh in cs215 l campbell usa wind speed ws in m s 1 200 ws 02 novalynx usa and precipitation p in mm 7852 m ab davis usa were measured at the heights of 2 m and 2 5 m above the ground the measuring accuracy for rn ta rh ws and p were 4 0 2 2 0 2 m s 1 and 0 2 mm respectively the soil heat flux g in w m 2 hfp01 hukseflux netherlands was measured at the soil depth of 0 02 m and 0 05 m with two soil heat flux plates at each depth on the travertine dams vapor pressure deficit vpd in kpa was calculated from recorded ta and rh tetens 1930 to describe the atmospheric water demand all these meteorological data were measured every 5 s and every 10 minutes averages were subsequently recorded on a cr1000 datalogger campbell scientific logan ut usa over the growing seasons of 2013 to 2021 following yan et al 2020 the growing season length was determined from 1 april to 31 october over the study period we defined april to may as spring june to august as summer and september to october as autumn the data from 1 april 25 july in 2013 and 14 july 31 october in 2021 were missing in this study 2 3 data processing and parameters calculations we used the bowen ratio energy balance breb method to calculate et in mm s 1 bowen 1926 which has been successfully appertained in many studies for surface energy fluxes along with various environmental conditions over wetland areas burba et al 1999 peacock and hess 2004 fischer et al 2013 zhang et al 2016b yan et al 2020 the wetland energy balance ratio was estimated based on the following equation 1 rn g le h s 0 where rn in w m 2 denotes the net radiation g in w m 2 the soil heat flux le in w m 2 the latent heat flux h in w m 2 the sensible heat flux and s in w m 2 the water energy storage the water surface partially covered the research site and the annual water level was approximately 10 cm above the soil moreover travertine dams hinder the adjacent water flow therefore the water energy storage could be neglected the bowen ratio β is defined as the ratio of h to le and it supposes similar water vapor and heat exchange coefficients i e kw kh β can be calculated according to bowen 1926 with the following equation 2 β h le ρ c p k h t z ε l p a ρ k w e z γ δ t δ e where ρ in kg m 3 represents the air density cρ in kj kg 1 1 the specific heat capacity at constant pressure ε the constant ratio i e 0 622 of molecular weight of water to dry air γ in kpa the psychrometric constant l in j kg 1 the specific latent heat of vaporization pa in kpa the air pressure and δt and δe are the temperature and humidity gradients recorded between two heights respectively in this study the et le and h were calculated using the breb approach 3 et r n g l 1 β 4 le r n g 1 β 5 h β r n g 1 β the bowen ratio measurements were screened and checked regularly for retrieval of quality data based on the vital principles namely the atmospheric stability power failure of instruments impact of meteorological conditions on sensors i e rain cyclone dew or ice out of reach fluxes and turbulence fluctuations van gorsel et al 2011 for instrument calibration the two temperature and rh sensors were placed at the same height for three days and then measurements were calibrated on a cr1000 datalogger for estimating wetland et there is no single approach because of the complexity and variability of wetlands additionally for independent and accurate measurement of wetland et there is no single guaranteed method because most of the methods required the high accuracy of rn and g to obtain improved measurements of wetland et drexler et al 2004 the breb method can give accurate estimates of wetland et based on accurate rn g and small values of the bowen ratio peacock and hess 2004 previous research documented that the small relative error in the bowen ratio can keep the small relative error in et angus and watts 1984 however near sunrise and sunset large errors in latent heat flux density can occur when the β closed to 1 prueger et al 1997 therefore the raw bowen ratios close to 1 and out of range fluxes of le and h e g 100 to 1000 w m 2 were excluded according to perez et al 1999 with the following equation 6 ε δ δ e γ δ δ t δ e where δ δ e represents the resolution of the dewpoint hygrometer 0 03 kpa γ δ δ t the resolution of thermocouples 0 05 and ε the error interval closed to 1 the previous research revealed that the accuracy of the breb method can be determined by comparing the calculated fluxes with other independent et measurement equipment perez et al 1999 therefore we compared the wetland et measured by breb with the potential evapotranspiration of an open water surface by the penman monteith equation in our previous research in the same region i e yan et al 2020 during the study period on average 8 of the error resulted in the bowen ratio the longer data gaps were filled via the mean diurnal variation approach whereas the small gaps for instance 2 h in duration were filled using linear interpolation falge et al 2001 krishnan et al 2012 gaps recorded in flux data ranged from 3 to 19 during the growing season of 2013 2021 gaps in meteorological data were also filled with daily records from the nearby songpan meteorological station after gap filling the data were summed or averaged to calculate daily monthly and annual values 2 4 statistical analysis the influences of meteorological drivers on et were analyzed via linear and nonlinear regressions at multiple timescales e g daily to interannually the data were accumulated to daily monthly and annual values to explore the temporal fluctuations fig 2 the coefficient of variation cv was applied to describe the variability of the selected parameters to evaluate the regression significance between et and meteorological regulating parameters the f statistics was used at a value of 0 05 critical probability αcrit 0 05 we applied the one way analysis of variance anova at a significance level of 0 05 to compare the seasonal and annual differences in et and explanatory variables the regression slopes were used to indicate wetland total et sensitivity to precipitation all statistical analyses were performed using excel 2016 microsoft corporation redmond wa usa matlab ver r2017a mathworks inc usa and spss ver 17 0 spss inc usa 3 results 3 1 multi temporal scale variations in meteorological parameters daily mean variations in meteorological factors are shown in fig 2a e during the growing seasons 1 april 31 october of 2013 2021 the range of daily mean rn ta vpd rh and ws was 5 19 263 59 w m 2 2 31 21 88 0 0018 0 95 kpa 44 08 98 99 and 0 1 31 m s 1 respectively over nine years the parameters including rn ta and vpd were highest in august with the interannual monthly mean values of 154 0 w m 2 16 59 and 0 40 kpa respectively fig 3 b d over the observation period rh had its monthly mean maximum values in september 86 61 and ws in april 0 60 m s 1 fig 3e f all parameters i e rn ta vpd rh and ws fluctuated differently from year to year yielding interannual growing season mean values of

generally the daily precipitation varied in the matter of quantity and timing increasing with the start of the rainy season i e april and the maximum falling during the mid growing season i e june september over 2013 2021 fig 2e uncommonly in 2017 one large p event was recorded on the day of the year doy 179 donating 80 8 mm of p which attributed to 8 33 rainfall of that year the region s highest interannual monthly mean rainfall occurred in june about 44 greater than the lowest amount during october fig 3g the growing season p totaled to 5515 1 mm over the study period excluding 2013 and 2021 varied from 483 4 to 969 3 mm with an interannual mean of 787 87 170 mm fig 4g the minimal amounts of p occurred in 2019 483 4 mm approximately 38 64 less than the seven years average rainfall 787 87 mm 3 2 multi temporal scale variations in evapotranspiration daily mean et exhibited an apparent day to day variation ranging between 0 06 and 6 77 mm d 1 with the mean value of 2 64 mm d 1 across a nine year study period fig 2f the range of daily mean et was 0 31 6 77 0 24 5 78 0 39 5 92 0 46 6 06 0 06 5 61 0 35 5 36 0 31 5 95 0 36 6 01 and 0 45 5 84 mm d 1 over the growing season of 2013 2021 respectively the daily rate of et gradually increased during spring reached its maximum in summer and then declined during autumn the interannual monthly mean et patterns corresponded closely with environmental parameters i e rn ta and vpd fig 3a the variations in et were highest in august with an interannual monthly mean value of 3 48 mm d 1 and lowest in october being 1 49 mm d 1 the growing season annual et significantly varied among consecutive nine year periods ranging from 290 85 to 589 90 mm y 1 with an interannual mean of 499 45 110 57 mm y 1 and cv of 22 13 fig 4a annual et was the largest and more variable during 2016 than during 2021 with a cv of 53 45 and 35 84 respectively additionally the et was not highest in the years with more rainfall e g 2017 3 3 environmental controls on evapotranspiration the growing season relationships between daily mean et and environmental parameters over the nine years are shown in fig 5 daily mean et had a significant positive linear interaction with rn ta and vpd fig 5a c with p values all 0 05 the correlation analysis indicated that the daily variation in rn ta and vpd individually explained 86 45 and 51 of the variation in et respectively however there was no significant relationship between et and ws at the daily resolution fig 5d over these parameters available energy i e rn had a dominant role in driving et with a goodness of fit of 86 moreover the multiple regression model showed that 89 of the variation in daily et was explained by the combined variations of rn ta and vpd table 2 the regulating parameters on a seasonal variation in et differed among months fig 6 a d overall the monthly et increased linearly with increasing rn ta and vpd while no apparent trends have occurred in et in response to the total monthly p on a growing season basis when investigating the driving mechanisms on monthly et the rn was responsible for most of the variation in et in june july and september october fig 6a average r2 0 64 in the meantime ta became more important during april may and august on average explaining 60 variation in et fig 6b in addition monthly et was shown to have a weak linear relationship with ta during the months of low temperature i e april and may r2 0 54 and 0 59 while the strongest association was in the months of high temperature i e august r2 0 67 monthly variations in vpd explained 61 and 76 of et variability during april and october respectively fig 6c furthermore et was observed to have no significant relationship with p in all months fig 6d seasonally the multiple regression analysis indicated that 76 of the variability in et was determined by the combined variations of ta and vpd in spring 68 by rn and ta in summer and 66 by rn and vpd during autumn table 2 over interannual timescales the growing season total annual et was significantly correlated with ta and p fig 7 a f table 2 p 0 05 the strongest relationship occurred between et and ta with a coefficient of determination of 73 across nine years however the impacts of other parameters i e rn vpd rh and ws on total annual et were infirm and insignificant p 0 05 the growing season annual mean ta and total p together explained 92 of the variation in et during the observation period table 2 3 4 water balance cumulative et was 4169 16 mm during the growing season of 2014 2021 which was smaller than the cumulative p of 5826 7 mm yielding an overall p use efficiency of 71 55 fig 8 the annual cumulative difference between p and et i e p et varied from 82 to 457 mm across the study period in addition the et ratio to p i e et p for 2014 2021 was 0 59 0 61 0 76 0 52 0 70 1 16 0 82 and 0 93 respectively over 2014 2018 the cumulative p was greater than the cumulative et and at no time did et exceed the cumulative p fig 8a e however cumulative et exceeded cumulative p on doy 242 304 in 2019 and doy 91 222 in 2020 yielding the annual cumulative p et of 43 62 mm and 61 04 mm respectively fig 8f g the cumulative et was about 15 larger than the cumulative p during 2019 furthermore the slopes of the relationships between the growing season annual et and p increased i e 0 61 0 60 0 85 0 58 0 68 1 03 0 73 and 0 86 from 2014 to 2021 respectively table 1 4 discussion 4 1 characteristics of evapotranspiration daily mean et significantly varied over the growing season with the mean value of 2 64 mm d 1 falling within the average value of 2 3 to 4 5 mm d 1 over different types of wetlands globally fig 2f lafleur 2008 however the mean et at our site i e 2 64 mm d 1 was generally higher than et estimated for subalpine forests i e 1 6 mm d 1 and 0 11 2 56 mm d 1 cheng et al 2003 gaofeng et al 2014 in the mountainous range of southwestern china seasonal variations in et with corresponding environmental parameters fluctuated in a way that is congruent with the previous observations during the growing season for the forest yang et al 2014 yan et al 2017 ma et al 2018 the monthly wetland et increased with climate warming and reached its highest values in summer fig 3 it is typically related to the transition from the dry to the wet season under monsoon rotation gu et al 2005 wang et al 2016 chu et al 2018 the variability at this conversion period led to a high seasonal fluctuation in environmental parameters and thus et zha et al 2010 the largest variability in et in august was parallel with the greatest variations in ta accompanied by higher rn and vpd over the same period which is consistent with prior studies that demonstrated et should increase with rising temperatures under ample water availability xie et al 2016a zhang et al 2016b yan et al 2020 previous research in the same region documented that daily et was not significantly reduced despite decreasing soil water across may august yan et al 2017 furthermore zhang et al 2016b measured the growing season et of three distinct ecosystems of the qinghai lake watershed based on the bowen ratio method in the northeast of the qinghai tibet plateau and found the annual average et of 373 83 15 75 mm y 1 which is lower than the et rate at jiuzhaigou i e 499 45 110 57 mm y 1 fig 4a the fluctuations in et rate can be attributed in response to the variations in environmental drivers xiao et al 2013 xu et al 2014 xie et al 2016b and differences in elevation over different wetlands ma et al 2016 therefore the higher rate of subalpine wetland et over the current study in comparison to the alpine wetland zhang et al 2016a cao et al 2019 could also be explained by the variations of different elevations of atmospheric demand zhang et al 2009 4 2 variables controlling evapotranspiration and their mechanisms at multiple timescales our results demonstrate that the variations in wetland et under the influencing environmental parameters are very complex and its driving forces can be observed through different timescales i e daily to interannually the differences in environmental parameters over short and long term scales can lead to different variability in the wetland et 4 2 1 the influencing factors of et at the daily scale over wetland ecosystems with cold climates and high altitudes the primary regulating parameters of daily et are rn and ta rouse 2000 liu et al 2009 runkle et al 2014 followed by vpd and ws zhao and liu 2018 and occasionally precipitation induced soil water availability under dry condition jacobs et al 2002 the current analysis showed that available energy i e rn ta and vpd are generally the main environmental parameters involved in controlling the daily et over the growing season in a subalpine wetland of jiuzhaigou fig 5a c table 2 however et was more tightly coupled with available energy than other explanatory parameters which predominantly explained 86 of the variations these findings are consistent with the previous study in the alpine ecosystem which revealed that available energy was the most important in regulating et zhang et al 2016b based on the current observations the elevated response of daily et to environmental parameters i e rn ta and vpd primarily linked with ample water availability over the wetland at short timescales i e daily the ecosystem was not stressed by water because surface flow existed over the non frozen period thus causing daily et to increase with environmental driving factors to meet the atmospheric water demand in addition rn causes to increase in ta and vpd as it is the primary energy source affecting the heat and water vapor movement to and from the plant leaf surfaces resulting in differences in et clausnitzer et al 2011 moreover the level of atmospheric water demand reflects by high vpd which alters the tree transpiration rate and canopy conductance chen et al 2012 zha et al 2013 the ws showed no meaningful relationship with et due to an irregular pattern fig 5d guo et al 2021 however higher ws can contribute to the variation of higher vpd table 2 montaldo and oren 2016 4 2 2 the influencing factors of et at the seasonal and interannual scale the long term variations in et significantly determined its seasonal and interannual response to environmental parameters differently over the growing season the interannual variation of monthly et was determined mainly by rn in june r2 0 71 and ta in august r2 0 67 which is further strengthened by multiple regression model fig 6a b table 2 it was based on different trends of rn and ta in spring and sufficient water availability provided by p from june to september the ta was gradually increased under excellent water conditions at the beginning of the growing season enabling rapid vegetation growth thus increasing et this result is comparable with other reports which showed that solar radiation and temperature regulated et when there was ample water supply gu et al 2005 guo and sun 2012 yan et al 2020 in autumn mainly in october the low seasonal vpd decreased the et consistent with the previous studies which revealed some positive influences from vpd fig 6c table 2 wu et al 2010 zhao and liu 2018 furthermore jiuzhaigou s subalpine wetland showed no significant et dependence on p at the monthly timescales fig 6d which is expected due to the sizable amount of p induced water availability zhang et al 2014 zhang et al 2016b at interannual timescales the impact of environmental parameters on et has rarely been examined for subalpine wetlands due to limited observing data the annual growing season et rate significantly varied across nine years matching primarily to the fluctuation in ta fig 4a c as a result the interannual variation in et was predominantly controlled by ta and up to a certain degree by p especially in the dry years fig 7a f this result was further strengthened by the combined effects of ta and p which explained 92 of the variation in interannual et table 2 the precipitation events are essential during the driest period to sustain the et rate zha et al 2013 our findings align with previous observations for the ecosystems experiencing dry periods liu et al 2010 and when or where the p was limited zhang et al 2016b the et was observed not the highest in the years with more rainfall e g 2017 while lowest in the years with low rainfall e g 2013 2021 fig 4a g which indicates that the et was controlled by energy in the wet years and by moisture in the dry years in addition unlike rn vpd and ws affecting et over the short term rain fed soil water can explain a large portion of fluctuations in et at longer timescales ewers et al 2001 chen et al 2014 hayat et al 2022 which reinforces the current results the heightened sensitivity in et to ta usually coincided with sufficient rainfall amounts recharging soil water causing et to increase to meet the atmospheric water demand generally the wetland s susceptibility to the warming climate is determined by the level of increasing temperature which would lead to a change in the wetland water balance winter 2000 our findings are consistent with previous observations where ta is a key limiting parameter on hydrological and ecological processes over northern wetlands including arctic and boreal responses to climate warming petrone et al 2000 moore et al 2013 runkle et al 2014 the prior study documented that warming induced water losses may also fluctuate the thermal gradients and surface moisture by changing surface energy and water balance leading to stronger effects in the wetland regions zhang et al 2012 the rising tendency in the vertical air surface thermal gradients was also found in the adjacent wetland areas wang et al 2011 zhang et al 2016a and over a central european wetland kovářová and pokorný 2010 therefore this study suggests that the subalpine wetlands may be exposed to potential degradation with increasing air temperature under ongoing climate warming without an accompanying increase in corresponding precipitation the findings of this research have broader applicability to the high altitude wetlands and other parts of the subalpine ecoregion in response to changing hydrometeorological conditions 4 3 water balance over jiuzhaigou wetland the wetland et feedback to p is a valuable metric for investigating the hydrological patterns of changing climate because it can directly influence the proportion of seasonal variations in the water budget leading to determining the wetland s existence malone et al 2014 yan et al 2020 prior studies revealed that annual wetland et fluctuated widely between 325 and 1552 mm considering up to 55 92 of p as a vital cause of water losses zhou and zhou 2009 headley et al 2012 xiao et al 2013 malone et al 2014 cao et al 2019 zang et al 2019 in our study the accumulative wetland et over 2014 2021 i e 4169 16 mm accounted for 71 55 of the overall p use efficiency fig 8 however the et p varied from 0 52 to 1 16 indicating the high ratio of et to p and high interannual variability across the observation period it should be noted that the growing season annual accumulative et in 2019 and 2020 was more than the corresponding p input resulting in p et of 43 62 mm and 61 04 mm respectively in addition annual et was about 15 greater than local rainfall amounts during 2019 the comparison among years highlights that the projected warming climate will probably upsurge the annual et with an insignificant increase in annual rainfall yan et al 2017 which agrees with the previous study sottocornola and kiely 2010 the ratio of et to p is comparable to other studies in the qinghai tibet plateau which documented that the et ratio was less or nearly equal to local rainfall amounts liu et al 2009 jie et al 2013 furthermore zhang et al 2016b documented the larger ratio of et to p i e 26 for achnatherum splendens steppe site which is in line with our findings the high et p ratio emphasizes the robust wetland feedback to climate warming gutowski et al 2007 the increasing trend in wetland et with climate change tends to result in a reduction in water availability for discharge downstream this result is further reinforced by the slopes of et to p ranging from 0 58 to 1 03 showing larger positive et trends over 2014 2021 table 1 in addition the extra amount of et water losses may promote by a more extended non frozen period with the corresponding warming climate especially in the wetland regions due to lower evaporative resistance zhang et al 2011 the wetlands et has lower values than open water under similar climates and ample water availability lafleur 2008 because plants can decrease the et in the wetlands by physiological constraints to transpiration brümmer et al 2012 moreover wetlands can humidify and better cool the surrounding environment in summer krinner 2003 which appears particularly interesting in response to increasing temperatures due to global warming 5 conclusion we demonstrated the patterns and importance of multi year et with the complex influences of environmental factors in the subalpine wetland which is characterized by fragile ecosystems and robust climate change results show that et responses to site environmental parameters fluctuated differently from daily to interannual timescales variations in daily et were mainly controlled by rn on a seasonal level variations in et were most considerable during summer predominantly in august variations in rn ta and vpd determined et based on monthly resolution whereas p was not important interannually the variability in ta and p led to variation in et the heightened sensitivity of et to climate warming and p exceptionally high et p ratio over the long term underscores that most p was used by et suggesting decreases in runoff and streams drying up in jiuzhaigou valley given the tendency for rising temperatures with future climate change in high altitude wetlands this study can potentially assist in sustainable water management and environmental

2444,dynamics in long term evapotranspiration et and its controlling variables are essential for understanding how a high altitude wetlands ecosystem responds to climate change the rising temperature is expected to agitate the regional hydrological cycle and water balance particularly in the subalpine wetland valley of jiuzhaigou located in the transition zone between the northeast qinghai tibet plateau and the sichuan basin southwest china here we used growing season multi year 2013 2021 bowen ratio data to assess the variability in et and its key controlling parameters at different timescales in jiuzhaigou valley this study also explored the ratio of et to precipitation p the wetland daily mean et varied from 0 06 to 6 77 mm d 1 with a mean value of 2 64 mm d 1 for the nine years fluctuations in daily et were primarily driven by available energy net radiation rn explaining 86 of the variation seasonal patterns in et were largely similar to environmental parameters i e rn air temperature ta and vapor pressure deficit vpd peaking in august with an interannual monthly mean value of 3 48 mm d 1 interannual monthly mean et had a strong positive linear relationship with rn ta and vpd while there was no significant correlation with p on a growing season basis furthermore monthly et was shown to be regulated by ta largely in high temperature months and minimally in low temperature months the growing season et varied interannually and the et to p ratio i e et p ranged between 0 52 and 1 16 interannual variation in annual et was controlled by ta and p which individually explained 73 and 61 of the variation respectively the multiple regression model indicated that ta and p together elucidated 92 of the variation in annual et the increased sensitivity e g regression slopes of et to p over 2014 2021 indicates that et consumed most of p which leads to decreasing runoff and streams drying up this study clarifies the temporal dynamics in et for wetlands and its environmental controls at multiple timescales it is demonstrated that the proportion of et could increase in response to increasing temperature without an associated increase in p affecting local water balance these results could potentially contribute to sustainable water management in high altitude wetlands and environmental planning under future climate change keywords bowen ratio evapotranspiration high altitude wetlands multiple timescales rising temperature water balance data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the high altitude wetland services including flood mitigation determining water balance providing ecological habitats and lessening storm damage mainly rely on climatic features which regulate either water recharge or discharge of the regions aber et al 2012 therefore quantifying the water budgets of wetlands is of great interest to determine the requirements of water usage and hydrological regimes drexler et al 2004 with the acceleration of global warming the high altitude wetlands are expected to experience more incredible climate changes shen et al 2014 as these wetlands are more susceptible to variations in temperature and precipitation zhang et al 2016a generally over the period 1951 2012 the global surface temperature increased by 0 49 0 89 c where the warming rate in high altitudes and latitudes was significantly larger than the average global trend ipcc 2013 furthermore the forecasted increase in surface warming is expected to be the most obvious at high altitudes and latitudes in the upcoming decades based on long term observation 1956 2014 the annual air temperature has significantly increased by 0 0220 c year 1 during the past two decades 1994 2014 as compared to the period 1956 1993 0 0090 c year 1 over the subalpine wetland valley of jiuzhaigou yan et al 2017 located in the transition zone between the northeast qinghai tibet plateau and the sichuan basin since 1956 the region s annual precipitation p has usually not changed while evapotranspiration et was observed to increase leading to a reduction in runoff and drying up in streams gan and zheng 2007 yang et al 2011 yan et al 2020 the wetland area in the region decreased from 2 34 km2 to 1 61 km2 from 1983 to 2002 di et al 2011 it is also documented that the water area in jiuzhaigou valley reduced by 30 liu et al 2011 which is believed to be caused mainly by climatic factors however many aspects of water dynamics in the wetland area primarily concerning the quantitative understanding of multiple scale variations in et remain inadequate goulden et al 2007 yan et al 2020 as et is an essential part of high altitude wetlands hydrological processes thus it is crucial to investigate how et responds to environmental drivers particularly climatic warming for a better understanding of the water management practices with future climate change the long term e g several years measurements by the bowen ratio system provide an opportunity to investigate the wetland ecosystem processes and et regime response to ongoing climatic changes the wetland et is still arguably the most uncertain ecohydrological parameter in ecosystem water budgets development and understanding of ecological influences accredited to episodic climatic events zhang et al 2016a many researchers have reported the et and energy fluxes over different types of wetland such as boreal zones devito et al 2005 zha et al 2010 runkle et al 2014 northern zones mackay et al 2007 arctic zones liljedahl et al 2011 and temperate wetlands eichelmann et al 2018 which are mainly confined to the areas with latitude higher than 38 n furthermore these investigations were primarily based on short term data sets with few annual comparisons recent discerning about ecosystem level et responses to occurrences of warming or episodic climatic events are mixed in the pieces of literature given a resemblance during warming conditions the plant transpiration and photosynthesis responses to stomatal closure hayat et al 2020 the wetland ecosystem et should also be responsive to the rise in temperature previous studies documented substantial increases in the wetland et during climate warming without an associated increase in precipitation which may be subject to change in the wetland water balance winter 2000 yang et al 2014 zhang et al 2016a in addition zhao and running 2010 have revealed that high air temperature can lead to increases in et and water stress the et regime of the wetland ecosystem under higher temperatures is critical for the energy and water fluxes and thus to the onset continuation of climate warming therefore accurate estimation of the et and energy fluxes between the land surface and the atmosphere over the wetlands on the tibetan plateau is essential for predicting the temperature and precipitation regimes the complex interactions of environmental parameters controlled the et differently across temporal scales i e daily interannually rouse 2000 ma et al 2018 hayat et al 2022 it is documented that available energy i e net radiation rn air temperature ta vapor pressure deficit vpd wind speed ws and precipitation p which all vary over a range of spatiotemporal scales are the most important variables affecting the water vapor exchange processes between the land surface and atmosphere wang et al 2006 xie et al 2016a chen et al 2018 however comprehensive information about these regulating mechanisms is still lacking especially for wetlands during climate warming even though the role of environmental parameters in driving ecosystem et in wetland areas is challenging and complicated to investigate the improved understanding of ecosystem level et and identification of its critical regulating parameters at interannual timescales is a vital research objective with ongoing climate change rocha and goulden 2008 the additional complications when scaling from short term hourly to long term annually intervals may affect the response of et to environmental associations chen et al 2008 prior studies have revealed that et has considerable variations over seasonal interannual and regional timescales restrepo and arain 2005 mao et al 2002 lafleur 2008 qiu et al 2017 jia et al 2018 over short timescales e g intra annually the variations in et along with environmental parameters have been reported reasonably well for many ecosystems worldwide peacock and hess 2004 sun et al 2008 helman et al 2017 zou et al 2021 however over longer timescales e g interannually the comprehensive assessment of the dynamics in et and its controlling mechanisms is currently inadequate xu et al 2014 yan et al 2020 iqbal et al 2021 the intra annual variations of the hydrological cycle are generally different from the interannual dynamics with changing climate however they could explain the seasonal and year to year differences in ecosystem et to a large extent respectively ma et al 2019 hayat et al 2022 previous studies documented that interannual dynamics in et are significant which could not be ignored barr et al 2007 liu et al 2019 therefore a better understanding of et variability and its controlling mechanisms over long term is basic to accurately predict future hydrological cycling in high altitude wetlands and address the consequences of management decisions usually the annual et p ratio is associated with vegetation types land uses and environmental conditions hence widely used to examine the influences of landscape changes and climate on the regional water cycle donohue et al 2007 li et al 2013 yan et al 2017 it is demonstrated that the transferring of grassland to forestland land use changes related to afforestation and reforestation would lead to more et p ratio which caused a decrease in runoff zhang et al 2015 the forest coverage of minjiang valley next to the jiuzhaigou has only increased from 18 85 to roughly 30 and the et p ratio was observed at 30 40 zhang et al 2008 in comparison the jiuzhaigou valley forest coverage increased to approximately 65 bossard et al 2015 which can be supposed to make the et p ratio higher however it remained uninvestigated due to a lack of comprehensive observing data in the current study we analyzed a nine year record 2013 2021 of continuous et data collected by the bowen ratio system over a typical subalpine river valley in jiuzhaigou the water of this valley is the source of the jialing river a major tributary of the yangtze river like tibetan plateau the jiuzhaigou valley has fragile ecosystems sensitive to climate change our particular objectives of this research were to 1 quantify the long term variability in et and hydrological response to climate warming over the wetland and 2 determine the major regulatory variables and the controlling mechanism of et at multiple timescales 2 materials and methods 2 1 site descriptions we conducted this study in jiuzhaigou valley at a horizontal flow wetland of nuorilang lakes 33 09 71 n 103 54 38 e fig 1 which is the research station of peking university shenzhen graduate school the study site elevation is 2365 m above mean sea level and is located in the upper reach of jialing river sichuan province southwest china the site has a prevailing highland temperate monsoon climate and is situated in a transition zone between the warm temperate region and the northern subtropical region of the tibetan plateau based on long term data i e 1951 2009 from nearby songpan meteorological station about 30 km from the observation site the mean annual air temperature is 7 3 with the lowest average monthly ta varying from 3 7 in january to the highest mean monthly ta of 16 8 in july hao et al 2009 precipitation is the primary source of the regional water budget and episodic rainfall events are expected the mean annual rainfall is 762 mm most of which falls during the growing season between the months of april and october qiao 2012 the islands are distributed on the sloping downstream sides by travertine dams with a longwinded border at nuorilang lakes florsheim et al 2013 generally the surface water flow fluctuates in response to rainfall amounts and patterns causing differences in water levels over seasonal scales above the soil the lowest water table i e 5 cm occurred in april whereas the largest water table about 15 cm occurred in august liu et al 2011 revealed that jiuzhaigou has a visible allocation of landscape characteristics attributed to distinct vegetation composition and types across the altitude the dominant plant species growing above the water surface at the site are salix linearistipularis with scattered abies fabri pinus tabuliformis sorbaria arborea carex obscura and betula utilis while the islands submerged portions are dominated by equisetum fluvitalie and equisetum arvense 2 2 meteorological measurements meteorological measurements correspondingly with et estimations were continuously attained from the bowen ratio tower about 3 m height established over the canopy in the experimental area of the wetland the variables included net radiation rn in w m 2 240 100 novalynx usa air temperature ta in cs215 l campbell usa relative humidity rh in cs215 l campbell usa wind speed ws in m s 1 200 ws 02 novalynx usa and precipitation p in mm 7852 m ab davis usa were measured at the heights of 2 m and 2 5 m above the ground the measuring accuracy for rn ta rh ws and p were 4 0 2 2 0 2 m s 1 and 0 2 mm respectively the soil heat flux g in w m 2 hfp01 hukseflux netherlands was measured at the soil depth of 0 02 m and 0 05 m with two soil heat flux plates at each depth on the travertine dams vapor pressure deficit vpd in kpa was calculated from recorded ta and rh tetens 1930 to describe the atmospheric water demand all these meteorological data were measured every 5 s and every 10 minutes averages were subsequently recorded on a cr1000 datalogger campbell scientific logan ut usa over the growing seasons of 2013 to 2021 following yan et al 2020 the growing season length was determined from 1 april to 31 october over the study period we defined april to may as spring june to august as summer and september to october as autumn the data from 1 april 25 july in 2013 and 14 july 31 october in 2021 were missing in this study 2 3 data processing and parameters calculations we used the bowen ratio energy balance breb method to calculate et in mm s 1 bowen 1926 which has been successfully appertained in many studies for surface energy fluxes along with various environmental conditions over wetland areas burba et al 1999 peacock and hess 2004 fischer et al 2013 zhang et al 2016b yan et al 2020 the wetland energy balance ratio was estimated based on the following equation 1 rn g le h s 0 where rn in w m 2 denotes the net radiation g in w m 2 the soil heat flux le in w m 2 the latent heat flux h in w m 2 the sensible heat flux and s in w m 2 the water energy storage the water surface partially covered the research site and the annual water level was approximately 10 cm above the soil moreover travertine dams hinder the adjacent water flow therefore the water energy storage could be neglected the bowen ratio β is defined as the ratio of h to le and it supposes similar water vapor and heat exchange coefficients i e kw kh β can be calculated according to bowen 1926 with the following equation 2 β h le ρ c p k h t z ε l p a ρ k w e z γ δ t δ e where ρ in kg m 3 represents the air density cρ in kj kg 1 1 the specific heat capacity at constant pressure ε the constant ratio i e 0 622 of molecular weight of water to dry air γ in kpa the psychrometric constant l in j kg 1 the specific latent heat of vaporization pa in kpa the air pressure and δt and δe are the temperature and humidity gradients recorded between two heights respectively in this study the et le and h were calculated using the breb approach 3 et r n g l 1 β 4 le r n g 1 β 5 h β r n g 1 β the bowen ratio measurements were screened and checked regularly for retrieval of quality data based on the vital principles namely the atmospheric stability power failure of instruments impact of meteorological conditions on sensors i e rain cyclone dew or ice out of reach fluxes and turbulence fluctuations van gorsel et al 2011 for instrument calibration the two temperature and rh sensors were placed at the same height for three days and then measurements were calibrated on a cr1000 datalogger for estimating wetland et there is no single approach because of the complexity and variability of wetlands additionally for independent and accurate measurement of wetland et there is no single guaranteed method because most of the methods required the high accuracy of rn and g to obtain improved measurements of wetland et drexler et al 2004 the breb method can give accurate estimates of wetland et based on accurate rn g and small values of the bowen ratio peacock and hess 2004 previous research documented that the small relative error in the bowen ratio can keep the small relative error in et angus and watts 1984 however near sunrise and sunset large errors in latent heat flux density can occur when the β closed to 1 prueger et al 1997 therefore the raw bowen ratios close to 1 and out of range fluxes of le and h e g 100 to 1000 w m 2 were excluded according to perez et al 1999 with the following equation 6 ε δ δ e γ δ δ t δ e where δ δ e represents the resolution of the dewpoint hygrometer 0 03 kpa γ δ δ t the resolution of thermocouples 0 05 and ε the error interval closed to 1 the previous research revealed that the accuracy of the breb method can be determined by comparing the calculated fluxes with other independent et measurement equipment perez et al 1999 therefore we compared the wetland et measured by breb with the potential evapotranspiration of an open water surface by the penman monteith equation in our previous research in the same region i e yan et al 2020 during the study period on average 8 of the error resulted in the bowen ratio the longer data gaps were filled via the mean diurnal variation approach whereas the small gaps for instance 2 h in duration were filled using linear interpolation falge et al 2001 krishnan et al 2012 gaps recorded in flux data ranged from 3 to 19 during the growing season of 2013 2021 gaps in meteorological data were also filled with daily records from the nearby songpan meteorological station after gap filling the data were summed or averaged to calculate daily monthly and annual values 2 4 statistical analysis the influences of meteorological drivers on et were analyzed via linear and nonlinear regressions at multiple timescales e g daily to interannually the data were accumulated to daily monthly and annual values to explore the temporal fluctuations fig 2 the coefficient of variation cv was applied to describe the variability of the selected parameters to evaluate the regression significance between et and meteorological regulating parameters the f statistics was used at a value of 0 05 critical probability αcrit 0 05 we applied the one way analysis of variance anova at a significance level of 0 05 to compare the seasonal and annual differences in et and explanatory variables the regression slopes were used to indicate wetland total et sensitivity to precipitation all statistical analyses were performed using excel 2016 microsoft corporation redmond wa usa matlab ver r2017a mathworks inc usa and spss ver 17 0 spss inc usa 3 results 3 1 multi temporal scale variations in meteorological parameters daily mean variations in meteorological factors are shown in fig 2a e during the growing seasons 1 april 31 october of 2013 2021 the range of daily mean rn ta vpd rh and ws was 5 19 263 59 w m 2 2 31 21 88 0 0018 0 95 kpa 44 08 98 99 and 0 1 31 m s 1 respectively over nine years the parameters including rn ta and vpd were highest in august with the interannual monthly mean values of 154 0 w m 2 16 59 and 0 40 kpa respectively fig 3 b d over the observation period rh had its monthly mean maximum values in september 86 61 and ws in april 0 60 m s 1 fig 3e f all parameters i e rn ta vpd rh and ws fluctuated differently from year to year yielding interannual growing season mean values of

generally the daily precipitation varied in the matter of quantity and timing increasing with the start of the rainy season i e april and the maximum falling during the mid growing season i e june september over 2013 2021 fig 2e uncommonly in 2017 one large p event was recorded on the day of the year doy 179 donating 80 8 mm of p which attributed to 8 33 rainfall of that year the region s highest interannual monthly mean rainfall occurred in june about 44 greater than the lowest amount during october fig 3g the growing season p totaled to 5515 1 mm over the study period excluding 2013 and 2021 varied from 483 4 to 969 3 mm with an interannual mean of 787 87 170 mm fig 4g the minimal amounts of p occurred in 2019 483 4 mm approximately 38 64 less than the seven years average rainfall 787 87 mm 3 2 multi temporal scale variations in evapotranspiration daily mean et exhibited an apparent day to day variation ranging between 0 06 and 6 77 mm d 1 with the mean value of 2 64 mm d 1 across a nine year study period fig 2f the range of daily mean et was 0 31 6 77 0 24 5 78 0 39 5 92 0 46 6 06 0 06 5 61 0 35 5 36 0 31 5 95 0 36 6 01 and 0 45 5 84 mm d 1 over the growing season of 2013 2021 respectively the daily rate of et gradually increased during spring reached its maximum in summer and then declined during autumn the interannual monthly mean et patterns corresponded closely with environmental parameters i e rn ta and vpd fig 3a the variations in et were highest in august with an interannual monthly mean value of 3 48 mm d 1 and lowest in october being 1 49 mm d 1 the growing season annual et significantly varied among consecutive nine year periods ranging from 290 85 to 589 90 mm y 1 with an interannual mean of 499 45 110 57 mm y 1 and cv of 22 13 fig 4a annual et was the largest and more variable during 2016 than during 2021 with a cv of 53 45 and 35 84 respectively additionally the et was not highest in the years with more rainfall e g 2017 3 3 environmental controls on evapotranspiration the growing season relationships between daily mean et and environmental parameters over the nine years are shown in fig 5 daily mean et had a significant positive linear interaction with rn ta and vpd fig 5a c with p values all 0 05 the correlation analysis indicated that the daily variation in rn ta and vpd individually explained 86 45 and 51 of the variation in et respectively however there was no significant relationship between et and ws at the daily resolution fig 5d over these parameters available energy i e rn had a dominant role in driving et with a goodness of fit of 86 moreover the multiple regression model showed that 89 of the variation in daily et was explained by the combined variations of rn ta and vpd table 2 the regulating parameters on a seasonal variation in et differed among months fig 6 a d overall the monthly et increased linearly with increasing rn ta and vpd while no apparent trends have occurred in et in response to the total monthly p on a growing season basis when investigating the driving mechanisms on monthly et the rn was responsible for most of the variation in et in june july and september october fig 6a average r2 0 64 in the meantime ta became more important during april may and august on average explaining 60 variation in et fig 6b in addition monthly et was shown to have a weak linear relationship with ta during the months of low temperature i e april and may r2 0 54 and 0 59 while the strongest association was in the months of high temperature i e august r2 0 67 monthly variations in vpd explained 61 and 76 of et variability during april and october respectively fig 6c furthermore et was observed to have no significant relationship with p in all months fig 6d seasonally the multiple regression analysis indicated that 76 of the variability in et was determined by the combined variations of ta and vpd in spring 68 by rn and ta in summer and 66 by rn and vpd during autumn table 2 over interannual timescales the growing season total annual et was significantly correlated with ta and p fig 7 a f table 2 p 0 05 the strongest relationship occurred between et and ta with a coefficient of determination of 73 across nine years however the impacts of other parameters i e rn vpd rh and ws on total annual et were infirm and insignificant p 0 05 the growing season annual mean ta and total p together explained 92 of the variation in et during the observation period table 2 3 4 water balance cumulative et was 4169 16 mm during the growing season of 2014 2021 which was smaller than the cumulative p of 5826 7 mm yielding an overall p use efficiency of 71 55 fig 8 the annual cumulative difference between p and et i e p et varied from 82 to 457 mm across the study period in addition the et ratio to p i e et p for 2014 2021 was 0 59 0 61 0 76 0 52 0 70 1 16 0 82 and 0 93 respectively over 2014 2018 the cumulative p was greater than the cumulative et and at no time did et exceed the cumulative p fig 8a e however cumulative et exceeded cumulative p on doy 242 304 in 2019 and doy 91 222 in 2020 yielding the annual cumulative p et of 43 62 mm and 61 04 mm respectively fig 8f g the cumulative et was about 15 larger than the cumulative p during 2019 furthermore the slopes of the relationships between the growing season annual et and p increased i e 0 61 0 60 0 85 0 58 0 68 1 03 0 73 and 0 86 from 2014 to 2021 respectively table 1 4 discussion 4 1 characteristics of evapotranspiration daily mean et significantly varied over the growing season with the mean value of 2 64 mm d 1 falling within the average value of 2 3 to 4 5 mm d 1 over different types of wetlands globally fig 2f lafleur 2008 however the mean et at our site i e 2 64 mm d 1 was generally higher than et estimated for subalpine forests i e 1 6 mm d 1 and 0 11 2 56 mm d 1 cheng et al 2003 gaofeng et al 2014 in the mountainous range of southwestern china seasonal variations in et with corresponding environmental parameters fluctuated in a way that is congruent with the previous observations during the growing season for the forest yang et al 2014 yan et al 2017 ma et al 2018 the monthly wetland et increased with climate warming and reached its highest values in summer fig 3 it is typically related to the transition from the dry to the wet season under monsoon rotation gu et al 2005 wang et al 2016 chu et al 2018 the variability at this conversion period led to a high seasonal fluctuation in environmental parameters and thus et zha et al 2010 the largest variability in et in august was parallel with the greatest variations in ta accompanied by higher rn and vpd over the same period which is consistent with prior studies that demonstrated et should increase with rising temperatures under ample water availability xie et al 2016a zhang et al 2016b yan et al 2020 previous research in the same region documented that daily et was not significantly reduced despite decreasing soil water across may august yan et al 2017 furthermore zhang et al 2016b measured the growing season et of three distinct ecosystems of the qinghai lake watershed based on the bowen ratio method in the northeast of the qinghai tibet plateau and found the annual average et of 373 83 15 75 mm y 1 which is lower than the et rate at jiuzhaigou i e 499 45 110 57 mm y 1 fig 4a the fluctuations in et rate can be attributed in response to the variations in environmental drivers xiao et al 2013 xu et al 2014 xie et al 2016b and differences in elevation over different wetlands ma et al 2016 therefore the higher rate of subalpine wetland et over the current study in comparison to the alpine wetland zhang et al 2016a cao et al 2019 could also be explained by the variations of different elevations of atmospheric demand zhang et al 2009 4 2 variables controlling evapotranspiration and their mechanisms at multiple timescales our results demonstrate that the variations in wetland et under the influencing environmental parameters are very complex and its driving forces can be observed through different timescales i e daily to interannually the differences in environmental parameters over short and long term scales can lead to different variability in the wetland et 4 2 1 the influencing factors of et at the daily scale over wetland ecosystems with cold climates and high altitudes the primary regulating parameters of daily et are rn and ta rouse 2000 liu et al 2009 runkle et al 2014 followed by vpd and ws zhao and liu 2018 and occasionally precipitation induced soil water availability under dry condition jacobs et al 2002 the current analysis showed that available energy i e rn ta and vpd are generally the main environmental parameters involved in controlling the daily et over the growing season in a subalpine wetland of jiuzhaigou fig 5a c table 2 however et was more tightly coupled with available energy than other explanatory parameters which predominantly explained 86 of the variations these findings are consistent with the previous study in the alpine ecosystem which revealed that available energy was the most important in regulating et zhang et al 2016b based on the current observations the elevated response of daily et to environmental parameters i e rn ta and vpd primarily linked with ample water availability over the wetland at short timescales i e daily the ecosystem was not stressed by water because surface flow existed over the non frozen period thus causing daily et to increase with environmental driving factors to meet the atmospheric water demand in addition rn causes to increase in ta and vpd as it is the primary energy source affecting the heat and water vapor movement to and from the plant leaf surfaces resulting in differences in et clausnitzer et al 2011 moreover the level of atmospheric water demand reflects by high vpd which alters the tree transpiration rate and canopy conductance chen et al 2012 zha et al 2013 the ws showed no meaningful relationship with et due to an irregular pattern fig 5d guo et al 2021 however higher ws can contribute to the variation of higher vpd table 2 montaldo and oren 2016 4 2 2 the influencing factors of et at the seasonal and interannual scale the long term variations in et significantly determined its seasonal and interannual response to environmental parameters differently over the growing season the interannual variation of monthly et was determined mainly by rn in june r2 0 71 and ta in august r2 0 67 which is further strengthened by multiple regression model fig 6a b table 2 it was based on different trends of rn and ta in spring and sufficient water availability provided by p from june to september the ta was gradually increased under excellent water conditions at the beginning of the growing season enabling rapid vegetation growth thus increasing et this result is comparable with other reports which showed that solar radiation and temperature regulated et when there was ample water supply gu et al 2005 guo and sun 2012 yan et al 2020 in autumn mainly in october the low seasonal vpd decreased the et consistent with the previous studies which revealed some positive influences from vpd fig 6c table 2 wu et al 2010 zhao and liu 2018 furthermore jiuzhaigou s subalpine wetland showed no significant et dependence on p at the monthly timescales fig 6d which is expected due to the sizable amount of p induced water availability zhang et al 2014 zhang et al 2016b at interannual timescales the impact of environmental parameters on et has rarely been examined for subalpine wetlands due to limited observing data the annual growing season et rate significantly varied across nine years matching primarily to the fluctuation in ta fig 4a c as a result the interannual variation in et was predominantly controlled by ta and up to a certain degree by p especially in the dry years fig 7a f this result was further strengthened by the combined effects of ta and p which explained 92 of the variation in interannual et table 2 the precipitation events are essential during the driest period to sustain the et rate zha et al 2013 our findings align with previous observations for the ecosystems experiencing dry periods liu et al 2010 and when or where the p was limited zhang et al 2016b the et was observed not the highest in the years with more rainfall e g 2017 while lowest in the years with low rainfall e g 2013 2021 fig 4a g which indicates that the et was controlled by energy in the wet years and by moisture in the dry years in addition unlike rn vpd and ws affecting et over the short term rain fed soil water can explain a large portion of fluctuations in et at longer timescales ewers et al 2001 chen et al 2014 hayat et al 2022 which reinforces the current results the heightened sensitivity in et to ta usually coincided with sufficient rainfall amounts recharging soil water causing et to increase to meet the atmospheric water demand generally the wetland s susceptibility to the warming climate is determined by the level of increasing temperature which would lead to a change in the wetland water balance winter 2000 our findings are consistent with previous observations where ta is a key limiting parameter on hydrological and ecological processes over northern wetlands including arctic and boreal responses to climate warming petrone et al 2000 moore et al 2013 runkle et al 2014 the prior study documented that warming induced water losses may also fluctuate the thermal gradients and surface moisture by changing surface energy and water balance leading to stronger effects in the wetland regions zhang et al 2012 the rising tendency in the vertical air surface thermal gradients was also found in the adjacent wetland areas wang et al 2011 zhang et al 2016a and over a central european wetland kovářová and pokorný 2010 therefore this study suggests that the subalpine wetlands may be exposed to potential degradation with increasing air temperature under ongoing climate warming without an accompanying increase in corresponding precipitation the findings of this research have broader applicability to the high altitude wetlands and other parts of the subalpine ecoregion in response to changing hydrometeorological conditions 4 3 water balance over jiuzhaigou wetland the wetland et feedback to p is a valuable metric for investigating the hydrological patterns of changing climate because it can directly influence the proportion of seasonal variations in the water budget leading to determining the wetland s existence malone et al 2014 yan et al 2020 prior studies revealed that annual wetland et fluctuated widely between 325 and 1552 mm considering up to 55 92 of p as a vital cause of water losses zhou and zhou 2009 headley et al 2012 xiao et al 2013 malone et al 2014 cao et al 2019 zang et al 2019 in our study the accumulative wetland et over 2014 2021 i e 4169 16 mm accounted for 71 55 of the overall p use efficiency fig 8 however the et p varied from 0 52 to 1 16 indicating the high ratio of et to p and high interannual variability across the observation period it should be noted that the growing season annual accumulative et in 2019 and 2020 was more than the corresponding p input resulting in p et of 43 62 mm and 61 04 mm respectively in addition annual et was about 15 greater than local rainfall amounts during 2019 the comparison among years highlights that the projected warming climate will probably upsurge the annual et with an insignificant increase in annual rainfall yan et al 2017 which agrees with the previous study sottocornola and kiely 2010 the ratio of et to p is comparable to other studies in the qinghai tibet plateau which documented that the et ratio was less or nearly equal to local rainfall amounts liu et al 2009 jie et al 2013 furthermore zhang et al 2016b documented the larger ratio of et to p i e 26 for achnatherum splendens steppe site which is in line with our findings the high et p ratio emphasizes the robust wetland feedback to climate warming gutowski et al 2007 the increasing trend in wetland et with climate change tends to result in a reduction in water availability for discharge downstream this result is further reinforced by the slopes of et to p ranging from 0 58 to 1 03 showing larger positive et trends over 2014 2021 table 1 in addition the extra amount of et water losses may promote by a more extended non frozen period with the corresponding warming climate especially in the wetland regions due to lower evaporative resistance zhang et al 2011 the wetlands et has lower values than open water under similar climates and ample water availability lafleur 2008 because plants can decrease the et in the wetlands by physiological constraints to transpiration brümmer et al 2012 moreover wetlands can humidify and better cool the surrounding environment in summer krinner 2003 which appears particularly interesting in response to increasing temperatures due to global warming 5 conclusion we demonstrated the patterns and importance of multi year et with the complex influences of environmental factors in the subalpine wetland which is characterized by fragile ecosystems and robust climate change results show that et responses to site environmental parameters fluctuated differently from daily to interannual timescales variations in daily et were mainly controlled by rn on a seasonal level variations in et were most considerable during summer predominantly in august variations in rn ta and vpd determined et based on monthly resolution whereas p was not important interannually the variability in ta and p led to variation in et the heightened sensitivity of et to climate warming and p exceptionally high et p ratio over the long term underscores that most p was used by et suggesting decreases in runoff and streams drying up in jiuzhaigou valley given the tendency for rising temperatures with future climate change in high altitude wetlands this study can potentially assist in sustainable water management and environmental
